0,Climate adaptive thermal characteristics of envelope of residential passive house in China,WOS:000844543700018,passive house constructed china large scale past couple year great energy saving potential however indicates significant discrepancy energy performance heating cooling passive house different zone therefore develops comparative analysis energy saving potential passive house conventional around china a sensitivity analysis thermal characteristic building envelope insulation exterior wall window airtightness energy consumption carried improve adaptability passive house moreover variation energy consumption different heat gain intensity also compared evaluate effect envelope thermal characteristic comprehensively result suggest decrease exterior wall insulation lead greatest increase energy consumption especially severe cold zone china however optimal insulation may internal heat gain intensity instance decrease insulation 0 4 1 0 w 2 center dot k could reduce energy consumption 4 65 kw center dot h 2 center dot heat gain increase 20 w 2 building hot summer cold winter zone china
1,"An early-stage analysis of climate-adaptive designs for multi-family buildings under future climate scenario: Case studies in Rome, Italy and Stockholm, Sweden",WOS:000502361000006,present preliminary case adaptive design urban multi family building early stage allow thermal comfort minimum energy use today last part 21st century generated future data combined comfort model assessment proposed new way including future scenario preliminary building design two representative site rome italy stockholm sweden existing vulnerability expected condition psychometric analysis indicates 1 trend rome would gradually lead failure majority conventional adaptive design measure cooling dehumidification demand would rise 5 3 23 6 heating humidification demand would decrease 27 16 2 trend stockholm would result increased comfort period exploiting adaptive design measure since heating humidification demand would reduced 67 53 however cooling dehumidification demand would increase slightly 0 1 5 accordingly four main key risk identified 1 overheating would become rising increasing public health threat building rome rely exclusively natural ventilation 2 open question remain design team area correct cooling load selection additional space future installation effectiveness current cooling device etc 3 occasional heat wave gradual rising humidity level expected vulnerable topic conventional lightweight building stockholm 4 building heavy heating load would tend greater cooling demand especially poor ventilation resource greater internal gain in conclusion suggested envelope optimization whichever type one efficient effective measure towards future condition
2,THE INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON ELECTRICITY DEMAND. CASE STUDY IN THE BASQUE COUNTRY,WOS:000518391500018,analyzes sensitivity electricity demand sector temperature context outline methodology incorporate variable energy decision making methodology based evolution thermal distance cold warm day respect established threshold heating degree day cooling degree day influence demand approach tested basque country result show residential sector sensitive change future demand projected according multiple scenario due greater statistical significance temperature difference cold day current limited use air conditioning estimated residential demand could fall much 4 could translate nearly 20 million euro annual saving emission reduction around 30 000 co2 per year
