1,Are farmers' adaptations enhancing food production? Evidence from China,WOS:000445234600024,a primary goal studying identify option used improve crop productivity reduce negative impact many adjustment farm management farmer adopt necessarily represent true adaptation issue often ignored existing literature resulting risk policy maker misled think easier actually thereby underestimate challenge present overall goal identify whether farmer adoption enhancing food production adapting identification us plot level panel survey 619 rural household three province china county level weather data with use plot county year fixed effect well instrumental variable approach estimate show autonomous adoption effective improving crop yield implies farmer adoption cannot always considered adaptation provides possible explanation result concludes policy implication
