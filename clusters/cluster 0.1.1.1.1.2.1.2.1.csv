0,Decline in the alpine landscape aesthetic value in a national park under climate change,WOS:000758317600001,alpine landscape projected degraded would threaten benefit society previous study however limited aesthetic remains unclear much aesthetic would affect human welfare to address issue gain insight policy conducted choice experiment survey using digitally manipulated image based scenario natural scientific knowledge mountainous national park japan uncovered park visitor appreciate alpine landscape include snow patch mountain type alpine flower analyzing data 445 respondent conversely invasion alpine vegetation dwarf bamboo disappearance snow patch due substantially deteriorated perceived aesthetic benefit alpine landscape economic loss caused induced landscape degradation estimated 100 usd per visitor maximum disappearance snow patch invasion dwarf bamboo reduced benefit approximately 13 usd 101 usd respectively our finding suggest sustaining aesthetic value alpine landscape national park via potentially significant economic benefit by supposing mountain national park attracts 70 000 visitor summer would cause minimum eight million usd economic loss park without appropriate measure annually our finding highlight importance measure considering impact social benefit associated alpine landscape
1,A model-based assessment of adaptation options for Chianti wine production in Tuscany (Italy) under climate change,WOS:000368114700008,cover comprehensive economic analysis option specific wine producing region namely tuscany a temperature increase rainfall pattern different chianti wine production tuscany therefore need adapt near future address challenge identify grape yield quality loss main impact wine production relocation vineyard uphill introducing drought resistant variety considered measure appraise measure using optimization framework regional wine producer maximize income subject economic constraint including impact wine productivity quality our simulation show quantitatively extent higher degree impact demand higher degree find combination two measure provides better strategy lead higher economic efficiency however uncertainty regarding efficiency new variety discourages use new drought resistant variety whereas higher efficiency would make choice favourable sensitivity analysis time horizon discount rate confirms theory investment uncertainty showing shorter time horizon frequent investment provides possibility postpone decision implement measure due value flexibility higher discount rate lead later decision uncertainty creates value waiting new information
2,Time is of the essence: adaptation of tourism demand to climate change in Europe,WOS:000361799100014,analysis potential impact tourism demand european union eu provides long term 2100 projection accounting term holiday duration frequency our analysis based hedonic valuation climatic condition combining accommodation travel cost estimation our result suggest climatic likely affect relative attractiveness eu region tourism activity in certain region notably southern eu mediterranean region condition 2100 could current economic condition lower tourism revenue 0 45 gdp per year on contrary area eu notably northern european region would gain altered climatic condition although gain would relatively modest reaching 0 32 gdp annual basis our result also suggest holiday duration would beneficial holiday frequency view mitigating cost these two time dimension likely conditioned broader societal institutional factor however
3,Current viticultural techniques to mitigate the effects of global warming on grape and wine quality: A comprehensive review,WOS:000614712500005,main factor affecting grape wine quality mediterranean viticulture global warming provokes increase accumulation soluble solid grape together lower content anthocyanins acidity result stuck sluggish fermentation causing economic loss winery strategy essential minimize detrimental effect global warming grape wine quality summarized effect viticultural technique delay grapevine ripening emphasis canopy management overviewed effect high temperature grape wine quality some viticultural technique severe shoot trimming minimal pruning late winter pruning apical leaf removal may delay grapevine ripening close 15 day forcing regrowth interesting technique since allows delay grape ripening least two month essential warm grapevine production area
