1,Two Backward-Looking Principles of Climate Justice,WOS:000502554900012,examines two backward looking principle cost mitigating adapting distributed according polluter pay principle cost borne caused according beneficiary pay principle borne benefited activity causing regardless whether took part activity unpacks principle considers main problem contends properly combined address problem
2,Multi-level climate adaptation policy and causation narratives,WOS:000313497900009,policy meant reduce negative consequence impact associated anthropogenic turn success often depends causal relationship within natural human system in i examine use narrative causal relationship explore narrative little basis observation persist guiding policy i examine three case study one concerning narrative impact second concerning relationship household wealth vulnerability third concerning procedure need policy maker in case i find narrative needed legitimize continue resource flow within existing policy process continued despite growing empirical model driven evidence suggest narrative may correct i compare story theory sociological evolutionary theory suggest importance correcting improving policy process avoid pathology
3,Rethinking the interplay between affluence and vulnerability to aid climate change adaptive capacity,WOS:000565535000002,affluence vulnerability often seen opposite side coin affluence generally understood reducing form vulnerability increased resilience adaptive capacity however context increase associated hazard disaster suggest need examine dynamic relationship complex association define affluence vulnerability interface avi different national context show nuanced understanding avi problematize notion increasing material affluence necessarily mitigating influence social vulnerability b extend analysis social vulnerability beyond low income region include affluent context
4,How harmful are restrictions on adapting to climate change?,WOS:000293811200006,dominant assumption economic model policy remains implemented optimal manner there however several reason optimal level may attainable investigates effect suboptimal level caused different type restriction composition level cost welfare find especially restriction effectiveness extreme level harmful furthermore show potential mitigation offset suboptimal varies essential case becomes ineffective higher temperature increase largely ineffective case short term inaction however case short term recommendation increase mitigation level slightly normally recommended keep mitigation policy flexible enough able respond restriction become prominent it clear reducing restriction combination adjusting optimal level mitigation may keep cost restriction limited thus generally harmful ignore existing restriction devising efficient policy
5,Classical decision rules and adaptation to climate change,WOS:000260731900008,one approach rationalising policy addressing potentially catastrophic policy may prove unnecessary suppose policy provide form social insurance even presence pure uncertainty then provided policy effective insurance justified precautionary minimax response even policy potentially ineffective however intervention justified attempt minimise regret experienced future generation reasoning extends justify weather policy provided policy always reduce policy cost if however policy decision provide weather benefit certain state world rationale break minimising regret establish case mixed policy response provided adopting policy mix precludes chance intervention fail altogether precautionary policy policy minimise regret computed simple dynamic adaptive planning problem sufficient condition policy maker pessimism provided
6,Focusing on differences across scenarios could lead to bad adaptation policy advice,WOS:000640484300001,a development closely intertwined assessing benefit focusing reduces impact could lead misleading policy advice in case trying minimize impact could lead inferior outcome it preferable explore policy influence absolute level metric interest scenario rather focus influence incremental impact evaluation policy typically compare difference scenario different level without many policy however address development simultaneously focusing impact may identify best outcome
7,A critical examination of the climate engineering moral hazard and risk compensation concern,WOS:000434537000009,widespread concern potential implementation engineering would reduce mitigation critically examined first empirical evidence moral hazard risk compensation general inconclusive empirical evidence date case engineering indicates reverse may occur second basic economics substitute show reducing mitigation response engineering implementation could provide net benefit human environment engineering might theoretically increase mitigation strong income effect third existing policy strive promote technology measure including induce analogous risk compensating behaviour if goal policy minimize risk concern ground restricting prohibiting engineering three potential mean concern manifest genuinely deleterious way well policy option reduce effect identified
