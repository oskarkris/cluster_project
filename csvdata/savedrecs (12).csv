In spite of these numerous flood management interventions, the number of flood victims in Senegal's urban centres has increased steadily since 1999. This article contributes empirically and conceptually to recent studies highlighting poor national disaster risk management frameworks in West Africa, by investigating how floods have been managed in Senegal and why this management has not led to the results expected by the population. The article finds that the configuration of flood management policies and programmes in urban Senegal points towards three key intertwined issues which have influenced the limited achievements of flood management in urban areas. These include, but are not restricted to, the political and personal appropriation of flood management-related processes, the reinforcement of the dichotomy between central government and municipalities, and a fragmented institutional framework with overlapping institutions.","[Schaer, Caroline; Nygaard, Ivan] UNEP DTU Partnership, Dept Engn Management, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Thiam, Mame Demba] Univ Cheikh Anta Diop, Fac Lettres & Sci Humaines, Dept Geog, Dakar, Senegal; [Thiam, Mame Demba] Univ Cheikh Anta Diop, IFAN, CAD, Dakar, Senegal",Technical University of Denmark; University Cheikh Anta Diop Dakar; University Cheikh Anta Diop Dakar,"Schaer, C (corresponding author), UNEP DTU Partnership, Dept Engn Management, Copenhagen, Denmark.",cesc@dtu.dk,"THIAM, Mame Demba/AAU-3343-2020; Nygaard, Ivan/Q-4058-2017","THIAM, Mame Demba/0000-0001-5455-2212; Nygaard, Ivan/0000-0002-7633-9241; Schaer, Caroline/0000-0002-5270-1293",,,,,63,9,9,3,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Therefore, pioneering research has dedicated efforts to optimize the design of NBS, to evaluate their wider co-benefits and to understand promoting and/or hampering governance conditions for the uptake of NBS. In this article, we aim to complement this research by conducting a comprehensive literature review of factors shaping people's perceptions of NBS as a means to reduce hydro-meteorological risks. Based on 102 studies, we identified six topics shaping the current discussion in this field of research: (1) valuation of the co-benefits (including those related to ecosystems and society); (2) evaluation of risk reduction efficacy; (3) stakeholder participation; (4) socio-economic and location-specific conditions; (5) environmental attitude, and (6) uncertainty. Our analysis reveals that concerned empirical insights are diverse and even contradictory, they vary in the depth of the insights generated and are often not comparable for a lack of a sound theoretical-methodological grounding. We, therefore, propose a conceptual model outlining avenues for future research by indicating potential inter-linkages between constructs underlying perceptions of NBS to hydro-meteorological risks.","[Han, Sungju; Kuhlicke, Christian] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Urban & Environm Sociol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Han, Sungju; Kuhlicke, Christian] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, D-14468 Potsdam, Germany; [Kuhlicke, Christian] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); University of Potsdam,"Han, SJ (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Urban & Environm Sociol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.;Han, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, D-14468 Potsdam, Germany.",sungju.han@ufz.de; Christian.Kuhlicke@ufz.de,"Han, Sungju/ABI-1640-2020","Han, Sungju/0000-0001-9386-8922",European Union [776866],European Union(European Commission),C.K. received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 776866.,,113,14,14,9,41,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,DEC,2019,11,12,,,,,,,2599,10.3390/w11122599,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11122599,,,23,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,KC7VN,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000507380900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

They are associated with a policy trend that values the knowledge and capacities of local people and builds on local resources, including social capital. CBDP may be instrumental not only in formulating local coping and adaptation strategies, but also in situating them within wider development planning and debates. In theory, local people can be mobilised to resist unsustainable (vulnerability increasing) forms of development or livelihood practices and to raise local concerns more effectively with political representatives. This paper focuses on the potential of CBDP initiatives to alleviate vulnerability in the context of climate change, and their limitations. It presents evidence from the Philippines that, in the limited forms in which they are currently employed, CBDP initiatives have the potential both to empower and disempower, and warns against treating CBDP as a panacea to disaster management problems.","Social Res Associates, Leicester LE1 6TP, Leics, England",,"Allen, KM (corresponding author), Social Res Associates, 12 Princess Rd W, Leicester LE1 6TP, Leics, England.",kmallen@uk2.net,"Ahluwalia, Tarun/A-2762-2012",,,,,,62,293,297,5,106,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0361-3666,,,DISASTERS,Disasters,MAR,2006,30,1,,,,,81,101,,10.1111/j.1467-9523.2006.00308.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9523.2006.00308.x,,,21,"Environmental Studies; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Social Sciences - Other Topics,017LA,16512863,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000235693900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels' changes alter agricultural crop productivity, plant water requirements and irrigation water availability. The global food system needs to respond and adapt to these changes, for example, by altering agricultural practices, including the crop types or intensity of management, or shifting cultivated areas within and between countries. As impacts and associated adaptation responses are spatially specific, understanding the land use adaptation to environmental changes requires crop productivity representations that capture spatial variations. The impact of variation in management practices, including fertiliser and irrigation rates, also needs to be considered. To date, models of global land use have selected agricultural expansion or intensification levels using relatively aggregate spatial representations, typically at a regional level, that are not able to characterise the details of these spatially differentiated responses. Here, we show results from a novel global modelling approach using more detailed biophysically derived yield responses to inputs with greater spatial specificity than previously possible. The approach couples a dynamic global vegetative model (LPJ-GUESS) with a new land use and food system model (PLUMv2), with results benchmarked against historical land use change from 1970. Land use outcomes to 2100 were explored, suggesting that increased intensity of climate forcing reduces the inputs required for food production, due to the fertilisation and enhanced water use efficiency effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but requiring substantial shifts in the global and local patterns of production. The results suggest that adaptation in the global agriculture and food system has substantial capacity to diminish the negative impacts and gain greater benefits from positive outcomes of climate change. Consequently, agricultural expansion and intensification may be lower than found in previous studies where spatial details and processes consideration were more constrained.","[Alexander, Peter; Henry, Roslyn; Rounsevell, Mark D.

While new wine regions may emerge out of the traditional boundaries, most of the present-day renowned winemaking regions may be threatened by climate change. Here, we analyse the future evolution of the geography of wine production over Europe, through the definition of a novel climatic suitability indicator, which is calculated over the projected grapevine phenological phases to account for their possible contractions under global warming. Our approach consists in coupling six different de-biased downscaled climate projections under two different scenarios of global warming with four phenological models for different grapevine varieties. The resulting suitability indicator is based on fuzzy logic and is calculated over three main components measuring (i) the timing of the fruit physiological maturity, (ii) the risk of water stress and (iii) the risk of pests and diseases. The results demonstrate that the level of global warming largely determines the distribution of future wine regions. For a global temperature increase limited to 2 degrees C above the pre-industrial level, the suitable areas over the traditional regions are reduced by about 4%/degrees C rise, while for higher levels of global warming, the rate of this loss increases up to 17%/degrees C. This is compensated by a gradual emergence of new wine regions out of the traditional boundaries. Moreover, we show that reallocating better-suited grapevine varieties to warmer conditions may be a viable adaptation measure to cope with the projected suitability loss over the traditional regions. However, the effectiveness of this strategy appears to decrease as the level of global warming increases. Overall, these findings suggest the existence of a safe limit below 2 degrees C of global warming for the European winemaking sector, while adaptation might become far more challenging beyond this threshold.","[Sgubin, Giovanni; Swingedouw, Didier] Univ Bordeaux, Environm & Paleoenvironm Ocean & Continentaux EPO, Pessac, France; [Mignot, Juliette] Sorbonne Univ SU CNRS IRD MNHN, LOCEAN Lab, Inst Pierre Simon, Paris, France; [Gambetta, Gregory Alan; Pieri, Philippe; Ollat, Nathalie; van Leeuwen, Cornelis] Univ Bordeaux, ISVV, INRAE, Bordeaux Sci Agro,EGFV, Villenave Dornon, France; [Bois, Benjamin] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Ctr Rech Climatol, UMR 6282 CNRS UB Biogeosci, Dijon, France; [Loukos, Harilaos; Noel, Thomas] Climate Data Factory TCDF, Paris, France; [de Cortazar-Atauri, Inaki Garcia] INRAE, US AgroClim, Avignon, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Universite de Bourgogne; INRAE,"Sgubin, G (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, Environm & Paleoenvironm Ocean & Continentaux EPO, Pessac, France.",giovanni.sgubin@u-bordeaux.fr,"Garcia de Cortazar-Atauri, Inaki/A-7535-2012; Mignot, Juliette/F-3138-2011; Swingedouw, Didier/D-1408-2010","Garcia de Cortazar-Atauri, Inaki/0000-0001-6941-9844; Gambetta, Gregory/0000-0002-8838-5050; Mignot, Juliette/0000-0002-4894-898X; Swingedouw, Didier/0000-0002-0583-0850; Noel, Thomas/0000-0003-2953-5060","Blue-Action (European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program) [1668, 727852]; EUCP (European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme) [776613]; French government",Blue-Action (European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program); EUCP (European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme); French government,"This work received support from the Blue-Action (European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, Grant 1668 No. 727852) and EUCP (European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No. 776613) projects, as well as from the French government in the framework of the University of Bordeaux's IdEx Investments for the Future -program/RRI Tackling Global Change.

A stakeholder-driven, science-based multimodel approach has been developed and used by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) to generate actionable information for adaptation planning processes. For a range of mid-century climate projections-likely to be hotter, drier, and more variable-contrasting future socio-economic scenarios (Representative Agricultural Pathways, RAPs) were co-developed with stakeholders to portray a sustainable development scenario and a rapid economic growth pathway. The unique characteristic of this application is the integration of a multi- modeling approach with stakeholder engagement to co-develop scenarios and adaptation strategies. Distribution of outcomes were simulated with climate, crop, livestock, and economic impact assessment models for smallholder crop livestock farmers in a typical dryland agro-ecological zone in Zimbabwe, characterized by low and erratic rainfall and nutrient depleted soils. Results showed that in Nkayi District, Western Zimbabwe, climate change would threaten most of the farms, and, in particular, those with large cattle herds due to feed shortages. Adaptation strategies that showed the most promise included diversification using legume production, soil fertility improvement, and investment in conducive market environments. The switch to more legumes in the farming systems reduced the vulnerability of the very poor as well as the more resourced farmers. Overall, the sustainable development scenario consistently addressed institutional failures and motivated productivity-enhancing, environmentally sound technologies and inclusive development approaches.

The case study taken is Xuan Thuy National Park in Nam Dinh Province, Vietnam. This is a marginalised coastal area where rising sea levels, increasing storm surges and saltwater intrusion place pressure on coastal ecosystems, yet where communities continue to rely on these same ecosystems for agriculture- and aquaculture-related livelihoods. We interview stakeholders in Xuan Thuy National Park, connecting these with a narrative review of existing research into social and environmental change in the park to understand research gaps and challenges for vulnerable coastal areas like the Nam Dinh coast. Based on our findings, we suggest that whilst the effects of a changing environment on physical health and economic activity are increasingly well understood, effects on wellbeing and social relations can be even more immediate and profound in daily living. In turn, we argue environmental management has a crucial role to play not only for ecosystem-based adaptation, but also in sustaining wellbeing and allowing culturally meaningful practices to continue especially in coastal regions where changes can be even more intense and immediate. However, we caution that whilst techno-scientific solutions grounded in environmental management do have significant potential in reducing impacts of extreme events and slower-onset environmental changes, they must not divert attention away from structural issues that can make some people or areas more vulnerable in the first instance.","[Mabon, Leslie; Mueller-Hirth, Natascha; Yuill, Chris] Robert Gordon Univ, Sch Appl Social Studies, Aberdeen AB10 7QG, Scotland; [Nguyen Song Tung; Nguyen Thi Kim Dung; Pham Thi Tram; Cao Thi Thanh Nga; Le Thu Quynh; Dang Thanh Trung; Nguyen Thi Huyen Thu; Nguyen Thi Bich Nguyet; Le Hong Ngoc; Tran Thi Tuyet; Bui Thi Cam Tu; Tran Ngoc Anh] Vietnam Acad Social Sci, Inst Human Geog, 1 Lieu Giai, Hanoi, Vietnam",Robert Gordon University,"Mabon, L (corresponding author), Robert Gordon Univ, Sch Appl Social Studies, Aberdeen AB10 7QG, Scotland.",l.j.mabon@rgu.ac.uk,,"Mabon, Leslie/0000-0003-2646-6119; Mueller-Hirth, Natascha/0000-0003-0578-4484; Le, Ngoc/0000-0002-6021-3775",British Academy International Partnership and Mobility [IPM160249]; Scottish Funding Council Global Challenges Research Fund Official Development Assistance funds,British Academy International Partnership and Mobility; Scottish Funding Council Global Challenges Research Fund Official Development Assistance funds,The research on which this paper was based was possible through a British Academy International Partnership and Mobility grant (number IPM160249) held by Dr Leslie Mabon and Dr Nguyen Song Tung; and Scottish Funding Council Global Challenges Research Fund Official Development Assistance funds allocated to Robert Gordon University and subsequently assigned by the university to Dr Leslie Mabon.

While scientists must account for potential future dynamics in flood risk resulting from climate change or settlement growth, decision-makers are urged to consider a host of flood management options and thus face a significantly enlarged decision scope. In light of the complexities that arise from the shift in flood policy, there is a growing need to better integrate science and decision-making and develop an interface to combine different knowledge domains. This paper discusses scientist-stakeholder workshops (SSW) as a collaborative approach within a flood-related Integrated Assessment (IA) to connect the assessment of (flood) risks more closely to the process of policy implementation. We present findings from two SSW conducted as part of the project RiskAdapt in two Austrian flood-prone municipalities with the aim of (i) reflecting the determinants of vulnerability, (ii) identifying local context conditions, (iii) developing adaptive measures for extreme scenarios and thereby (iv) facilitating anticipatory adaptation to flood risk dynatnics. We illustrate the potential and constraints of SSW as a participatory method in flood risk management and discuss the possibilities of institutionalizing SSW in the context of the EU Floods Directive implementation in Austria.

Backcrosses ((north x south) x south) were intermediate or close to the southern parent both in bud set and in frost hardiness between the populations representing the parental origins. In bud set, 36.4% of the total variation was between the populations. The bud set date and development of frost hardiness were highly correlated at the population level (r = 0.69-0.97). Frost hardening started during the bud formation period and accelerated A hen most of the buds had formed.

Co-management systems have also been criticized for not fully integrating harvesters into the local management of resources. These two problems can be approached through the use of spatially-defined human social units termed community clusters, which are based on the demographic or ecological units being managed. An examination of polar bear management in Nunavut Territory, Canada, shows that community clusters provide a forum to collect and analyse traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) over a geographic area that mirrors the management unit, providing detailed information of local conditions. This case study also provides examples of how instituting community clusters at a governance level provides harvesters with social space in which to develop their roles as managers, along the continuum from being powerless spectators to active, adaptive co-managers. Five steps for enhancing co-management systems through the inclusion of community clusters and their knowledge are: (1) the acceptance of TEK, science, the precautionary principle and the right of harvesters not to be constrained by overly-conservative management decisions; (2) data collection involving TEK and science, and a collaboration between the two; (3) institutionalization of community clusters for data collection; (4) institutionalization of community clusters in the management process; and (5) grass-roots initiatives to take advantage of the social space provided by the community cluster approach, in order to adapt the management to local conditions, and to effect policy changes at higher levels, so as to better meet local objectives.","Lakehead Univ, Dept Geog, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada",Lakehead University,"Dowsley, M (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Geog, 955 Oliver Rd, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",marthadowsley@hotmail.com,,,,,,,111,42,44,1,91,NORWEGIAN POLAR INST,TROMSO,"POLAR ENVIRONMENTAL CENTRE, HJALMAR JOHANSENSGATE 14, TROMSO, FRAMSENTERET, NORWAY",0800-0395,1751-8369,,POLAR RES,Polar Res.,APR,2009,28,1,,,,,43,59,,10.1111/j.1751-8369.2008.00093.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-8369.2008.00093.x,,,17,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Oceanography",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Oceanography,419TH,,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000264242100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The increase in temperatures has affected sea levels, polar masses and extreme events, among others. There are many scientific studies that analyze the impacts of climate change on coastal communities, but most of them focus on beach erosion and coastal recession. Scientific literature on the effects of climate change on ports and harbors and their adaptation is much less abundant. Ports are essential for the economy and society of their cities, so studying the impact of climate change on them is an urgent need. The Mediterranean and the Spanish Mediterranean coast is one of the areas that will be most affected by climate change in the future. In addition, the Spanish economy depends a lot on its tourism and, thus, on its coastal cities. Therefore, the study of the impact of climate change on Spanish ports and coastal communities is essential. This article presents a review of the studies carried out until now on the effects of climate change on Spanish ports, and it identifies research gaps and weaknesses and suggests new research lines.","[Portillo Juan, Nerea; Negro Valdecantos, Vicente; del Campo, Jose Maria] Univ Politecn Madrid, Environm Coast & Ocean Res Lab, Campus Ciudad Univ Calle Profesor Aranguren 3, Madrid 28040, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Juan, NP (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Environm Coast & Ocean Res Lab, Campus Ciudad Univ Calle Profesor Aranguren 3, Madrid 28040, Spain.",nf.portillo@upm.es; vicente.negro@upm.es; josemaria.delcampo@upm.es,"Portillo Juan, Nerea Fatima/HKF-2744-2023","Portillo Juan, Nerea Fatima/0000-0003-4060-1575; CAMPO YAGUE, JOSE MARIA DEL/0000-0002-8284-4527",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Author Nerea Portillo Juan has received research support from Universidad Politecnica de Madrid.

Moreover, it synthesises the current knowledge of the impact of elevated ambient CO2 levels (eCO(2)) and temperatures on physiological processes, and the application of this knowledge in mechanistic crop models. While eCO(2) evidently has a strong impact on photosynthesis and crop water use, it is uncertain how this will work out for the climatic and crop management conditions prevailing in southern Africa. The impact of heat stress on crop reproductive processes and the process of transpiration cooling mitigating heat stress are poorly represented in models, while both process are relevant given the climatic conditions prevailing in southern Africa. Twenty studies assessing the impact of climate change on future yields of crops, mostly maize, have been retrieved. The results suggest that potato, Bambara groundnut and sugarcane yields may improve. No consistent trends for maize and sorghum could be identified. While yield predictions are obviously context-specific, large uncertainties related to climate predictions and crop models imply results should be treated with caution. Suggestions are made for field experimentation and the improved application of crop models for climate change research in the region.","[Franke, A.

This is because existing investments in property and capital will require new forms of protection if they are to continue generating stable streams of public revenue. Since Anthropocene impacts are unevenly distributed, some territories will be under more pressure than others to shift limited public spending to cope with growing levels of exposure. The sinking of Louisiana's coastal wetlands provides a clear example of this trend of accelerating local vulnerability due to human-induced environmental change. With the bulk of state revenue tied to activities concentrated along Louisiana's coasts, the state's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority has launched an ambitious plan of government-backed expenditures that seek to defend the economic viability of these zones. Yet, many actions aimed at preventing immediate loss also work to secure incumbent extractive industries, such as offshore oil and gas drilling, which themselves contribute to the very vulnerabilities requiring state intervention in the first place. This paper, borrowing from the environmental sociology of Allan Schnaiberg, considers the social consequences of this dynamic, dubbed the treadmill of protection.","[Gray, Ian] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Sociol, 264 Haines Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Gray, Ian] Max Planck Inst Hist Sci, Berlin, Germany",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Max Planck Society,"Gray, I (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Sociol, 264 Haines Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",igray@ucla.edu,,"Gray, Ian/0000-0002-6826-6521",,,,,140,3,3,1,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2053-0196,2053-020X,,ANTHROPOCENE REV,Anthr.

This present study fills this gap. Fuzzy inference system based reservoir operating rules (FIS-ORs) are developed by optimization-simulation and compared with linear, nonlinear, and artificial neural network rules under simulated stationary and nonstationary inflow conditions. Results are obtained for two case studies assuming, in each case, a single reservoir with water supply, flood control, and environmental flow allocation functions. The FIS-ORs are found to be most robust to inflow nonstationarity. Applying the FIS-ORs to 30years of projected future inflows show their advantage to be enhanced when they are recalibrated every 10years or so, as compared to when there is no recalibration. It is also observed the advantage of the FIS-ORs to be more significant when the weighting of the problem objectives is such that the overall objective function is more difficult to satisfy.

Although qualitative scenarios, in which ecosystem responses to climate change are derived via expert opinion, often suffice for managers to begin addressing climate change in their planning, this approach may face limits in resolving the responses of complex systems to altered climate conditions. In addition, this approach may fall short of the scientific credibility managers often require to take actions that differ from current practice. Quantitative simulation modeling of ecosystem response to climate conditions and management actions can provide this credibility, but its utility is limited unless the modeling addresses the most impactful and management-relevant uncertainties and incorporates realistic management actions. We use a case study to compare and contrast management implications derived from qualitative scenario narratives and from scenarios supported by quantitative simulations. We then describe an analytical framework that refines the case study's integrated approach in order to improve applicability of results to management decisions. The case study illustrates the value of an integrated approach for identifying counterintuitive system dynamics, refining understanding of complex relationships, clarifying the magnitude and timing of changes, identifying and checking the validity of assumptions about resource responses to climate, and refining management directions. Our proposed analytical framework retains qualitative scenario planning as a core element because its participatory approach builds understanding for both managers and scientists, lays the groundwork to focus quantitative simulations on key system dynamics, and clarifies the challenges that subsequent decision making must address.","[Symstad, Amy J.] US Geol Survey, Northern Prairie Wildlife Res Ctr, 26611 US Highway 385, Hot Springs, SD 57747 USA; [Fisichelli, Nicholas A.; Schuurman, Gregor W.] Natl Pk Serv, Nat Resource Stewardship & Sci, 1201 Oakridge Dr,Suite 200, Ft Collins, CO 80525 USA; [Miller, Brian W.] Colorado State Univ, US Geol Survey, Dept Interior, North Cent Climate Sci Ctr, 1499 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Rowland, Erika] Upper Saco Valley Land Trust, 2686 White Mt Rd, North Conway, NH 03860 USA; [Fisichelli, Nicholas A.] Schood Inst, Forest Ecol Program, Acad Natl Pk,POB 277, Winter Harbor, ME 04693 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; Colorado State University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Symstad, AJ (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Northern Prairie Wildlife Res Ctr, 26611 US Highway 385, Hot Springs, SD 57747 USA.",asymstad@usgs.gov,,"Miller, Brian/0000-0003-1716-1161",U.S. Geological Survey; U.S. National Park Service; Department of the Interior North Central Climate Science Center,U.S. Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey); U.S. National Park Service; Department of the Interior North Central Climate Science Center,"This work was funded by the U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. National Park Service, and the Department of the Interior North Central Climate Science Center.

In this study, the environmental impacts of VF were evaluated based on a case study of VF for vegetables in Miyagi Prefecture in Japan, where VF has been utilized in post-disaster relief operations in the wake of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. The nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) footprints of these VFs were determined and analyzed to quantify the potential reduction in N and P emissions. First, the N and P footprints in conventional farming were calculated. Then, those footprints were compared with three different scenarios with different ratios for food imports, which equate to different levels of food self-sufficiency. The results show a decrease in the N and P footprints with increased prefectural self-sufficiency due to the introduction of VF. In addition to reducing the risks to food supply by reducing the dependence on imports and the environmental impacts of agriculture, further analysis reveals that VF is suitable for use in many scenarios around the world to reliably provide food to local communities. Its low vulnerability to natural disasters makes VF well suited to places most at risk from climate change anomalies.","[Liu, Jiarui; Matsubae, Kazuyo] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Aoba Ku, 468-1 Aoba, Sendai, Miyagi 9808572, Japan; [Oita, Azusa; Hayashi, Kentaro] Natl Agr & Food Res Org NARO, Inst Agroenvironm Sci, 3-1-3 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan; [Hayashi, Kentaro] Res Inst Humanity & Nat, Kita Ku, 457-4 Motoyama, Kyoto 6038047, Japan",Tohoku University; National Agriculture & Food Research Organization - Japan; Research Institute for Humanity & Nature (RIHN),"Liu, JR (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Aoba Ku, 468-1 Aoba, Sendai, Miyagi 9808572, Japan.",liu.jiarui.r7@dc.tohoku.ac.jp; a.oita@affrc.go.jp; kentaroh@affrc.go.jp; kazuyo.matsubae.a2@tohoku.ac.jp,"; Matsubae, Kazuyo/J-8842-2015; Hayashi, Kentaro/O-1463-2018","Liu, Jiarui/0000-0002-5086-7134; Oita, Azusa/0000-0002-1876-2033; Matsubae, Kazuyo/0000-0002-3816-3898; Hayashi, Kentaro/0000-0002-2936-9544",,,,,102,2,2,16,35,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2022,14,2,,,,,,,1042,10.3390/su14021042,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14021042,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZC1IU,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000757283300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The assessment shows that current and proposed policies and instruments are inadequate to stimulate large-scale adoption of soil carbon projects across Europe. Given the identified structural flaws, it is likely that this is true for all climate-smart agricultural practices. An alternative approach needs to be developed. Under EU climate policy, agriculture should be included in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) by allowing regulated industries to buy offsets from the agricultural sector, following the examples set by Australia and others. The second element of a new approach is aimed at the CAP, which needs to be far more focused on the specific requirements of climate change mitigation and adaptation. Yet, such stronger focus does not take away the need to explore new income streams for farmers from offsets under the ETS, as the CAP will never have sufficient funds for the deep and full transition of Europe's agriculture sector that is needed.","[Verschuuren, Jonathan] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Law Sch, Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"Verschuuren, J (corresponding author), Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Law Sch, Tilburg, Netherlands.",J.M.Verschuuren@uvt.nl,,"Verschuuren, Jonathan/0000-0002-8922-1584","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant [655565]; Australian Centre for Climate and Environmental Law of the University of Sydney, NSW (Australia)","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Australian Centre for Climate and Environmental Law of the University of Sydney, NSW (Australia)","This article is based upon a paper accepted for presentation at the 3rd European Climate Change Adaptation Conference 'Our Climate Ready Future', Glasgow (United Kingdom), 5-9 June 2017.

These discourses of viability often invoke concrete physical limits and tipping points suggesting a transcendent natural order. Conversely, I demonstrate how viability is co-produced through political economic structures that exercise power at multiple scales in shaping the environment and understandings of how it is changing. I describe three dialectics of this co-production: epistemic/material (between ideas about viability and their biophysical and political economic conditions), epistemic/normative (between how the world is understood to be and ideas about how we should live in it), and inter-scalar (between geographic scales, where action at one scale shapes both ecologies and understandings of possible action at another). Each of these dialectics shapes the knowledge regimes that govern the ambiguous social and biophysical process of disappearance and foreclosure of livelihood possibilities in the time of climate change. I examine these discourses of viability through narratives of unviable agrarian livelihoods in coastal Bangladesh, as a lens through which to examine the dialectics of viability more broadly. I situate these discourses concretely in relation to an analysis of interdisciplinary social and natural scientific research on ecological and agrarian viability in coastal Bangladesh now and in the future. Across a broad interdisciplinary spectrum, I find that scientific attention to political economy shapes the politics of possibility. Finally, I demonstrate how discourses of viability limit alternative possible economic and ecological futures. I do this through a concrete examination of the co-production of viable agrarian futures within communities in coastal Bangladesh. These alternative visions indicate that the viability of agriculture is shaped by historical and ongoing decisions in the present about cultivation, water management, and development intervention.","[Paprocki, Kasia] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Paprocki, K (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",k.paprocki@lse.ac.uk,"Paprocki, Kasia/AFN-4975-2022","Paprocki, Kasia/0000-0001-5202-351X","National Science Foundation [DGE1144153, 1459009]; Social Science Research Council; Fulbright-Hays Program",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Social Science Research Council; Fulbright-Hays Program,"Research contributing to this article was generously supported by funding from the National Science Foundation (under Grant Nos.

Studies in environmental justice concur that the adverse effects of urban climate change are disproportionately greater for the demographically vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, the children, and the socially marginalized. Yet, little is known about how these social groups contribute to urban climate change policies. Accounting for local climate risks and the presence of national adaptation schemes, this study examines whether the implementation of adaptation policies in the 902 European cities is influenced by the proportion of these vulnerable groups. Our results show a positive and significant association between the proportion of elderly citizens and adaptation policies among these European cities. The result of this study offers local level empirical evidence to the climate justice discussion and suggests that the adaptation policies adopted by these European cities are working to ameliorate environmental injustice faced by the older and weaker social groups.","[Yang, Hyuk] Rutgers Univ Newark, Sch Publ Affairs & Adm, 111 Washington St, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Lee, Taedong] Yonsei Univ, Polit Sci Dept, Yonsei Ro 50, Seoul, South Korea; [Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Ecosyst & Environm Res Programme, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland",Rutgers State University Newark; Yonsei University; University of Helsinki,"Lee, T (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Polit Sci Dept, Yonsei Ro 50, Seoul, South Korea.",hy265@scarletmail.rutgers.edu; tdlee@yonsei.ac.kr,"Yang, Hyuk/AAW-7060-2021; Juhola, Sirkku/GVS-5485-2022","Yang, Hyuk/0000-0003-3067-9854; Juhola, Sirkku/0000-0003-0095-2282",National Research Foundation of Korea [2019S1A5A2A01047251],National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),This work was funded by National Research Foundation of Korea (2019S1A5A2A01047251) .,,57,17,17,17,47,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

While climate change has been a consideration for Australian fisheries and aquaculture management, emphasis in both research and adaptation effort has been at the production end of supply chains-impacts further along the chain have been overlooked to date. A holistic biophysical and socio-economic system view of seafood industries, as represented by end-to-end supply chains, may lead to an additional set of options in the face of climate change, thus maximizing opportunities for improved fishery profitability, while also reducing the potential for maladaptation. In this paper, we explore Australian seafood industry stakeholder perspectives on potential options for adaptation along seafood supply chains based on future potential scenarios. Stakeholders, representing wild capture and aquaculture industries, provided a range of actions targeting different stages of the supply chain. Overall, proposed strategies were predominantly related to the production end of the supply chain, suggesting that greater attention in developing adaptation options is needed at post-production stages. However, there are chain-wide adaptation strategies that can present win-win scenarios, where commercial objectives beyond adaptation can also be addressed alongside direct or indirect impacts of climate. Likewise, certain adaptation strategies in place at one stage of the chain may have varying implications on other stages of the chain. These findings represent an important step in understanding the role of supply chains in effective adaptation of fisheries and aquaculture industries to climate change.","[Lim-Camacho, Lilly] Climate Adaptat Flagship, Pullenvale, Qld 4069, Australia; [Hobday, Alistair J.; Fleming, Aysha; van Putten, Ingrid] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Climate Adaptat Flagship, Castray Esplanade, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Bustamante, Rodrigo H.; Norman-Lopez, Ana; Plaganyi, Eva E.; Thebaud, Olivier; Thomas, Linda] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Climate Adaptat Flagship, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Farmery, Anna; Frusher, Stewart; Green, Bridget S.; Pecl, Gretta T.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Schrobback, Peggy] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Tasmania; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Lim-Camacho, L (corresponding author), Climate Adaptat Flagship, 1 Technol Court, Pullenvale, Qld 4069, Australia.",lilly.lim-camacho@csiro.au,"Pecl, Gretta/D-7267-2011; Schrobback, Peggy/X-4697-2019; Thebaud, Olivier/D-9792-2011; Lim-Camacho, Lilly/A-7502-2015; van putten, ingrid/AAV-1301-2021; Hobday, Alistair/A-1460-2012; Thomas, Linda/Q-2521-2018; Plaganyi, Eva E/C-5130-2011; Fleming, Aysha/E-8753-2011; Farmery, Anna/H-9696-2014; Frusher, Stewart/G-5117-2014","Pecl, Gretta/0000-0003-0192-4339; Schrobback, Peggy/0000-0003-0526-1659; Thebaud, Olivier/0000-0001-8665-3827; Lim-Camacho, Lilly/0000-0002-4897-1186; van putten, ingrid/0000-0001-8397-9768; Hobday, Alistair/0000-0002-3194-8326; Thomas, Linda/0000-0001-8989-8109; Plaganyi, Eva E/0000-0002-4740-4200; Fleming, Aysha/0000-0001-9895-1928; Farmery, Anna/0000-0002-8938-0040; Frusher, Stewart/0000-0003-2493-3676",FRDC-DCCEE on behalf of the Australian Government [FRDC 2012/233],FRDC-DCCEE on behalf of the Australian Government(Fisheries R&D Corp),This research was part of the 'Growth opportunities and critical elements in the value chain for wild fisheries and aquaculture in a changing climate (FRDC 2012/233)' which was supported by funding from the FRDC-DCCEE on behalf of the Australian Government.

A field study was conducted in the semi-humid potato-growing belt of Kenya to test the effect of legume intercropping and water soluble silicon (orthocilicic acid) on soil erosion, and use efficiency of light and water. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) was grown singly and intercropped with dolichos (Lablab purpureus L.) or hairy vetch (Vicia sativa L.). Each cropping system was subjected to granular water-soluble silicon (Si) amendment at two rates [2.5 kg Si ha(-1) (+Si) vs. 0 kg Si ha(-1) (-Si)]. Plants receiving Si maintained significantly higher (p < 0.05) percent relative leaf water content (62-89% vs. 52-72% in controls) and exhibited higher concentrations of proline (1.99-2.91 vs. 1-1.19 umol g(-1)), soluble carbohydrates (28-59 vs. 10-28 umol g(-1)) and electrolyte conductance (1,409-3,903 vs. 746-2,307 mS cm(-1)). Legume intercropping enhanced groundcover establishment and reduced soil and nutrient losses by 45-80% compared with sole potato. Crop yields were 2-3-fold greater in intercropping relative to sole potato and were significantly greater in treatments subjected to Si application. Land equivalent ratios were above unity in intercropping but less than unity in sole potato, and were 8-20% increased by Si application. Use efficiency of water (5.99-9.09 Kg ha(-1) m(-3)) and light (1.98-2.98 g MJ(-1)) were significantly greater under legume intercropping compared with sole potato (1.13-3.23 Kg ha(-1) m(-3) and 0.77-0.98 g MJ(-1), respectively) and increased with Si application. Integrative use of Si and legume intercropping presents the smallholder farmers an opportunity to increase productivity of potato while enhancing resource use efficiency and soil fertility in the semi-humid tropics.","[Nyawade, Shadrack; Parker, Monica L.] Consultat Grp Int Agr Res CGIAR, Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur CCAFS, Nairobi, Kenya; [Nyawade, Shadrack; Schulte-Geldermann, Elmar; Sharma, Kalpana; Parker, Monica L.] Int Potato Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya; [Nyawade, Shadrack; Karanja, Nancy N.; Gachene, Charles K.

Through a survey, we obtain a household level data from goat producers in designated climate-smart and non-climate-smart villages of the Lawra and Jirapa districts in Upper West region of Ghana. Data are analysed using a multivariate probit model to assess how perceptions and other factors influence coping and adaptation strategy choices. Seven main coping/adaptation strategies are used by goat farmers to deal with weather variability and climate change. Our econometric results show that goat farmers' perceptions and being located in a climate-smart village, as well as market and extension information influence the choice of coping and adaptation strategies towards climate change. The results suggest that perceptions of weather variability and climate change have significant positive influence on all adaptation strategies, and that these adaptation strategies are complementary to each other as evidenced by their high inter-correlations. The fact that farmers located in climate-smart villages are more likely to adopt strategies that enable them to cope with and adapt to weather variability and climate change signals the need for project implementers to extend the number of villages benefiting from the climate-smart village concept.","[Tetteh, Bright K.

To achieve this objective, statistically analyses is performed on several available data sets: sea-level data from tide gauges (Takoradi, Tema and Forcados), satellite altimetry (combined TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1 and Jason-2/OSTM), gridded sea-level reconstruction (Church et al., J Clim 17(13):2609-2625, 2004), meteorological reanalysis (NCEP), a high-resolution ocean model simulation driven by this meteorological reanalysis, and, observational data sets (The Hadley Centre Global Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature (HadISST1), and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) index). Ghana is the only country along the West African coast with two relatively long sea-level records available (Takoradi and Tema), but with data quality concerns (Woodworth et. al., Afr J Mar Sci 29(3):321-330, 2007). Attempts are made to combine these two records, which cover different but overlapping periods, to construct a regional sea-level curve for Ghana (1929-1981) that may be regionally representative. A physical connection is identified between the AMO, sea-surface temperature and sea level in the Gulf of Guinea and mean sea-level trends and variability of the West African coast. It has been found that a stronger AMO is connected with higher mean sea-level in the Tropical Atlantic and in particular also at the Gulf of Guinea sea-level. This connection may explain the multidecadal variability of sea-level there, and in particular the negative trends between 1955 and 1975 and the positive trends thereafter. In addition, warmer sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Guinea are also connected with higher sea-level, although a simple estimation based on reasonable assumptions of the thermal expansion of the water column is not sufficient to explain the connection between sea-surface-temperature and sea-level. More detailed modelling studies will be needed to explain this link. Although this study provides useful information for adaption strategies in Ghana, the research is unable to provide sea-level information between the years 1981 and 1993 because of lack of data.","[Evadzi, Prosper I.

Adapting to these changes to secure adequate freshwater to meet the rising demands of socio-economic development has become a critical task for decision-makers. Whilst a range of adaptation options may be available, the complexity and interconnectedness of water resource systems make it challenging to identify which options are likely to be most feasible and effective. Here, we present a Bayesian decision network (BDN) that was co-developed with local experts to identify appropriate adaptation options for freshwater management under both current and likely future conditions in the Da Do Basin of coastal Vietnam. Potential adaptation options were prioritised according to cost-effectiveness based on relative costs incurred and relative utilities delivered across a range of future scenarios. The BDN model indicated that cost-effectiveness of adaptation options varied between future scenarios. Constructing pumping stations was the most cost-effective option under climate change scenarios, whilst a higher water price was the most cost-effective option under non-climatic changes. Under combined climatic and non-climatic changes, constructing pumping stations in combination with increasing water prices provided the most cost-effective option. The model affords an opportunity for decision-makers in the Da Do Basin to prioritise and evaluate appropriate and feasible adaptation actions under different scenarios with respect to multiple drivers.","[Phan, Thuc D.] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Phan, Thuc D.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Ctr Coastal Management, Gold Coast, Qld 4215, Australia; [Smart, James C.

The use of nature-based solutions to address these challenges is increasing. Natural water retention ponds have been identified as viable solutions for water management in agriculture. This paper aims to characterize water retention ponds, and to quantify their effectiveness, direct and indirect benefits, and costs. The paper analyses the case of the Lamone river catchment in Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy), characterized by large seasonal variability of water flow and availability. This is an important agricultural area that relies heavily on irrigation. Here water retention ponds are systematically applied to store water in winter, for use during the dry season. They can play a strategic role in ensuring irrigation water availability, while preserving minimum environmental flow. The paper analyses both the benefits of ponds for the water balance at sub-catchment scale, and the environmental effects produced by ponds having an ecological functionality. We develop an implementation scenario for new ponds, and we appraise the contribution of new ponds whose siting is chosen in order to maximize landscape connectivity. Their hydrological effects are evaluated under present and future climate change scenarios, showing how they may increase water availability for irrigation, while improving the river flow regime. More water for irrigation can favour additional agricultural production, while a more ecologically oriented design of ponds can favour to landscape ecological improvements. The investment costs of ponds are justified in economic terms, and the additional costs of improved design are expected to be balanced by the ecosystem services obtained. The business model required to operate this type of intervention is discussed, together with potential funding channels. We discuss two innovative incentive models based on compensation of land and production lost, and on tradable development rights that can be applied to widely support NBS implementation.","[Staccione, Andrea; Mysiak, Jaroslav] Euro Mediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Edificio Porta DellInnovaz Piano 2,Via Liberta 12, I-30175 Marghera Venice, VE, Italy; [Staccione, Andrea; Mysiak, Jaroslav] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Edificio Porta DellInnovaz Piano 2,Via Liberta 12, I-30175 Marghera Venice, VE, Italy; [Broccoli, Davide; Mazzoli, Paolo; Bagli, Stefano] GECOsistema Srl Geog Environm Consulting, R&D Unit Suedtirol Via Maso Pieve Pfarrhofstr 60, I-47923 Rimini, RN, Italy",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Staccione, A (corresponding author), Euro Mediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Edificio Porta DellInnovaz Piano 2,Via Liberta 12, I-30175 Marghera Venice, VE, Italy.;Staccione, A (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Edificio Porta DellInnovaz Piano 2,Via Liberta 12, I-30175 Marghera Venice, VE, Italy.",andrea.staccione@cmcc.it,,"Broccoli, Davide/0000-0003-3129-9618; Staccione, Andrea/0000-0002-9251-8952",JRC [JRC/IPR/2019/OP/0394],JRC,"This research was funded by JRC, grant number JRC/IPR/2019/OP/0394 - LOT 7: Landscape Elements for Water Retention in a Mountainous Environment.",,85,4,4,3,27,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

However, the landscape structural diversity and the cover of forest-grassland ecotones, which are both crucial for nature conservation value, were not explicitly considered. We aimed to compare the country-specific management guidelines regarding their efficiency for the conservation of the structurally diverse forest-grassland mosaics in the light of recent land-use and climate change. In strategic simulation experiments using the process-based model of pasture-woodland ecosystems WoodPaM, we analyzed the relationships among drivers for the formation of mosaic patterns (grazing intensity, climate change) and the resulting landscape properties (tree cover, forest-grassland ecotones, mosaic structure) during the past until today (2000 AD). The results showed that tree canopy densification following recent climate warming is likely to trigger landscape structural shifts. Medium grazing pressure promoted the development of the full range of pasture-woodland habitats and is therefore confirmed as a management strategy that balances agronomic demands and nature conservation value. Tree cover is rejected as a criteria to monitor pasture-woodland conservation status, because its relationship to landscape structural diversity and to the cover of forest grassland ecotones did not hold for changing climate. Our results suggest experimental-retrospective analysis as a useful tool to test conclusions from expert knowledge. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

An incentivised lab experiment is conducted on a representative sample in the neighbouring region of Bilbao. A 2 x 2 factorial between-subject design is used to measure risk acceptability in response to visual and economic impact framings, and the effect of experience is measured using a 2-period repeated game within-subject design. Results from the experiment teach us that photos of climate impacts can be an effective medium for provoking visceral feelings about climate change. When used in conjunction with simple numerical risk information, photos can help the public to engage more deeply with climate issues and in turn encourage them to take precautionary measures to limit losses in the future. Experiencing economic losses leads to reductions in levels of acceptable risks, but decision-making is characterised by little emotional or logical reasoning, signalling a use of heuristics such as 'gut impulse', which may be prone to cognitive bias.","[Markanday, Ambika; Galarraga, Ibon] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Bilbao, Basque Country, Spain; [Kallbekken, Steffen] Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res CICERO, Oslo, Norway",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3),"Markanday, A (corresponding author), Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Bilbao, Basque Country, Spain.",ambika.markanday@bc3research.org; steffen.kallbekken@cicero.oslo.no; ibon.galarraga@bc3research.org,,"Galarraga, Ibon/0000-0002-2683-9360; Kallbekken, Steffen/0000-0001-6539-992X",Horizon 2020 COACCH Project [776479]; Basque Government through the BERC 2018-2021 programme; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO through BC3 Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation [MDM-2017-0714],Horizon 2020 COACCH Project; Basque Government through the BERC 2018-2021 programme(Basque Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO through BC3 Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation(Spanish Government),"This research was supported by the Horizon 2020 COACCH Project (grant agreement no. 776479).

However, current approaches to informing communities of future climate risk are problematic. The predominant focus on end-of-century projections neglects more pressing development concerns, which relate to the management of shorter-term risks and climate variability, and constitutes a substantial opportunity cost for the limited financial and human resources available to tackle development challenges. When a long-term view genuinely is relevant to decision-making, much of the information available is not fit for purpose. Climate model projections are able to capture many aspects of the climate system and so can be relied upon to guide mitigation plans and broad adaptation strategies, but the use of these models to guide local, practical adaptation actions is unwarranted. Climate models are unable to represent future conditions at the degree of spatial, temporal, and probabilistic precision with which projections are often provided, which gives a false impression of confidence to users of climate change information. In this article, we outline these issues, review their history, and provide a set of practical steps for both the development and climate scientist communities to consider.

Resilience is defined here as the ability of a water resources management system to 'bounce back', i.e. absorb and then recover from a water deficit event, restoring the normal system operation. Ten alternative metrics are proposed and analysed addressing a range of different resilience aspects including duration, magnitude, frequency and volume of related water deficit events. The metrics were analysed on a real-world case study of the Bristol Water supply system in the UK and compared with current practice. The analyses included an examination of metrics' sensitivity and correlation, as well as a detailed examination into the behaviour of metrics during water deficit periods. The results obtained suggest that multiple metrics which cover different aspects of resilience should be used simultaneously when assessing the resilience of a water resources management system, leading to a more complete understanding of resilience compared with current practice approaches. It was also observed that calculating the total duration of a water deficit period provided a clearer and more consistent indication of system performance compared to splitting the deficit periods into the time to reach and time to recover from the worst deficit events.","[Roach, Tom; Kapelan, Zoran] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Harrison Bldg,North Pk Rd, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Roach, Tom; Ledbetter, Ralph] HR Wallingford, Howbery Business Pk, Wallingford OX10 8BA, Oxon, England",University of Exeter; HR Wallingford Limited,"Roach, T (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Harrison Bldg,North Pk Rd, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England.;Roach, T (corresponding author), HR Wallingford, Howbery Business Pk, Wallingford OX10 8BA, Oxon, England.",tom.roach@atkinsglobal.com,,"Kapelan, Zoran/0000-0002-0934-4470; Ledbetter, Ralph/0000-0003-0764-8187",UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; HR Wallingford; University of Exeter through the STREAM Industrial Doctorate Centre [EP/G037094/1],UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); HR Wallingford; University of Exeter through the STREAM Industrial Doctorate Centre,"This work was financially supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, HR Wallingford and The University of Exeter through the STREAM Industrial Doctorate Centre (grant EP/G037094/1).

In this sector, indicators have been centered on the impacts of climate on production systems, crops, yields, infrastructure, financial performance, farmers' livelihoods and food security. This paper focuses on designing an indicator set to capture the resilience of agriculture to inform decision-making frameworks and policies. The indicators' selection and definition were driven by their relevance for decision-making through the combined knowledge of policy and information priorities on climate change impacts and vulnerabilities as well as pragmatic issues relating to data availability. In total, 36 indicators were selected covering the following areas: regional drivers of the change to the agricultural sector (demographics, agricultural markets, climate); farmland production activities (food and feed); non-farm economy; and primary outcomes (off-farm net income, numerous environmental services). By coordinating this process among policy-makers with different roles in regional planning, we were able to identify shared information needs among the various sectoral representatives. The indicator selection process also captured policy gaps potential responses that could increase resilience and feed directly into policy reviews, thereby strengthening integration of actions across sectors. This indicator set emphasizes that the relationships between government agencies and both industry and academia may be improved by addressing gaps in data availability, accessibility, and privacy constraints.","[Bizikova, Livia] IISD, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Larkin, Patricia; Mitchell, Scott; Waldick, Ruth] Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Waldick, Ruth] Agrifood & Agr Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Carleton University,"Bizikova, L (corresponding author), IISD, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",lbizikova@iisd.ca; plarkin@xplornet.com; ScottMitchell@CUNET.CARLETON.CA; RuthWaldick@CUNET.CARLETON.CA,"BITOUN, RACHEL Elisabeth/AAC-9538-2021; Mitchell, Scott W/C-8548-2017","BITOUN, RACHEL Elisabeth/0000-0002-3614-9910; Mitchell, Scott W/0000-0003-4657-0706","Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, through the New Directions Research Program","Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, through the New Directions Research Program","Special thanks goes to the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, through the New Directions Research Program for their invaluable support and for making this project possible.

To fill this gap, we conduct a spatial analysis of 234 ROC USA sites; analyze the co-op conversion process; and interview ROC USA staff, technical assistance providers, and resident co-op leaders. Although ROC USA communities, like other MHCs, face elevated exposure and sensitivity to hazards, we find that ROC USA's model supports communities' adaptive capacity by increasing access to financial resources, bridging formal and informal knowledge and skills, and improving social and institutional capacity. This networked cooperative model represents a scalable form of transformative adaptation by enabling low-income communities to address the underlying causes of uneven hazard vulnerabilities that are intensifying under climate change.

Traditionally, cities have treated climate mitigation and adaptation strategies in isolation, without addressing their potential synergies, conflicts or trade-offs. Recent studies have shown that this can lead to inefficiencies in urban planning, conflicting policy objectives and lost opportunities for synergistic actions. However, in the last few years, we have observed that cities are increasingly moving towards addressing both mitigation and adaptation in urban planning. Cities need to pay particular attention and understand the rationale of both policy objectives whilst considering the integration of the two policies in urban planning and decision-making. This study presents an analytical framework to evaluate the level of integration of climate mitigation and adaptation in cities' local climate action plans. We tested this framework in nine selected major cities, representatives from all inhabited continents, which are frontrunners in climate action both in their regions and globally. We applied the framework in order to evaluate the level of mitigation and adaptation integration in cities' CCAPs and further explored the different types of mitigationadaptation interrelationships that have been considered. A scoring system was also devised in order to allow comparing and ranking of the different CCAPs for their level of integration of adaptation and mitigation.

In consistency with this research framework, the study has developed a case study analysis, focusing on the description and evaluation of four best practices of French EcoQuartiers. The methodology adopted has selected with an inductive method the mitigation and adaptation strategies developed in the implementation of the French emblematic eco-quartiers, combining the official sources of the projects with on-site visits and surveys in order to define an experimental proposal of a grid of methodological-operational references relating to eco-districts. Furthermore, the discussion points out the potentials and limits of the proposed framework, related on the one hand to the quality, innovation, integration, and dissemination of the design solutions, and on the other hand to the economic and social costs of the EcoQuartiers that find a synthesis in the concept of greentrification.

Cropping systems that invest in soil organic matter, such as no-tillage (NT) with crop residue retention, have been proposed as potential solutions. However, a key challenge for assessing the sustainability of NT systems is that soil carbon (C) stocks develop over long timescales, and there is an urgent need to identify trajectory indicators of sustainability and crop productivity. Here we examined the effects of NT as compared with conventional tillage without residue retention on relationships between soil characteristics and maize (Zea mays L.) productivity in long-term on-farm and on-station trials in Zimbabwe. Our results show that relationships between soil characteristics and maize productivity, and the effects of management on these relationships, varied with soil type. Total soil nitrogen (N) and C were strong predictors of maize grain yield and above-ground biomass (i.e., stover) in the clayey soils, but not in the sandy soils, under both managements. This highlights context-specific benefits of management that fosters the accumulation of soil C and N stocks. Despite a strong effect of NT management on soil C and N in sandy soils, this accrual was not sufficient to support increased crop productivity in these soils. We suggest that sandy soils should be the priority target of NT with organic resource inputs interventions in southern Africa, as mineral fertilizer inputs alone will not halt the soil fertility decline. This will require a holistic management approach and input of C in various forms (e.g., biomass from cover crops and tree components, crop residues, in combination with mineral fertilizers). Clayey soils on the other hand have greater buffering capacity against detrimental effects of soil tillage and low C input.","[Thierfelder, Christian; Cairns, Jill E.] CIMMYT, POB MP 163, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Paterson, Eric] James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Mwafulirwa, Lumbani; Baggs, Elizabeth M.] Univ Edinburgh, Global Acad Agr & Food Secur, Easter Bush Campus, Roslin EH25 9RG, Midlothian, Scotland; [Mwafulirwa, Lumbani] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England; [Daniell, Tim J.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Mhlanga, Blessing] Scuo Super St Anna, Inst Life Sci BioLabs, Pisa, Italy; [Mwafulirwa, Lumbani] Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Ecosyst & Global Change Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England",James Hutton Institute; University of Edinburgh; University of Reading; University of Sheffield; University of Cambridge,"Mwafulirwa, L (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Global Acad Agr & Food Secur, Easter Bush Campus, Roslin EH25 9RG, Midlothian, Scotland.;Mwafulirwa, L (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England.;Mwafulirwa, L (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Ecosyst & Global Change Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England.",lm965@cam.ac.uk,"Paterson, Eric/A-7756-2008; Mwafulirwa, Lumbani/I-5718-2019","Paterson, Eric/0000-0003-1512-7787; Mwafulirwa, Lumbani/0000-0002-6293-4170",UK Global Challenges Research Fund [BB/P022936/1]; MAIZE CGIAR Research Program; Government of Australia; Government of Belgium; Government of Canada; Government of China; Government of France; Government of India; Government of Japan; Government of Korea; Government of Mexico; Government of Netherlands; Government of New Zealand; Government of Norway; Government of Sweden; Government of Switzerland; Government of UK; Government of USA; World Bank,UK Global Challenges Research Fund; MAIZE CGIAR Research Program(CGIAR); Government of Australia; Government of Belgium(CGIAR); Government of Canada(CGIAR); Government of China; Government of France; Government of India; Government of Japan; Government of Korea(Korean Government); Government of Mexico; Government of Netherlands(Netherlands Government); Government of New Zealand; Government of Norway; Government of Sweden; Government of Switzerland; Government of UK; Government of USA; World Bank(The World Bank India),"This work was funded through the UK Global Challenges Research Fund administered by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/P022936/1].

In cities around the world, high air temperatures have been found to have strong repercussions in terms of heat-related mortality for populations aged 65 years and older, especially nighttime temperatures. In response, many measures have been proposed to counteract the effects of UHI such as cool roofs and materials or urban greening. While these approaches are promising and are rightfully explored, behavioral adaptation measures have not received as much attention. Given the importance of nighttime temperatures on heat-wave mortality and the importance of sleep quality for individuals to recover from intense daytime heat exposure, adapting sleeping habits to reduce sleep time exposure to intense heat may help reduce the health impacts of heat-waves. In this paper, outdoor and indoor temperature measurements conducted over the summer of 2015 in the bedrooms of two apartments in Paris, France are analyzed. The potential for this kind of behavioral adaptation to reduce occupant exposure to high sleep time temperatures is quantified and discussed.

Due to large modeling uncertainties, the ensembles are often averaged to provide a basis for studying the effects of climate change. A key issue when analyzing averages of a climate model ensemble is whether to weight all models in the ensemble equally, often referred to as the equal-weights or unweighted approach, or to use a weighted approach, where, in general, each model would have a different weight. Many studies have advocated for the latter, based on the assumption that models that are better at simulating the past, that is, the models with higher hindcast accuracy, will give more accurate forecasts for the future and thus should receive higher weights. To examine this issue, observed and modeled daily precipitation frequency (PF) estimates for three urban areas in the United States, namely Boston, Massachusetts; Houston, Texas; and Chicago, Illinois, were analyzed. The comparison used the raw output of 24 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models. The PFs from these models were compared with the observed PFs for a specific historical training period to determine model weights for each area. The unweighted and weighted averaged model PFs from a more recent testing period were then compared with their corresponding observed PFs to determine if weights improved the estimates. These comparisons indeed showed that the weighted averages were closer to the observed values than the unweighted averages in nearly all cases. The study also demonstrated how weights can help reduce model spread in future climate projections by comparing the unweighted and weighted ensemble standard deviations in these projections. In all studied scenarios, the weights actually reduced the standard deviations compared to the equal-weights approach. Finally, an analysis of the results' sensitivity to the areal reduction factor used to allow comparisons between point station measurements and grid-box averages is provided.","[Grady, Kevin; Markus, Momcilo] Univ Illinois, Prairie Res Inst, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Wu, Shu; Wang, Fuyao] Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Madison, WI USA; [Koric, Seid] Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Champaign, IL USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Markus, M (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Prairie Res Inst, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",mmarkus@illinois.edu,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [SUBAWD000255]; National Science Foundation [OCI-0725070, ACI-1238993]",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Grant/Award Number: SUBAWD000255; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: OCI-0725070 and ACI-1238993",,39,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1093-474X,1752-1688,,J AM WATER RESOUR AS,J.

Framed by a systematic review of risk reduction measures, we assess the extent to which Austrian policies are characteristic of an anticipatory, forward-looking flood management approach to cope with expected future stresses on the flood risk, such as climate change and land development. The analysis shows that risk reduction measures build on status quo assessments and do not explicitly consider future changes in the flood hazard or vulnerability. However, new design standards for extreme events, the proliferation of large-scale flood retention, tightened land development and building restrictions, and novel planning instruments indicate that Austrian policies are increasingly forward-looking to more effectively mitigate future increases in the flood risk. This temporal reorientation is a consequence of a wider policy shift from flood control to integrated flood risk management. Faced with the increasing spatial interplay of risk reduction measures (e.g. securing land for flood runoff and flood retention), our analysis shows that inter-sectoral cooperation between water management and spatial planning can support long-term flood management decisions and maintain the ability to adapt to changing future conditions.","[Nordbeck, Ralf; Steurer, Reinhard] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy InFER, Vienna, Austria; [Loeschner, Lukas] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Landscape Spatial & Infrastruct Sci, Inst Spatial Planning Environm Planning & Land Re, Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Nordbeck, R (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy InFER, Vienna, Austria.",ralf.nordbeck@boku.ac.at,,"Loschner, Lukas/0000-0001-7504-8007; Nordbeck, Ralf/0000-0002-6152-0830",,,,,83,13,14,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

Within the adaptation research and practitioner community, youth voices, perspectives, and involvement are essential in ensuring representative and sustainable adaptation strategies. This paper examines the potential of youth-led participatory video (PV) as a strategy to foster known protective factors that underpin the resilience of youth and their capacity to adapt to various stresses, including impacts of climate change. The work draws on a case study from the Inuit community of Rigolet, Nunatsiavut, Labrador, Canada, where a two-week PV workshop was conducted with seven youth and followed by in-depth interviews with participants and community members. The findings show that PV may be a pathway to greater adaptive capacities because the process connects to known protective factors that enhance resilience of circumpolar indigenous youth. PV also shows promise as a strategy to engage youth in sharing insights and knowledge, connect generations, and involve young Inuit in planning and decision making in general.","[MacDonald, Joanna Petrasek; Ford, James] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [Willox, Ashlee Cunsolo] Cape Breton Univ, Dept Nursing, Sydney, NS B1P 6L2, Canada; [Willox, Ashlee Cunsolo] Cape Breton Univ, Dept Indigenous Studies, Sydney, NS B1P 6L2, Canada; [Mitchell, Claudia] McGill Univ, Dept Integrated Studies Educ, Montreal, PQ H3A 1Y2, Canada",McGill University; Cape Breton University; Cape Breton University; McGill University,"MacDonald, JP (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Geog, 805 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada.",joanna.petrasekmacdonald@mail.mcgill.ca,"Ford, James/A-4284-2013","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456",Nunatsiavut Department of Health and Social Development; Native Spirit Youth Centre in Rigolet; Air Labrador; First Air; Inuit Traditional Knowledge for Adapting to the Health Effects of Climate Change project (IK-ADAPT); Inuit Mental Health Adaptation to Climate Change project (IMHACC); Indigenous Health Adaptation to Climate Change project (IHACC); Health Canada's First Nations; Inuit Health Branch; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC); ArcticNet; CIHR Applied Public Health Chair; Nasivvik Centre for Inuit Health and Changing Environments; Royal Canadian Geographic Society,Nunatsiavut Department of Health and Social Development; Native Spirit Youth Centre in Rigolet; Air Labrador; First Air; Inuit Traditional Knowledge for Adapting to the Health Effects of Climate Change project (IK-ADAPT); Inuit Mental Health Adaptation to Climate Change project (IMHACC); Indigenous Health Adaptation to Climate Change project (IHACC); Health Canada's First Nations; Inuit Health Branch; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); ArcticNet; CIHR Applied Public Health Chair(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Nasivvik Centre for Inuit Health and Changing Environments(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Royal Canadian Geographic Society,"We are extremely grateful to the community of Rigolet, in particular the young people who worked on this project with us, the parents that volunteered their time to accompany us on our boil-up, and all the community members who showed their support throughout the video workshop.

Even holding land use constant, ecosystem service provision may change through time due to climate change. This paper develops an auction mechanism that implements an optimal solution for providing ecosystem services through time with multiple landowners who have private information about the net benefits of alternative uses of their land. Under the auction, each landowner has a dominant strategy to truthfully reveal their private information. With this information a regulator can then implement the optimal landscape pattern, which maximizes the present value of net benefits derived from the landscape, following the rules of the auction mechanism. The auction can be designed as a subsidy auction that pays landowners to conserve or a tax auction where landowners pay for the right to develop. Our mechanism optimizes social adaptation of ecosystem management to climate change. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Such phenomena are associated with imperviousness and low, unsustainable utilisation of land and exterior building surfaces. Local authorities have multiple objectives when (re-)developing future-proof districts. Hence, exploiting local potentials to mitigate adverse anthropogenic effects and managing the resource of urban land/surfaces have become key priorities. Accordingly, a five-level hierarchy for a land-sensitive urban development strategy was derived. To support the operationalisation of the hierarchy, we present the model Namares, a highly resolved GIS-based approach to enable spatially explicit identification and techno-economic and environmental assessment of intervention measures for advantageous utilisation of available surfaces per land parcel. It uses existing data and covers the management of economic, natural, and technical resources. Nine intervention measures are implemented to identify potentials, estimate investments and annual costs, and assess the appeal of existing subsidies. The approach was applied to a case study redevelopment area in a large city in Germany. The results provide spatially explicit information on greening potentials, estimated investments, subsidy demand, and other quantified benefits. The case study results show the limited potential for additional unsealing of impervious surfaces by transforming ca. 10% of sealed ground surface area into new urban gardens. At the same time, up to 47% of roof and 30% of facade surfaces could be utilised for greening and energy harvesting. The approach enables a comprehensive localisation and quantitative assessment of intervention potentials to enhance decision support in land-sensitive urban development strategies.","[Naber, Elias; Volk, Rebekka; Schultmann, Frank] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Ind Prod, D-76187 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Moermann, Kai; Luetzkendorf, Thomas] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Sustainable Management Housing & Real Estate, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Boehnke, Denise] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Div Nat & Built Environm 4, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Naber, E (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Ind Prod, D-76187 Karlsruhe, Germany.",elias.naber@kit.edu; rebekka.volk@kit.edu; kai.moerrnann@kit.edu; denise.boehnke@kit.edu; thomas.luetzkendorf@kit.edu; frank.schultmann@kit.edu,"; Volk, Rebekka/R-6755-2017","Naber, Elias/0000-0001-6945-2644; Volk, Rebekka/0000-0001-9930-5354; Schultmann, Frank/0000-0001-6405-9763; Boehnke, Denise/0000-0002-4697-9520",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung-BMBF) [033W111A]; research project 'Namares' in the funding program 'RES:Z-Ressourceneffiziente Stadtquartiere',German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung-BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); research project 'Namares' in the funding program 'RES:Z-Ressourceneffiziente Stadtquartiere',This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung-BMBF) grant number 033W111A and research project 'Namares' in the funding program 'RES:Z-Ressourceneffiziente Stadtquartiere'.

Heat stress is expected to further increase due to urbanization, an aging population, and global warming. Previous research has identified correlations between extreme heat and mortality. However, the underlying physical, behavioral, environmental, and social risk factors remain largely unknown and comprehensive quantitative investigation on an individual level is lacking. We conducted a new cross-sectional household questionnaire survey to analyze individual heat impairment (self-assessed and reported symptoms) and a large set of potential risk factors in the city of Berlin, Germany. This unique dataset (n = 474) allows for the investigation of new relationships, especially between health/fitness and urban heat stress. Our analysis found previously undocumented associations, leading us to generate new hypotheses for future research: various health/fitness variables returned the strongest associations with individual heat stress. Our primary hypothesis is that age, the most commonly used risk factor, is outperformed by health/fitness as a dominant risk factor. Related variables seem to more accurately represent humans' cardiovascular capacity to handle elevated temperature. Among them, active travel was associated with reduced heat stress. We observed statistical associations for heat exposure regarding the individual living space but not for the neighborhood environment. Heat stress research should further investigate individual risk factors of heat stress using quantitative methodologies. It should focus more on health and fitness and systematically explore their role in adaptation strategies. The potential of health and fitness to reduce urban heat stress risk means that encouraging active travel could be an effective adaptation strategy. Through reduced CO2 emissions from urban transport, societies could reap double rewards by addressing two root causes of urban heat stress: population health and global warming.","[Schuster, Christian; Lakes, Tobia] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Schuster, Christian] North Rhine Westphalia State Environm Agcy, DE-45023 Essen, North Rhine Wes, Germany; [Honold, Jasmin] Humboldt Univ, Dept Psychol, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Honold, Jasmin] German Inst Urban Affairs, Zimmerstr 13-15, D-10969 Berlin, Germany; [Lauf, Steffen] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, Str 17 Juni 145, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Lauf, Steffen] Stat Off Berlin Brandenburg, Alt Friedrichsfelde 60, D-10315 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Technical University of Berlin,"Schuster, C (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.;Schuster, C (corresponding author), North Rhine Westphalia State Environm Agcy, DE-45023 Essen, North Rhine Wes, Germany.",chr.schuster@gmail.com,"Schuster, Christian/D-8089-2011","Schuster, Christian/0000-0001-6579-2350; Lakes, Tobia/0000-0001-8443-7899","German Research Foundation (DFG) [LA 2525/2-1, 595166]",German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The study was part of the Research Unit 1736 'Urban Climate and Heat Stress in mid-latitude cities in view of climate change' (www.UCaHS.org), funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) (LA 2525/2-1; 595166).

The present paper evaluates the impacts of climate change in the highly regulated Tagus River basin and assesses various adaptation options, quantifying the effort needed to maintain the ability to sustain current water uses. A water management and allocation model covering surface and groundwater resources is used to evaluate available and renewable water resources for different climate scenarios. Additionally, the Water Exploitation Index Plus (WEI+) and water supply reliability criteria are used to quantify water scarcity and the ability to satisfy water demands, respectively. The results show that climate change will significantly change the stream flow regime and reduce water availability in the Tagus River basin, but the existing reservoir infrastructure will alleviate some of these impacts, especially in the dry half-year. Until the end of the century, water scarcity levels, measured by annual WEI+, are expected to increase in the Tagus River basin from 0.46 to 0.52 or 0.62, respectively under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 or RCP 8.5). The benefits of streamflow regulation vary with the hydrological regimen, the current degree of water use and the role of groundwater resources to meet demand. The benefits of streamflow regulation are also dependent on the environmental flow requirements that will be adopted in the future. A reduction of water consumption for irrigation by 25% to 40% will significantly improve the Tagus River system performance and maintain the current scarcity situation in the future, under the expected scenarios of climate change.","[Sondermann, Melissa Nogueira; de Oliveira, Rodrigo Proenca] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Civil Engn Res & Innovat Sustainabil CERIS, Rovisco Pais 1, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico,"Sondermann, MN (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Civil Engn Res & Innovat Sustainabil CERIS, Rovisco Pais 1, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.",melissa.sondermann@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,"Sondermann, Melissa Nogueira/GXH-4490-2022; Proença de Oliveira, Rodrigo/B-2552-2014","Proença de Oliveira, Rodrigo/0000-0002-6587-9453; Sondermann, Melissa/0000-0001-8389-2662",Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [PD/BD/135421/2017]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PD/BD/135421/2017] Funding Source: FCT,Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia,This work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [grant number PD/BD/135421/2017].,,43,0,0,5,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,AUG,2022,14,16,,,,,,,2527,10.3390/w14162527,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14162527,,,22,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,4A5ZL,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000845179000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The meltwater from these structures is crucial to meet irrigation water demands during spring. However, there is a large variability associated with this water supply due to the local weather influences at the chosen location. This study compared the ice volume evolution of an AIR built in Ladakh, India with two others built in Guttannen, Switzerland using a surface energy balance model. Model input consisted of meteorological data in conjunction with fountain discharge rate (mass input of an AIR). Model calibration and validation were completed using ice volume and surface area measurements taken from several drone surveys. The model was successful in estimating the observed ice volume evolution with a root mean square error within 18% of the maximum ice volume for all the AIRs. The location in Ladakh had a maximum ice volume four times larger compared to the Guttannen site. However, the corresponding water losses for all the AIRs were more than three-quarters of the total fountain discharge due to high fountain wastewater. Drier and colder locations in relatively cloud-free regions are expected to produce long-lasting AIRs with higher maximum ice volumes. This is a promising result for dry mountain regions, where AIR technology could provide a relatively affordable and sustainable strategy to mitigate climate change induced water stress.","[Balasubramanian, Suryanarayanan; Hoelzle, Martin] Univ Fribourg, Dept Geosci, Fribourg, Switzerland; [Balasubramanian, Suryanarayanan; Wangchuk, Sonam] Himalayan Inst Alternat Ladakh, Leh, India; [Lehning, Michael] WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res, Davos, Switzerland; [Bolibar, Jordi; Oerlemans, Johannes] Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Keller, Felix] Acad Engiadina, Samedan, England; [Keller, Felix] ETH, Zurich, Switzerland","University of Fribourg; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Utrecht University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich","Balasubramanian, S (corresponding author), Univ Fribourg, Dept Geosci, Fribourg, Switzerland.;Balasubramanian, S (corresponding author), Himalayan Inst Alternat Ladakh, Leh, India.",suryanarayanan.balasubramanian@unifr.ch,"; Lehning, Michael/AFS-9462-2022","Balasubramanian, Suryanarayanan/0000-0002-8027-8808; Lehning, Michael/0000-0002-8442-0875","University of Fribourg [2021, CH19, CH20, CH21, IN21]; Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship(SB); Himalayan Institute of Alternatives; Swiss Polar Institute",University of Fribourg; Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship(SB); Himalayan Institute of Alternatives; Swiss Polar Institute,Funding This work was supported and funded by the University of Fribourg and by the Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship (SB).

Still, systematic insights in factors that stimulate or impede governance capacity are less widely available than those in the Global North. Moreover, translating relevant scientific insights into policy and practice is often problematic. Hence, there is a need for feasible interactive approaches that may facilitate integration between science and policy. In this paper, we assess to what extent the City Blueprint Approach may facilitate such meaningful science-policy interaction. This approach has been developed in the context of Watershare and the European Innovation Partnership on Water. We discuss the content of the approach and reflect on the process of applying it in the case of Ahmedabad, India. First, we carried out an overall assessment of Ahmedabad's trends, pressures, and integrated water resources management. Important challenges of Ahmedabad are water pollution, water scarcity (decline of groundwater levels), heat risk and urbanisation. Second, a governance capacity assessment provided a clearer understanding of the main enabling and limiting conditions that determine the city's ability to govern these challenges. It was found that the governance conditions regarding learning, stakeholder engagement and implementing capacity are most in need of improvement. Next, we zoomed in on a specific development in which these limiting governance conditions were better developed: Ahmedabad's Heat Action Plan. Based on our results and experiences, we reflect on the generalisability of the findings on the City Blueprint Approach (CBA)'s usefulness for improving science-policy interactions and water governance to India as well as the Global South more generally.","[Aartsen, Martien; Koop, Stef; Hegger, Dries; Van Leeuwen, Kees] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Environm Governance, VeningMeineszgebouw A, Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands; [Aartsen, Martien] Twynstra Gudde, Stn Pl 1, NL-3818 LE Amersfoort, Netherlands; [Koop, Stef; Van Leeuwen, Kees] KWR Watercycle Res Inst, Groningenhaven 7, NL-3430 BB Nieuwegein, Netherlands; [Goswami, Bijoy] Ctr Environm Educ Ahmedabad, Ahmadabad 380054, Gujarat, India; [Oost, Johan] Wetskills Fdn, Binckhorstlaan 36-M420, NL-2516 BE The Hague, Netherlands",Utrecht University; KWR Watercycle Research Institute; Centre for Environment Education (CEE),"Hegger, D (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Environm Governance, VeningMeineszgebouw A, Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands.",Martienaartsen@gmail.com; stef.koop@kwrwater.nl; d.l.t.hegger@uu.nl; bijoy.goswami@ceeindia.org; johan.oost@wetskills.com; kees.van.leeuwen@kwrwater.nl,"van Leeuwen, Cornelis J/S-5815-2016; Hegger, Dries/L-9301-2013","van Leeuwen, Cornelis J/0000-0003-1605-4268; Hegger, Dries/0000-0003-2721-3527",European Commission [687809],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),The European Commission is acknowledged for Funding POWER in H2020-Water under grant agreement no. 687809.,,54,13,13,1,21,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Despite this, local government budgets for tree planting and maintenance have declined in many cities throughout the world. Thus far, the academic literature has largely ignored whether businesses are willing to help fund urban forests and the ES they provide. Business financing via payments for ecosystem services (PES) within the urban realm is also under-researched and lacking in practice. This study aims to address these research gaps. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 30 businesses of varying sizes and sectors, operating in Southampton, UK. Respondents thought a public-private partnership would be feasible, with a focus on voluntary payments towards enhancing air quality, reducing flood risk, and improving aesthetics. Respondents would prefer to choose from a list of location-specific, cost-effective, monitored projects to fund directly, for marketing and/or corporate social responsibility purposes. To facilitate business funding of urban forest-based ES, clear communication of the expected environmental benefits and a strong business case are required, drawing on the experience of similar initiatives.

This study proposes a method for assessing the climate risks resulting from climate change as well as a tool that companies can use to assess those risks. The method for assessing climate risk is proposed in accordance with the ISO 31000 risk management process. We then design a web-based tool to implement the climate change risk assessment process. The data the tool generates enable companies to identify and analyze their climate risks to reduce potentially negative future financial impacts. The data on potential damage costs indicate that climate change is no longer an environmental issue but rather an economic one for companies, and the results presented through the proposed assessment method can be used to establish countermeasures and sustainable planning at companies. The results of this research are significant in that they provide companies with the critical information needed to improve their planning and response to climate risk.","[Kim, Donghyun; Lee, Junbeom] Korea Environm Inst, 370 Sicheong Daero, Sejong 30147, South Korea",Korea Environment Institute (KEI),"Kim, D (corresponding author), Korea Environm Inst, 370 Sicheong Daero, Sejong 30147, South Korea.",donghyunkim@kei.re.kr; jblee@kei.re.kr,"Kim, Donghyun/HDO-8306-2022","Kim, Donghyun/0000-0003-3711-5103; Lee, Junbeom/0000-0001-6317-249X",Korea Environment Institute [2016-001-05],Korea Environment Institute,This study was performed by the Korea Environment Institute (Project Number: 2016-001-05).,,52,0,0,1,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2016,8,10,,,,,,,1013,10.3390/su8101013,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su8101013,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EE1BE,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000389314600053,View Full Record in Web of Science

Main aim of the analysis is to assess whether water harvesting significantly improves crop yields, and whether the type of water harvesting technology and the quality of the rainy season correlate with the change in yield. We find that water harvesting improves crop yields significantly, and that the relative impact of water harvesting on crop yields is largest in low rainfall years. Smallholder farmers may still be reluctant to invest in water harvesting, however, as in regions with low agricultural productivity the returns to investment are limited. Finally, our review of the literature suggests that there is only a limited number of studies that has systematically evaluated the crop yield impacts of water harvesting technologies.

Adaptation is the 'adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities'. The challenge for governments is taking this rather vague concept and turning it into viable and implementable public policies. This implies that they have to make choices as to the types of polices to create, the sectors they should cover, ministerial jurisdictions and funding. This article contributes to the discussion on the adaptation governance by presenting a conceptual framework that outlines policy choices governors need to make, by applying this framework to a number of countries, and starting the debate on which choice or choices were particularly instrumental in shaping adaptation policy in particular countries as a whole. It focuses on four countries traditionally seen to be adaptation leaders: Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom.","[Massey, Eric; Huitema, Dave] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Huitema, Dave] Open Univ Netherlands, Fac Management Sci & Technol, NL-6401 DL Heerlen, Netherlands; [Garrelts, Heiko] Univ Bremen, SFG, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Grecksch, Kevin; Winges, Maik] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Mees, Heleen] Univ Utrecht, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Rayner, Tim] Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Storbjork, Sofie] Linkoping Univ, Linkoping, Sweden; [Termeer, Catrien] Wageningen Univ, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Open University Netherlands; University of Bremen; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Utrecht University; University of East Anglia; Linkoping University; Wageningen University & Research,"Massey, E (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",e.e.massey@vu.nl,"Grecksch, Kevin/AAA-1826-2021; Mees, Heleen/L-5394-2013; Huitema, Dave/L-1343-2013","Grecksch, Kevin/0000-0002-1913-0134; Mees, Heleen/0000-0002-4401-6106; Huitema, Dave/0000-0001-8565-3200; Huitema, D./0000-0002-0139-3913",Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment,Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment,This research has been carried out in the framework of the Dutch National Research Programme 'Knowledge for Climate' (www.knowledgeforclimate.org).

However, the industries differ in terms of size, ownership and mobility. Although mining companies are 'mobile,' a commitment to a mine site makes them immobile at a location dictated by the presence of a mineral; forestry of natural and managed trees takes place in a specifically selected location that can be changed given a reasonably long time-frame and high financial investment; fishing is the last of the major hunting industries, and despite operating from fixed ports, fishers chase fish across the ocean. All three industries as employers and product providers seek a sustainable future under a changing climate but are subject to environmental variability that impacts on their activities. As each industry has historically dealt with and survived major climate impacts, they typically consider themselves to be resilient, although we illustrate in several case studies that recent climate variability significantly impacts productivity and current resilience is limited. Projected climate change and variability are likely to exacerbate impacts on these industries through new or intensified hazards. Although each industry performs risk management controls to minimize climate-related impacts, a new approach incorporating future climate projections in addition to historical experiences would better prepare each to reduce vulnerability to changing climate. We find that wholesale transformation may not be appropriate or necessary at this time for these industries, and in most cases anticipatory, incremental adaptation should be encouraged, while larger-scale changes are considered in the longer term. Additionally, to overcome some of the barriers and promote the drivers of adaptation, we suggest that a model of adaptive governance coupled with greater use of climate champions may be the most effective method for improving adaptation uptake in these industries.","[Hodgkinson, Jane H.] CSIRO Earth Sci & Resource Engn, CSIRO Climate Adaptat Flagship, Brisbane, Qld 4069, Australia; [Hobday, Alistair J.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, CSIRO Climate Adaptat Flagship, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Pinkard, Elizabeth A.] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, CSIRO Climate Adaptat Flagship, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Hodgkinson, JH (corresponding author), CSIRO Earth Sci & Resource Engn, CSIRO Climate Adaptat Flagship, Brisbane, Qld 4069, Australia.",jane.hodgkinson@csiro.au; alistair.hobday@csiro.au; libby.pinkard@csiro.au,"Pinkard, Libby/C-5804-2011; Hodgkinson, Jane/GLT-5216-2022; Hobday, Alistair/A-1460-2012","Pinkard, Libby/0000-0002-3410-0099; Hobday, Alistair/0000-0002-3194-8326; Hodgkinson, Jane/0000-0002-4031-3883",Climate Adaptation Flagship at CSIRO,Climate Adaptation Flagship at CSIRO,"We appreciate the support of Mark Howden and the Climate Adaptation Flagship at CSIRO in undertaking this cross-sectoral analysis.

To respond to emerging challenges due to climate change, land-use changes, and sociodemographic and migration issues, an integrated management of natural hazards is needed, including appropriate approaches to risk communication. This study-which included a quantitative street survey, semistructured interviews (Leitfadeninterview), and focus group discussions carried out in 9 Austrian municipalities prone to flooding-found that residents with foreign-born parents and foreign-born residents were underrepresented in local governments and in voluntary organizations related to disaster risk management and therefore often do not participate in decision-making. Nonetheless, ethnicity was often not the prevailing factor that determined vulnerability and modes of coping. Instead, social networks and ownership structures had an important influence on people's ability to recover from past events and prepare for future events.

These organizations differ from businesses and governments by being non-profit, often informal, resource limited, and reliant on volunteer labor. How these organizations facilitate collective action is not well known, especially since they do not necessarily solve common pool resource governance, but rather improve common pool resources through collective action. In fact, at first glance, community groups seem to not have the means for solving collective action problems used routinely in industry and government, such as paying people for cooperation or punishing them for lack of it.This article investigates how community groups solve collective action problems though data gathered across 25 organizations in three sites - Sitka, Alaska, USA; Toco, Trinidad; and a global site of distributed citizen science organizations. We found that community groups used positive reinforcement methods common to industry and used little punishment. Groups also engaged in mechanisms for collective action, such as relying on altruistic contributions by few individuals, that generally are not considered commonplace in businesses and governments. We conclude by discussing implications from this study for collective action theory and for how policymakers might learn from community groups to address climate change.","[Matthews, Luke J.] RAND Corp, 20 Pk Plaza,Suite 920, Boston, MA 02116 USA; [Clark-Ginsberg, Aaron] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA USA; [Scobie, Michelle] Univ WestIndies, Inst Int Relat, St Augustine, Trinidad and To; [Peters, Laura E.

One of Sri Lanka's biggest cities, Kurunegala, is a densely populated city that is gradually turning into an economic revitalization area. This fast-growing city needs to establish an integrated urban plan that takes into account the risks of climate change. Thus, a climate change risk assessment was conducted for both the water and heat wave risks via discussions with key stakeholders. The risk assessment was conducted as a survey based on expert assessment of local conditions, with awareness surveys taken by residents, especially women. The assessment determined that the lack of drinking water was the biggest issue, a problem that has become more serious due to recent droughts caused by climate change and insufficient water management. In addition, the outbreak of diseases caused by heat waves was identified as a serious concern. Risk assessment is integral to developing an action plan for minimizing the damage from climate change. It is necessary to support education and awareness in developing countries so that they can perform risk assessment well and develop both problem-solving and policy-making abilities to adapt to a changing climate.","[Cho, Hanna] Korea Environm Inst, Korea Adaptat Ctr Climate Change, 232 Gareum Ro, Sejong 30121, South Korea",Korea Environment Institute (KEI),"Cho, H (corresponding author), Korea Environm Inst, Korea Adaptat Ctr Climate Change, 232 Gareum Ro, Sejong 30121, South Korea.",hncho@kei.re.kr,,,"Korea Adaptation Center for Climate Change (KACCC) at the Korea Environment Institute (KEI) as part of the Sri Lanka, Technical support for climate smart cities project [2018-115]; Korea Ministry of Science and ICT [NRF-2018M1A2A2080813]","Korea Adaptation Center for Climate Change (KACCC) at the Korea Environment Institute (KEI) as part of the Sri Lanka, Technical support for climate smart cities project; Korea Ministry of Science and ICT(Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)","This study was conducted by the Korea Adaptation Center for Climate Change (KACCC) at the Korea Environment Institute (KEI) as part of the Sri Lanka, Technical support for climate smart cities (2018-115) project.

Increasing global temperatures leave coastal locations in particular, vulnerable to impacts that include rising sea levels and more extreme and variable weather events. Stress can be acute for small coastal communities located in the Circumpolar North, where a lack of capacity and awareness along with institutional constraints, can exacerbate vulnerability. Given that continued climate change is inevitable regardless of the extent of mitigative action, adaptation is a necessity. In northern regions, there is evidence that adaptation planning is occurring in response to observed climate stressors, with structural (or hard) adaptation approaches prevalent across the sensitive coastline. However, structural adaptations are often associated with several drawbacks and may not be suitable, particularly in a region that is facing rapid rates of warming, enhanced exposures, and significant environmental and socioeconomic constraints. To enhance resilience, small northern coastal communities should adopt a diversified portfolio of adaptations that incorporate more sustainable non-structural and ecosystem-based (or soft) adaptation approaches.","[Bonnett, Nicole; Birchall, S.

This study used a Representative Climate Futures (RCF) approach to model projected wheat yields under climate change in Australia. It simulated the range of impacts, resulting from a subset of individual Global Climate Models (GCMs), on wheat production in the major wheat regions of Australia. The study used RCFs that represented 'most-likely', 'best' and 'worst' cases across multiple Representative Concentration pathways (RCPs). Median wheat yields modelled for the South West Australia projected declines between 26% and 38%, under a 'most-likely' case for RCP 4.5 by 2090, and between 41% and 49%, under a 'most-likely' case for RCP 8.5. Median wheat yields declined under RCP 8.5 for the 'most-likely' case across the majority of wheat producing regions, with a range of 1% to 49%. Greater declines were projected under the 'worst' cases of hottest and driest climates. However, the 'best' cases of least warm and wetter climates projected an increase in median wheat yield, a range of 2% to 87%. Variability also changed from the baseline under all projected RCFs and across all regions, with a standard deviation of up to 2.46 t/ha under the 'most likely' case at a site in south-eastern Australia. These likely shifts in the size and reliability of yields, combined with concurrent climate change impacts on other factors, mean that agriculture faces significant adaptation challenges, particularly under some of the 'most-likely' scenarios and all of the 'worst' case scenarios. Further work is required to explore how scenarios in one region relate to those in other regions and thus the overall outcome at the continental scale.","[Taylor, Chris] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sustainable Soc Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Taylor, Chris; D'Occhio, Michael] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [D'Occhio, Michael] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Taylor, Chris; Cullen, Brendan; Eckard, Richard] Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Rickards, Lauren] RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Queensland; University of Sydney; University of Melbourne; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Taylor, C (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",ctaylor@unimelb.edu.au,"; Eckard, Richard/M-9572-2014","Rickards, Lauren/0000-0001-6088-3448; Cullen, Brendan/0000-0003-2327-0946; Eckard, Richard/0000-0002-4817-1517",,,,,48,10,10,6,39,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-521X,1873-2267,,AGR SYST,Agric.

A framework for examining the socioeconomic impacts associated with changes in the long-term availability of water is developed and applied to the hydrologic implications of the Canadian and British Hadley2 general circulation models (GCMs) for the 18 water resource regions in the conterminous United States. The climate projections of these two GCMs have very different implications for future water supplies and costs. The Canadian model suggests most of the nation would be much drier in the year 2030. Under the least-cost management scenario the drier climate could add nearly $105 billion to the estimated costs of balancing supplies and demands relative to the costs without climate change. Measures to protect instream flows and irrigation could result in significantly higher costs. In contrast, projections based on the Hadley model suggest water supplies would increase throughout much of the nation, reducing the costs of balancing water supplies with demands relative to the no-climate change case.","US Geol Survey, Reston, VA 20192 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,,,,"Schwarz, Gregory/0000-0002-9239-4566",,,,,21,22,23,1,12,AMER WATER RESOURCES ASSOC,HERNDON,"950 HERNDON PARKWAY SUITE 300, HERNDON, VA 20170-5531 USA",1093-474X,,,J AM WATER RESOUR AS,J.

This paper investigates the role played by differences in the temporal effectiveness of coastal protection measures in the choice of protection modes. Results from a discrete-choice experiment implemented in Papua New Guinea suggest that respondents have a strong preference for long-term over short-term effectiveness; an urgency to protect cannot be identified. Using incentivized preference measures for patience and risk-aversion as well as sociodemographic controls, we account for taste heterogeneity and validate the robustness of our results.","[Adloff, Susann] Kiel Inst World Econ, Dusternbrooker Weg 148, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Adloff, Susann; Rehdanz, Katrin] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel,"Adloff, S (corresponding author), Kiel Inst World Econ, Dusternbrooker Weg 148, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",susann.adloff@ifw-kiel.de,,,"German Research Foundation (DFG) [SPP 1889, RE 2993/2-1]",German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This research has been funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) under the SPP 1889 'Regional Sea Level Change and Society' (RE 2993/2-1).,,76,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This could mean detrimental impacts to the poor and marginal people in the lower Teesta basin (LTB) in Bangladesh. Though adaptation involves financial costs, the farmers' practicing adaptation in LTB experience diminished crop loss and damage. This study was aimed at assessing the promising adaptation practices, their economic return, and social welfare in the LTB through an extended cost-benefit analysis. The study suggests that among the adaptations, shallow tube-well (STW) based irrigation practice in both sandy and loamy soil has the highest marginal adaptation cost (MAC) but the lowest benefit-cost ratio (BCR). The deep tube-well (DTW) based irrigation practice generates superior benefits to the farmers compared to the STW based farming due to initial establishment by the government which is very expensive. Maize farming as an alternate and less resource consumptive cropping produces nearly five times higher economic benefits than the costs which can be acknowledged as the most profitable and resilient adaptation option in the LTB. Though MAC is relatively low for the short-duration variety (SDV) rice among the promising adaptations, its economic profitability is 62% lower than that of the maize cultivation. However, having higher BCR the maize cultivation generates US$86 higher welfare to the farmers than the SDV rice which may strengthen the farmer's preference of maize cultivation over the SDV rice. It can be stated with high confidence that strategic adaptation planning, soft credit, technological advancement, and subsidized agricultural inputs will encourage the farmers to carry out adaptation options which may reduce climate-induced loss and damages for the farmers and build socio-economic resilience in the LTB and other similar areas of South Asia.","[Arfanuzzaman, Md] Food & Agr Org United Nat, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Hassan, S.

Forest managers, however, find themselves in the increasingly complex planning situation to balance the often conflicting demands in BES. To cope with this situation, a prototype of a decision support system (DSS) for strategic (long-term) planning at the forest enterprise level was developed in the present project. The DSS was applied at three case study enterprises (CSEs) in Northern Switzerland, two lowland and one higher-elevation enterprise, for a 50-year time horizon (2010 to 2060) under present climate and three climate change scenarios ('wet', 'medium', 'dry'). BES provisioning (for biodiversity, timber production, recreation, protection against gravitational hazards and carbon sequestration) was evaluated for four management scenarios (no management, current (BAU), lower and higher management intensity) using a utility-based multi-criteria decision analysis. Additionally, four alternative preference scenarios for BES provisioning were investigated to evaluate the robustness of the results to shifting BES preferences. At all CSEs, synergies between carbon sequestration, biodiversity and protection function as well as trade-offs between carbon sequestration and timber production occurred. The BAU management resulted in the highest overall utility in 2060 for different climate and BES preference scenarios, with the exception of one lowland CSE under current BES preference, where a lower intensity management performed best. Although climate change had a relatively small effect on overall utility, individual BES indicators showed a negative climate change impact for the lowland CSEs and a positive effect for the higher elevation CSE. The patterns of overall utility were relatively stable to shifts in BES preferences, with exception of a shift toward a preference for carbon sequestration. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of the DSS to investigate the development of multiple BES as well as their synergies and trade-offs for a set of lowland and mountainous forest enterprises. The new system incorporates a wide set of BES indicators, a strong empirical foundation and a flexible multi-criteria decision analysis, enabling stakeholders to take scientifically well-founded decisions under changing climatic conditions and political goals.","[Thrippleton, Timothy; Bont, Leo Gallus; Schweier, Janine] WSL Birmensdorf, Sustainable Forestry Forest Resources & Managemen, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Blattert, Clemens] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Boreal Ecosyst Res Grp, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Mey, Reinhard; Zell, Jurgen; Thurig, Esther] WSL Birmensdorf, Resource Anal Forest Resources & Management, Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Jyvaskyla; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Thrippleton, T (corresponding author), WSL Birmensdorf, Sustainable Forestry Forest Resources & Managemen, Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",timothy.thrippleton@wsl.ch,"Thürig, Esther/E-1235-2017","Thürig, Esther/0000-0002-7942-0395; Blattert, Clemens/0000-0003-0892-8666; Mey, Reinhard/0000-0003-3702-0366",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [407340_172372],Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This study was conducted in the framework of the NRP 73 'Sustainable Economy' project SessFor funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF), 407340_172372.",,99,2,2,4,16,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-893X,,FRONT FOR GLOB CHANG,Front.

The region is also known for its ongoing development challenges including those arising from reconstruction in the aftermath of natural disasters. Incepting the idea of climate-resilience in development planning has, therefore, become a necessity in this poverty-ridden region. To identify the strategies that have been envisaged by the stakeholders in terms of climate-resilient development, this paper singled out the stakeholders who are responsible for local-level development in the mid-hill region of Nuwakot which lies in central Nepal. Data was collected through the visioning and back-casting method and included interviews with community members, NGO experts and regional representatives. The study identified the activities and priorities of stakeholders based on different time horizons illustrating climate-resilient development pathways. The study found that community pathways address mostly current needs and climate variability and that future challenges do not play a central role in the selection of adaptation measures. Although a majority of the actors recognized climate-resilient development as a priority, it tends to be planned in silos without cooperation and coordination among themselves. The results reveal that the risks and vulnerabilities encountered by community members, who are at the receiving end of climate change, have not been incorporated into the development plans of the policymakers. The study concludes that development priorities should be formulated based on the identification of a need and proposes that future cooperation mechanisms for stakeholders should be brought under one umbrella and include a discussion of climate resilient development pathways that incorporates more community engagement so as not to lose the connection between country aspirations and community voices.","[Pandey, Avash; Prakash, Anjal] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, Lalitpur, Nepal; [Prakash, Anjal] Indian Sch Business, Hyderabad, India; [Werners, Saskia E.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Werners, Saskia E.] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur, Bonn, Germany",Indian School of Business (ISB); Wageningen University & Research,"Pandey, A (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, Lalitpur, Nepal.",avash.pandey@icimod.org; Anjal_Prakash@isb.edu; saskia.werners@wur.nl,,"Pandey, Avash/0000-0001-6684-4319","Department for International Development, the U.K; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada; International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, Kathmandu, Nepal (ICIMOD); government of Afghanistan; government of Australia; government of Austria; government of Bangladesh; government of Bhutan; government of China; government of India; government of Myanmar; government of Nepal; government of Norway; government of Pakistan; government of Switzerland; government of United Kingdom","Department for International Development, the U.K; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada(CGIAR); International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, Kathmandu, Nepal (ICIMOD); government of Afghanistan; government of Australia; government of Austria; government of Bangladesh; government of Bhutan; government of China; government of India; government of Myanmar; government of Nepal; government of Norway; government of Pakistan; government of Switzerland; government of United Kingdom","This work was carried out by the Himalayan Adaptation, Water and Resilience (HI-AWARE) consortium under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA) with financial support from the Department for International Development, the U.K. and the International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada.

In particular, there is a need to develop adaptation strategies to ensure the resilience of industrial activities to various perturbations that may result from climate change. The inherent complexity of such systems makes decision-making for risk management a non-trivial task that is best facilitated with the aid of mathematical models. Enterprise input-output models have been used extensively to model production systems at different scales. In this work, a fuzzy linear programming enterprise input-output model is developed to determine optimal adjustments in production levels of multi-product systems when a crisis is induced by a loss of resource inputs. The model allows for adjustments that are equitable for different decision-makers that may comprise an industrial complex or a supply chain. Capabilities of the model are illustrated with a case study on the effect of water shortage on an aluminum production system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Tan, R. R.; Aviso, K.

It brings together scholars from diverse schools working on new areas of research and application in urban design and planning. Emergent research agendas include both novel areas of research and important shifts in the direction of a research area. The challenge for planning schools is to reflect critically on these changes and develop long-term research agendas that can better position our field in society and academia, and provide a basis from which to assess our academic programmes. The chapters presented in this issue reinforce key aspects of planning: multi-scale, and multi-faceted, yet integrative in its intent, stressing the physical, yet inescapably social. At the same time, they identify research areas that respond to major social and environmental changes. Blanco and Alberti focus on the latest findings in climate change science and on planning for adaptation; they highlight the opportunities that planners have to provide leadership in this area.

Others demonstrate that disaster response upholds and produces structural inequality. This article examines how existing mitigation and adaptation policies fail to respond to lived conditions of residents and communities on the front lines of environmental change and perpetuate inequality. Based on interviews with residents in the lower bayou communities of Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, and professionals working in the study area, we identified three factors that influence the outcomes of mitigation and relocation initiatives. First, we found that adaptation is a dynamic, ongoing process which can lead to the need for multiple types of assistance for a given property or household over time. Second, program timing and how residents make decisions about whether and how to rebuild or relocate are misaligned. Third, current programs deny resources to frontline communities by creating participation barriers for low- and moderate-income households. The findings affirm the need for more flexible policy guidelines if assistance programs are to transform communities in ways that respond to resident priorities and the realities of environmental change.","[Nelson, Marla] Univ New Orleans, Dept Planning & Urban Studies, New Orleans, LA 70148 USA; [Ehrenfeucht, Renia] Univ New Mexico, Community Reg Planning Dept, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Birch, Traci] Louisiana State Univ, Sch Architecture, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Brand, Anna] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Louisiana System; University of New Orleans; University of New Mexico; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Nelson, M (corresponding author), Univ New Orleans, Dept Planning & Urban Studies, New Orleans, LA 70148 USA.",mnelson@uno.edu,,,Water Institute of the Gulf [2000249131]; Department of the Treasury through the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA)'s Center of Excellence Research Grants Program,Water Institute of the Gulf; Department of the Treasury through the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA)'s Center of Excellence Research Grants Program,"This project was funded by The Water Institute of the Gulf [under project award 2000249131].

A broad repertoire of adaptation actions is needed to adapt to these various hazards. It is therefore important to identify general psychological antecedents that motivate people to engage in many different adaptation actions, in response to different hazards, and in different contexts. We examined if people's climate change perceptions act as such general antecedents. Questionnaire studies in the Netherlands (n = 3,546) and the UK (n = 803) revealed that the more people perceive climate change as real, human-caused, and having negative consequences, the more likely they are to support adaptation policy and to seek information about local climate impacts and ways to adapt. These relationships were stronger and more consistent when the information and policies were introduced as measures to adapt to risks of climate change specifically. However, the three types of climate change perceptions were inconsistently associated with intentions to implement adaptation behaviours (e.g. installing a green roof). This suggests that climate change perceptions can be an important gateway for adaptation actions, especially policy support and information seeking, but that it may be necessary to address additional barriers in order to fully harness the potential of climate change perceptions to promote widespread adaptation behaviour.","[van Valkengoed, A.

An indigenous knowledge reliability index of 0.72 relative to 0.88 for science-based predictors was obtained, implying that both indigenous knowledge and science-based predictors are reliable indicators for forecasting weather. Indigenous knowledge and science-based predictors influence adaptation strategies through the cultivation of indigenous varieties, early or late planting, diversification of crops cultivated and the use of improved crop and drought-tolerant varieties. Governments in sub-Saharan Africa can consider tasking meteorological stations to harness indigenous and science-based predictors in daily forecasts towards adaptation and mitigation strategies.","[Ankrah, Daniel Adu; Kwapong, Nana Afranaa; Boateng, Seth Dankyi] Univ Ghana, Sch Agr, Coll Basic & Appl Sci CBAS, Dept Agr Extens, Accra, Ghana",University of Ghana,"Kwapong, NA (corresponding author), Univ Ghana, Sch Agr, Coll Basic & Appl Sci CBAS, Dept Agr Extens, Accra, Ghana.",nkwapong@ug.edu.gh,"Ankrah, Daniel Adu/ABC-9929-2021","Ankrah, Daniel Adu/0000-0001-9360-0854; Kwapong, Nana Afranaa/0000-0002-0225-6101",,,,,70,7,7,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2042-1338,2042-1346,,AFR J SCI TECHNOL IN,Afr.

This study was conducted in hazard-prone districts, Kurigram (riverbank erosion-prone) and Nilphamari (drought-prone), of the northwest region of Bangladesh to compare farmers' perceptions of CC with meteorological trends, and to examine farm adaptation measures. A total of 252 smallholder households were interviewed. Household survey, key informant interviews, focus group discussions and field observations were carried out to collect the primary data. The findings revealed that farmers' perceptions of CC were consistent with the meteorological trends of the past 30 years (1986-2015) and showed increasing temperature parameters and decreasing rainfall parameters. Farmers perceived negative impacts were increased summer temperature and length of summer days, decreased rainfall intensity, number of rainy days and length of winter days as well as increased intensity of floods, droughts, riverbank erosion and other natural hazards. The farmers also noted significant moderate to high impact of CC on agricultural production. The practiced adaptation strategies were low to medium, and almost all the households applied traditional strategies including compost and manure in their fields and practiced crop rotation as well as homestead gardening to minimize the adverse impact of CC. The study recommends bridging information gaps between the scientific community and farmers about CC adaptation options to meet challenges posed by CC. This study also provides field-based evidence for devising CC mitigation and adaptation policies.","[Roy, Debashis; Datta, Avishek; Kuwornu, John K.

The reinsurance and insurance industries are increasingly cited as sectors that can play a role to help manage risks, by improving disaster risk reduction (DRR) and loss prevention. This paper investigates how the (re)insurance industry could support the transition from a paradigm focused on ex-post responses to ex-ante risk reduction measures including NBS, in line with the Sendai Framework. This paper presents the results of a series of 61 interviews undertaken with the (re)insurance sector and related actors under the EU H2020 Nature Insurance Value Assessment and Demonstration (NAIAD) project. Methods based on a Grounded Theory approach indicate how this sector can play different roles in loss prevention, including ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (eco-DRR). Results illustrate how the (re)insurance industry, under these roles, is gradually innovating by having a better understanding of hazards and mitigation. The findings of the study contribute to wider discussions such as the possibility of new arrangements like natural insurance schemes and evidence-based assessment of avoided damage costs from green protective measures, in Europe and beyond.","[Marchal, Roxane; Moncoulon, David] Caisse Cent Reassurance, Dept R&D, Cat & Agr Modelling, 157 Blvd Haussmann, F-75008 Paris, France; [Marchal, Roxane; Piton, Guillaume; Tacnet, Jean-Marc] Univ Grenoble Alpes, IRSTEA, Ctr Grenoble, UR ETNA, 2 Rue Papeterie, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Lopez-Gunn, Elena; Zorrilla-Miras, Pedro] I Catalist, C Borni 20, Madrid 28232, Spain; [van der Keur, Peter] Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland GEUS, Dept Hydrol, Oster Voldgade 10, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Dartee, Kieran W.

With increased concerns regarding climate change and environmental water demand, system managers and irrigators are being forced to consider deficit-irrigation options. This study illustrates the potentials of deficit irrigation as an effective adaptive response to climate change and environmental water demand in achieving efficiency gains, water saving and maximizing benefits that could be achieved at system level. We compared three scenarios: optimization with full irrigation, optimization with deficit irrigation and deficit irrigation without optimization. A non-linear optimization model, which uses crop production function and profit functions endogenously, was used to evaluate the potential of deficit irrigation. The results show that optimization with deficit irrigation could result in both environmental flows and maximizing net returns objectives, increase overall water use efficiency, and therefore offer an effective adaptive response against climate change. We envisage deficit irrigation could be used as a cost-effective adaptive response for meeting climate and environmental objectives. Water saved through deficit irrigation could be used to restore environmental balance through augmenting environmental flows. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the ways to protect people from this hazard is the use of urban green or street greenery. However, its implementation can be problematic in highly urbanized areas. This paper presents a concept of the green structure (GS), designed, and is still being developed, by Adam Kalinowski where cooling efficiency is based on the synergy of shade and evapotranspiration. The GS that could be used as street furniture, small architecture form or a public utility structure intended to protect people and objects from an adverse urban environment, at the same time providing pleasant and healthy microclimate inside. The pilot project-the first application of the GS in the urban environment-is presented and the results of short-term measurements of temperature and humidity are provided and analyzed. Moreover, a simple dynamic simulation of the GS performance in courtyards has been conducted. The obtained results show the decrease of the perceived temperature within this structure. Depending on climate type, an average potential reduction of Universal Thermal Comfort Index (UTCI) and mean radiant temperature (T-mrt), caused by the GS in a courtyard case study, is 5-8 degrees C and 17-29 degrees C, respectively. Performed simulation also confirms that TRNSYS software is an appropriate tool for simple outdoor microclimate analysis. Further research to develop this concept, increase its performance and customize it for different applications are proposed.","[Bandurski, Karol; Koczyk, Halina] Poznan Univ Tech, Fac Environm Engn & Energy, Inst Environm Engn & Bldg Installat, Berdychowo 4, PL-60965 Poznan, Poland; [Bandurska, Hanna] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Plant Physiol, Wolynska 35, PL-60965 Poznan, Poland; [Kazimierczak-Grygiel, Ewa] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Bot Garden, Dabrowskiego 165, PL-60594 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Technology; Poznan University of Life Sciences; Adam Mickiewicz University,"Bandurski, K (corresponding author), Poznan Univ Tech, Fac Environm Engn & Energy, Inst Environm Engn & Bldg Installat, Berdychowo 4, PL-60965 Poznan, Poland.",karol.bandurski@put.poznan.pl; hanna.bandurska@up.poznan.pl; ewakg@amu.edu.pl; halina.koczyk@put.poznan.pl,"Bandurski, Karol/F-8685-2014","Bandurska, Hanna Zofia/0000-0003-4424-7614; Bandurski, Karol/0000-0001-8578-7233","Poznan University of Technology [01/13/DSMK/0863, 504101/0713/SBAD/0910]",Poznan University of Technology,"This study was co-funded by a grants number 01/13/DSMK/0863 and 504101/0713/SBAD/0910, awarded by Poznan University of Technology.",,86,5,5,8,48,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,JUN,2020,13,11,,,,,,,2755,10.3390/en13112755,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en13112755,,,24,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Energy & Fuels,MF5SF,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000545401100082,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data analytics are essential for achieving this goal, especially the so-called science of enviromics (large-scale environmental characterization of crop growing conditions) that could be used to pinpoint the relevant environment impacts driving the adaptation of a certain specie in a breeding framework. Here we quantified the effects of diverse climate factors on the current adaptation of elite common bean germplasm in Brazil. To capture the non-linearity of those impacts across a wide range of environments, we developed an enviromic prediction approach by combining Generalized Additive Models (GAM), environmental covariates (EC), and grain yield (GY) from 18 years of historical breeding trials. Then, we predicted the optimum limits for ECs at each production scenario (four regions, three seasons, and two grain types) and its respective predictions of GY adaptation. Our results indicate that the nonlinear influence of air temperature, solar radiation, and rainfall led to a huge interaction of the impacts among the development stages, seasons, and regions. This revealed that seasonality differently affected the vegetative and reproductive stages, which its impact drastically vary according to the region and season, which makes unfeasible the development of a breeding strategy for selecting for broad adaptation. Conversely, with our approach it was possible to pinpoint the effects of the region- or season-specific impacts, which helped identify the climate limits and critical development phases for each possible production scenario. This could allow breeders to design crop ideotypes while directing efforts to develop climate-smart varieties. Furthermore, enviromics prediction is a cost-effective way to use EC as a data analytics tool to support the visualization of regional breeding gaps for specific growing conditions.","[Heinemann, Alexandre Bryan] Embrapa Arroz & Feijao, Rodovia GO-462 Km 12 Zona Rural, BR-75375000 Santo Antonio De Goias, Go, Brazil; [Costa-Neto, Germano] Cornell Univ, Inst Genom Div, Ithaca, NY USA; [Fritsche-Neto, Roberto] Univ Sao Paulo, ESALQ, Dept Genet, Ave P adua Dias,11 Agron, BR-13418260 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Fritsche-Neto, Roberto] Int Rice Res Inst, Breeding Analyt & Data Management Unit, Pili Dr, Los Banos, Laguna, Philippines; [da Matta, David Henriques; Fernandes, Igor Kuivjogi] Fed Univ Goias UFG, Inst Math & Stat IME, S-N Inst Matemat & Estat Samambaia Goiania,Campus, BR-74001970 Esperanca, Go, Brazil",Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA); Cornell University; Universidade de Sao Paulo; CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI),"Heinemann, AB (corresponding author), Embrapa Arroz & Feijao, Rodovia GO-462 Km 12 Zona Rural, BR-75375000 Santo Antonio De Goias, Go, Brazil.",alexandre.heinemann@embrapa.br; gmc222@cornell.edu; r.fritscheneto@irri.org; dhmatta@ufg.br; igorkuivjogi@hotmail.com,,"Matta, David/0000-0003-0199-2075; Kuivjogi Fernandes, Igor/0000-0002-1634-9173","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Goias (FAPEG), Brazil; PRONEM/FAPEG/CNPq; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Brazil [408025/2018-2-408025/2018-2]","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Goias (FAPEG), Brazil; PRONEM/FAPEG/CNPq; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Brazil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ))","AB Heinemann acknowledges support from Fundacao de Amparo `a Pesquisa do Estado de Goias (FAPEG), Brazil, PRONEM/FAPEG/CNPq and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Brazil, Edital Universal-408025/2018-2-408025/2018-2.",,60,1,1,2,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-4290,1872-6852,,FIELD CROP RES,Field Crop.

Yet, critical notions that underpin vulnerability have yet to be integrated into its application to natural resource management and non-climatic stressors. In particular, the way generic and stressor-specific facets of vulnerability interact and can inform decision-makers about how interventions combine and/or trade-off remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the salience of the generic/specific framing in the context of Chilean artisanal fishing communities engaged in rights-based co-management and experiencing pressures from two stressors: poaching and market volatility. Specifically, we draw on market data combined with socio-economic surveys conducted with 446 members and leaders from 42 fisher unions to quantitatively investigate potential trade-offs and synergies between facets of vulnerability to poaching and markets. Generic adaptive capacity (i.e. flexibility, assets, learning, organization and agency) likely facilitated stressor-specific adaptive capacities to both stressors. High levels of specific adaptive capacity to one stressor neither increased exposure nor undermined specific adaptive capacity to the other stressor. However, adaptive capacity did not translate into exposure reduction as expected, suggesting that adaptation barriers may prevent fishers from mobilizing adaptive capacity into effective adaptive action. This study illustrates how breaking down vulnerability into generic and specific facets can help us better anticipate important trade-offs and synergies in management interventions. More generally, it highlights the potential of the climate adaptation and vulnerability literatures in informing place-based management of natural resources.

Resumen El concepto de vulnerabilidad -visto como la combinacion entre exposicion, sensitividad y capacidad adaptativa- esta ganando importancia en nuevas esferas ademas del cambio climatico. Esto abre oportunidades para investigar problemas de sustentabilidad de manera mas holistica. Sin embargo, aun queda por integrar conceptos fundacionales de vulnerabilidad en aplicaciones relacionadas a manejo de recursos naturales y estresores no climaticos. Particularmente, no se ha explorado la forma en que facetas genericas de vulnerabilidad o aquellas especificas a un estresor interactuan entre si. En este estudio, investigamos la importancia de facetas genericas y/o especificas de vulnerabilidad en el contexto de organizaciones de pescadores artesanales en Chile que participan en un sistema de co-manejo. Se aborda la exposicion a dos estresores: robos (pesca illegal) y volatilidad de mercados. Especificamente, usamos datos sobre mercados combinados con encuestas socioeconomicas realizadas a 446 pescadores y dirigentes de 42 organizaciones de pescadores para explorar de manera cuantitativa potenciales trade-offs y sinergias entre componentes de vulnerabilidad a robos y a la vulnerabilidad del mercado. La capacidad adaptativa generica (ej. flexibilidad, bienes, aprendizaje, organizacion y agencia) parece haber facilitado la capacidad adaptativa especifica a cada estresor. Sin embargo, altos niveles de capacidad adaptativa especifica a un estresor no incrementan la exposicion ni afectan la capacidad adaptativa especifica al otro estresor. Contrario a las expectativas, mayor capacidad adaptativa no se manifiesta en una menor exposicion. Esto sugiere que existen posibles barreras evitando que pescadores movilicen su capacidad adaptativa hacia acciones concretas. Este estudio ilustra como la descomposicion de la vulnerabilidad en componentes genericos y especificos puede ayudarnos a anticipar sinergias y trade-offs que pueden ser claves en intervenciones de manejo. A modo general, esto remarca el potencial de utilizar aproximaciones basadas en adaptacion y vulnerabilidad climatica en informar el manejo local de recursos naturales.

Sea-level rise is a dynamic and uncertain process, which is deeply uncertain towards the latter part of this century and beyond. Communities require decision making approaches that can enable adjustments to policies ahead of damage, without entrenching current exposure to hazards or incurring larger than necessary adjustment costs in the future. We first discuss the nature of the sea-level problem, the policy context that creates decision-making challenges and how they have been typically addressed through policy and practice. Secondly, we show how an assessment and planning approach, designed to address uncertainty and change (the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) planning approach), has been integrated into national guidance for coastal hazard and climate change decision making in New Zealand. The Guidance integrates hazard and sea-level rise assessments with uncertainty type and with the scale and scope of activity. It is underpinned with values-based community engagement, and uses signals and decision triggers for monitoring and adjusting pathways to meet objectives over time. The applicability of the approach in the Guidance for other policy problems involving uncertainty, is also discussed.","[Lawrence, Judy] Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Climate Change Res Inst, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Bell, Rob; Blackett, Paula; Stephens, Scott] NIWA, POB 11115, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Allan, Sylvia] Allan Planning & Res Ltd, 26 Patrick S4, Lower Hutt, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington; National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand,"Lawrence, J (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Climate Change Res Inst, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",judy.lawrence@vuw.ac.nz; rob.bell@niwa.co.nz; paula.blackett@niwa.co.nz; scott.stephens@niwa.co.nz; sylvia.allan@ihug.co.nz,"Lawrence, Judy/W-9823-2019","Lawrence, Judy/0000-0001-6798-3636; Bell, Robert/0000-0002-8490-8942","Ministry for the Environment, New Zealand; Sea-level Change project in the NIWA Strategic Science Investment Fund [CAVA1804]; Deep South National Science Challenge","Ministry for the Environment, New Zealand; Sea-level Change project in the NIWA Strategic Science Investment Fund; Deep South National Science Challenge","All authors were funded by the Ministry for the Environment, New Zealand, to revise the Coastal Hazard Guidance, based on their respective expertise.

Adopting a cognitive model to gain such insights we conclude that individual's belief in their own abilities to manage water stress play a crucial role in driving intentions to adapt and therefore greater attention needs to be placed on understanding the underling drivers shaping such beliefs.

Given the significant impact that climate change will have on this country, as well as its climatic variety, the proposed methodology can be used as a reference in other regions. Updating of the climate zones of peninsular Spain for 49 cities has been carried out, through the adaptation of these zones to the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The results show that two-thirds of these cities are currently designing and constructing buildings with obsolescent climate data that do not take into account the current or future climate reality, which is significantly affecting previous calculations on the thermal performance of buildings.

However, many of the implied smart windows that have been studied to date respond to only one stimulus, but studies on dual-responsive smart windows have been increasing. The growing interest in multi-responsive smart windows is due to the many opportunities in terms of utility and activity that they offer. Herein, our group has adopted a strategy to combine the thermo- and electro-chromic as well as electrolyte properties in one single molecule. Dual-responsive poly (ionic liquid) (PIL) 6 based electrolyte was synthesized via radical polymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) with N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) with viologen based electroactive monomer utilizing AIBN as an initiator in DMSO. One single molecule (all-in-one) single-layer device consisting of ITO/smart PIL/ ITO was assembled on a glass substrate, that can enhance its optical efficiency and characteristics of phase shift. The proposed electrochromic device exhibits tunable transparency and electrochromic properties due to the thermo-responsive property of PNIPAM and the bistable electrochromic property of a viologen-based electroactive monomer, respectively. Consequently, the acquired dual-responsive properties of smart PIL 6 for the development of bistability smart windows can not only control solar energy input but can also provide a more comfortable color tone to boost people's feelings and emotions in indoor environments.","[Rathod, Pramod V.; Puguan, John Marc C.; Kim, Hern] Myongji Univ, Environm Waste Recycle Inst, Dept Energy Sci & Technol, Yongin 17058, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Myongji University,"Puguan, JMC; Kim, H (corresponding author), Myongji Univ, Environm Waste Recycle Inst, Dept Energy Sci & Technol, Yongin 17058, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",jmpuguan@gmail.com; hernkim@mju.ac.kr,,,"National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Education [2020R1A6A1A03038817, 2019R1F1A1058732]; Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) [2020R1A2C2101759]; Korea Institute of Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) - Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE), Republic of Korea [20194010201750]","National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Education(National Research Foundation of Korea); Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)(Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); Korea Institute of Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) - Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE), Republic of Korea(Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE), Republic of KoreaKorea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation & Planning (KETEP))","This study was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (2020R1A6A1A03038817; 2019R1F1A1058732) and the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) (2020R1A2C2101759) , and by the Korea Institute of Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE No. 20194010201750) , Republic of Korea.",,57,20,20,23,146,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",1385-8947,1873-3212,,CHEM ENG J,Chem.

Among NBS, green roofs have an important role in temperature regulation in buildings and in lowering the damaging effects of heatwaves on human health. In this paper a spatial microsimulation model is implemented to simulate temperature impacts of green roofs installations in cities and their capacity to attenuate the effects of heatwave episodes. Particularly vulnerable to heatwaves are elderly people with limited mobility, who have limited means to seek cooling and create cooler indoor environments. The model, implemented using the Netlogo platform (version 6.0.4), considers as agents the elderly citizens in a city area and simulates the heatwave-related health impacts, which are measured in mortality likelihood. In particular, the model simulates a generalised 1.5 degrees C to 3 degrees C indoor temperature reduction range induced by green roofs (based on inferences from green roof literature) in four different European cities: Szeged (Hungary), Alcal'a de Henares (Spain), Metropolitan City of Milan (Italy) and Cankaya municipality (Turkey). The simulation utilises a ceteris paribus modelling approach, meaning that the relationships of the observed phenomenon (mortality induced by heatwaves) with other possible influencing factors (e.g. level of sport and physical activities practiced by people) are not taken into account. In the case of Szeged, Alcal'a de Henares, and Cankaya municipality a substantial reduction in mortality is found to occur associated with green roofs roll out. In the case of the Metropolitan city of Milan, green roofs installations show a low mitigation effect in some scenarios. The underlying factor is the temperature threshold parameter of the model, above which heatwave mortality occurs. This parameter was inferred from the literature (Baccini M., et al., 2008) and it resulted to be substantially higher in the Metropolitan city of Milan (31.8 degrees C) than in the other cities. The simulation helps in obtaining results which are specific to a given city and particular scenarios therein, and provides additional insights, such as expected temperature mitigation effect induced by green roofs under climate change conditions, or the indoor temperature reduction targets that are needed for a particular city to have a maximum desired heatwave mitigation impact.

This systematic review considered evidence linking green building strategies in the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (R) (LEED) Rating System with the potential to reduce negative health outcomes following exposure to urban flooding events. Queries evaluated links between LEED credit requirements and risk of exposure to urban flooding, environmental determinants of health, co-benefits to public health outcomes, and co-benefits to built environment outcomes. Public health co-benefits to leveraging green building design to enhance flooding resilience included: improving the interface between humans and wildlife and reducing the risk of waterborne disease, flood-related morbidity and mortality, and psychological harm. We conclude that collaborations among the public health, climate change, civil society, and green building sectors to enhance community resilience to urban flooding could benefit population health.","[Houghton, Adele] Biositu LLC, 505D W Alabama St, Houston, TX 77006 USA; [Castillo-Salgado, Carlos] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, 615 N Wolfe St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,"Houghton, A (corresponding author), Biositu LLC, 505D W Alabama St, Houston, TX 77006 USA.",adeleh@biositu.com; ccastil3@jhu.edu,,"Houghton, Adele/0000-0002-6861-1591","Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Office of Public Health Practice and Training (Lipitz Public Health Policy grant)","Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Office of Public Health Practice and Training (Lipitz Public Health Policy grant)","This work was supported by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Office of Public Health Practice and Training (Lipitz Public Health Policy grant).

We collected household level data to understand grass-root perspectives on climate variability, impacts and barriers to adaptation in two different districts; Moga, Punjab and Mahbubnagar, Telangana. Further the study uses meteorological data to validate farmers perceptions. The results show that change in the quantum and distribution of rainfall, rising temperature, ground water depletion, lower farm income, higher unemployment and rural migration are some of the major impacts of climate change. Moreover, farmers perceptions on climate variability were consistent with the observed climate trend. Against climatic variations farmers were making shift to crop varieties of suitable duration, curtailing expenditure, borrowing and participating in employment guarantee schemes. However, farmers responses were constrained by barriers like lack of accessibility to weather information, limited knowledge on the cost-benefit of adaptation, inaccessibility to climate smart technologies, inadequate financial resources and unawareness on welfare schemes. The study concludes there is a need to reorient the developmental programmes at the macro-level considering micro-level needs and constraints for climate resilient agriculture.","[Singh, Naveen P.; Anand, Bhawna; Khan, Mohd Arshad] ICAR Res Complex, Natl Inst Agr Econ & Policy Res, New Delhi 110012, India",Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - National Institute of Agricultural Economics & Policy Research,"Singh, NP (corresponding author), ICAR Res Complex, Natl Inst Agr Econ & Policy Res, New Delhi 110012, India.",naveenpsingh@gmail.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; NIAP, LIBRARY ICAR/ABB-6258-2020; Khan, Mohd Arshad/AAO-5674-2021","Khan, Mohd Arshad/0000-0002-7952-4565",,,,,21,2,2,0,3,NATL INST SCIENCE COMMUNICATION-NISCAIR,NEW DELHI,"DR K S KRISHNAN MARG, PUSA CAMPUS, NEW DELHI 110 012, INDIA",0972-5938,0975-1068,,INDIAN J TRADIT KNOW,Indian J.

One is the high demand for cooling and heating, especially the cooling requirement in summer; the other is the intermittent energy use mode, which depends on whether people are at home. Over recent decades, the average environmental temperature has risen continually, and thus the building cooling load has increased significantly. At present, technological approaches to the building envelope are based on the continuous energy use mode, which needs to be optimised to fit in with local climate characteristics and energy use habits. The orthogonal analysis method is used to optimise the index values of the building envelope capacity by using energy consumption simulation, and experiments are performed to verify a suitable way of using thermal insulation layers to insulate the envelope structure. From the results, it is concluded that thermal reaction rate can be used as a factor to judge the performance of different thermal insulation types. Under an intermittent energy use mode, interior thermal insulation has a higher thermal reaction rate and lower energy consumption. In order to conserve energy, different combinations of envelope index levels are proposed for heating and cooling modes. After building with this optimised energy technology approach, it is expected that thermal comfort can be achieved with a relatively low level of energy use.","[Pan, Li; Xu, Qiang; Nie, Yue; Qiu, Tong] Shanghai Res Inst Bldg Sci, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China",,"Pan, L (corresponding author), Shanghai Res Inst Bldg Sci, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.",panli@sribs.com.cn,,,China National Key R&D Program Solutions to heating and cooling of buildings in the Yangtze River region [2016YFC0700302],China National Key R&D Program Solutions to heating and cooling of buildings in the Yangtze River region,This work was supported by the China National Key R&D Program Solutions to heating and cooling of buildings in the Yangtze River region (Grant no. 2016YFC0700302).,,23,21,21,0,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-7102,,,J BUILD ENG,J.

The solar water pumping systems (SWPS) could be an attractive option in view of climate change impacts, increasing diesel costs and grid electricity scarcity that the country suffers. However, due to high initial cost SWPS, population mainly uses diesel water pumps (DWPs). The main objective of this study is to assess the potential of microfinanced SWPS for irrigation in rural areas of Burkina Faso.MethodsBased on ground data collection and profitability analysis, this study investigates the best SWPS market segments for irrigation in rural areas of Burkina Faso. The case study of the village of Korsimoro was considered. Especially, the study is focused on the onion crop as it is the most cultivated crop in the area of study.ResultsIt was found that there are three main SWPS market segments in the area of study: market segment 1 which is that of farmers individually owning and using a DWP with rated power between 1.5 and 3kW, market segment 2 which is composed of farmers individually owning a DWP of rated power ranging from 4 to 7.5kW and market segment 3 which is that of farmers paying for pumping services offered by a pump owner in market segment 2. The study revealed that replacing polyvinyl chloride (PVC) water storage tank by DWPs to be used on cloudy days is profitable for all the market segments. The study showed also that at 9.5% interest charged on agricultural equipment, only SWPS for the market segments 2 and 3 can be fully financed through microloan without risk of long payback period.ConclusionsThe results imply that more attention should be given to SWPS in the context of rural areas of Burkina Faso to enhance the productive use of energy and also mitigate the impacts of climate change on the environment. In addition, the study provides detailed information to farmers about how they can make more profitable their activities.","[Yamegueu, Daniel] Int Inst Water & Environm Engn 2iE, Dept Elect Ind & Energy Engn, Renewable Energies & Energy Efficiency Lab, Rue Sci 01,BP 594, Ouagadougou 01, Burkina Faso; [Alokore, Yunus] Viva Energy Int Ltd, Plot 31 Pakwach Rd,POB 460, Arua, Uganda; [Corso, Giulia] Microenergy Int Gmbh, Potsdamer Str 143, D-10783 Berlin, Germany",,"Yamegueu, D (corresponding author), Int Inst Water & Environm Engn 2iE, Dept Elect Ind & Energy Engn, Renewable Energies & Energy Efficiency Lab, Rue Sci 01,BP 594, Ouagadougou 01, Burkina Faso.",daniel.yamegueu@2ie-edu.org,,"YAMEGUEU, Daniel/0000-0002-1789-8377",German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF),German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This work was supported by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in the framework of the Mikroklima West Africa Project.,,32,5,5,3,13,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2192-0567,,,ENERGY SUSTAIN SOC,Energy Sustain.

Nevertheless, few studies have examined the influence of flood events on individual well-being and how such impacts may be limited by flood protection measures. This study estimates the long term impacts on individual subjective well-being of flood experiences, individual subjective flood risk perceptions, and household flood preparedness decisions. These effects are monetised and placed in context through a comparison with impacts of other adverse events on well-being. We collected data from households in flood-prone areas in France. The results indicate that experiencing a flood has a large negative impact on subjective well-being that is incompletely attenuated over time. Moreover, individuals do not need to be directly affected by floods to suffer SWB losses since subjective well-being is lower for those who expect their flood risk to increase or who have seen a neighbour being flooded. Floodplain inhabitants who prepared for flooding by elevating their home have a higher subjective well-being. A monetisation of the aforementioned well-being impacts shows that a flood requires Euro150,000 in immediate compensation to attenuate SWB losses. The decomposition of the monetised impacts of flood experience into tangible losses and intangible effects on SWB shows that intangible effects are about twice as large as the tangible direct monetary flood losses. Investments in flood protection infrastructure may be under funded if the intangible SWB benefits of flood protection are not taken into account.","[Hudson, Paul] Potsdam Univ, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, Potsdam, Germany; [Botzen, W.

To avoid extirpation, corals must adapt. Individual variation in heat tolerance and its heritability underpin the potential for coral adaptation. However, the magnitude of heat tolerance variability within coral populations is largely unresolved. We address this knowledge gap by exposing corals from a single reef to an experimental marine heatwave. We found that double the heat stress dosage was required to induce bleaching in the most-tolerant 10%, compared to the least-tolerant 10% of the population. By the end of the heat stress exposure, all of the least-tolerant corals were dead, whereas the most-tolerant remained alive. To contextualize the scale of this result over the coming century, we show that under an ambitious future emissions scenario, such differences in coral heat tolerance thresholds equate to up to 17 years delay until the onset of annual bleaching and mortality conditions. However, this delay is limited to only 10 years under a high emissions scenario. Our results show substantial variability in coral heat tolerance which suggests scope for natural or assisted evolution to limit the impacts of climate change in the short-term. For coral reefs to persist through the coming century, coral adaptation must keep pace with ocean warming, and ambitious emissions reductions must be realized.","[Humanes, Adriana; Lachs, Liam; Beauchamp, Elizabeth A.; Bythell, John C.; Edwards, Alasdair J.; Martinez, Helios M.; Palmowski, Pawel; Treumann, Achim; van der Steeg, Eveline; Guest, James R.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne, England; [Golbuu, Yimnang] Palau Int Coral Reef Ctr, Koror, Palau; [van Hooidonk, Ruben] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [van Hooidonk, Ruben] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA",Newcastle University - UK; University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML),"Humanes, A (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne, England.",adrihumanes@gmail.com,"Bythell, John/ABE-6138-2021; Beauchamp, Elizabeth/HKE-8016-2023; Lachs, Liam/AAK-5872-2021","Bythell, John/0000-0003-2416-9786; Beauchamp, Elizabeth/0000-0002-2356-6774; Lachs, Liam/0000-0003-3712-6144; van der Steeg, Eveline/0000-0002-9768-7472; Golbuu, Yimnang/0000-0001-8621-7742; Treumann, Achim/0000-0002-9417-3505; Palmowski, Pawel/0000-0001-9163-9560; Guest, James/0000-0002-9714-9009",,,,,77,2,2,20,26,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Despite their apparent significance in policy processes, such tactics are often neither planned for nor well reported in resilience-building projects and programme documents.

This research presents a case study of coastal and environment management systems in two important coastal regions: an urbanized area of the central coast of California, United States; and the rapidly urbanizing and developing coastal lowlands of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Similarities and differences in coastal environmental governance, management, and outcomes were identified and analyzed. The contrasting federalist governance structures are compared, and the coastal management and environment assessment systems in the case study locations are analyzed. This research contributes to the body of knowledge on subnational coastal environmental management systems through the review of previous relevant studies; the examination of historical primary and secondary source official reports; and the collection, analysis, and discussion of important qualitative and quantitative interviews and survey data. The study concludes that transparency and accessibility to the decision-making process are essential to the success of coastal environmental management in both locations, with benefits arising from the presence of public participation and trust. The successful integration of broad stakeholders and public awareness in California provides an example that could possibly be replicable in Rio de Janeiro to increase stakeholder participation in the decision-making processes. The paper concludes with recommendations for further studies of governance and management alternatives, and for extending and strengthening state and local capabilities of coastal environmental processes within integrated coastal environmental management systems.","[Obraczka, Marcelo] Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, Sanit & Environm Engn Dept, BR-20550 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Beyeler, Marc] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Div Social Sci, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Magrini, Alessandra; Legey, Luiz Fernando] Fed Univ Rio de Janeiro UFRJ, Environm & Energy Planning Program, BR-21949 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Obraczka, M (corresponding author), Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, Sanit & Environm Engn Dept, BR-20550 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",marcelobraczka@gmail.com,"Magrini, Alessandra/AAF-3732-2019","Magrini, Alessandra/0000-0002-3006-6743",CAPES Foundation in Brazil,CAPES Foundation in Brazil(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"The authors are grateful to the CAPES Foundation in Brazil for funding a visiting research in the Environmental Studies Department of the University of California, Santa Cruz, during 2012, where the research design was formulated and initiated.

We find a robustly larger sensitivity of PE to aerosols than GHGs across all available models. The aerosol/GHG-induced sensitivity ratios for globe-averaged monthly maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation (RX5day) and maximum 1-day precipitation (RX1day) in the multimodel ensemble are 1.6 and 1.4, respectively. Over land, the corresponding ratios for RX5day and RX1day are 2.3 and 1.8, respectively. In particular, the aerosol forcing leads to several times greater sensitivity than GHG forcing in West Africa, eastern China, South and Southeast Asia, northwestern South America, and Eastern Europe. The atmospheric energy balance, dynamical adjustment, and vertical structure of forcing, all contribute to the difference in the PE sensitivity to the two forcings. It is shown that the fast response primarily contributes to the greater-than-one aerosol-to-GHG ratios of the PE sensitivities, as for the mean precipitation. This is because of a stronger rainfall suppression effect induced by the GHG atmospheric forcing. We also find that the aerosol-to-GHG ratios of the PE sensitivities depend on the defined extreme precipitation indices. The aerosol-to-GHG sensitivity ratio is larger for more loosely defined PE, and it gradually converges to one for more severely defined PE. Our results further highlight the importance of considering the anthropogenic aerosol reduction in projecting the change in PE. Plain Language Summary Precipitation extreme (PE) has wide-ranging societal impacts. Warming caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) increases primarily contributes to the increase in PE during recent decades. To mitigate the air pollution, the expected declines of anthropogenic aerosols in the 21st century would impose an additional warming on the Earth, which will aggravate the PE caused by GHGs-induced warming. The ultimate response of PE is thus related to the strength of various forcing agents, and the sensitivity of PE to various forcing agents. We show whether the difference in the PE sensitivity between GHGs and aerosols is robust across models and what mechanisms lead to the difference. A robustly larger sensitivity of PE to aerosols than GHGs across all available models is found. This sensitivity difference is primarily associated with the fast response of PE to various forcings. This study further highlights the importance of considering the anthropogenic aerosol reduction in projecting the change in PE. It has implications for policy making on climate adaptation to PE.

We use two future scenarios - the IPCC SRES A1B scenario, and a climate stabilisation scenario (2C20), allowing us to assess the impact of climate mitigation on results. We performed a pair of simulations under each scenario - one in which vegetation was fixed at the initial state and one in which vegetation changes dynamically in response to climate change, as determined by the interactive vegetation model within HadCM3C. In our simulations with interactive vegetation, relatively small changes in global vegetation coverage were found, mainly dominated by increases in shrub and needleleaf trees at high latitudes and losses of broadleaf trees and grasses across the Amazon. Globally this led to a loss of terrestrial carbon, mainly from the soil. Global changes in carbon storage were related to the regional losses from the Amazon and gains at high latitude. Regional differences in carbon storage between the two scenarios were largely driven by the balance between warming-enhanced decomposition and altered vegetation growth. Globally, interactive vegetation reduced albedo acting to enhance albedo changes due to climate change. This was mainly related to the darker land surface over high latitudes (due to vegetation expansion, particularly during December-January and March-May); small increases in albedo occurred over the Amazon. As a result, there was a relatively small impact of vegetation change on most global annual mean climate variables, which was generally greater under A1B than 2C20, with markedly stronger local-to-regional and seasonal impacts. Globally, vegetation change amplified future annual temperature increases by 0.24 and 0.15K (under A1B and 2C20, respectively) and increased global precipitation, with reductions in precipitation over the Amazon and increases over high latitudes. In general, changes were stronger over land - for example, global temperature changes due to interactive vegetation of 0.43 and 0.28K under A1B and 2C20, respectively. Regionally, the warming influence of future vegetation change in our simulations was driven by the balance between driving factors. For instance, reduced tree cover over the Amazon reduced evaporation (particularly during June-August), outweighing the cooling influence of any small albedo changes. In contrast, at high latitudes the warming impact of reduced albedo (particularly during December-February and March-May) due to increased vegetation cover appears to have offset any cooling due to small evaporation increases. Climate mitigation generally reduced the impact of vegetation change on future global and regional climate in our simulations. Our study therefore suggests that there is a need to consider both biogeochemical and biophysical effects in climate adaptation and mitigation decision making.","[Falloon, P.

These plots belong to terraces of the left bank of the Tam river which coincides with one of the three main terroirs of the AOC area. Precisely, the analysed plots are localised on the rissian-aged (approximate to 200 000 yrs B.P.) terrace composed of alluvial shelves crosscut by small valleys where the Oligocen (ca. 28 My) marly molassic basement outcrops. Three different Basic Terroir Units (BTU) have been identified : terrace shelf. terrace slope and comb. Each of them has specific viticultural potentialities related to its topographical, geological and pedological characteristics. Representative profiles have been analysed in each BTU. Field analysis has evidenced that all rocks material have derived from Rissian alluvial deposits due to solifluxion processes when part of the alluvial material deposited on the terrace shelf has slept onto the slope overlying the marly Olicocen molassic basement. This solifluxion phase has taken place during the late-glacial Wurmian climatic oscillations interval (Bollering-Alerod episode ca. 12,000 years BP). Afterwards, during the Holocene period (i.e. the last 10,000 years) the alluvial-derived material has suffered pedolgenetic alteration. The nature of the resulting alterites depends on the initial topographic situation inherited from the late-Wurmian solifluxion phase. On to the terrace shelf the soil sequence begins by a reddish clayey horizon (up to 0, 6m) because of the erosion of the eluvial horizon during the last 10,000 years. It is followed by a thick (= 1 m average) reddish coarse-pebble horizon rich in clays and iron oxydes. On the terrace slope, characteristics luvisols have developped composed by an eluvial silty-sandy horizon (up to 0.60 m) overlying an illuvial pebble-sand level (up to 3m) where clays and ferrous oxydes are moderatly accumulated. Finaly, the thick (> 2m) dark silts and clays sequence (with scattered gravels and small pebbles) of the comb derive from the deposition of eroded soil material of the above terrace shelf and slope units (colluvium). On the basis of the role of high qualitative limiting factor played by the water stress parameter such as quality of drainage, permeability of soils, the down-side slope terrace unit appears as the most appropriate unit because of its slope gradient combined with the occurrence of a thick permeable pebble-sand sequence. Finally, combination of physical and chemical results - acidic pH and very low CEC - permits to recommand the Gravesac rootstock adapted to well-drained acidic soils and Syrah/Fer Servadou climatic-adapted grapevine varieties as the most suitable vegetative material. In addition, the knowledge of the geological component at the scale or the basic units allows for the adaptation of some cultural practices in order to enhance the viticultural potentialities of the plots. In order to encourage the vine's roots to dig deep and reach the sandy-pebbles horizon, two cultural possibilities are proposed: inter-row grassing associated with the << inter-plant >> method or earthing down under the row associated with inter-row ploughing. The choice will depends on the soil erosion amplitude if the inter-row ploughing method is used. The analysis demonstrate the efficiency of detailed geological survey using BTU concept as an operational tool. Further. it enhances that the geological component can be regarded as an amplification point of the terroir system as any alteration even of minor importance - of the geological parameters, may have noticeable consequences on the resulting terroir effect.","CNRS, LMTG, UMR 5563, F-31400 Toulouse, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Courjault-Rade, P (corresponding author), CNRS, LMTG, UMR 5563, 14 Ave E Belin, F-31400 Toulouse, France.",pierrecr@lmtg.obs-mip.fr,"Courjault-Radé, Pierre/AAH-7387-2021",,,,,,20,1,1,0,7,VIGNE ET VIN PUBLICATIONS INT,VILLENAVE D ORNON,"210 CHEMIN DE LEYSOTTE CS 50008, 33882 VILLENAVE D ORNON, FRANCE",1151-0285,,,J INT SCI VIGNE VIN,J.

Floods (47%), typhoons (27%), and cyclones (16%) were frequently discussed while no sources mentioned droughts.

The waste-to-energy networks studied in this contribution include the following main systems: (1) wastewater treatment plants for biogas production, (2) a biogas upgrading process for biomethane generation, and (3) a molten carbonate fuel cell together with a Rankine cycle to harness green electricity. Waste streams in the proposed model consist of wastewater from wastewater treatment plants and waste steam from central utility systems itself. The derived green electricity is utilized to satisfy the energy demands in central utility systems. A waste-to-energy network is simulated by simulation tools, and a mixed integer linear programming problem is formulated to optimize central utility systems based on the simulation results. A case study of the Yeosu petrochemical industrial complex in South Korea evaluates the developed model. The total economic costs of the optimized central utility systems based on the integrated model are reduced by approximately 15% compared to the existing central utility systems. The results from air pollutant emissions pinch analysis indicate that the total quantities of carbon dioxides and sulfur oxides emitted from the integrated model are decreased by about 35%.

However not all assets build capacity equally. In this study we argue that building AC requires a combination of interventions that address not only climate-related risks (specific capacity) but also the structural deficits (e.g., lack of income, education, health, political power) (generic capacity) that shape vulnerability. Focusing on rainfed agriculture in NE Brazil, we investigate how households leverage and combine generic and specific capacities to reduce vulnerability. Particularly we explore: 1) the relative importance of different kinds of capacity in shaping vulnerability on these households and 2) how the level of generic capacities (particularly as a result of Brazil's anti-poverty program Bolsa Familia) influences the adoption of specific ones. We find that both kinds of capacity matter, as relatively higher levels of generic capacity (in terms of income in general, and climate-neutral income specifically) are associated with higher levels of specific capacity (irrigation). In addition we find that while Bolsa Familia has been positive in increasing income, it has not been sufficient to manage the risk of food insecurity during drought events, suggesting a 'poverty trap' in which families are constantly coping with drought but failing to overcome the conditions that make them vulnerable. Our findings indicate that in order to decrease climate vulnerability of poor agricultural households, development interventions, such as anti-poverty programs, have to go beyond cash transfer and should incorporate risk management policies that enhance synergies between generic and specific capacities.

These areas represent social-ecological systems that will require increasing management intervention to maintain their biological and socio-cultural values. Managers of protected areas have begun to recognize the inevitability of ecosystem change and the need to embrace dynamic approaches to intervention. However, significant uncertainty remains about the onset and severity of some impacts, which makes planning difficult. For Indigenous communities, there are intrinsic links between cultural heritage and the conservation of place and biodiversity that need to be better integrated in protected area planning and management. In New South Wales, Australia, management of public conservation reserves and national parks is the responsibility of a State government agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS). This paper describes the outcomes of a participatory planning process with NPWS staff to, firstly, identify the options available, the available tool kit', to manage biodiversity and cultural heritage in protected areas; secondly, explore how the selection of management actions from the tool kit' is associated with the level of climate risk to biodiversity or cultural heritage assets; and thirdly, to understand how the form of individual management actions might adapt to changes in climate risk. Combining these three elements into a series of risk-based, adaptive pathways for conservation of biodiversity and cultural heritage is a novel approach that is currently supporting place-based planning for public conservation areas. Incorporation of the trade-offs and synergies in seeking to effectively manage these discrete but related types of values and the implications for conservation practice are discussed.","[Jacobs, Brent; Boronyak, Louise] Univ Technol, Inst Sustainable Futures, POB 123, Broadway 2007, Australia; [Mitchell, Polly] Off Environm & Heritage, Climate Change Adaptat, POB A290, Sydney South, NSW 1232, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; Office of Environment & Heritage - New South Wales,"Jacobs, B (corresponding author), Univ Technol, Inst Sustainable Futures, POB 123, Broadway 2007, Australia.;Mitchell, P (corresponding author), Off Environm & Heritage, Climate Change Adaptat, POB A290, Sydney South, NSW 1232, Australia.",brent.jacobs@uts.edu.au; louise.boronyak@uts.edu.au; Polly.K.Mitchell@environment.nsw.gov.au,,"Boronyak, Louise/0000-0001-9932-0394",New South Wales Government under the NSW Climate Change Adaptation Research Hub,New South Wales Government under the NSW Climate Change Adaptation Research Hub,This research received funding from the New South Wales Government under the NSW Climate Change Adaptation Research Hub.,,57,9,9,2,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2225-1154,,,CLIMATE,Climate,APR,2019,7,4,,,,,,,58,10.3390/cli7040058,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli7040058,,,12,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,HX6CQ,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000467492000013,View Full Record in Web of Science

The research uses the empirical results of a panel data model based on long time series that enable sensitivity of the main crops to energy cost and the viability of the solar panel system connected to the grid to be identified. We present evidence of the private and social benefits of investments in PV to improve the gross margin of farmers and decrease the carbon footprint of the irrigated areas. Relevant regional disparities in the sensitivity of the main crops explain the regional competition for low-cost water resources and the social conflicts associated with water governance. The Feed-In Tariff system for a PV system is evaluated as a tool to reach clean energy targets and preserve the populations working and living in irrigated drylands. An evaluation of the water desalination plants based on PV is analysed as an alternative to balance the hydric resources of intensive irrigated systems. The main conclusion is that coordinated regulation in energy and water policies may improve farmers' profitability and accelerate the speed in reaching environmental targets in drylands.","[Mesonada, Carlos San Juan; Benitez, Julia I.

We illustrate with examples from the Warta River Basin in Poland. The challenge of reliably estimating the impact of climate change on flood and drought risk at the local and regional scales has led to the pursuit of robust policy solutions. Robust policy solutions, as we demonstrate by comparing reservoirs and small ponds, can be equally intractable given the lack of information on their costs, benefits, and co-benefits, particularly if climate change is taken into account. The mainstreaming challenge is further complicated by the myriad of EU policies targeting flood and drought risks. While the European Commission is working towards a coherent policy picture, we demonstrate contradictions regarding reservoir and other water retention policies. Finally, mainstreaming climate change in flood and drought policy is further challenged by the web of responsible institutions at local, regional, and national scales.","[Linnerooth-Bayer, Joanne; Sendzimir, Jan; Hochrainer-Stigler, Stefan] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Dubel, Anna] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); AGH University of Science & Technology,"Linnerooth-Bayer, J (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",bayer@iiasa.ac.at; adubel@zarz.agh.edu.pl; sendzim@iiasa.ac.at; hochrain@iiasa.ac.at,,"Bayer, Joanne/0000-0003-3084-2471; Hochrainer-Stigler, Stefan/0000-0002-9929-8171",European Commission [224092],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),The work described in this paper was supported by the project RESPONSES European Responses to Climate Change under Grant Agreement No. 224092 in the 7th Framework Programme of the European Commission.

In the Kota process, the municipality was in the geographical focal point and a multi-level stakeholder group focused upon slum inhabitants. The suggested interventions and actions in both cities were dominated by systems (infrastructure and ecosystems) while identified barriers and facilitating factors to implementation revealed a greater acknowledgement of governance issues. Focus on marginalized groups and sectors is facilitated by the direct representations of those issues. While multi-stakeholder processes can be important forums for social learning adaptation planning that benefit vulnerable sectors and groups, with limited inclusion and responsibility given to representatives of marginalized sectors and groups for implementation actions, it is likely that the interests and priorities of more powerful actors will dominate and not contribute to increasing the resilience of the most vulnerable.","[Wilk, Julie; Jonsson, Anna C.] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies, Environm Change Unit, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Linkoping, Sweden; [Rydhagen, Birgitta] Blekinge Inst Technol, Res Div Technosci Studies, Karlshamn, Sweden; [del Callejo, Ivan; Cerruto, Noelia; Chila, German; Encinas, Silvia] Univ Mayor San Simon, Ctr AGUA, Cochabamba, Bolivia; [Kumar, Arun] Govt Coll, Dept Math, Kota, India; [Rani, Ashu] Univ Kota, Dept Pure & Appl Chem, Kota, India",Linkoping University; Blekinge Institute Technology; University of Kota,"Wilk, J (corresponding author), Blekinge Inst Technol, Res Div Technosci Studies, Karlshamn, Sweden.",julie.wilk@liu.se,,,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) [SWE-2010-138],Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida),This work was supported by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) for funding project SWE-2010-138.,,58,5,5,1,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1946-3138,1946-3146,,INT J URBAN SUSTAIN,Int.

Drawing on social-ecological network and sociodemographic data collected via face-to-face interviews with 404 small-scale commercial fishers from 9 Galician communities (Spain), we empirically examine the adaptation pathways that fishers follow when they face hypothetical impacts on their fishery resources and test the role of five social-ecological network structures on fisher's stated intended responses to such scenarios. Our results show that fishers generally intend to follow a 'remain-adapt-transform-exit (the fishery)' pathway when faced with increasing climate impacts. Next, we demonstrate that trust-based bonding ties and ties to informal leaders are associated with a 'business-as-usual' strategy. In contrast, communicative bonding ties are associated with adaptive responses, while communicative bridging ties are associated with transformative and exit strategies. Our findings provide key empirical insight that broaden our understanding of the intricate relationship between social networks and adaptive behaviour relevant to social-ecological systems worldwide.","[Salgueiro-Otero, Diego; Ojea, Elena] Univ Vigo, Ctr Invest Marina, Future Oceans Lab, Campus Lagoas Marcosende, Vigo 36310, Spain; [Barnes, Michele L.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Australian Res Council ARC, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",Universidade de Vigo; CIM UVIGO; James Cook University,"Salgueiro-Otero, D (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Ctr Invest Marina, Future Oceans Lab, Campus Lagoas Marcosende, Vigo 36310, Spain.",dsalgueiro@uvigo.es,,,"European Research Council under the European Union [679812]; Xunta de Galicia; Conselleria de Cultura, Educacion e Ordenacion Universitaria; ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies; Australian Research Council [DE190101583]; Australian Research Council [DE190101583] Funding Source: Australian Research Council","European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia); Conselleria de Cultura, Educacion e Ordenacion Universitaria; ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","We thank all of the small-scale fishers and institutional members who participated in, and contributed to this study; the Federacion Galega de Confrarias de Pescadores and Xunta de Galicia for providing information and helping us reach the target communities; Paula Barreiro Buceta, Luz Eva Fernandez Fernandez, Laura Oubina Acuna, Carlos Pereira Luengo, angela Hernandez Gonzalez and Gema Martinez Iglesias for their help in the field; Elena Fontan Allende for digitizing the social surveys; Alex Tidd and Smit Vasquez Caballero for helpful comments and suggestions and Jose Carlos Marino Balsa and Berta Barreiro Rios for sharing the images of their fishing communities for this article.

However, unlike the encapsulating walls of the nasal cavity, ecogeographic variation in nasal turbinate morphology among humans has not yet been established. Here we investigate variation in inferior nasal turbinate morphology in two populations from climatically extreme environments. Materials and methods Twenty-three linear measurements of the inferior turbinate, nasal cavity walls, and airway passages were collected from CT scans of indigenous modern human crania from Equatorial Africa (n = 35) and the Arctic Circle (n = 35). MANOVA and ANCOVA were employed to test for predicted regional and sex differences in morphology between the samples. Results Significant morphological differences were identified between the two regional samples, with no evidence of significant sexual dimorphism or region-sex interaction effect. Individuals from the Arctic Circle possessed superoinferiorly and mediolaterally larger inferior turbinates compared to Equatorial Africans. In conjunction with the surrounding nasal cavity walls, these differences in turbinate morphology produced airway dimensions that were both consistent with functional expectations and more regionally distinct than either skeletal component independently. Conclusion This study documents the existence of ecogeographic variation in human nasal turbinate morphology reflecting climate-mediated evolutionary demands on intranasal heat and moisture exchange. Humans adapted to cold-dry environments exhibit turbinate morphologies that enhance contact between respired air and nasal mucosa to facilitate respiratory air conditioning. Conversely, humans adapted to hot-humid environments exhibit turbinate morphologies that minimize air-to-mucosa contact, likely to minimize airflow resistance and/or facilitate expiratory heat-shedding.","[Marks, Tarah N.; Franciscus, Robert G.] Univ Iowa, Dept Anthropol, Iowa City, IA USA; [Maddux, Scott D.] Univ North Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Ctr Anat Sci, 3500 Camp Bowie Blvd, Ft Worth, TX 76107 USA; [Butaric, Lauren N.] Des Moines Univ, Dept Anat, Des Moines, IA USA",University of Iowa; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; University of North Texas Health Science Center,"Maddux, SD (corresponding author), Univ North Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Ctr Anat Sci, 3500 Camp Bowie Blvd, Ft Worth, TX 76107 USA.",scott.maddux@unthsc.edu,"butaric, l/AFM-9174-2022","butaric, l/0000-0003-3743-2408",,,,,155,11,11,2,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9483,1096-8644,,AM J PHYS ANTHROPOL,Am.

This complexity calls for integrated water resources management and negotiations between sectors on the most important, cost-effective, and productive allocation of water where it is a limited resource. This reflection paper shows examples of adaptation efforts to water scarcity at a scale where gains in water productivity can be derived from inter-sectoral water reuse and wastewater-freshwater swaps, complementing other water scarcity coping strategies (water savings, long-distance transfer, and desalination). Wastewater treatment for reuse offers opportunities across scales as it allows, for example, donor regions to be compensated with reclaimed water for the release of freshwater for higher-value use, increasing overall economic water productivity in this way. In such water swaps, farmers are compensated with higher water volumes in exchange for higher quality. The reuse of water between sectors offers opportunities to (i) expand the traditional (agricultural) water productivity concept and (ii) significantly increase water productivity at the system level. While rural-urban water reallocation can help mitigate the impacts of climate change, compensating farmers with reclaimed water remains limited for the reasons discussed in the paper.","[Drechsel, Pay] Int Water Management Inst IWMI, 127 Sunil Mawatha, Battaramulla, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Qadir, Manzoor] United Nations Univ Inst Water Environm & Hlth UN, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Baumann, Jurgen] Alliance Biovers Int & Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Tegucigalpa, Honduras",CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI),"Drechsel, P (corresponding author), Int Water Management Inst IWMI, 127 Sunil Mawatha, Battaramulla, Colombo, Sri Lanka.",p.drechsel@cgiar.org,"Qadir, Manzoor/HGC-7825-2022","Qadir, Manzoor/0000-0003-0904-2568",CGIAR Trust Fund,CGIAR Trust Fund(CGIAR),CGIAR Trust Fund donors,,44,1,1,6,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1531-0353,1531-0361,,IRRIG DRAIN,Irrig.

Today, green roofs (GRs) represent a viable solution for enhancing energy and urban resilience in the face of climate change, as they can have a positive impact on the building's indoor thermal comfort and energy demand, as well as inducing various environmental benefits (easing urban heat island effects, improving the management of runoff water, reducing air pollution, etc.). Thus, it is important to be able to assess their effectiveness, both today and under future climate conditions, in order to evaluate whether they can also provide a valid long-term solution. In this paper, a simulation approach is proposed to evaluate the energy and indoor-comfort efficacy of GRs installed on a cluster of buildings with respect to climate change and demographic growth. To illustrate the proposed methodology, it has been applied to two European urban environments characterized by very different climatic conditions (Esch-sur-Alzette in Luxembourg and Palermo in Italy) considering their behaviour over a period of 60 years (2020, 2050, 2080). Results showed that, with respect to standard existing roofs (i.e., without the presence of green coverage), and considering the rising temperatures due to climate change, during cooling seasons GRs enabled significant energy savings (ranging from 20% to 50% for Esch-sur-Alzette and from 3% to 15% for Palermo), improvement of the indoor comfort (reduction of the average predicted mean votes - PMVs) and attenuation of the ceiling temperatures (2-5 degrees C for both contexts) of the buildings' top floors.","[Cirrincione, Laura; Scaccianoce, Gianluca] Univ Palermo, Dept Engn, Viale Sci Bld 9, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Marvuglia, Antonino] Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol LIST, ERIN Environm Res & Innovat Dept, 41 Rue Brill, L-4422 Belvaux, Luxembourg",University of Palermo; Luxembourg Institute of Science & Technology,"Marvuglia, A (corresponding author), Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol LIST, ERIN Environm Res & Innovat Dept, 41 Rue Brill, L-4422 Belvaux, Luxembourg.",laura.cirrincione@unipa.it; antonino.marvuglia@list.lu; gianluca.scaccianoce@unipa.it,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Cirrincione, Laura/ABC-6375-2021; Marvuglia, Antonino/J-2595-2019; Marvuglia, Antonino/AAD-6483-2022","Cirrincione, Laura/0000-0002-9429-0728; Marvuglia, Antonino/0000-0002-8360-8040; ",COST Action [CA16114],COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),"The article was developed with the support of the COST Action CA16114 `RESTORE: Rethinking Sustainability towards a Regenerative Economy, thanks to the Short-Term Scientific Mission (STSM) carried out at the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST) by Laura Cirrincione.

While the urban heat island (UHI) effect may aggravate thermal exposure, city-level UHI regression studies are generally restricted to temporal-aggregated intensities (e.g., seasonal), as a function of time-fixed factors (e.g., urban density). Hence, such approaches do not disclose daily urban-rural air temperature changes, such as during heatwaves (HW). Here, summer data from Lisbons air temperature urban network (June to September 2005-2014), is used to develop a linear mixed-effects model (LMM) to predict the daily median and maximum Urban Thermal Signal (UTS) intensities, as a response to the interactions between the timevarying background weather variables (i.e., the regional/non-urban air temperature, 2-hours air temperature change, and wind speed), and time-fixed urban and geographic factors (local climate zones and directional topographic exposure). Results show that, in Lisbon, greatest temperatures and UTS intensities are found in 'Compact' areas of the city are proportional to the background air temperature change. In leeward locations, the UTS can be enhanced by the topographic shelter effect, depending on wind speed-i.e., as wind speed augments, the UTS intensity increases in leeward sites, even where sparsely built. The UTS response to a future urban densification scenario, considering climate change HW conditions (RCP8.5, 2081-2100 period), was also assessed, its results showing an UTS increase of circa 1.0 degrees C, in critical areas of the city, despite their upwind location. This LMM empirical approach provides a straightforward tool for local authorities to: (i) identify the short-term critical areas of the city, to prioritise public health measures, especially during HW events; and (ii) test the urban thermalperformance, in response to climate change and urban planning scenarios. While the model coefficient estimates are case-specific, the approach can be efficiently replicated in other locations with similar biogeographic conditions. (c) 2021 The Authors.

To cope with such threads and vulnerabilities, urban sustainability and resilience oriented plans have been developed. Accordingly, policy makers need to learn how to properly integrate urban sustainability with urban resilience principles and practices in the re-shaping of urban agendas. In order to highlight the future potential of integrating transformative resilience principles into the general sustainability approach, this paper provides a critical review of a recent and successful urban regeneration and development plan, the Mexico City Green Plan. This paper also discusses a feasibility study for urban redevelopment and transition towards resilience in Mexico City, in order to illustrate the necessity and potential of urban resilience for the improvement of the life prospects of disadvantaged inhabitant groups. The Valle del Chalco neighborhood in Mexico City is presented as an example, whereby resilient and sustainable urban transformation was achieved through an integrated and sustainable decentralized water management and infrastructure plan. In practice, the terms 'Sustainability' and 'Resilience' can be exploited to justify conventional, non-sustainable urban development practices. The results discussed in this paper demonstrate the necessity of the integration of transformative resilience principles within sustainable urban redevelopment and regeneration. The main findings are i) Policy makers underestimate the potential of urban resilience in shaping more sustainable urban futures, since they only understand resilience as the flipside of specific vulnerabilities, ii) The building of urban resilience within sustainable urban transitions and redevelopment can effectively foster people empowerment, particularly in combination with the decentralization of resources management systems, and iii) The main challenge for the implementation and execution of transitions processes towards urban resilience and sustainability is the elimination of political barriers.

Although there has been a growing interest in reducing the risk compensation effect related to climate change, the academic literature in this area is very limited. In this study, we propose a psychological intervention to mitigate a sample of university students' (N = 1,500) irrational response to green technological innovation so as to promote their pro-environmental behaviors. Our experiments identify students' mental construal level as an important psychological factor that, when combined with a proper message framing strategy of introducing new green technologies, can remedy their irrational response to new green technologies. Our findings suggest that highlighting the new technology as playing a preventive/promotional role related to climate change can mitigate risk compensation behavior and eventually promote students' pro-environmental behaviors when they are at a high/low mental construal level.","[Jia, Yanhui; Tian, Jie] Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Res Ctr Econ Upper Reaches Yangtze River, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Haiyue] Sichuan Univ, Sch Business, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Chongqing Technology & Business University; Sichuan University,"Liu, HY (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Sch Business, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",seamoon@scu.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Fund of China: Research on Mechanism Innovation and Effect Evaluation of Ecological Poverty Alleviation from the Perspective of Targeted Poverty Alleviation [17BJY131],National Social Science Fund of China: Research on Mechanism Innovation and Effect Evaluation of Ecological Poverty Alleviation from the Perspective of Targeted Poverty Alleviation,This research is supported by The National Social Science Fund of China: Research on Mechanism Innovation and Effect Evaluation of Ecological Poverty Alleviation from the Perspective of Targeted Poverty Alleviation (17BJY131).,,43,3,3,14,33,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

However, the dominant incremental policy approaches have not generated action at anywhere near the rate, scale or depth that is needed. This is largely due to the fact that climate change has historically been framed as a purely external, technical challenge. There is an urgent need for a more integral understanding that links internal and external (collective and systems) approaches to support transformation. However, related knowledge is scarce and fragmented across disciplines. This study addresses this gap. Through a systematic literature review, we analyse how the linkages between internal and external change are portrayed and understood in current research. We assess the scope, perspectives and approaches used to understand why, and how, internal change relates to climate action and sustainability. Our results highlight patterns and gaps regarding foci, conceptualisation, methods, epistemology, ontology and ethics that hamper emergent solutions and progress.

A high demand for fish prevails in the region as 90-100% of the population prefers fish in their daily diet. The region faces climate change-related issues at various levels and with a range of impacts on the inland fisheries sector. The period 1951 to 2010 saw a significant increase in annual mean temperature in several states of the region (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Sikkim, Mizoram, and Tripura). The highest increase in annual mean temperature was recorded in Sikkim (+0.05 degrees C yr(-1)) followed by Manipur (+0.03 degrees C yr(-1)). Significant changes in annual rainfall pattern were also recorded during the same time period in the region: four of the eight states (Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, and Nagaland) experienced a decreasing trend, and the remaining four (Meghalaya, Manipur, Tripura, and Mizoram) an increasing trend. The highest increase in annual rainfall was recorded in Meghalaya (+14.68 mm yr(-1)) during this period. The change in seasonal trend of mean temperature and the erratic rainfall pattern in the region have had profound impacts on the traditional fisheries of the region. This study outlines these impacts and suggests potential adaptation actions that may be implemented to cope with climate change.","[Borah, Bibha Chetia] Assam Agr Univ, Fisheries Res Ctr, Jorhat 785013, Assam, India",Assam Agricultural University,"Borah, BC (corresponding author), Assam Agr Univ, Fisheries Res Ctr, Jorhat 785013, Assam, India.",drbchetia@yahoo.com,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,0,MICHIGAN STATE UNIV PRESS,E LANSING,"1405 SOUTH HARRISON RD, STE 25 MANLY MILES BUILDING, E LANSING, MI 48823-5202 USA",1463-4988,1539-4077,,AQUAT ECOSYST HEALTH,Aquat.

To challenge this assumption, this article theorises fatigue as a subtle form of resistance. Evidence is based on qualitative research as part of a climate change collaboration, with a focus on a methodology called 'transformative scenario planning'. The author combines Goffman, Scott and Pratt to analyse interactions between facilitators, researchers and stakeholders in meetings and workshops. Historical representations of scientific endeavours are contrasted with performances of participation in Namibia, India and Botswana. The article concludes that anticipating workshop fatigue could be an accessible way to surface power relations in inherently unequal international partnerships, and bring a sociological sensibility to transdisciplinary climate change research.","[Perez, Teresa Sandra] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Creat Circular Plast Ctr, Cambridge, England; [Perez, Teresa Sandra] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cambridge; University of Cape Town,"Perez, TS (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Fac Asian & Middle Eastern Studies, Sidgwick Ave, Cambridge CB3 9DA, England.",tp475@cam.ac.uk,,"Perez, Teresa/0000-0002-8846-8999",UK (DFID); Canada (IDRC),UK (DFID); Canada (IDRC),"This research was undertaken as part of the Adaptation at Scale in Semi-Arid Regions (ASSAR) project, one of four consortia within the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA) programme, joint funded by the UK (DFID) and Canada (IDRC) from 2014 to 2018.",,37,0,0,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0011-3921,1461-7064,,CURR SOCIOL,Curr.

A ten-year precipitation dataset was analysed for both a rapidly urbanized megacity and nearby suburban/rural stations in southern China. Rapid urbanization in the megacity was evident from satellite observations. A statistically significant, long-term, increasing trend of precipitation existed only at the megacity station (45.6 mm per decade) and not at the other stations. The increase was attributed to thermal and dynamical modifications of the tropospheric boundary layer related to urbanization, which was confirmed by the results of our WRF-SLUCM simulations. The results also suggested that a long-term regional increase in precipitation, caused by greenhouse gas-induced climate change, for instance, was not evident within the study period. The urbanization-induced increase was found to be higher than the precipitation increase (183 mm per decade) expected from future climate change. The direct climate impacts due to rapid urbanization is highlighted with strong implications for urban sustainable development and the planning of effective adaptation strategies for issues such as coastal defenses, mosquito-borne disease spread and heat stress mortality.

These challenges call for a transition toward improved water management, including considerations of resilience. However, because the resilience concept has multidisciplinary origins it is open to multiple interpretations, which poses a challenge to understanding and operationalizing the concept. We explore how resilience thinking can be translated into urban water practice to develop the conceptual understanding of transitions toward sustainability. The study is based on a literature review, interviews with water experts, as well as four case studies in South Africa, India, Sweden, and the Philippines. We identify seven key principles or attributes of urban water resilience and the related transition process. We find that resilience building needs to discern between and manage three levels (i.e., socioeconomic, external hazard considerations, and larger social-ecological systems) to be sustainable. In addition, we find that human agency is a strong driver of transition processes, with a certain level of risk awareness and risk perception providing one threshold and a certain capacity for action to implement measures and reorganize in response to risks being another. The difficulty of achieving knowledge to action derives from the multiple challenges of crossing these two types of identified thresholds. To address long-term trends or stressors, we find an important role for social learning to ensure that the carrying capacity of urban water services is not exceeded or unwanted consequences are created (e.g., long-term trends like salinization and water depletion). We conclude that the resilience term and related concepts add value to understanding and addressing the dynamic dimension of urban water transitions if the key principles identified in this study are considered.","[Johannessen, Ase] Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden; [Johannessen, Ase] Lund Univ, Ctr Risk Assessment & Management LUCRAM, Div Risk Management & Societal Safety, Lund, Sweden; [Wamsler, Christine] Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden",Stockholm Environment Institute; Lund University; Lund University,"Johannessen, A (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden.;Johannessen, A (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Risk Assessment & Management LUCRAM, Div Risk Management & Societal Safety, Lund, Sweden.",,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) [MSB: 211-946]; Transforming Development and Disaster Risk Initiative at SEI - Swedish International Development Cooperation (Sida); Swedish Research Council FORMAS,Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB); Transforming Development and Disaster Risk Initiative at SEI - Swedish International Development Cooperation (Sida); Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),"This paper is an outcome of the WASH & RESCUE project (Grant number MSB: 211-946) financed by The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB).

To determine an optimized management strategy for smallholder farmers in southern Niger to cope with crop production failure and improve cropping performance in the context of climate change and variability, multi-site trials were conducted to evaluate the impacts of transplanting on pearl millet growth and productivity. Eight treatments viz. T1-0NPK (100% transplanting without NPK), T1-NPK (100% transplanting + NPK), T2-0NPK (100% transplanting of empty hills without NPK), T2-NPK (100% transplanting of empty hills + NPK), T3-0NPK (50% transplanting of empty hills without NPK), T3-NPK (50% transplanting of empty hills + NPK), T4-0NPK (farmer practice without NPK), and T4-NPK (farmer practice + NPK) were included in the experiment. Compared to farmer practice, transplanting significantly reduced time to tillering, flowering, and maturity stages by 15%, 27%, and 11%, respectively. The results also revealed that T1-NPK significantly increased panicle weight, total biomass, grain yield, and plant height by 40%, 38%, 27%, and 23%, respectively. Farmers' evaluations of the experiments supported these findings, indicating three substantial advantages of transplanting, including higher yield (37.50% of responses), larger, more vigorous and more panicles (34.17% of responses), and good tillering (28.33% of responses). An economic profitability analysis of the system revealed that biomass gain (XOF 359,387/ha) and grain gain (XOF 324,388/ha) increased by 34% and 22%, respectively, with T1-NPK. Therefore, it can be inferred that transplanting is a promising strategy for adapting millet cultivation to climate change and variability in southern Niger.","[Traore, Bouba; Moussa, Abdourazak Alio; Nassirou, Yahaya Seydou Abdel; Ba, Malick N.; Tabo, Ramadjita] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, BP 12404, Niamey, Niger; [Traore, Bouba; Traore, Amadou] Inst Econ Rurale IER Mali, BP 28, Koutiala, Mali",CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT),"Traore, B (corresponding author), Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, BP 12404, Niamey, Niger.;Traore, B (corresponding author), Inst Econ Rurale IER Mali, BP 28, Koutiala, Mali.",b.traore@cgiar.org; abdoulrazakalio@gmail.com; traoreamadou73@yahoo.fr; ay02121990@gmail.com; b.malick@cgiar.org; r.tabo@cgiar.org,"Ba, Malick Niango/I-8557-2012; Moussa, Abdourazak Alio/AAT-1848-2021","Ba, Malick Niango/0000-0001-7323-8739; Moussa, Abdourazak Alio/0000-0001-5261-9380; Traore, Bouba/0000-0002-4458-6440","USAID Development Food Security Assistance program (DFSA/GIRMA) of Catholic Relief Services (CRS) under the ICRISAT agreement [72DFFP18CA00003, NE.19.SUBCONT.8563.672.P0410.01.00]",USAID Development Food Security Assistance program (DFSA/GIRMA) of Catholic Relief Services (CRS) under the ICRISAT agreement,"This research has been funded by the USAID Development Food Security Assistance program (DFSA/GIRMA) of Catholic Relief Services (CRS) (grant number: 72DFFP18CA00003) under the ICRISAT agreement (grant number: NE.19.SUBCONT.8563.672.P0410.01.00); however, the views expressed do not necessarily reflect the US government's official policies.",,46,0,0,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,JUL,2022,13,7,,,,,,,997,10.3390/atmos13070997,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13070997,,,15,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,3G9MK,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000831669900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To understand how integration of different objectives is realized in programme management approaches, it is important to have in depth knowledge on how actors manage social, cognitive and physical boundaries. Therefore, this article analyses how actors manage boundaries in a regional integrative programme. Within this case we focus on two integration attempts: one which has succeeded relatively well and one which was less successful. The analysis shows the importance of boundary spanning actions, such as jointly working on strategy documents, organizing events where actors can formally and informally interact, and the activities of a political change agent. Adding to previous insights, we find four additional explanations for successful integration which shed new light on how boundaries can be best managed in future programmatic approaches: the influence of contextual factors on boundary management and its success, the need to address both the social and cognitive dimension of boundaries, the need to make the programme attractive for the actors governing the issues it wants to integrate with, and the role of boundary drawing to create an understanding and respect for boundaries.","[van Broekhoven, Saskia; van Buuren, Arwin] Erasmus Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Sociol, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam,"van Broekhoven, S (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Sociol, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands.",saskia.vanbroekhoven@pbl.nl,"van Buuren, Arwin/I-6240-2013","van Buuren, Arwin/0000-0002-8504-0495",,,,,40,1,1,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0965-4313,1469-5944,,EUR PLAN STUD,Eur.

It employs both network analysis of those involved with documents and events intended to integrate climate change information into policy production or practice and qualitative research to understand how climate information flows among stakeholders in the water quality sector, a policy area of great importance in the Great Lakes region. It finds that the network consists of centralized regional-scale work surrounded by more dispersed specialized and local work that has developed over time. Our interviews reveal that overlaps between these scales produce more usable knowledge as potential users form their own specialized networks which operate as communities of practice that further tailor information to match particular application needs. We propose a model of this process that describes how the development of usable information works in a continuum, with each step furthering usability at the regional level. This model outlines the potential for knowledge networks and communities of practice to not only drive the use of information in particular decision contexts, but also provide a critical means to inform regional work and scale up the production of usable information about climate change.

The common approach for energy demand estimation is using only typical meso-scale weather data in building energy models (BEMs), which underestimates the impacts of extreme climate and microclimate variations. To quantify the impacts of such underestimation on assessing the future energy performance of buildings, this study simulates a high spatiotemporal resolution BEM for two representative residential buildings located in a 600 x 600 m2 urban area in Southeast Sweden while accounting for both climate change and microclimate. Future climate data are synthesized using 13 future climate scenarios over 2010-2099, divided into three 30-year periods, and microclimate data are generated considering the urban morphology of the area. It is revealed that microclimate can cause 17% rise in cooling degree-day (CDD) and 7% reduction in heating degree-day (HDD) on average compared to mesoclimate. Considering typical weather conditions, CDD increases by 45% and HDD decreases by 8% from one 30-year period to another. Differences can become much larger during extreme weather conditions. For example, CDD can increase by 500% in an extreme warm July compared to a typical one. Results also indicate that annual cooling demand becomes four and five times bigger than 2010-2039 in 2040-2069 and 2070-2099, respectively. The daily peak cooling load can increase up to 25% in an extreme warm day when accounting for microclimate. In the absence of cooling systems during extreme warm days, the indoor temperature stays above 26 degrees C continuously over a week and reaches above 29.2 degrees C. Moreover, the annual overheating hours can increase up to 140% in the future. These all indicate that not accounting for influencing climate variations can result in maladaptation or insufficient adaptation of urban areas to climate change.","[Hosseini, Mohammad] NTNU Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Engn, Dept Ocean Operat & Civil Engn, Alesund, Norway; [Hosseini, Mohammad; Nik, Vahid M.] Lund Univ, Div Bldg Phys, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, SE-22363 Lund, Sweden; [Javanroodi, Kavan; Nik, Vahid M.] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Div Bldg Technol, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Javanroodi, Kavan] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Solar Energy & Bldg Phys Lab LESO PB, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Lund University; Chalmers University of Technology; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Nik, VM (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Div Bldg Phys, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, SE-22363 Lund, Sweden.;Nik, VM (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Div Bldg Technol, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",mohammad.hosseini@ntnu.no; kavan.javanroodi@epfl.ch; vahid.nik@byggtek.lth.se,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,"joint programming initiative 'ERANet Smart Energy Systems' focus initiative on Integrated, Regional Energy Systems; European Union [775970, 101033683]; Centre for Innovation Research at Lund University (CIRCLE); Sweden's innovation agency (VINNOVA -MIRAI)","joint programming initiative 'ERANet Smart Energy Systems' focus initiative on Integrated, Regional Energy Systems; European Union(European Commission); Centre for Innovation Research at Lund University (CIRCLE); Sweden's innovation agency (VINNOVA -MIRAI)","This work was supported by the joint programming initiative `ERANet Smart Energy Systems' focus initiative on Integrated, Regional Energy Systems, with support from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [775970] and the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement for the COLLECTiEF (Collective Intelligence for Energy Flexibility) project (grant agreement ID: 101033683).

In this context, a global land and natural resource rush for business, development and climate and environmental stewardship purposes has been at work since the mid-2000s. This paper discusses whether, how, and the extent to which the resource rush behind mainstream climate stewardship and sustainability transitions shapes the contemporary resource property question regarding who has the ability and power to harness what natural resources where, how, and for what purpose(s). It explores the drivers, protagonists and implications for research and political advocacy of critical shifts in the object, subject, form, enforcing authority, policy structure, and justification of resource property during neoliberal globalization since the 1970s. An alliance of trailblazing resource rush supporters and accommodators is behind these changes which, when taken altogether, hint at a broader restructuring trend of the resource property question in climate stewardship and sustainability transitions today. Despite its potential to democratize resource access, control and ownership, the restructuring trend so far primarily serves the purposes of big business and conservation non-profits to enhance their social license to operate by means of reducing local resource tenure risks at the grassroots level and reputational risks more generally. While there is a need for further research, the examined changes seem to be transforming the playing field of political advocacy around resource governance in climate stewardship and transitions to sustainability. But the examined restructuring trend is highly contested and contingent on an unstable middle-ground sort of political compromise, the future trajectory of which remains to be seen.","[Alonso-Fradejas, Alberto] Univ Utrecht, Human Geog & Spatial Planning Dept, Fac Geosci, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Alonso-Fradejas, Alberto] Vening Meinesz Bldg 6-14,Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Alonso-Fradejas, A (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Human Geog & Spatial Planning Dept, Fac Geosci, Utrecht, Netherlands.;Alonso-Fradejas, A (corresponding author), Vening Meinesz Bldg 6-14,Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands.",a.alonsofradejas@uu.nl,,,,,,,80,2,2,0,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,SEP,2021,108,,,,,,,,105529,10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105529,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105529,,,10,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UF2XI,,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000688441300012,View Full Record in Web of Science

This term describes an agenda and framework for people who believe in the probable, inevitable or unfolding collapse of industrial consumer societies, due to the direct and indirect impacts of human-caused climate change and environmental degradation. Some of the principles of Deep Adaptation facilitation are summarised, such as containment, to enable co-responsibility for a safe enough space for difficult conversations. Another key principle is welcoming radical uncertainty in response to the anxieties that people feel from their anticipation of collapse. A third principle is making space for difficult emotions, which are welcomed as a natural and ongoing response to our predicament. A fourth aspect is a curiosity about processes of othering and separation.

The extent to which heat management strategies designed to lessen the urban heat island effect could offset future heat-related mortality remains unexplored in the literature. Using coupled global and regional climate models with a human health effects model, we estimate changes in the number of heat-related deaths in 2050 resulting from modifications to vegetative cover and surface albedo across three climatically and demographically diverse US metropolitan areas: Atlanta, Georgia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Phoenix, Arizona. Employing separate health impact functions for average warm season and heat wave conditions in 2050, we find combinations of vegetation and albedo enhancement to offset projected increases in heat-related mortality by 40 to 99% across the three metropolitan regions.

The application of the framework is conducted for the coastal community of Little Anse on Isle Madame, Nova Scotia. Specifically, the state of the Little Anse breakwater is analysed and adaptation options for protecting, accommodating, and retreating are presented and evaluated in the face of predicted storm scenarios. The results indicate that, in the case of Little Anse, the strategic decision to protect the community by a new breakwater arm provides preferred measures for resilience and adaptive capacity.

There is a need to learn from practical experience in fostering cooperation towards research outcomes, coordinating geographically dispersed teams, and bridging distinct incentives and ways of working. This article reflects on the experience of the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA), a multi-consortium programme which sought to build resilience to regional climate change. Participants valued the consortium as a network that provided connections with distinct sources of expertise, as a means to gain experience and skills beyond the remit of their home organisation. Consortia were seen as an avenue for reaching scale both in terms of working across regions, as well as in terms of moving research into practice. CARIAA began with programme-level guidance on climate hotspots and collaboration, alongside consortium-level visions on research agenda and design. Consortia created and implemented work plans defining each organisation's role and responsibilities and coordinated activities across numerous partners, dispersed locations, and diverse cultural settings. Nested committees provided coherence and autonomy at the programme, consortium, and activity-level. Each level had some discretion in how to deploy funding, creating multiple collaborative spaces that served to further interconnect participants. The experience of CARIAA affirms documented strategies for collaborative research, including project vision, partner compatibility, skilled managers, and multi-level planning. Collaborative research also needs an ability to revise membership and structures as needed in response to changing involvement of partners over time.","[Currie-Alder, Bruce; Cundill, Georgina] Int Dev Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Scodanibbio, Lucia] SouthSouthNorth, 55 Salt River Rd, Cape Town, South Africa; [Vincent, Katharine] Kulima Integrated Dev Solut, Postnet Suite H79,Private Bag X9118, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Prakash, Anjal] Indian Sch Business, Bharti Inst Publ Policy, Hyderabad 500111, Telangana, India; [Nathe, Nathalie] Vivid Econ, 163 Eversholt St, London NW1 1BU, England",Indian School of Business (ISB),"Currie-Alder, B (corresponding author), Int Dev Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",bcurrie-alder@idrc.ca; scolucia@gmail.com; Katharine@kulima.com; Anjal_Prakash@isb.edu; nathalie.nathe@vivideconomics.com,"Vincent, Katharine/L-5669-2019; Currie-Alder, Bruce/Q-4071-2018","Vincent, Katharine/0000-0003-3152-1522; Currie-Alder, Bruce/0000-0002-3224-4136","Government of the United Kingdom - Foreign, Commonwealth AMP; Development Office (FCDO); International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada","Government of the United Kingdom - Foreign, Commonwealth AMP; Development Office (FCDO); International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada(CGIAR)","This work was carried out with financial support from the Government of the United Kingdom - Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) and the International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada.",,37,4,4,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Vulnerability assessments directly support countries in developing adaptation plans and in identifying possible measures to reduce adverse consequences of changing climate conditions. Against this background, this paper describes a vulnerability assessment using an integrated and participatory approach that builds on standardized working steps of previously developed 'Vulnerability Sourcebook' guidelines. The backbone of this approach is impact chains as a conceptual model of cause-effect relationships as well as a structured selection of indicators according to the three main components of vulnerability, namely exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. We illustrate our approach by reporting the results of a vulnerability assessment conducted in Burundi focusing on climate change impacts on water and soil resources. Our work covers two analysis scales: a national assessment with the aim to identify climate change 'hotspot regions' through vulnerability mapping; and a local assessment aiming at identifying local-specific drivers of vulnerability and appropriate adaptation measures. Referring to this vulnerability assessment in Burundi, we discuss the potentials and constraints of the approach. We stress the need to involve stakeholders in every step of the assessment and to communicate limitations and uncertainties of the applied methods, indicators and maps in order to increase the comprehension of the approach and the acceptance of the results by different stakeholders. The study proved the practical usability of the approach at the national level by the selection of three particularly vulnerable areas. The results at a local scale supported the identification of adaption measures through intensive engagement of local rural populations.","[Schneiderbauer, Stefan; Pedoth, Lydia; Renner, Kathrin; Zebisch, Marc] Eurac Res, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Schneiderbauer, Stefan; Pedoth, Lydia] United Nations Univ, UNU EHS, Inst Environm & Human Secur, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Schneiderbauer, Stefan] Univ Free State, Dept Geog, Qwaqwa Campus, ZA-9301 Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Baunach, Daniel] Dept Environm & Environm Planning, D-90402 City Of Nuremberg, Germany; [Fritzsche, Kerstin] Inst Futures Studies & Technol Assessment IZT, D-14129 Berlin, Germany; [Bollin, Christina] Fed Minist Econ Cooperat & Dev BMZ, D-10963 Berlin, Germany; [Pregnolato, Marco] Catholic Univ Sacred Heart Milano, Ecometr Ltd, Spinoff, I-25121 Brescia, Italy; [Liersch, Stefan; Rivas Lopez, Maria del Rocio] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Liersch, Stefan; Rivas Lopez, Maria del Rocio] Leibniz Assoc, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Ruzima, Salvator] Environm Assessments Geol Energy & Water Consulta, BP 3672, Bujumbura, Burundi",European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano; University of the Free State; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Schneiderbauer, S (corresponding author), Eurac Res, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.;Schneiderbauer, S (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, UNU EHS, Inst Environm & Human Secur, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.;Schneiderbauer, S (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Dept Geog, Qwaqwa Campus, ZA-9301 Bloemfontein, South Africa.",schneiderbauer@ehs.unu.edu; dani_b_@gmx.de; lydia.pedoth@eurac.edu; kathrin.renner@eurac.edu; kerstin.Fritzsche@iass-potsdam.de; c.bollin@t-online.de; mar.pregnolato@gmail.com; marc.zebisch@eurac.edu; stefan.liersch@pik-potsdam.de; rivas@pik-potsdam.de; salvator.ruzima@gitec-consult.com,"Lopez, Maria/HHC-3659-2022; Zebisch, Marc/GQQ-9291-2022; Schneiderbauer, Stefan/E-8662-2017","Schneiderbauer, Stefan/0000-0001-7587-849X; Renner, Kathrin/0000-0001-7757-799X; Pedoth, Lydia/0000-0001-5429-687X; Zebisch, Marc/0000-0002-3530-7219",GIZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit) witin the scope of the project ACCES (Adaptation au changement climatique pour la protection des ressources en eau et sol),GIZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit) witin the scope of the project ACCES (Adaptation au changement climatique pour la protection des ressources en eau et sol),The study work is based on a contractual work carried out for the GIZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit) witin the scope of the project ACCES (Adaptation au changement climatique pour la protection des ressources en eau et sol).,,46,11,11,0,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2020,12,16,,,,,,,6354,10.3390/su12166354,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12166354,,,25,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OD0YP,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000579580700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The analytic framework is used to explore the long-run growth prospects for Egypt in a changing climate. Based on a review of existing estimates of climate change impacts on agricultural productivity, labour productivity and the potential losses due to sea-level rise for the country, the model is used to simulate the effects of climate change on aggregate consumption, investment and income up to 2050. Available cost estimates for adaptation investments are employed to explore adaptation strategies. The simulation analysis suggests that in the absence of policy-led adaptation investments, real GDP towards the middle of the century will be 6.5% lower than in a hypothetical baseline without climate change. A combination of adaptation measures, that include coastal protection investments for vulnerable sections along the low-lying Nile delta, support for changes in crop management practices and investments to raise irrigation efficiency, could reduce the GDP loss in 2050 to around 2.6%. Further work along these lines for developing countries in climate change hotspot regions deserves a high priority on the research agenda in economic modelling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Despite this, a transparent method for identifying and understanding the relationship between climate change, migration and other contextual factors remains a knowledge gap. Existing conceptual models are useful in understanding the complexities of climate migration, but provide varying degrees of applicability to quantitative studies, resulting in non-homogenous transferability of knowledge in this important area. This paper attempts to provide a critical review of climate migration literature, as well as presenting a new conceptual model for the identification of the drivers of migration in the context of climate change. It focuses on the interactions and the dynamics of drivers over time, space and society. Through systematic, pan-disciplinary and homogenous application of theory to different geographical contexts, we aim to improve understanding of the impacts of climate change on migration. A brief case study of Malawi is provided to demonstrate how this global conceptual model can be applied into local contextual scenarios. In doing so, we hope to provide insights that help in the more homogenous applications of conceptual frameworks for this area and more generally.","[Parrish, Rebecca; Zeka, Ariana] Brunel Univ London, Inst Environm Hlth & Soc, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Parrish, Rebecca; Colbourn, Tim] UCL, Inst Global Hlth, 30 Guilford St, London WC1N 1EH, England; [Lauriola, Paolo] Italian Natl Res Council, Inst Clin Physiol, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Leonardi, Giovanni] Dept Publ Hlth Environm & Soc, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Leonardi, Giovanni] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Hajat, Shakoor] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Ctr Climate Change & Planetary Hlth, London WC1E 7HT, England",Brunel University; University of London; University College London; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Parrish, R; Zeka, A (corresponding author), Brunel Univ London, Inst Environm Hlth & Soc, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.;Parrish, R (corresponding author), UCL, Inst Global Hlth, 30 Guilford St, London WC1N 1EH, England.",ucfarp0@ucl.ac.uk; t.colbourn@ucl.ac.uk; paolo.lauriola@gmail.com; Giovanni.leonardi@phe.gov.uk; Shakoor.Hajat@lshtm.ac.uk; Ariana.zeka@brunel.ac.uk,"Leonardi, Giovanni S/E-5700-2015; Leonardi, Giovanni/AAS-7603-2020","Hajat, Shakoor/0000-0002-3086-362X; Lauriola, Paolo/0000-0003-4768-6612; Parrish, Rebecca/0000-0003-3105-7969; Leonardi, Giovanni S./0000-0001-7477-1762",NERC as part of the London NERC Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP) [NE/L002485/1],NERC as part of the London NERC Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"R.P. is funded by NERC as part of the London NERC Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP) under grant code NE/L002485/1.

Armoring and defending the coast are being revealed as ineffective in terms of outcomes and cost, particularly in rural areas. Nature-based options include approaches that make space for coastal dynamism (e.g., through managed retreat) or leverage ecosystem services such as erosion control (e.g., by restoring coastal wetlands). Resistance can be strong to these alternatives to hard infrastructure. Nova Scotia, off Canada's Atlantic coast, is a vulnerable coastal jurisdiction facing such decisions. The emerging climax thinking framework was used to design 14 experimental online focus groups. These focus groups explored how three priming treatments influenced discussions about adaptation options and urgency and quantitative pre/post-tests, compared with information-only control treatments. A future-focused priming strategy seemed most effective since it fostered discussions about duties to future generations. The altruism-focused priming strategy involved reflections of wartime mobilization and more recent collective action. It also worked but was more difficult to implement and potentially higher risk. Past-focused priming was counterproductive. Further research should test the future-focused and altruism-focused strategies among larger groups and in different jurisdictions, reducing some of the biases in our sample.","[Sherren, Kate; Sutton, Krysta; Chappell, Ellen] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Studies, Halifax, NS, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Sherren, K (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Studies, Halifax, NS, Canada.",kate.sherren@dal.ca,,"Sherren, Kate/0000-0003-1576-9878","Climate Change Adaptation Fund of Natural Resources Canada (2018-2020); Ocean Frontiers Institute, Dalhousie University","Climate Change Adaptation Fund of Natural Resources Canada (2018-2020)(Natural Resources Canada); Ocean Frontiers Institute, Dalhousie University","This work was completed with support from the Climate Change Adaptation Fund of Natural Resources Canada (2018-2020, van Proosdij, PI, KSherren, CI), as part of the Making Room for Movement project, and a Seed Fund grant to KSutton from the Ocean Frontiers Institute, Dalhousie University.",,81,1,1,4,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0364-152X,1432-1009,,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

Information campaigns about bushfire preparedness are often based on the assumption that residents of bushfire-prone neighbourhoods underestimate their risk. However, there are complex relationships between bushfire hazard, perceived risk and adaptive action. Aims. We investigate how residents' understanding of bushfire risk relates to biophysical risk in the City of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia's most fire-prone state capital. Methods. A transdisciplinary case study using a survey of 406 residents living close to the wildland-urban interface, focus groups in four bushfire-prone neighbourhoods, and geospatial fire risk assessment. Key results. Neighbourhood concern about bushfire is statistically associated with biophysical measurement of local bushfire risk. This awareness does not necessarily translate into adaptive action, in part because residents underestimate the risk to their homes from fuels on their own property and overestimate the risk from bushland and neighbouring properties, leading to a common response that preparing for bushfire is futile if your neighbours do not also prepare. Neighbourhoods with high levels of positive community interaction, however, are more likely to access preparedness information, and develop fire-adaptive behaviours. Conclusions/Implications. Our findings highlight the need for social adaptation pathways using local communication interventions to build the neighbourhood knowledge, networks and capacities that enable community-led bushfire preparedness.","[Lucas, Chloe H.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog Planning & Spatial Sci, Private Bag 78, Sandy Bay, Tas 7001, Australia; [Lucas, Chloe H.; Williamson, Grant J.; Bowman, David M.

J,"Walsh, C",,,,"Walsh, Cormac",,,Integration of expertise or collaborative practice?: Coastal management and climate adaptation at the Wadden Sea,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ZONE MANAGEMENT; SCIENCE; INTERFACE; KNOWLEDGE,"Collaborative governance has emerged in recent years as a leading paradigm within environmental management more generally and coastal management in particular. The extensive policy and academic literatures on integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) have promoted the coordination of multiple policy sectors, the inclusion of non-state actors as well as the integration of scientific knowledge and expertise from across a diverse range of disciplines. More recently, scholars within this field have called for greater attention to local, lay forms of knowledge and the cultural values held by coastal communities. The potential tensions between these objectives has however, received limited attention to date. To what extent is a concern for collaborative practice and stakeholder inclusion compatible with a similarly ambitious concern for the transdisciplinary integration of expertise? This paper responds to calls for empirical analyses of governance processes at the coast and the need to critically review purported paradigm shifts within the context of broader spatially and temporally differentiated governance contexts. The paper identifies distinct interpretations of ICZM in the literature, reflecting distinct paradigms of planning practice. Empirically, the paper examines the relationship between knowledge integration and collaborative practice through a case study of managing coastal change at the German Wadden Sea coast. In this particular case, expert driven approaches to policy-making, informed by a technical rationality paradigm have been dominant, presenting challenges to the emergence of colla-borative, cross-sectoral governance.","[Walsh, Cormac] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Walsh, C (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",cormac.walsh@uni-hamburg.de,,,German Research Foundation,German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The research for this paper was generously supported by the German Research Foundation under project grant: Metageographies and Spatial Frames: Coastal Management as Situated Practice in the International Wadden Sea Region.,,48,12,12,1,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,JAN 1,2019,167,,,,,,78,86,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.10.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.10.004,,,9,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Oceanography; Water Resources,HE2ND,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000453113900008,View Full Record in Web of Science

In Tuvalu, a low-lying Pacific island nation, ways of perceiving climate risks encompass both understandings about potential hazards wrought by a changing climate as well as culturally informed understandings about appropriate responses to the threats born from those hazards. An analysis of risk perception that combines the Cultural Theory of Risk with an examination of traditional environmental knowledge is used to understand how climate impacts are perceived in Nanumea, Tuvalu. The argument is made that adaptive decisions which reflect community risk priorities and cultural worldviews are more likely to be successful than efforts that may claim community engagement but do not reflect community members' perceptions and worldviews.","Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Lazrus, H (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",,,,National Science Foundation; Marine Conservation Institute,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Marine Conservation Institute,"Heather Lazrus is an environmental anthropologist and a Project Scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado.

This study investigated the strengths and gaps of climate-change perceptions of Beijing's citizens by a questionnaire survey. Responses were sought on 36 perceptions under three domains: causes, impacts, and countermeasures. The influence of underlying factors, self-rated health status and current and childhood living environments, were explored by non-parametric statistical tests. Self-rated health status strongly influenced two causes (deforestation, releasing carbon dioxide), two countermeasures (responsibility to do something to tackle climate change, officials ignored the issue of climate change), and none for impacts. Childhood city-living strongly affected the perceptions of some climate-change causes. However, childhood living environments did not affect impacts and countermeasures. A typology of residents' perception patterns was proposed. Respondents registered perception forte, especially for the common causes. Perception disconnection was detected for the linkage between two causes: resource consumption and fossil-fuel use. Perception deficit was shown for three causes: nitrous oxide release, methane emission, and urbanization. A strong collateral perception was found between the impacts of health-related issues and extreme weather. Perception discord was established between impacts on food production and agricultural pest problems. For countermeasures, the strongest perceptions were expressed for taking personal actions, changing behavior, and supporting the government. Such responses signified altruistic personal mitigation commitments and the manifestation of civic duties. The findings could inform the formulation of climate-change public policies and public education programs to nurture a climate-resilient city.","[Tian, Yuhong; Liu, Fenghua; Luan, Jingya; Yan, Mengxuan] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Sch Nat Resources, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Jim, C.

However, the potential to initiate such a transformative approach has not materialized because of the many underlying issues that need to be understood properly. Therefore, this study conducted a systematic review to gather empirical evidence on the issues and challenges in implementing risk-sensitive urban development. The study identified forty-six issues and challenges under seven key themes that need addressing in order to facilitate the desirable transition: trade-offs, governance, fragmentation and silos, capacity, design and development, data, and funding. The issues and challenges that exist under trade-offs for negotiating solutions for risk-sensitive urban development and the governance of multiple stakeholders were identified as the top two areas that need attention in facilitating the desirable transition. This study also revealed that important information, such as scientific information, hazard and risk information, temporal and spatial information, and critical local details are not being produced and shared between stakeholders in decision-making. A profound participatory process that involves all the stakeholders in the decision-making process was identified as the pathway to ensure equitable outcomes in risk-sensitive urban development.","[Roslan, Ahmad Farhan; Fernando, Terrence; Biscaya, Sara] Univ Salford, THINKLab, 7th Floor,Maxwell Bldg, Salford M5 4WT, Lancs, England; [Roslan, Ahmad Farhan; Sulaiman, Noralfishah] Univ Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia UTHM, KANZU Res Resilient Built Environm, Parit Raja 86400, Malaysia",University of Salford,"Roslan, AF (corresponding author), Univ Salford, THINKLab, 7th Floor,Maxwell Bldg, Salford M5 4WT, Lancs, England.;Roslan, AF (corresponding author), Univ Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia UTHM, KANZU Res Resilient Built Environm, Parit Raja 86400, Malaysia.",a.f.b.roslan@edu.salford.ac.uk; t.fernando@salford.ac.uk; s.biscaya@salford.ac.uk; nora@uthm.edu.my,"Ahmad Farhan, Roslan/ABH-1052-2021; Sulaiman, Noralfishah/AAO-1893-2021","Ahmad Farhan, Roslan/0000-0002-9521-1315; Sulaiman, Noralfishah/0000-0002-4638-0606; Fernando, Terrence/0000-0001-5321-9071",Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/T003219/1]; ESRC [ES/T003219/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the Grant ES/T003219/1 entitled Technology Enhanced Stakeholder Collaboration for Supporting Risk-Sensitive Sustainable Urban Development.,,141,3,3,8,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2021,13,19,,,,,,,10631,10.3390/su131910631,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su131910631,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WK2RA,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000709577100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Extreme temperatures can impair the use of public spaces in cities, as heat stress endangers human well-being and health. Identifying suitable adaptation measures to maintain the full functionality of public spaces requires a multidimensional approach, accounting for interrelated scientific, social, and practical aspects. As one result we introduce an inter- and transdisciplinary concept that addresses the challenge of adapting public spaces to climate change. Additionally we present a pilot study from Heidelberg, Germany, where a new, sustainable urban quarter experienced more pronounced heat stress than the historic city centre in the hot and dry summer of 2018. The study shows the suitability of our approach to identify appropriate heat adaptation measures. Solar potential modelling and mental map surveys proved to be particularly effective methods. We find that adaptation measures generate synergy effects by improving both climatic and social conditions.","[Foshag, Kathrin; Aeschbach, Nicole] Heidelberg Univ, TdLab Geog, Inst Geog, Neuenheimer Feld 368, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Foshag, Kathrin; Aeschbach, Werner] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Environm Phys, Neuenheimer Feld 229, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Foshag, Kathrin] Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg Sch Educ, Vossstr 2,Bldg 4330, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Hoefle, Bernhard] Heidelberg Univ, 3D Geospatial Data Proc 3DGeo Res Grp, Inst Geog, Neuenheimer Feld 368, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Winkler, Raino] City Heidelberg, Off Environm Protect Trade Supervis & Energy, Kornmarkt 1, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Siegmund, Alexander] Heidelberg Univ Educ, Dept Geog, Res Grp Earth Observat Rgeo, Czernyring 22-10-12, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Siegmund, Alexander] Heidelberg Univ Educ, UNESCO Chair World Heritage & Biosphere Reserve O, Czernyring 22-10-12, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Aeschbach, Nicole; Hoefle, Bernhard; Siegmund, Alexander; Aeschbach, Werner] Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg Ctr Environm HCE, Neuenheimer Feld 229, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Foshag, K (corresponding author), Heidelberg Univ, TdLab Geog, Inst Geog, Neuenheimer Feld 368, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.;Foshag, K (corresponding author), Heidelberg Univ, Inst Environm Phys, Neuenheimer Feld 229, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.;Foshag, K (corresponding author), Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg Sch Educ, Vossstr 2,Bldg 4330, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.",kathrin.leutz@iup.uni-heidelberg.de,"Höfle, Bernhard/A-4702-2010; Aeschbach, Werner/C-1026-2008; Aeschbach, Nicole/AAC-9458-2021","Höfle, Bernhard/0000-0001-5849-1461; Aeschbach, Werner/0000-0003-0917-1239; Aeschbach, Nicole/0000-0002-4479-3407","Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) of Germany [FKZ: 01DO19001]; Heidelberg School of Education (Heidelberg University); Heidelberg School of Education (University of Education Heidelberg, Germany); Federal Ministry of Education and Research(BMBF) of Germany [01JA1517A/01JA1517B]; Heidelberg School of Education","Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) of Germany(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Heidelberg School of Education (Heidelberg University); Heidelberg School of Education (University of Education Heidelberg, Germany); Federal Ministry of Education and Research(BMBF) of Germany(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Heidelberg School of Education","Sincere thanks are given to the City of Heidelberg, especially Christoph Czolbe, Sabine Lachenicht, Hubert Zimmerer, and colleagues for supporting different parts of the project.

Instead of a triple crop scheme like other areas in the Delta, a prawn and rice rotational cultivation scheme was initiated to facilitate agricultural production in Kien Giang. In this paper, the ecosystem services (ES) generated from the agriculture ecosystem under the prawn and rice rotational crops (PRRC) were assessed using an integrated approach. The specific ES identified here include water and nutrition regulation in the soil together with climate regulation in favor of the cultivated crops. A multi-disciplinary approach including remote sensing, GIS, social surveys and statistical analysis was adopted to comprehensively evaluate the geographical, biophysical, economic and social aspects of the ES. Firstly, Landsat 8 images were processed with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NVDI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) to identify the areas cultivating PRRC. The accuracy of image classification was assessed by ground truthing and we found an 80% coincidence between the simulated results and the field observations. Then, the social survey was conducted using face to face interviews at 50 local households to collect data related to farming practices. Economic values of ecosystem services were obtained using the revised market methods by annual crop yields per unit area. The mean estimated value of ES provided through the PRRC was 1300 USD/ha/year (standard deviation of 600 USD/ha/year) which accounted for 38.1% and 59.4% of the averaged economic revenue and net benefit, respectively. The analysis of social survey data revealed the factors having the greatest effects on ecosystem services values were selling prices of prawn and farming experiences. Finally, results were synthesized with GIS to describe how ES values vary across the research area which facilitates effective communication of the importance of ES concepts to policy makers regarding land use planning and natural resources management decisions.

Several empirical studies have shown that the implementation of adaptation practices can reduce the adverse effects of CC. The likelihood of farmers performing adaptation practices is mostly influenced by the degree of CC impact that they perceive. Thus, we identified the characteristics of farmers that affect the degree of the CC impact that they perceive. We used data from the Indonesian Rice Farm Household survey consisting of 87,330 farmers. An ordered probit regression model was used to estimate the effect of each variable on the degree of the perceived impact of CC. The results of this study confirm those of previous empirical studies. Several variables that have been identified as having a positive effect on farmer adaptation practices, such as farmer education, land tenure, irrigation infrastructure, cropping system, chemical fertilizer application, access to extension services, and participation in farmer groups, negatively affect the degree of the perceived impact of CC. However, a different result was found in the estimation of the gender variable. We found that female farmers have a higher CC resilience and ability to withstand climatic shocks and risks than male farmers. Female farmers have a more positive perception of future farming conditions than male farmers. We recommend the implementation of a national adaptation policy that use and expand the channel of agricultural extension services to deliver the planned adaptation policy, and prioritizes farmers with insecure land tenure. Additionally, we encourage the increasing of female involvement in the CC adaptation practices and decision-making processes.","[Rondhi, Mohammad; Khasan, Ahmad Fatikhul] Univ Jember, Dept Agribusiness, Jember 68121, Indonesia; [Mori, Yasuhiro; Kondo, Takumi] Hokkaido Univ, Res Fac Agr, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan",Universitas Jember; Hokkaido University,"Rondhi, M; Khasan, AF (corresponding author), Univ Jember, Dept Agribusiness, Jember 68121, Indonesia.",rondhi.faperta@unej.ac.id; ahmad.fatih@unej.ac.id; ymouri@agecon.agr.hokudai.ac.jp; kondot@agecon.agr.hokudai.ac.jp,"Rondhi, Mohammad/W-2208-2019; KONDO, Takumi/HPE-7657-2023","Rondhi, Mohammad/0000-0002-6860-4957; Khasan, Ahmad/0000-0003-0209-834X",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [18K05839]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [18K05839] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Grant Number: 18K05839.",,102,17,17,3,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,MAY,2019,8,5,,,,,,,81,10.3390/land8050081,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land8050081,,,21,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,IE8YH,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000472659100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results indicate the direct effects of green and cool roofs at reducing overheating are much greater than the indirect cooling effect. A non-insulated cool roof was found to be the most effective strategy. By insulating the roof, the level of overheating was slightly reduced. Non-insulated green and cool roofs were more effective than insulated roofs at reducing levels of overheating. When using a 2050 weather file, the building frequently overheated without the use of green or cool roof.","[Virk, G.; Jansz, A.; Mavrogianni, A.; Davies, M.] UCL, Bartlett Sch Grad Studies, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England; [Mylona, A.] Chartered Inst Bldg Serv Engineers, London, England; [Stocker, J.] Cambridge Environm Res Consultants, Cambridge, England",University of London; University College London,"Virk, G (corresponding author), UCL, Bartlett Sch Grad Studies, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",gurdane.virk.11@ucl.ac.uk,"Davies, Michael/GWV-2527-2022","Mavrogianni, Anna/0000-0002-5104-1238; Stocker, Jenny/0000-0003-3243-7226; Davies, Michael/0000-0003-2173-7063","EPSRC; Chartered Institution of Building Service Engineers; Greater London Authority; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [1085987, EP/I02929X/1, EP/E016375/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/I02929X/1, EP/E016375/1] Funding Source: UKRI",EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Chartered Institution of Building Service Engineers; Greater London Authority; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work is part of an Engineering Doctorate funded jointly by the EPSRC and the Chartered Institution of Building Service Engineers and is supported by the Greater London Authority.,,66,26,26,1,40,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1420-326X,1423-0070,,INDOOR BUILT ENVIRON,Indoor Built Environ.,MAY,2014,23,3,,,SI,,504,520,,10.1177/1420326X14527976,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1420326X14527976,,,17,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",AJ3MT,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000337571400013,View Full Record in Web of Science

To aid decision-making under climate change, we developed a bottom-up approach for assessing the performance of flood management systems under climate uncertainty and nonstationarity. The developed bottom-up approach was applied to the American River, CA, USA flood management system by first identifying the sensitivity and vulnerability of the system to different climates. To do this, we developed a climate response surface by calculating and plotting Expected Annual Damages (EAD, $/year) under different flood regimes. Next, we determined a range of plausible future climate change and flood frequency scenarios by applying Bayesian statistical methods to projected future flows derived from a Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model forced with Global Circulation Model (GCM) output. We measured system robustness as the portion of plausible future scenarios under which the current flood system could meet its performance goal. Using this approach, we then evaluated the robustness of four proposed management strategies in the 2012 Central Valley Flood Protection Plan in terms of both flood risk and cost-effectiveness, to assess the performance of the strategies in the face of climate risks. Results indicated that the high sensitivity of the expected damages to changes in flood regimes makes the system extremely vulnerable to a large portion of the plausible range of future flood conditions. The management strategy that includes a combination of nature-based flood management actions along with engineered structures yields the greatest potential to increase system robustness in terms of maintaining EAD below an acceptable risk threshold. However, this strategy still leaves the system vulnerable to a wide range of plausible future conditions. As flood frequency regimes increase in intensity from the current conditions, the cost-effectiveness of the management strategies increases, to a point, before decreasing. This bottom up analysis demonstrated a viable decision-making approach for water managers in the face of uncertain and changing future conditions. Neglecting to use such an approach and omitting climate considerations from water resource planning could lead to strategies that do not perform as expected or which actually lead to mal-adaptations, increasing vulnerability to climate change.","[DiFrancesco, Kara] Wicked Water Strategies, Bend, OR 97701 USA; [Gitelman, Alix] Oregon State Univ, Dept Stat, Corvallis, OR 97731 USA; [Purkey, David] Stockholm Environm Inst, Bogota 110231, Colombia",Oregon State University,"DiFrancesco, K (corresponding author), Wicked Water Strategies, Bend, OR 97701 USA.",kara@wickedwaterstrategies.com; alix.gitelman@oregonstate.edu; david.purkey@sei.org,"DiFrancesco, Kara/AAF-3492-2020",,U.S. National Science Foundation [0846360],U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation under grant no. 0846360.,,55,3,3,1,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAR,2020,12,3,,,,,,,907,10.3390/w12030907,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12030907,,,23,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,LI1MS,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000529249500292,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study focused on the barriers impeding smallholder tomato farmers' adaptation strategies in the Offinso North District (OND) of Ghana. The analysis was performed using factor analysis and Crombach's Alpha coefficient. A total of 378 smallholder tomato farmers were randomly sampled for a face-to-face interview in the OND of Ghana. Using the quantitative factor analytical approach to analyse farmers' adaptation barriers will help provide a clear direction on the strategic ways of addressing the imperative constraints that hinder tomato growers' adaptive capacity to increase tomato food security in tomato producing communities. From the factor analysis results, the study concludes that personal barriers, institutional and labour barriers, irrigation technology barriers, inadequate credit and farm inputs barriers, cost of land barriers, facility barriers and lack of political will barriers are major barriers that impede tomato farmers' adaptive strategies. Also, the study revealed that age (P < 0.05), gender (P < 0.05) and marital status (P < 0.05) are major determinants that influence the barriers tomato farmers encounter in their adaptive responses to climate variability. The findings point out the need for government and development partners including non-governmental organizations to enhance the adaptive capacities of farmers through the provision of adequate credit facilities and other farming logistics to build farmers' resilience to increase tomato production in the OND of Ghana.","[Guodaar, Lawrence; Asante, Felix] Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geog & Rural Dev, Coll Humanities & Social Sci, Fac Social Sci,PMB, Univ PO, Kumasi, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Guodaar, L (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geog & Rural Dev, Coll Humanities & Social Sci, Fac Social Sci,PMB, Univ PO, Kumasi, Ghana.",guodaarlaw@gmail.com; couzon_species@yahoo.com,,"Guodaar, Lawrence/0000-0003-3227-6709",,,,,35,6,6,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1932,,,COGENT FOOD AGR,Cogent Food Agr.,AUG 14,2018,4,1,,,,,,,15045071504507,10.1080/23311932.2018.1504507,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2018.1504507,,,15,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Agriculture,HI5FD,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000456477000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We present national-level eco-efficiency metrics in several representative production countries during the most recent decade (2000-2010) for four important crops: canola, cotton, maize, and soybeans. The metrics address greenhouse gas emissions and the utilization of land, water, and energy - all calculated per unit of production. We group countries based on their level of agricultural intensification and find that high-intensification countries are achieving the highest and yet still increasing levels of eco-efficiency, with these decadal gains: canola (26%), cotton (23%), maize (17%), and soybeans (18%). By stark contrast, low-intensification countries had no change in eco-efficiency during this same decade. Overall, our results suggest large opportunities for additional improvements in the developing world, and that cumulative resource savings through intensification have been significant. For instance, in the case of irrigated maize, if the high- and medium-intensification production countries had only achieved the same irrigation water-use efficiency as in the low-intensification countries, approximately 4 quadrillion (4x10(15)) more litres of irrigation water would have been consumed during the period 2000-2010.","[Gustafson, David I.] Int Life Sci Inst Res Fdn, CIMSANS, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Collins, Michael; Fry, Jonna; Smith, Saori] ERM, London EC3A 8AA, England; [Matlock, Marty] Univ Arkansas, Coll Engn, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Zilberman, David] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shryock, Jereme; Doane, Michael] Monsanto Co, St Louis, MO 63167 USA; [Ramsey, Nathan] Context Network, W Des Moines, IA 50266 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Monsanto,"Gustafson, DI (corresponding author), Int Life Sci Inst Res Fdn, CIMSANS, 1156 15th St NW,Suite 200, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",dgustafson@ilsi.org,,"Matlock, Marty/0000-0003-0176-3969",,,,,27,8,9,3,76,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1473-5903,1747-762X,,INT J AGR SUSTAIN,Int.

The water resources in urban areas are either approaching or exceeding the limits of sustainable use at alarming rates. Groundwater table depletion and increasing flood events can be easily realized in rapidly developing urban areas. It is necessary to improve existing water management systems for high-quality water and reduced hydro meteorological disasters, while preserving our natural/pristine environment in a sustainable manner. This can be achieved through optimal collection, infiltration and storage of stormwater. Stormwater runoff is rainfall that flows over the ground surface; large volumes of water are swiftly transported to local water bodies and can cause flooding, coastal erosion, and can carry many different pollutants that are found on paved surfaces. Sustainable stormwater management is desired, and the optimal capture measure is explored in the paper. This study provides commentary to assist policy makers and researchers in the field of stormwater management planning to understand the significance and role of remote sensing and GIS in designing optimal capture measures under the threat of future extreme events and climate change. Community attitudes, which are influenced by a range of factors, including knowledge of urban water problem, are also considered. In this paper, we present an assessment of stormwater runoff management practices to achieve urban water security. For this purpose, we explored different characteristics of stormwater runoff management policies and strategies adopted by Japan, Vietnam and Thailand. This study analyses the abilities of Japanese, Vietnamese and Thai stormwater runoff management policies and measures to manage water scarcity and achieve water resiliency. This paper presents an overview of stormwater runoff management to guide future optimal stormwater runoff measures and management policies within the governance structure. Additionally, the effects of different onsite facilities, including those for water harvesting, reuse, ponds and infiltration, are explored to establish adaptation strategies that restore water cycle and reduce climate change-induced flood and water scarcity on a catchment scale.

The main goal of this study is to assess the impacts of climate change on Cooling Degree Days computed with wet-bulb temperature (CDDwb) and household space cooling demand in Brazil. We compare the needs under three specific warming levels (SWLs) scenarios (1.5 degrees C, 2 degrees C and 4 degrees C) to a baseline with historically observed meteorological parameters by combining CDDwb projections with an end-use model to evaluate the energy requirements of air conditioning. The effects of the climate change were isolated, and no future expansion in AC ownership considered. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with AC energy demand are also calculated. Results show an increase in both average CDDwb and AC electricity consumption for the global warming scenarios in all Brazilian regions. The Northern region shows the highest increase in CDDwb (187% in CDDwb for SWL 4 degrees C), while the Southeast presents the highest AC energy consumption response (326% in the AC energy consumption for SWL 4 degrees C) compared to the baseline.

The fragile institutional capabilities induce the transitioning towards the sustainable urban water paradigm to accommodate the complexities and uncertainties. This research methodically draws sustainable water management strategies to achieve water security after a critical literature review, trends and policy analysis, and scenario modeling of the study area. First, research systematically illustrated the analysis of unmet water demand and coverage during the study period (2015-2030) and evaluated the impact of external factors such as population growth, living standard, and climate change on the current water system of the Kathmandu Valley. The results showed that future water demand is likely to reach 765 MLD by the year 2030 from the estimated current demand of 388.1 MLD. Also, external factors will increase the pressure on the current water supply-demand systems, and hence exacerbate the water stress but result showed the negligible impact of climate change during the study period. The research explored the significance of Melamchi Water Supply Project (MWSP) and found that the effective implementation of MWSP will decrease the unmet water demand by 56-66% in the valley. In the second part, comparative analysis of different management strategies under four future scenarios (optimistic, moderate I and II and business-as-usual) were carried out.

Fieldwork was carried out in two parks (in Utrecht and Wageningen, the Netherlands) during summer and tropical days (Ta max > 25 C and >30 C, respectively), the latter representing future climate conditions. Behavioural responses (park attendance, spatio-temporal user patterns) and thermal perception of resting park visitors were studied through unobtrusive observations (N=11337) and surveys (N=317). Outcomes were related to air temperature (Ta) of meteorological reference stations and spatial data on the vegetation structures of the parks. Observational data show that daily park attendance decreased with rising Ta max. Survey results indicate that resting park visitors perceived a high level of thermal comfort during all investigated days. Park visitors chose resting locations predominantly based on solar exposure conditions (sun, half shade, shade). Those solar exposure preferences were significantly related to Ta: with increased Ta the number of park visitors in the shade increased and decreased in the sun (p < 0.001) with a tipping point of 26 C. These results indicate that parks in moderate climates may guarantee a high level of thermal comfort, even on tropical days, if a variety of solar exposure conditions is guaranteed. A ratio of 40% sun, 20% half shade and 40% shade in parks was derived from spatio-temporal user patterns, which appear to accommodate preferences of resting park visitors under summer and tropical thermal conditions and on various daytimes. These results and a spatial typology of tree configurations for microclimatic variety provide direction for designing future parks: they need to offer a wide range of sun-exposed, half shaded and shaded places to accommodate for different user needs and future climate conditions.

In particular, urban heat islands caused by increasing average temperatures and urban growth are a challenge for cities. The use of climate simulations to assess current and future urban heat stress is a helpful approach for supporting this transition. In particular, green and blue infrastructure helps to reduce the urban heat island effect. These cooling effects can be analysed using simulations. However, a central challenge is that urban adaptation to heat needs to be implemented consistently at different planning levels. A second major challenge in adaption is identifying the amount of urban green infrastructure required in order to achieve a specific cooling benefit and establishing this by means of planning instruments. This article presents two case studies in the city of Vienna to demonstrate how climate simulation tools can be used across different planning levels if they are standardized. When combined with a green and open space factor as a steering instrument, the necessary amount of greening for subsequent planning processes can be secured. The result is a multi-scale toolset consisting of three climate simulation models and a green and open space factor, coordinated, and standardised for use at different levels of planning.","[Reinwald, Florian; Brandenburg, Christiane; Gabor, Anna; Ring, Zita; Damyanovic, Doris] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Landscape Planning, Dept Landscape Spatial & Infrastructure Sci, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Hinterkoerner, Peter] Wien 3420 Aspern Dev AG, A-1220 Vienna, Austria; [Kainz, Astrid] Zent Anstalt Meteorol & Geodynam, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Kraus, Florian; Scharf, Bernhard] Green4C GmbH, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Toetzer, Tanja] AIT Austrian Inst Technol GmbH, A-1210 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT)","Reinwald, F (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Landscape Planning, Dept Landscape Spatial & Infrastructure Sci, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",florian.reinwald@boku.ac.at; christiane.brandenburg@boku.ac.at; anna.gabor@boku.ac.at; p.hinterkoerner@wien3420.at; astrid.kainz@zamg.ac.at; florian.kraus@green4cities.com; zita.ring@boku.ac.at; bernhard.scharf@green4cities.com; tanja.toetzer@ait.ac.at; doris.damyanovic@boku.ac.at,,"Gabor, Anna/0000-0003-1851-3907; Reinwald, Florian/0000-0001-9763-3389; Totzer, Tanja/0000-0001-6140-0655; Brandenburg, Christiane/0000-0002-7221-1451","Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK); City of the Future (Stadt der Zukunft) research program by FFG [861673]; BOKU Vienna","Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK); City of the Future (Stadt der Zukunft) research program by FFG; BOKU Vienna","The Green.Resilient.City research project was funded by Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK) and carried out as part of the City of the Future (Stadt der Zukunft) research program by FFG., grant number 861673and The APC was funded by BOKU Vienna Open Access Publishing Fund.",,81,2,2,16,36,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2021,13,21,,,,,,,12111,10.3390/su132112111,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132112111,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WZ5NS,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000720014300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the third environmental epoch, policy efforts have primarily been framed within the context of sustainability and focus on applying comprehensive, bottom-up policy and planning initiatives. Despite its practical approach for addressing cross-cutting environmental issues, the sustainable communities paradigm has fallen short of facilitating a transformation in which U.S. society subsists within the Earth system's ecological limits. As a result of the sustainability epoch's policy failures, environmental policy practitioners have increasingly applied the concept of resilience to frame policy discussions. This study draws from resilience theory and applies the environmental epoch framework to conceptualize the emergence of a fourth epoch in U.S. environmental politics and policy, governing for resilience. An examination of the features that distinguish an environmental epoch that centers on resilience contributes to theory and provides practical insight for policymakers by identifying opportunities to prepare for ongoing and unprecedented environmental challenges.","[Fiack, Duran] CUNY, Lehman Coll, Dept Polit Sci, 250 Bedford Pk Blvd W, Bronx, NY 10468 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Lehman College (CUNY),"Fiack, D (corresponding author), CUNY, Lehman Coll, Dept Polit Sci, 250 Bedford Pk Blvd W, Bronx, NY 10468 USA.",Duran.Fiack@lehman.cuny.edu,,"Fiack, Duran/0000-0001-8695-6027",,,,,146,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

The latter, taking into account some adaptation mechanisms that the stakeholders may have, based on their current culture, traditions and knowledge. Different surveys were applied as a tool to obtain information. A total of 298 surveys were carried out and distributed in four communities of the municipality: Zopoco (49), Tanaquillo (50), Carapan (59), Ichan (37) and the municipal head Chilchota (103). Multivariate techniques were applied on the surveys to reduce the data structure into groups of variables. Results show that the indigenous population of the Chilchota municipality perceives local changes in the climate attributed to several anthropogenic actions developed in recent years (logging, trash burning, pollution, etc.). They do not associate such changes with the phenomenon of climate change. Agricultural planting schedules in the region have been adjusted as an adaptive measure to the perceived changes. These climate changes are consistent with the average annual temperature and precipitation behavior for the 1968-2007 periods. For this period the temperature showed an increase of 0.5 degrees C, meanwhile precipitation was reduced to 150 mm per year.","[Gonzalez Martinez, Sandra Llovizna; Silva Garcia, Jose Teodoro; Avila Melendez, Luis Arturo; Cruz Cardenas, Gustavo; Ceja Torres, Luis Fernando] Inst Politecn Nac, Ctr Interdisciplinario Invest Desarrollo Integral, Unidad Michoacan, Justo Sierra 28, Jiquilpan 59510, Michoacan, Mexico; [Moncayo-Estrada, Rodrigo] Inst Politecn Nac, Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas, Ave Inst Politecn Nacl, La Paz 23096, Baja California, Mexico",,"Silva Garcia, JT (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Nac, Ctr Interdisciplinario Invest Desarrollo Integral, Unidad Michoacan, Justo Sierra 28, Jiquilpan 59510, Michoacan, Mexico.",tsilva09@hotmail.com,"Moncayo-Estrada, Rodrigo/AFO-3255-2022; Cruz-Cárdenas, Gustavo/A-6621-2011; Avila-Meléndez, LuisArturo/N-6658-2013","Moncayo-Estrada, Rodrigo/0000-0003-0204-1482; Avila-Meléndez, LuisArturo/0000-0002-4219-5753",,,,,39,3,3,0,1,CENTRO CIENCIAS ATMOSFERA UNAM,MEXICO CITY,"CIRCUITO EXTERIOR, MEXICO CITY CU 04510, MEXICO",0188-4999,,,REV INT CONTAM AMBIE,Rev.

This paper presents adjustments to tools and approaches, in particular the Urban Climate Maps framework, typically produced in industrialized countries for contexts relevant to developing countries, where accurate urban data are often not available. In this study, relevant urban, architectural and land use data were collected and constructed to enable numerical simulations of a heat wave episode in the Greater Metropolitan area of Tunis. The simulation results indicate that the diurnal heat stress reached very high values corresponding to an extreme heat stress level, according to the Urban Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) scale, by 9 a.m. local time. The highest sea-breeze speeds were over the sea (similar to 8 m s(-1)). However, the effect of the sea breeze was low over densely urbanized areas (<3 m s(-1)). At night, the intensity of the urban heat island reached +4.5 degrees C. Urban climatic maps were produced via a statistical analysis of the numerical simulation outputs for the diurnal heat stress and the urban heat island intensity. The impact of the sea breeze on the heat stress level is communicated using two UTCI maps. Strategic maps were also proposed to highlight critical areas for urban actors. These strategic maps illustrate the zoning of relevant territorial issues to facilitate dialog with the Urban Planning Agency of the Greater Metropolitan area of Tunis.","[Mhedhbi, Zohra; Hidalgo, Julia; Haoues-Jouve, Sinda; Touati, Najla] Jean Jaures Univ, Interdisciplinary Ctr Urban Studies CIEU, Lab Interdisciplinaire Solidarites Soc LISST, CNRS, Toulouse, France; [de Munck, Cecile; Masson, Valery] Natl Ctr Meteorol Res CNRM, UMR 3589, Meteo France CNRS, 42 Ave Gaspard Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse 1, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite de Toulouse - Jean Jaures; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France,"Mhedhbi, Z (corresponding author), Jean Jaures Univ, Interdisciplinary Ctr Urban Studies CIEU, Lab Interdisciplinaire Solidarites Soc LISST, CNRS, Toulouse, France.",zohra.mhedhbi@univ-tlse2.fr; julia.hidalgo@univ-tlse2.fr; cecile.demunck@meteo.fr; sinda.haoues-jouve@univ-tlse2.fr; najla.touati@univ-tlse2.fr; valery.masson@meteo.fr,,,,,,,28,0,0,1,1,CYBERGEO,PARIS,"13 RUE DU FOUR, PARIS, 75006, FRANCE",1278-3366,,,CYBERGEO,CyberGeo,,2022,,,,,,,,,,10.4000/cybergeo.39297,http://dx.doi.org/10.4000/cybergeo.39297,,,23,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,7C2XY,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000899682200032,View Full Record in Web of Science

Almost one in seven people on the planet are expected to reside in urban informal settlements, or slums, by 2030. Slum upgrading is the process of delivering place-based environmental and social improvements to the urban poor, including land tenure, housing, infrastructure, employment, health services and political and social inclusion. The processes and products of slum upgrading can address multiple environmental determinants of health. This paper reviewed urban slum upgrading evaluations from cities across Asia, Africa and Latin America and found that few captured the multiple health benefits of upgrading. With the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) focused on improving well-being for billions of city-dwellers, slum upgrading should be viewed as a key strategy to promote health, equitable development and reduce climate change vulnerabilities. We conclude with suggestions for how slum upgrading might more explicitly capture its health benefits, such as through the use of health impact assessment (HIA) and adopting an urban health in all policies (HiAP) framework. Urban slum upgrading must be more explicitly designed, implemented and evaluated to capture its multiple global environmental health benefits.","[Corburn, Jason] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept City & Reg Planning, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Corburn, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept City & Reg Planning, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jcorburn@berkeley.edu; sverdlik@berkeley.edu,,"Corburn, Jason/0000-0002-2160-348X; Sverdlik, Alice/0000-0002-1109-073X",,,,,82,43,45,2,58,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1660-4601,,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The study is conducted in Campania Region (Southern Italy), with reference to the irrigation seasons (April-September) of years 2008-2018. Temperature, wind speed, vapor pressure deficit, solar radiation and ET(0)derived from reanalysis datasets, were compared with the corresponding estimates obtained by spatially interpolating data observed by a network of 18 automatic weather stations (AWSs). Statistical performances of the spatial interpolations were evaluated with a cross-validation procedure, by recursively applying universal kriging or ordinary kriging to the observed weather data. ERA5-Land outperformed UMS both in weather data and ET(0)estimates. Averaging over all 18 AWSs sites in the region, the normalized BIAS (nBIAS) was found less than 5% for all the databases. The normalized RMSE (nRMSE) for ET(0)computed with E5L data was 17%, while it was 22% with UMS data. Both performances were not far from those obtained by kriging interpolation, which presented an average nRMSE of 14%. Overall, this study confirms that reanalysis can successfully surrogate the unavailability of observed weather data for the regional assessment of ET0.","[Pelosi, Anna] Univ Salerno, Dept Civil Engn, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy; [Pelosi, Anna; Terribile, Fabio; D'Urso, Guido] Univ Naples Federico II, Interdept Res Ctr Earth Crit Zone CRISP, I-80055 Portici, NA, Italy; [Terribile, Fabio; D'Urso, Guido; Chirico, Giovanni Battista] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, I-80055 Portici, NA, Italy",University of Salerno; University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II,"Pelosi, A (corresponding author), Univ Salerno, Dept Civil Engn, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy.;Pelosi, A (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Interdept Res Ctr Earth Crit Zone CRISP, I-80055 Portici, NA, Italy.;Chirico, GB (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, I-80055 Portici, NA, Italy.",apelosi@unisa.it; fabio.terribile@unina.it; guido.durso@unina.it; gchirico@unina.it,"D'Urso, Guido/HLX-0400-2023; Pelosi, A./Z-1329-2019","D'Urso, Guido/0000-0002-0251-4668; Pelosi, A./0000-0002-2306-5793; Chirico, Giovanni Battista/0000-0002-9536-4741",European Union [774234],European Union(European Commission),"This research has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 774234 Landsupport, coordinated by the Interdepartmental Research Centre on the Earth Critical Zone (CRISP) of the University of Naples Federico II.",,76,64,66,8,42,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUN,2020,12,6,,,,,,,1669,10.3390/w12061669,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12061669,,,22,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,MN5BF,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000550856100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The International Climate Conference COP26 evidences the relevance of the climate issue at the global level in Glasgow (November 2021). A decrease in natural energy resources leads to a search for alternative energy sources. Given this, this article is devoted to studying the peculiarities of the transition to climate management of the green energy transmission chain based on the circular economy and smart technologies. This paper has used simulation modeling to develop an algorithm for applying a smart approach to climate management of the green energy transmission chain based on the work of Industry 4.0 technologies. The result of this modeling will be the importance of strengthening the ability to develop intersectoral partnerships to create climate-energy clusters based on a closed cycle of using energy resources and developing smart technologies. At the same time, it has been found that COVID-19 has changed the behaviour of energy consumers towards the transition to the use of energy from renewable sources that are carbon neutral. With this in mind, this article has assessed the climate capacity of industries to use green energy from renewable sources based on resource conservation (rational use of energy resources) and climate neutrality. The industries of Ukraine, which are the largest consumers of energy and, at the same time, significantly affected by climate change, were taken for the study: industry, transport, and agriculture. The methodology for determining the indicator of the climate capacity of sectors in the transition to green energy has been based on the correlation index (ratio) of the consumption indicator of various types of energy by industries (petroleum products; natural gas; biofuels and waste; electricity) and the indicator of gross value added of industries in pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 conditions. The results have indicated that the use of energy from renewable sources (biofuels and waste) for the production of goods and services, as well as the economical nature of the provision of raw materials (biomass and faeces) are factors that ensure climate industry neutrality and enhance its climate capability. The prospects of such effects of assessing the climate capacity of sectors will be the basis for the rationale to develop intersectoral partnerships to create climate-energy clusters based on a closed cycle of using energy resources and developing smart technologies.","[Borysiak, Olena; Brych, Vasyl] West Ukrainian Natl Univ, Educ & Res Inst Innovat Environm Management & Inf, UA-46009 Ternopol, Ukraine; [Wolowiec, Tomasz; Dluhopolskyi, Oleksandr] Univ Econ & Innovat Lublin, Inst Publ Adm & Business, PL-20209 Lublin, Poland; [Gliszczynski, Grzegorz] Lublin Univ Technol, Fac Management, PL-20618 Lublin, Poland; [Dluhopolskyi, Oleksandr] West Ukrainian Natl Univ, Fac Econ & Management, UA-46009 Ternopol, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Western Ukrainian National University; Lublin University of Technology; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Western Ukrainian National University,"Dluhopolskyi, O (corresponding author), Univ Econ & Innovat Lublin, Inst Publ Adm & Business, PL-20209 Lublin, Poland.;Dluhopolskyi, O (corresponding author), West Ukrainian Natl Univ, Fac Econ & Management, UA-46009 Ternopol, Ukraine.",dlugopolsky77@gmail.com,"Dluhopolskyi, Oleksandr/H-2339-2017; 郭, 青霞/GZH-2618-2022; Borysiak, Olena/N-8803-2018","Dluhopolskyi, Oleksandr/0000-0002-2040-8762; Borysiak, Olena/0000-0003-4818-8068",,,,,38,3,3,7,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2022,14,18,,,,,,,11449,10.3390/su141811449,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141811449,,,11,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,4S8ZP,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000857722000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, other types of stakeholder interactions are possible. This paper uses the ecology of games to frame an investigation into stakeholder participation in the policy networks for regional climate change planning for South East Queensland, Australia. We tracked organisational participation in policy forums between 2008 and 2012. We then used a novel bipartite network theoretical approach to identify participation by different types of organisations across shared multiple forums, which we argue prefaces: cooperation, collaboration, support or advocacy. Network analysis was then combined with semi-structured interviews to access how scientific information was utilised across the regional network. Our results suggest that stakeholder interactions were predominately used to advocate for organisational agendas. Advocacy artificially narrows the scope of possible policy options and represents a biased, selective use of information. While advocacy is an important part of policy process, as a counter balance, explicit efforts are needed to recurrently expand the scope of policy options.","[McAllister, Ryan R.

The adaptation process induced a grouping effect of gilts around the mean age of the onset of puberty. Autumn and spring were characterized by the most enhanced gilt grouping effect at 201 to 210 days of age. The same effect was found for oestrus duration, which declined from a 12- to 96-hour range in the first year to an 18- to 90-hour range in the second year. The mean age of first oestrus was 0.8 days significantly lower in the second year compared with the first; the maximal lowering (1.7 days) occurred in the winter season. The WEI decreased significantly from the first to the second year in all four seasons, by a mean annual value of 0.88 days (15.9%). DE increased by 6.5 hours (significantly for all seasons) from the first year to the next.

Conflicting evidence as to the relative importance of these factors complicates our ability to interpret variation in robusticity in the past. It remains unclear how the pattern of robusticity in the skeleton relates to adaptive constraints on skeletal morphology. This study investigates variation in robusticity in claviculae, humeri, ulnae, femoral and tibiae among human foragers, relative to climate and habitual behavior. Cross-sectional geometric properties of the diaphyses are compared among hunter-gatherers from southern Africa (n = 83), the Andaman Islands (n = 32), Tierra del Fuego (n = 34), and the Great Lakes region (n = 15). The robusticity of both proximal and distal limb segments correlates negatively with climate and positively with patterns of terrestrial and marine mobility among these groups. However, the relative correspondence between robusticity and these factors varies throughout the body. In the lower limb, partial correlations between polar second moment of area (J(0.73)) and climate decrease from proximal to distal section locations, while this relationship increases from proximal to distal in the upper limb. Patterns of correlation between robusticity and mobility, either terrestrial or marine, generally increase from proximal to distal in the lower and upper limbs, respectively. This suggests that there may be a stronger relationship between observed patterns of diaphyseal hypertrophy and behavioral differences between populations in distal elements. Despite this trend, strength circularity indices at the femoral midshaft show the strongest correspondence with terrestrial mobility, particularly among males.","Univ Cambridge, Leverhulme Ctr Human Evolutionary Studies, Dept Biol Anthropol, Cambridge CB2 1QH, England",University of Cambridge,"Stock, JT (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Leverhulme Ctr Human Evolutionary Studies, Dept Biol Anthropol, Fitzwilliam St, Cambridge CB2 1QH, England.",j.stock@human-evol.cam.ac.uk,"Stock, Jay/B-6453-2011","Stock, Jay/0000-0003-0147-8631",Natural Environment Research Council [NER/M/S/2003/00069] Funding Source: researchfish,Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,104,144,155,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9483,1096-8644,,AM J PHYS ANTHROPOL,Am.

However, the comprehensive analyses on the climate-smartness of current agricultural production systems have been lack. Here, we assessed the changes in agricultural production systems and their influences on food productivity, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, food carbon footprint (CF), nitrogen and water use efficiency, and economic profit of major crops in the North China Plain (NCP) at sub-provincial level over 2000-2016. We further identified the prior areas and agronomic management practices to be improved where nitrogen and water use efficiency was low, CF was high, or/and economic profit was low. The results showed that wheat, maize, vegetables, and oil crops were always dominant crops in the NCP and maize planting area increased most among all crops types over 2000-2016. The non-uniformity of agricultural landscape led to the decline of Shannon-Wiener Index and Simpson's diversity Index. Agricultural GHG emissions and CF had spatially explicit patterns, along with crop yields and agricultural inputs. Among the agricultural inputs, fertilizer played a dominant role and contributed about 58.0%, 81.6%, and 77.3% respectively to the CF of wheat, maize, and oil crops, and plastic film contributed up to 55.1% to the CF of vegetables. The CF had a decreasing trend, while nitrogen use efficiency, irrigation water use efficiency and economic profit had an increasing trend, mainly due to increased yields, reduced agricultural inputs including fertilizers and irrigation, and improved agronomic managements. This study demonstrates a framework to evaluate and improve the climate-smartness of agricultural production system accounting for the multiple objectives simultaneously, and provides theoretical guidance and practical methods for government and farmers to improve agricultural production systems.

Sudden increases in solar power facilities have caused the physical destruction of wildlife habitats, thereby resulting in the decline of biodiversity and ecosystem functions. However, previous assessments have been based on the environmental impact of large solar photovoltaics (PVs). The impact of medium-sized PV facilities (0.5-10 MW), which can alter small habitat patches through the accumulation of installations has not been assessed. Here, we quantified the amount of habitat loss directly related to the construction of PV facilities with different size classes and estimated their siting attributes using construction patterns in Japan and South Korea. We identified that a comparable amount of natural and semi-natural habitats were lost due to the recent installation of medium solar facilities (approximately 66.36 and 85.73% of the overall loss in Japan and South Korea, respectively). Compared to large solar PVs, medium PV installations resulted in a higher area loss of semi-natural habitats, including secondary/planted forests, secondary/artificial grasslands, and agricultural lands. The siting attributes of medium and large solar PV facilities indicated a preference for cost-based site selec-tion rather than prioritizing habitat protection for biodiversity conservation. Moreover, even conservation areas were developed when economic and topological conditions were suitable for energy production. Our simulations indicate that increasing the construction of PVs in urban areas could help reduce the loss of natural and semi -natural habitats. To improve the renewable energy share while mitigating the impacts on biodiversity, our results stress the need for a proactive assessment to enforce sustainable site-selection criteria for solar PVs in renewable energy initiatives. The revised criteria should consider the cumulative impacts of varied size classes of solar power facilities, including medium PVs, and the diverse aspects of the ecological value of natural habitats.

The recurrence of extreme climate events is projected to be intensified in cities in the next decades, especially in the most vulnerable areas of the world, such as the Mediterranean region. In this context, the urban green infrastructure (UGI) is presented as a nature-based solution that directly contributes to climate change mitigation in Mediterranean compact cities and improves health, social, welfare, and environmental conditions for inhabitants. This research sets out a manageable framework to define, locate, and categorize more functional green urban and peri-urban areas in a dense Mediterranean city. It takes spatial distribution, extension, and the capacity to improve inhabitants' wellbeing through the provision of ecosystem services as classification criteria. Results show a scenario with a greater functional green surface available for the citizens to be managed. Identified areas have been categorized as cores, nodes, links, and green spaces defined as other areas. In particular, the latter play a significant role at social, structural, and ecological levels. The study showcases that rethinking urban design and strategic decision-making around these areas can enhance green equity in Mediterranean dense cities, their capacity to better deal with environmental extremes, and the inhabitants' engagement with a culture of sustainability and wellbeing.","[Delgado-Capel, Manuel; Carinanos, Paloma] Univ Granada, Dept Bot, Cartuja Campus, Granada 18071, Spain; [Carinanos, Paloma] Univ Granada, Andalusian Inst Earth Syst Res IISTA CEAMA, Granada 18071, Spain",University of Granada; Universidad de Cordoba; Universidad de Jaen; University of Granada; Instituto Interuniversitario de Investigacion del Sistema Tierra en Andalucia,"Delgado-Capel, M (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Dept Bot, Cartuja Campus, Granada 18071, Spain.",mdelgado@correo.ugr.es; palomacg@ugr.es,"Carinanos, Paloma/K-5696-2014","Carinanos, Paloma/0000-0002-8955-2383; Delgado-Capel, Manuel/0000-0001-7428-7161",,,,,114,4,4,5,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,DEC,2020,11,12,,,,,,,1246,10.3390/f11121246,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f11121246,,,22,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Forestry,PJ9XR,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000602111100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We developed the Green Schoolyards Project to investigate how green features-trees, gardens, and nature trails-in school parks impact heat index (i.e., air temperature and relative humidity) within parks, and physical activity levels and socioemotional well-being of these children. Herein, we present novel methods for a) observing children's interaction with green features and b) measuring heat index and children's behaviors in a natural setting, and a selection of baseline results.MethodsDuring two September weeks (high temperature) and one November week (moderate temperature) in 2019, we examined three joint-use elementary school parks in Central Texas, United States, serving predominantly low-income Latinx families. To develop thermal profiles for each park, we installed 10 air temperature/relative humidity sensors per park, selecting sites based on land cover, land use, and even spatial coverage. We measured green features within a geographic information system. In a cross-sectional study, we used an adapted version of System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities (SOPARC) to assess children's physical activity levels and interactions with green features. In a cohort study, we equipped 30 3rd and 30 4th grade students per school during recess with accelerometers and Global Positioning System devices, and surveyed these students regarding their connection to nature. Baseline analyses included inverse distance weighting for thermal profiles and summing observed counts of children interacting with trees.ResultsIn September 2019, average daily heat index ranged 2.0 degrees F among park sites, and maximum daily heat index ranged from 103.4 degrees F (air temperature = 33.8 degrees C; relative humidity = 55.2%) under tree canopy to 114.1 degrees F (air temperature = 37.9 degrees C; relative humidity = 45.2%) on an unshaded playground. 10.8% more girls and 25.4% more boys interacted with trees in September than in November.ConclusionsWe found extreme heat conditions at select sites within parks, and children positioning themselves under trees during periods of high heat index. These methods can be used by public health researchers and practitioners to inform the redesign of greenspaces in the face of climate change and health inequities.","[Lanza, Kevin; Hoelscher, Deanna M.; Kohl, Harold W.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Michael & Susan Ctr Hlth Living, Sch Publ Hlth Austin, 1616 Guadalupe St Suite 6-300, Austin, TX 78701 USA; [Alcazar, Melody] Austin Pk & Recreat Dept, 919 W 28th 1-2 St, Austin, TX 78705 USA; [Kohl, Harold W.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Publ Hlth Austin, Dept Epidemiol Human Genet & Environm Sci, 1616 Guadalupe St Suite 6-300, Austin, TX 78701 USA; [Kohl, Harold W.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Kinesiol & Hlth Educ, 2109 San Jacinto Blvd, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Lanza, K (corresponding author), Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Michael & Susan Ctr Hlth Living, Sch Publ Hlth Austin, 1616 Guadalupe St Suite 6-300, Austin, TX 78701 USA.",Kevin.L.Lanza@uth.tmc.edu,"Lanza, Kevin/ABD-8011-2020","Lanza, Kevin/0000-0002-5259-6745; Hoelscher, Deanna/0000-0002-0910-5031",Robert Wood Johnson Foundation [76576]; Michael & Susan Dell Foundation,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation(Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)); Michael & Susan Dell Foundation,"This work was supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation [grant number 76576].

Although this idea historically implemented in the city of Yazd, Iran, its effects on thermal comfort have not been studied thoroughly. This paper aims to discuss and analyze energy performance, in terms of parameters such as orientation, underground depth, nocturnal ventilation and its subsequent effects on thermal comfort in earth-sheltered buildings in Yazd. Design/methodology/approach Using EnergyPlus software, the obtained numeric data are precisely modeled, simulated and analyzed. Findings Results show that there is a direct relationship between depth of construction and energy consumption savings. The more construction depth of earth-sheltered buildings, the more percentage of energy consumption savings, that is of a higher rate in comparison to the aboveground ones. However, in south orientation, energy saving significantly reduces from depth of 2 m downwards and the annual indoor temperature fluctuation decreases by 50%. This subsequently yields to experiencing indoor thermal comfort for a significant number of days throughout the year. Considering the effects of orientation factor, the south orientation regardless of the depth provides the most desired outcome regarding energy savings. Originality/value Simulating the model generalized to the sunken courtyard can approve that the results of this research can be applied to the other models.","[Mirabi, Elahe] Shariati Tech Coll, Tehran, Iran; [Abarghuie, Fatemeh Akrami] Yazd Univ, Fac Architecture, Yazd, Iran",University of Yazd,"Abarghuie, FA (corresponding author), Yazd Univ, Fac Architecture, Yazd, Iran.",nafisse.akrami@gmail.com,,"Mirabi, Elahe/0000-0002-3038-0345",,,,,92,3,3,3,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2398-4708,,,INT J BUILD PATHOL,Int.

We developed three case studies based on field observations in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as information from the literature. Our key findings are: (1) the forest-related water cycle of the Congo Basin is not stable, and is gradually changing; (2) climate change is impacting the water cycle of the basin; and, (3) the slow modification of the water cycle is affecting livelihoods in the Congo Basin.

Despite this, relatively little attention is paid to building their capacity to manage the impacts of climate change they experience now and those they will experience in future. While child-centred approaches are starting to emerge in the field of community-based adaptation, these approaches are almost exclusively used by child-focused organizations. This article argues that mainstreaming children's needs and capacities into broader adaptation efforts can lead to more sustainable outcomes that can help to build long-term community-level adaptive capacity. A series of short examples from the field are used to highlight the different contexts in which child-centred approaches to community-based adaptation are taking place and some outcomes achieved to date. The article concludes that while there is a growing body of anecdotal evidence that taking a child-centred approach to community-based adaptation can build the adaptive capacity of children and also provide benefits to entire communities, there is no solid evidence-base proving that what has worked in a growing number of cases is more broadly applicable, translatable to other regions or sustainable in the absence of direct project support. The article recommends that collaborative efforts between researchers and practitioners should be launched to gather this evidence.","[Mitchell, Paul] Save Children, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Borchard, Caroline] Plan Int, Bangkok, Thailand",Save the Children,"Mitchell, P (corresponding author), Save Children, Hanoi, Vietnam.",paul@adapt-develop.com,,"Mitchell, Paul/0000-0003-1748-6521",,,,,48,19,19,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

We summarize the contributions included in this TS that provide examples of emerging climate change impacts, assess system risks at subnational and international scales, prove and evaluate different adaptation options and approaches, and explore societal and stakeholder perceptions. We also provide some food for thought on possible future developments in a transdisciplinary adaptation science working at the interface between ecology, socio-economics, and policy-governance, and that will have to provide concrete solutions to the challenges represented by climate-change and anthropogenic activity. Success will depend on the extent to which new knowledge and approaches can be integrated into the decision-making process to support evidence-based climate policy and ecosystem-based management.

The tool was developed based on analyzing a large dataset (more than 3000 road sections) extracted from the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) database. Several algorithms were examined: two decision trees, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), naive Bayes classifier, naive Bayes coupled with kernel estimator, random forest and gradient boosted trees. The last three achieved the highest accuracy levels (above 90%). The attributes used were intentionally selected to be related to climate stressors (such as temperature ranges, perspiration and freeze-thaw cycles) or basic road attributes (such as age and functional class) to enable the models quantify the impact of climate change. A major caveat of this study is that some climate stressors such as storm frequency and severity were not included in the model as there was no data available about them in the LTPP dataset. With the proposed tool, the impacts of different climate scenarios can be examined by running the model with inputs that reflect the attributes of each scenario. To illustrate this, we examined the deterioration of two sets of roads: one from Ontario and one from Texas. Each set was examined in two climate scenarios. The analysis showed lower levels of deterioration for the Ontario roads and exacerbation of deterioration for the roads in Texas. It means that climate change may exacerbate or alleviate road deterioration depending on location. This type of analysis can be beneficial to the long-term policymaking in road infrastructure. For example, notwithstanding the impact of climate attributes that are not considered in this study, an Ontario policymaker should expect that with the same design standards and the same maintenance regimes, the service levels of roads will be enhanced.","[Piryonesi, S.

Using research documents, interviews, field observations, image analysis, and case studies, it analyses evolutions in public and private stakeholders' strategies, and the levers and barriers at play. Based on 60 beach sites, it reveals the prevalence (76.7%) of hard protection compared with no response (8.3%), ecosystem-based responses (3.3%), and combined responses (11.7%) and a nation-wide shift from hard and one-size-fits-all responses to soft and place-specific responses. This shift was driven by the failure of initial hard protection measures, which has pushed the Government of Mauritius to improve beach management practices, promote retreat where hard protection had failed, resort to external expertise and funding to design a well-informed risk reduction and adaptation policy, and implement demonstration projects. The learning-by-doing process and increased external support have thus allowed progress in risk reduction and adaptation at publicly managed beach sites. In contrast, privately managed (i.e. by residents and hotel companies) beach sites often exhibit increased risks, as a result of the proliferation of uncoordinated technical interventions, related cascading (beach loss, spread of coastal erosion downdrift), and lock-in effects. This study provides guidance for the ground-rooted and systematic analysis of coastal risk reduction and adaptation responses and their drivers at the local and national scale. It could serve as a first basis for framing nation-wide assessments aimed at taking stock of recent progress in coastal risk reduction and adaptation worldwide and help overcome barriers to adaptation.","[Duvat, Virginie K.

Some proposals focus on incorporating urban green space to counter the rise in temperature and ensuing public health hazards. Urban blue spaces, defined as all surface waters within a city, are regarded as a possible factor for temperature mitigation, but effects have not been quantified and so remain underrepresented in research, recommendations for action and planning. A systematic review was conducted of studies quantifying the temperature-mitigating effects of urban blue compared to other urban sites (n=27). The studies included in the review measured air temperatures at various types of urban blue space such as ponds, lakes or rivers and compared them with reference sites at defined distances or to urban reference sites in the same city. The meta-analysis suggested that a cooling effect of 2.5 K (CI 95% 1.9-3.2 K, p<0.01) during the warmest months on northern hemisphere (between May and October) can be attributed to urban blue sites when including remote sensing data. However, research on the air temperature effects of urban blue space remains sparse compared to studies on urban green. The cooling effects clearly attributable to urban blue space are limited by surrounding environmental conditions like microclimate, urban development, wind velocity, wind turbulence, wind direction, temperature and humidity. Future research is needed to help planners use urban blue space efficiently as a temperature-mitigating and health protecting and promoting factor. The temperature-mitigating capacity of urban blue can potentially reduce heat stress in urban areas. To create healthy environments in the cities of the future, a better understanding of health affecting aspects of urban blue is needed to initiate public health action.","[Voelker, Sebastian; Kistemann, Thomas] Univ Bonn, Inst Hyg & Publ Hlth, RG Med Geog & Publ Hlth, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Baumeister, Hendrik; Classen, Thomas; Hornberg, Claudia] Univ Bielefeld, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm & Hlth 7, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany",University of Bonn; University of Bielefeld,"Volker, S (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Inst Hyg & Publ Hlth, RG Med Geog & Publ Hlth, Sigmund Freud Str 25, D-53105 Bonn, Germany.",sebastian.voelker@ukb.uni-bonn.de; baumeister@uni-bielefeld.de; thomas.classen@uni-bielefeld.de; claudia.hornberg@uni-bielefeld.de; thomas.kistemann@ukb.uni-bonn.de,"Völker, Sebastian/AAW-9111-2021","Völker, Sebastian/0000-0002-6187-9253; Kistemann, Thomas/0000-0002-3306-7100","Fritz and Hildegard Berg Foundation, Essen (Germany)","Fritz and Hildegard Berg Foundation, Essen (Germany)","This work is part of the young professionals research group German Healthy Urban Open Spaces.

However, the links between objective comprehension, perceived usefulness for communication and aesthetics of climate change impact maps have rarely been analysed in empirical studies. In a co-design effort together with stakeholders in adaptation planning and climate change communication experts, regional climate change impact maps were developed and published as open-access dataset. The comprehension, aesthetics and perceived usefulness of different map design features were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated in a two-step survey. Designs with less information density were understood best, found most aesthetical and useful for communication practice. Uncertainties were deemed necessary by participants, but not understood well when combined with other variables on the same map sheet. Map understanding varied significantly with the cognitive difficulty of a task. This difference was robust over user groups.

Making an effort to do the bivariate modelling may eliminate the useful socio-economic information in the interdependent and simultaneous adaptation choices (Dorfman, 1996). Hence, the more appropriate method is multiple-choice decisions to livelihood adoption based on the embankment category. The purpose of this study is to find out whether the inhabitants of Sundarban really consider embankment as their lifeline, what they think about its sustainability and what the outer world thinks about the embankment. Design/methodology/approach To analyse this study, the multinomial logit (MNL) model has been used. This model gives a platform to study the influence of the factors on livelihood choice decisions. In this MNL model, the livelihood decisions are categorized based on their primary livelihood status at the survey. Thus, the choice of livelihood among individuals is explained in terms of the livelihood and the household characteristics. Findings This result can possibly explain the fact that increasing population or man power and increasing annual income and protection from embankment failure may reduce the need to choose any other form of economy apart from the indigenous one, as the society is dominated by farmers who own very small plots of land and face consequences like crop failure every year because of natural calamities. A unit increase in annual income would result in a 0.53% decrease in the probability of choosing labourer as occupation and 0.57% decrease in the probability of choosing fishing/meen collection as occupation. Research limitations/implications The district is vast enough, and it is difficult to study all the blocks. Initially, nine blocks were identified as affected blocks from various literature reviews. Those blocks are Sagar, Patharpratima, Kultali, Gosaba, Kakdwip, Canning I, Canning II, Namkhana and Basanti. Pilot surveys were done to all those nine blocks identified above. After such a long and rigorous procedure, blocks were verified from available secondary data. Villages from vulnerable and less vulnerable parts of the later mentioned blocks are picked up as purposive sample, and household surveys are done on the basis of random sampling. Social implications If the year of schooling is enhanced, then the tertiary sector gets benefited, but the indigenous society of Sundarban cannot depend on such a sector as the scope for development is very limited. Consequently, policies aiming at promoting adaptation to challenged livelihood need to emphasize the crucial role of providing basic needs for better production techniques; and more investment in this sector will surely enable villagers to adapt cultivation following age-old tradition. Originality/value The study uses the MNL model to investigate the factors guiding household choices of different occupational adaptation methods, and cultivation is found to be the automatic choice for the inhabitants of Sundarban. Cultivation is impossible without embankment. Thus, the embankment in Sundarban is considered, as lifeline is established. So it can be said that livelihood in this region depends on the stability of embankment. This age-old structure is susceptible to vulnerability because of its unscientific construction and improper maintenance. The main objective of this study is to find out whether the inhabitants of Sundarban really consider embankment as their lifeline, what they think about its sustainability and what the outer world thinks about the embankment.","[Saha, Senjuti] Womens Christian Coll, Dept Geog, Kolkata, India; [Hazra, Somnath; Ghosh, Tuhin] Jadavpur Univ, Sch Oceanog Studies, Kolkata, India",Jadavpur University,"Hazra, S (corresponding author), Jadavpur Univ, Sch Oceanog Studies, Kolkata, India.",somhazra24@gmail.com,,,,,,,59,0,0,1,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1759-5908,1759-5916,,INT J DISASTER RESIL,Int.

Contributing to these high rates are the ongoing effects of colonial policies that diminish and disrupt the intergenerational transfer of sea ice Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ). Despite these challenges, place-based experiential IQ continues to be the most important information source for safe travel on the sea ice. This paper presents an Inuit-led, coproduced, cross-cultural research project in which Inuit youth documented and mobilized sea ice IQ in Mittimatalik (Pond Inlet), Nunavut for safe community sea ice travel. We outline the Inuit youth training to facilitate the terminology and participatory mapping workshops and to document this IQ. We also discuss the IQ that was most important to share, and the mapping and artistic methods used to mobilize this IQ into a booklet, maps, and posters. Inuktitut sea ice terms are the foundation to enable youth with the skills to learn about sea ice IQ with experienced hunters. IQ enables Inuit to interpret and synthesize information from weather forecasts, earth observations, and community-based monitoring to apply to local conditions. Seasonal IQ maps of safe and hazardous sea ice conditions provide travel planning information at spatial and temporal scales that supplemental information sources cannot address. The IQ products mobilize preparedness, situational awareness, navigation, and interpretation skills so Inuit youth can become more self-reliant, as access to technology is not always possible once out on the sea ice.","[Wilson, Katherine J.; Bell, Trevor] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Geog, 231 Elizabeth Ave, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada; [Arreak, Andrew] SmartICE Sea Ice Monitoring & Information Inc, Nunavut Operat Lead Qikiqtaaluk North, Mittimatalik, NU X0A 0S0, Canada; [Itulu, Jamesie] Jamesie Itulu Borealis Ink, Mittimatalik, NU X0A 0S0, Canada; [Sikumiut Community Management Comm] Sikumiut Community Management Comm, Mittimatalik, NU X0A 0S0, Canada; [Ljubicic, Gita J.] McMaster Univ, Sch Earth Environm & Soc, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada",Memorial University Newfoundland; McMaster University,"Wilson, KJ (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Geog, 231 Elizabeth Ave, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada.",Katherine.Wilson@mun.ca,,"Wilson, Katherine/0000-0002-4246-3578",Public Safety Canada's Search and Rescue New Initiatives Fund; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Northern Scientific Training Program; ArcticNet; Polar Knowledge Canada,Public Safety Canada's Search and Rescue New Initiatives Fund; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Northern Scientific Training Program; ArcticNet; Polar Knowledge Canada,"This research was funded in part by Public Safety Canada's Search and Rescue New Initiatives Fund, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the Northern Scientific Training Program, ArcticNet, and Polar Knowledge Canada.

Land allocations are sensitive to crop profits that in turn depend on yield effects induced by changes in climate and technology. We develop and apply an integrated framework to assess the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity and land use for the U.S. Northern Great Plains. Crop-specific yield-weather models reveal crop comparative advantage due to differential yield impacts of weather across the region's major crops, that is, alfalfa, wheat, soybeans, and maize. We define crop profits as a function of the weather-driven yields, which are then used to model land use allocation decisions. This ultimately allows us to simulate the impact of climate change under the RCP4.5 emissions scenario on land allocated to the region's major crops as well as to grass/pasture. Upon removing the trends effects in yields, climate change is projected to lower yields by 33-64% over 2031-2055 relative to 1981-2005, with soybean being the least and alfalfa the most affected crops. Yield projections applied to the land use model at present-day input costs and output prices reveals that Dakotas' grass acreage will increase by up to 23%, displacing croplands. Wheat acreage is expected to increase by up to 54% in select southeastern counties of North Dakota and South Dakota, where maize/soy acreage had increased by up to 58% during 1995-2016.","[Arora, Gaurav] Indraprastha Inst Informat Technol, Dept Social Sci & Humanities, New Delhi, India; [Feng, Hongli; Hennessy, David A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Anderson, Christopher J.] SkyDoc LLC, Ames, IA USA",Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi; Michigan State University,"Arora, G (corresponding author), Indraprastha Inst Informat Technol Delhi, Dept Social Sci & Humanities, New Delhi, India.",gaurav@iiitd.ac.in,,"Feng, Hongli/0000-0001-7553-8145","Elton R.

Based on a survey of 300 urban poor households in 14 communities located in these flood basins, the study found that the environmental-ecological vulnerability of the low-lying flood prone areas interacts strongly with the social vulnerability of urban poor households, highlighting the effects of climate related changes (sea level rise, increased typhoons, intensity of monsoon rains, floods and tidal/storm surges) on this vulnerable population. Most of the households have low-incomes, live in slum/squatter settlements and do not have adequate access to potable water, electricity, health, sewage and sanitation facilities. About two-thirds of them suffered losses (e. g., income, work, health/sickness, household appliances/things, housing damage) from typhoons, floods, and tidal/storm surges but only a small portion of them obtained help from formal institutions (e. g., local government units or LGUs, charitable agencies) and informal support networks (relatives/neighbors/friends). Of these, a third of these households appeared more vulnerable and consistently incurred higher losses (e. g., income and workdays) and intense inconveniences (e. g., water source buried by floods, toilets blocked and overflowed with wastes/large worms to their floors) compared to their neighbors. Both urban poor households and their local governments have formulated adaptation strategies in response to the increasing effects of climate change. Few of the local governments built river barriers, improved their drainage systems, installed water diversion techniques (e. g., bombastic) and disaster warning systems and increased the capacity of their officials to assist during evacuations. Meanwhile, some urban poor households have adapted to a water-based lifestyle (e. g., raising the floors/increasing the number of floors of their homes, building makeshift bridges among households in swampy areas, building Styrofoam boats for transport, etc.). But on the whole, both the urban poor residents and the formal institutions (LGUs, national agencies) need resources and capability building to increase their capacity to adapt to the effects of climate change.","Ateneo Manila Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Manila, Philippines",Ateneo de Manila University,"Porio, E (corresponding author), Ateneo Manila Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Manila, Philippines.",eporio@ateneo.edu,"Eclevia, Marian/I-6486-2013",,,,,,16,63,63,2,195,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1568-4849,1568-5314,,ASIAN J SOC SCI,Asian J.

Marine resources underpin subsistence and commercial fisheries, as well as tourism activities, contributing substantially to Palau's GDP and employment. Since 1992, Palau has been actively developing conservation initiatives to protect marine resources, promote ecotourism, and ensure revenue generation. Marine reserves represent a particularly important tool in the country's sustainable development strategy. In 2015, Palau designated 80% of its marine EEZ as a National Marine Sanctuary, with the remaining 20% slated for domestic fisheries. That same year, Palau received 160 thousand tourists, over 9 times the country's population. In early 2017, the President proposed a bill effectively limiting budget travel and actively promoting high-end tourism. This study uses a quantitative social-ecological model to explore policy scenarios involving tourism, marine conservation and local food security. While climate change had the largest expected impact on local ecosystems, reef fish consumption contributes considerably to future projected declines in marine resources. Therefore, for Palau to achieve its goals of boosting revenues while sustainably stewarding marine resources, it will be necessary to transfer some level of consumption from reef fish on to tuna and other pelagics. Such changes, which align with the current proposal of developing an offshore national fishery as part of the Sanctuary's management plan, may allow Palau to meet future seafood demand, while protecting reef systems and the industries that rely on them.","[Wabnitz, Colette C.

Bhutan's complex, often high-altitude terrain and the severe impact of the Indian summer monsoon leads to a strong exposure of the countries' key economic sectors (agriculture, forestry, hydropower generation and tourism) to climatic changes. Climate change also threatens Bhutan's vast biodiversity and increases the likelihood of natural hazards (e.g. glacier lake outburst floods, flash floods, droughts and forest fires). A better understanding of Bhutan's climate and its variability, as well as observed and possible climate impacts, will help in improving the handling of regional social, economic and ecologic challenges not limited to the Himalayas. Only a few climatological studies exist for the eastern Himalayas. They mainly focus on adaptation to immediate threats by glacier lake outbursts. In contrast, this paper (1) investigates the average spatial and inner-annual diversity of the air temperature regime of Bhutan, based on local meteorological observations, (2) discusses past temperature variability, based on global datasets, and (3) relates effects of observed warming to water availability, hydropower development, natural hazards, forests, biodiversity, agriculture, human health and tourism in the Bhutan Himalayas. Results indicate a large spatial and temporal temperature variability within Bhutan and considerably increasing temperatures especially over recent decades.

Second, drawing upon Amartya Sen's ( 2010) realization-focused comparison theory of justice, we develop a definition of adaptation finance justice based upon the texts of the 1992 UNFCCC and its subsidiary bodies. From this perspective, we assess three main points of contention between countries on both sides of the North-South divide: The Gap in raising the funds, The Wedge in their distribution, and The Dodge in how they are governed. Overall, we argue that while some ambiguity exists, the decisions of the UNFCCC provide a strong basis for a justice-oriented approach to adaptation finance.

In this sense, this study presents changing sediment volumes on various temporal scales for the fringing reef island Fuvahmulah. Based on three field campaigns, conducted over 2 years, aerial imagery provides information on marine aggregates of the island's beaches. In addition, high resolution climate reanalysis data serves as input into an empirical and a numerical approach. Together, both approaches describe the driving processes behind volumetric seasonal and interannual changes: On the one hand, the empirical method quantifies sediment transport rates for calcareous sediments over the whole time span of the data set by considering wind and swell waves from multiple directions. On the other hand, the numerical method gives insights into the complexity of currents induced by dominant wave components. Combining these methods facilitates hindcasting and predicting morphological changes under varying wave climate, assessing sediment pathways over the whole reef, and describing the seasonal and interannual evolution of the sand spit Thoondu. As a result, this study reveals sediment distribution on different spatio-temporal scales and elucidates their significance in the design of conventional and alternative low-regret coastal adaptation.","[David, C.

However, it is unclear whether farmers realize these benefits when crop choices available to farmers have different and variable costs and returns; multiple countries have programs that incentivize production of certain crops while other crops are subject to market fluctuations. We hypothesize that the benefits of forecasts on farmer livelihoods will be moderated by the combined impact of differing crop economics and changing climate. Drawing upon methods and insights from both physical and social sciences, we develop a model of farmer decision-making to evaluate this hypothesis. The model dynamics are explored using empirical data from Sri Lanka; primary sources include survey and interview information as well as game-based experiments conducted with farmers in the field. Our simulations show that a farmer using seasonal forecasts has more diversified crop selections, which drive increases in average agricultural income. Increases in income are particularly notable under a drier climate scenario, when a farmer using seasonal forecasts is more likely to plant onions, a crop with higher possible returns. Our results indicate that, when water resources are scarce (i.e. drier climate scenario), farmer incomes could become stratified, potentially compounding existing disparities in farmers' financial and technical abilities to use forecasts to inform their crop selections. This analysis highlights that while programs that promote production of certain crops may ensure food security in the short-term, the long-term implications of these dynamics need careful evaluation.","[Gunda, T.; Bazuin, J.

Primary sources of review included material officially submitted for consideration in the upcoming 2013 U.S. National Climate Assessment and supplemental peer-reviewed and grey literature. Although substantial adaptation planning is occurring in various sectors, levels of government, and the private sector, few measures have been implemented and even fewer have been evaluated. Most adaptation actions to date appear to be incremental changes, not the transformational changes that may be needed in certain cases to adapt to significant changes in climate. While there appear to be no one-size-fits-all adaptations, there are similarities in approaches across scales and sectors, including mainstreaming climate considerations into existing policies and plans, and pursuing no- and low-regrets strategies. Despite the positive momentum in recent years, barriers to implementation still impede action in all sectors and across scales. The most significant barriers include lack of funding, policy and institutional constraints, and difficulty in anticipating climate change given the current state of information on change. However, the practice of adaptation can advance through learning by doing, stakeholder engagements (including listening sessions), and sharing of best practices. Efforts to advance adaptation across the U.S. and globally will necessitate the reduction or elimination of barriers, the enhancement of information and best practice sharing mechanisms, and the creation of comprehensive adaptation evaluation metrics.","[Bierbaum, Rosina] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Bierbaum, Rosina] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Smith, Joel B.] Stratus Consulting, Boulder, CO USA; [Lee, Arthur] Chevron Serv Co, San Ramon, CA USA; [Blair, Maria] Amer Canc Soc, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Carter, Lynne] Louisiana State Univ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Chapin, F.

With climate change and sea-level rise in the next decades, the freeboard of existing coastal defences is likely to be reduced and the probability of wave overtopping for these coastal defences will increase. The wave overtopping from coastal defences increases the probability of coastal inundation and flooding, imposing threat to the communities which are living in low-lying coastal areas. Retrofitting of existing seawalls offers the potential to enhance coastal resilience by allowing them to adapt and respond to changing climatic conditions. This study investigates a range of possible physical configurations and optimum retrofit geometry to maximize the protection of existing seawalls from wave overtopping. A comprehensive physical modelling study of four retrofit prototypes, including recurve wall, model vegetation, reef breakwater and diffraction pillars, was conducted to examine their performance in mitigating wave overtopping, when placed in front of a vertical seawall. All the tests were conducted on 1:20 smooth beach slope. Each test case consisted of approximately 1000 pseudo-random waves based on the JONSWAP spectrum. The physical modelling experiments were designed to include both impulsive and non-impulsive wave conditions. This study provides new predictive relations and decision support tool needed to evaluate overtopping risks from existing seawalls with retrofits under various hydrodynamic conditions. The analysis of experimental measurements demonstrates that wave overtopping from retrofitting structures can be predicted with similar relations for vertical seawalls, and by using a reduction factor which varies with geometric shapes. Statistical measures and sensitivity analysis show that recurve walls have the best performance in reduction of wave overtopping volume followed by model vegetation and reef breakwater. The measurements show the insignificance of diffraction pillars, at least for the selected configurations investigated, in mitigating wave overtopping.","[Dong, S.; Abolfathi, S.; Salauddin, M.; Pearson, J.

This opportunity, however, may be underutilized. In thousands of county offices across the country, USDA field staff with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and Farm Service Agency (FSA) interface with farmers on a daily basis to provide conservation technical assistance, farm loans, and disaster recovery assistance. In this study, we conducted a survey of NRCS field staff (n = 1,893) and a similar survey of FSA field staff (n = 4,621) to determine the following: (1) how concerned USDA field staff are with both general and specific climate and weather threats and their effect on agriculture and forestry, (2) what available climate and weather resources staff are currently using, (3) how these factors relate to USDA field staff 's confidence and interest in playing the role of climate advisor, and (4) the differences that exist between NRCS and FSA field staff related to these research questions. We found that many USDA field staff are concerned about climate change in general and about several specific impacts, but fewer are confident in their ability to support land managers in addressing these impacts. Additionally, increased concern about climate threats was related to higher levels of climate and weather resource use and an increased desire to play the role of climate advisor, but was also related to lower levels of self-reported ability to play that role. These findings can be used to inform appropriate application of professional development opportunities and creation of tools and resources to improve professional uses of weather and climate information.","[Wiener, S.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Southeast Climate Hub, Raleigh, NC 27604 USA; [Roesch-McNally, G.

This paper presents an analysis of inequality and marginalization effects of post-disaster reconstruction from a risk governance perspective. Using a mixed-methods approach, we examine the Fischerdorf and Natternberg districts of the German city of Deggendorf, severely affected by the 2013 floods in Europe. The findings show that social inequality and marginalization affected housing reconstruction (and vice versa) in unexpected ways. Uninsured groups (such as the elderly and migrant homeowners) received prompt, ad-hoc support from state and civil society actors, while insured homeowners (mostly higher-income groups) experienced ongoing disputes between state and market actors that hampered their recovery. Some marginalized groups could not access state support, as various aspects of cultural diversity were not adequately considered. This fostered, and created new, patterns of inequality and risk. The ad-hoc engagement of civil society was crucial, but insufficient, to fully buffer the effects of inequality and marginalization resulting from formal recovery processes. We conclude that it is critical to give more attention to the interplay, and power constellations, between state, market and civil society actors to facilitate sustainable recovery and development-by counteracting potential inequality and marginalization effects. Increased consideration of cultural diversity and the support of citizens who play dual roles (and can mediate between different actors) was identified to be vital in this context. We thus call for increased research into the issue of complementary city-citizen rights and responsibilities in risk reduction and adaptation planning.","[Kammerbauer, Mark] Tech Hsch Nurnberg Georg Simon Ohm, Fak Architektur, D-90121 Nurnberg, Germany; [Wamsler, Christine] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, POB 170, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Kammerbauer, M (corresponding author), Tech Hsch Nurnberg Georg Simon Ohm, Fak Architektur, D-90121 Nurnberg, Germany.",mark.kammerbauer@th-nuernberg.de; christme.wamsler@lucsus.lu.se,,"Kammerbauer, Mark/0000-0002-5707-7936",Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) [PKZ 91586472]; Sustainable Urban Transformation for Climate Change Adaptation project; Swedish Research Council FORMAS [2011-901],Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Sustainable Urban Transformation for Climate Change Adaptation project; Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),This research was carried out in the context of a Visiting Postdoctoral Scholarship at Lund University Centre for Sustainability Studies (LUCSUS) (PKZ 91586472) supported by the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) as well as the Sustainable Urban Transformation for Climate Change Adaptation project financed by the Swedish Research Council FORMAS (no. 2011-901).

The pilot study focused on small-scale and commercial agriculture, water supply, housing, wildlife, livestock and biodiversity in the Thukela River basin, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The methodology was based on stakeholders identifying and ranking the severity of climate-related challenges, and downscaled stakeholder-identified information provided by modellers, with the aim of addressing possible changes of exposure in the future. The methodology enables the integration of model-based information with experience and visions based on local realities. It includes stakeholders' own assessments of their vulnerability to prevailing climate variability and the severity, if specified, of climate-related problems that may occur more often in the future. The methodology made it possible to identify the main issues to focus on in the adaptation plan, including barriers to adaptation. We make recommendations for how to design a model-assisted participatory process, emphasizing the need for transparency, to recognize the interests of the stakeholders, good advance planning, local relevance, involvement of local champions, and adaptation of Information material to each group's previous experience and understanding.","[Andersson, Lotta; Graham, L.

The tool classification includes considerations of type of input and output data, time commitment, and necessary skills required. The strengths and limitations of the most relevant tools are further discussed alongside illustrative case studies, some collected from literature and one conducted as part of this research in Wellington, Aotearoa using the Land Utilisation and Capability Indicator (LUCI) tool. A major finding of the research is that from the 95 tools reviewed, only four are judged to be potentially relevant for urban design projects. These are modelling tools that allow spatially explicit visualisation of biophysical quantification of ecosystem services. The ecosystem services assessed vary among tools and the outputs' reliability is often highly influenced by the user's technical expertise.

Improved social learning is urgently needed to transform urban water governance and make it more integrated and adaptive. However, empirical studies remain few and fragmented. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyse how social learning has supported or inhibited sustainable transformations in urban water governance. On the basis of multiple case studies conducted in urban, flood-prone areas in Colombia, the Philippines, South Africa, India, and Sweden, we study learning processes related to different aspects of water management and governance. Our results show that transformations in water governance are often triggered by crises, whereas other potentials for transformation are not tapped into. Furthermore, learning is often inhibited by lock-ins created by powerful actors. We conclude that there is a need for more proactive design of governance structures for triple-loop learning that take into account the identified barriers and supporting principles.","[Johannessen, Ase] Delft Univ Technol, Water Resources Grp, Delft, Netherlands; [Johannessen, Ase; Wamsler, Christine] Lund Univ, Ctr Risk Assessment & Management LUCRAM, Lund, Sweden; [Johannessen, Ase] Lund Univ, Div Risk Management & Societal Safety, Lund, Sweden; [Swartling, Asa Gerger; Andersson, Kim] SEI, Stockholm, Sweden; [Wamsler, Christine] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden; [Arran, Julian Timothy; Stenstrom, Thor Axel] Durban Univ Technol, Inst Water & Wastewater Technol, Durban, South Africa; [Vivas, Dayana Indira Hernandez] Stockholm Resilience Ctr Alumni, Stockholm, Sweden",Delft University of Technology; Lund University; Lund University; Stockholm Environment Institute; Lund University; Durban University of Technology,"Johannessen, A (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Water Resources Grp, Delft, Netherlands.",a.johannessen@tudelft.nl,"Swartling, Åsa C Gerger/J-1420-2018","Swartling, Åsa C Gerger/0000-0003-3616-7323; Johannessen, Ase/0000-0002-8752-5496",Swedish Research Council FORMAS [2011-901]; Swedish International Development Cooperation; Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency [211-946]; Swedish Research Council [2017-06214],Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Swedish International Development Cooperation; Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"Swedish Research Council FORMAS, Grant/Award Number: 2011-901; Swedish International Development Cooperation; Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, Grant/Award Number: 211-946; Swedish Research Council, Grant/ Award Number: 2017-06214",,52,42,42,8,22,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",1756-932X,1756-9338,,ENVIRON POLICY GOV,Environ.

Using a hydrological model, it assesses the relative influence of different urban-development and water-management modes on sewer-system overflows. It combines and compares the impacts of three climate change scenarios going up to 2100, which take into account the implementation of various urban-development strategies, as well as two demographic scenarios. Using this method, the study weighs the importance of the different hydrological mechanisms at play and proposes land-development strategies to implement with regards to climate change and population. The city of Nantes, the hydraulic network of which is well documented, serves as a case study. The results show that, in Nantes, climate change might have a smaller impact on overflows than population growth and urban development in certain scenarios. To limit overflows, insofar as there is no change in water use, this study suggests densifying existing urban areas served by a separative sewer system. It also provides a comparative appraisal of common and alternative water-management practices to reduce overflow. Simulations of different scenarios can help to foster a better understanding of the relationship between urban management and hydrological mechanisms.","[Mahaut, Valerie] Univ Montreal, Fac Amenagement, Ecole Architecture, CP 6128,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Andrieu, Herve] CNRS, IRSTV, IFSTTAR, Dept Geotech Engn Environm & Risks,FR 2488, Route Bouaye CS4, F-44344 Nantes, France",Universite de Montreal; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Engineering & Systems Sciences (INSIS); Universite Gustave-Eiffel,"Mahaut, V (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Fac Amenagement, Ecole Architecture, CP 6128,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",valerie.mahaut@hotmail.com; herve.andrieu@ifsttar.fr,"Andrieu, Herve/AAP-5588-2020",,Region Pays de la Loire; Nantes-Metropole,Region Pays de la Loire(Region Pays de la Loire); Nantes-Metropole(Region Pays de la Loire),The authors thank to the Region Pays de la Loire that has financed this research and to Nantes-Metropole (Yves Gouriten) for data and discussions.,,55,16,16,1,41,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

Conspicuously, windows can play a pivotal role in controlling the energy used in the building by reducing the use of energy-consuming areas that devour massive energy for air conditioning or heating appliances. Presently, the comfort performance of window materials is reaching its storage and processing limit, causing a significant push to find smart materials that can be used in the next generation of the built environment. An innovative solution for sustainable glazing has established an understanding of pH-temperature-transparency modulation. This work uses a hydroxypropyl cellulose and polyacrylic acid-based hydrogel as a rational energy stimulus for double-glazed windows, enriching a comfortable indoor daylight environment without sacrificing aesthetic appeal. The hydrogel maintains thermal comfort across various outdoor temperatures from 4 degrees C to 60 degrees C. The developed hydrogel-filled prototype glazing's indoor thermal comfort performance and durability were analsyzed, where the hydrogel intermolecular gap and porosity play a pivotal role across various pHs.","[Roy, Anurag; Mallick, Tapas K.; Tahir, Asif Ali] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Fac Environm Sci & Econ, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England",University of Exeter,"Roy, A; Tahir, AA (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Fac Environm Sci & Econ, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England.",a.roy30@exeter.ac.uk; a.tahir@exeter.ac.uk,"TAHIR, ASIF ALI/A-2515-2014; ROY, ANURAG/H-4438-2015","TAHIR, ASIF ALI/0000-0003-1985-6127; ROY, ANURAG/0000-0002-2097-9442","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), UK [EP/T025875/1, EP/V049046/1]","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This work was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), UK, under research grant numbers EP/T025875/1 and EP/V049046/1.

Today, many lower regions already face challenges in winter. However, several authors indicated new potentials for near-metropolitan areas in summer. As the first study for a metropolitan area, this paper discusses results of a large-scale quantitative survey (n = 877) from Vienna (Austria) to evaluate the intentions of urban residents to seek refreshment in nearby mountainous regions. The results regarding their adaptation behavior confirm the likely increase in demand to escape to nearby refreshing areas during heatwaves. This trend could lead to (re-)vitalization potential for rural near-metropolitan areas in Eastern Austria, which are often characterized by depopulation and degradation of infrastructure. A closer look at the respondents' mobility behavior, reveals a high risk for unsustainable developments. Although the high and increasing share of car-free households in Vienna would suggest a strong demand for public transport, the likelihood to travel by car towards such destinations is high even among this group. Focusing predominantly on on-site mobility offers would be recommended since many travelers did not use their car within the destination. At last, the attractiveness of climate-friendly travel options is discussed considering mobility-related needs and preferences of three touristic motive groups.","[Juschten, Maria; Hoessinger, Reinhard; Unbehaun, Wiebke] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna BOKU, Inst Transport Studies, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Brandenburg, Christiane; Liebl, Ursula; Jiricka-Puerrer, Alexandra] BOKU Vienna, Inst Landscape Dev Recreat & Conservat Planning, Peter Jordan Str 65, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Offenzeller, Martina; Prutsch, Andrea] Environm Agcy Austria, Spittelauer Lande 5, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Weber, Fabian] Lucerne Univ Appl Sci & Arts, Inst Tourism, Rosslimatte 48, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Juschten, M (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna BOKU, Inst Transport Studies, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",maria.juschten@boku.ac.at; christiane.brandenburg@boku.ac.at; r.hoessinger@boku.ac.at; ursula.liebl@boku.ac.at; martina.offenzeller@umweltbundesamt.at; Andrea.prutsch@umweltbundesamt.at; wiebke.unbehaun@boku.ac.at; fabian.weber@hslu.ch; alexandra.jiricka@boku.ac.at,,"Brandenburg, Christiane/0000-0002-7221-1451; Hossinger, Reinhard/0000-0002-0090-0573; Juschten, Maria/0000-0002-8486-9322; Jiricka-Purrer, Alexandra/0000-0002-6842-1835",Austrian Climate and Energy Fund under the 8th Call of the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP); BOKU Vienna Open Access Publishing Fund,Austrian Climate and Energy Fund under the 8th Call of the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP); BOKU Vienna Open Access Publishing Fund,This research was funded by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund under the 8th Call of the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP).

The major challenge is to reveal patterns in the way farmers form expectations about future production outcomes and to encode these findings into models of heterogeneous expectation formation. We developed and tested a payout-motivated field experiment to observe farmer decision-making under climate change and to examine how they form their expectations in a recursive-dynamic context. Participants were exposed to ambiguity and acquired incremental evidence about the true distribution of possible climate outcomes through repeated random draws. Simulation models used in agricultural and environmental research usually implement simple forms of adaptive agent expectation or completely neglect this issue by assuming perfect foresight or constant expectations. Our computer laboratory experiments with blue- and white-collar farmers from Southwest Germany (n = 97) suggest that expectation behaviour of a large share of farmers can be well replicated with Bayesian types of expectation models.","[Eisele, Marius; Troost, Christian; Berger, Thomas] Univ Hohenheim, Hans Ruthenberg Inst, Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Berger, T (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Hans Ruthenberg Inst, Stuttgart, Germany.",thomas.berger@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Troost, Christian/0000-0003-4626-7117",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [FOR-1695],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),Funding by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under FOR-1695 is gratefully acknowledged.,,55,2,2,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

We used the adaptive Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (aDGVM), which was originally developed and tested for Africa, to quantify sources of uncertainties in simulated African potential natural vegetation towards the end of the 21st century. We forced the aDGVM with regionally downscaled high-resolution climate scenarios based on an ensemble of six general circulation models (GCMs) under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5). Our study assessed the direct effects of climate change and elevated CO2 on vegetation change and its plant-physiological drivers. Total increase in carbon in aboveground biomass in Africa until the end of the century was between 18% to 43% (RCP4.5) and 37% to 61% (RCP8.5) and was associated with woody encroachment into grasslands and increased woody cover in savannas. When direct effects of CO2 on plants were omitted, woody encroachment was muted and carbon in aboveground vegetation changed between -8 to 11% (RCP 4.5) and -22 to -6% (RCP8.5). Simulated biome changes lacked consistent large-scale geographical patterns of change across scenarios. In Ethiopia and the Sahara/Sahel transition zone, the biome changes forecast by the aDGVM were consistent across GCMs and RCPs. Direct effects from elevated CO2 were associated with substantial increases in water use efficiency, primarily driven by photosynthesis enhancement, which may relieve soil moisture limitations to plant productivity. At the ecosystem level, interactions between fire and woody plant demography further promoted woody encroachment. We conclude that substantial future biome changes due to climate and CO2 changes are likely across Africa. Because of the large uncertainties in future projections, adaptation strategies must be highly flexible. Focused research on CO2 effects, and improved model representations of these effects will be necessary to reduce these uncertainties.","[Martens, Carola; Hickler, Thomas] Goethe Univ Frankfurt Main, Inst Phys Geog, Altenhoferallee 1, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Martens, Carola; Hickler, Thomas; Pfeiffer, Mirjam; Scheiter, Simon] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr SBiK F, Frankfurt, Germany; [Davis-Reddy, Claire] South African Environm Observat Network SAEON, uLwazi Node, Cape Town, South Africa; [Engelbrecht, Francois] Univ Witwatersrand, Global Change Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Higgins, Steven, I] Univ Bayreuth, Plant Ecol, Bayreuth, Germany; [von Maltitz, Graham P.] Council Sci & Ind Res CSIR, Pretoria, South Africa; [von Maltitz, Graham P.; Midgley, Guy F.] Stellenbosch Univ, Global Change Biol Grp, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Goethe University Frankfurt; Senckenberg Biodiversitat & Klima- Forschungszentrum (BiK-F); Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); National Research Foundation - South Africa; South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON); University of Witwatersrand; University of Bayreuth; Stellenbosch University,"Martens, C (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt Main, Inst Phys Geog, Altenhoferallee 1, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.",martens.carola@yahoo.de,"Midgley, Guy/H-3585-2014; Hickler, Thomas/S-6287-2016; Scheiter, Simon/G-5048-2012","Midgley, Guy/0000-0001-8264-0869; Hickler, Thomas/0000-0002-4668-7552; Scheiter, Simon/0000-0002-5449-841X; von Maltitz, Graham Paul/0000-0002-9272-1272; Engelbrecht, Francois/0000-0002-9189-6556","Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung [01LL1801B, 01LL1802B]; Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SCHE 1719/2-1]; National Research Foundation [11859]",Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); National Research Foundation,"Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung, Grant/Award Number: 01LL1801B and 01LL1802B; Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: SCHE 1719/2-1; National Research Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 11859",,108,20,20,6,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Adaptation to SLR requires societal and policy decision-making to consider these changing risks, which are in turn defined by socio-economic development objectives and the local societal context. Here, we review some of the key challenges facing governments, stakeholders and scientists in adapting to SLR, and key aspects of successful adaptation, by exploring different approaches to SLR and coastal adaptation planning in three western European countries, the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom. Several common challenges of SLR adaptation emerge across the different settings, including the inherent uncertainty regarding future conditions, the significant social and socioeconomic consequences, the consideration and distribution of (residual) risk over communities, and the long legacy of present-day decisions that affect future risk and management options supporting future generations. These challenges are addressed differently in the three countries, e. g. in the governance level at which adaptation is initiated, although common elements also emerge. One common emerging element is adaptive pathways planning, which entails dynamic decision-making that breaks uncertain decisions into manageable elements or steps over time, while keeping options for the future. Another common element is the development of effective local science-policy interfaces, as engagement of local decision-makers and citizens is essential to manage conflicting interests. Lastly, we find that social and communication sciences have great potential to support effective science-policy interfaces, e.g. though identifying societal tipping points.

This diversity is a result of physical factors, such as the risk of storm surge, sea level rise projections, and the topography of the landscape, as well as socio-economic factors, such as the level of development, and the capacity within the community to adapt. Despite this strong local variation, various communities share common characteristics that constrain or enable different adaptation options in different situations. Understanding these drivers is likely to be important in engaging coastal communities in the discussion around adaptation and may provide new insights into which adaptation options are suitable for each of our at-risk coastal communities. We performed a property-level analysis of 6 suburb-sized case studies distributed along the coast of Queensland, Australia. We assessed the potential economic costs of inundation events now and in the future under sea level rise projections, and the potential avoided costs following adaptation to protect against inundation. We went beyond this to estimate the distribution of risk in each community and compared the potential costs of adaptation with the capacity of the community to pay for their implementation. We used these insights to propose a typology of coastal communities based on their exposure to total inundation risk, the distribution of that risk within the community, and their capacity to adapt.","[Fletcher, Cameron S.] CSIRO, Atherton, Qld, Australia; [Rambaldi, Alicia N.] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Lipkin, Felix] CSIRO, Highett, Vic, Australia; [McAllister, Ryan R.

A critical challenge for implementing such risk transfer programs, however, is helping participants understand how insurance operates, and there is evidence that farmers with a poor understanding of insurance are less likely to use it. One of the proposed tools to help farmers understand insurance is a simulation game, through which farmers can gain first-hand experience with a functioning insurance market. This paper reports on the results of experiments in Ethiopia and Malawi, investigating farmers' understanding and the effectiveness of a role-playing game at improving that understanding. Our results suggest a generally poor understanding of basic insurance concepts, and are consistent with past results in suggesting that better understanding correlates with greater willingness to purchase it. Our results also suggest that role-playing games may be an important tool for improving understanding, but that they do not necessarily out-perform more conventional training practices.

These factors form a convergence with a complex of other factors to change production systems physically; and farmers' decision making is variously described as adaptive or maladaptive to these drivers of change. Recently updated State Government policies on farming, climate and water have immediate and long term implications for food production systems but are not readily interpreted at a local scale. Further, peak oil and energy security are only partially integrated into either climate or water policy discourse. In effect, despite some far-sighted words about the meaning of climate change, uncertainty is largely met with a 'business as usual' mantra. Farmer narratives are used to demonstrate their systemic and increasing vulnerability and likelihood of perverse outcomes. The Future Farming strategy and Our Water Our Future are briefly analyzed, as are potential implications of the rhetoric of newly elected conservative government. Using ideas from Bourdieu and Bhabha we suggest that the reliance on farmers being able to innovate and take up opportunities associated with the uncertainty of large scale changes in climate and energy availability are misguided. It is more likely that current policy directions entrench the values of the global market and its elite, leaving farmers locked-in to historical structural responses that will not be successful in the long-term and will diminish their ability to imagine radical and diverse ways of avoiding the maladaptive structures currently surrounding their production systems.

Amman has a mean annual rainfall of 378 mm, which makes rainwater harvesting viable and feasible. The rainfall data recorded at seven different weather stations were processed statistically to produce reliable averaging surface and isohyetal maps for rainfall over Amman. The GIS layer was generated for roofs and catchments to identify the suitable rainwater harvesting sites. Results show that the potential water collected by rainwater harvesting is five times less expensive than that collected via the conventional water supply system. The net total water savings by rainwater harvesting is 3.45 x 10(6) m(3)/year, and this could reduce the nonrevenue water and other losses by -1%.

In this paper we develop a Bayesian Belief Network model that supports decision making to increase the availability of safe drinking water in five flood-prone rural communities in the Solomon Islands. We collected quantitative household survey data and qualitative cultural and environmental knowledge through community focus group discussions. We combined these data to develop our model, which simulates the state of eight water sources and ten sanitation types and how they are affected by season and extreme events. We identify how climate and current practices can threaten the availability of drinking water for remote communities. Modelling of climate and intervention scenarios indicate that water security could be best enhanced through increased rainwater harvesting (assuming proper installation and maintenance). These findings highlight how a systems model can identify links between and improve understanding of water and sanitation, community behaviour, and the impacts of extreme events. The resultant BBN provides a tool for decision support to enhance opportunities for climate resilient water and sanitation service provision. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Indeed, the traditional static welfare-maximizing climate policy design leads to a conflict between mitigation and adaptation, invalidating the recently established consistency of cost-benefit analysis with the Paris Agreement's targets. Here, we show that this tension can be resolved by integrating multi-objective optimization and feedback control in the Dynamic Integrated Climate Economy model to design self-adaptive climate policies trading off welfare maximization with the Paris Agreement compliance. These policies allow adjusting against uncertainty as information on the socio-climatic system accumulates, thus representing the policy-making process more realistically. We show that, the costs being the same as in traditional methods, warming above 2 degrees C and the probability of overshooting can be drastically reduced, emphasizing the need for integrating adaptation and mitigation strategies and the value of embracing a self-adaptive, multi-objective perspective.","[Carlino, Angelo; Castelletti, Andrea] Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Milan, Italy; [Tavoni, Massimo] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Milan, Italy; [Tavoni, Massimo; Castelletti, Andrea] Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, RFF CMCC European Inst Econ & Environm EIEE, Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Castelletti, A (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Milan, Italy.;Castelletti, A (corresponding author), Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, RFF CMCC European Inst Econ & Environm EIEE, Milan, Italy.",andrea.castelletti@polimi.it,,"Carlino, Angelo/0000-0002-8403-9070; Castelletti, Andrea/0000-0002-7923-1498",European Union [821124],European Union(European Commission),The research leading to these results received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under Grant 821124 (NAVIGATE).,,110,0,0,7,7,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",,2328-4277,,EARTHS FUTURE,Earth Future,OCT,2022,10,10,,,,,,,e2022EF002767,10.1029/2022EF002767,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022EF002767,,,20,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,5N0UP,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000871506600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Watering is fine-tuned for each structure to maximize cooling and minimize water consumption using two linear cooling regimes, before deployment in the field. The surface heat budget is closely studied and the partitioning of irradiance and net radiation into conductive, convective, radiative and cooling flux at surface is analyzed for each structure. Energy partitioning, surface temperature increase and optimal watering rates all exhibit good correlation with overall surface absorptivity. The transmitted flux at varying depths is also characterized using a transmission index that includes surface absorptivity and apparent conductivity of the traversed layers. Results of this study intend to improve our understanding of the energy balance of cool pavements compared to traditional ones under given weather conditions, as well as that of processes involved in the optimization of their evaporative cooling versus watering rate.

However, adaptations to different but interacting drivers of change are unclear in the mix of opportunities and threats related to increasing connections, emerging technologies, new patterns of dependency and possible lock-in effects. This paper discusses a more open-ended understanding of the relationship between resilience and vulnerability, highlighting emerging trade-offs among adaptive capacities and exposures to different (and new) threats as they relate to social-ecological sustainability. The transition of the Southern Bolivian Altiplano, from being a remote rural area of subsistence farming to a global leader in quinoa production and exportation, has been taken as a study case. Results from 18 workshops organised within different communities provide insights about a range of trade-offs between community resilience attributes and social-ecological vulnerability induced from land use changes, livestock strategies, communities' behavioural change and institutions' emerging policies. The main theoretical advances of the paper relate to the need for critically framing multiple threat exposures and adaptive capacity trade-offs, contributing to arguing the usually positive meaning of resilience, and taking into account to whom or to what is positive which adaptation and which trade-off should be accepted, and why. Framing adaptive pathways through these questions would serve as a tool for addressing sustainable development goals, while avoiding lock-ins or unsustainable path dependencies.","[Chelleri, Lorenzo; Skrimizea, Eirini] Gran Sasso Sci Inst, GSSI Social Sci, Viale Francesco Crispi 7, I-67100 Laquila, Italy; [Minucci, Guido] Politecn Milan, Architecture & Urban Studies Dept, Milan, Italy",Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI); Polytechnic University of Milan,"Chelleri, L (corresponding author), Gran Sasso Sci Inst, GSSI Social Sci, Viale Francesco Crispi 7, I-67100 Laquila, Italy.",lorenzo.chelleri@gssi.infn.it; guido.minucci@polimi.it; eirini.skrimizea@gssi.infn.it,"Minucci, Guido/O-2018-2019; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; SKRIMIZEA, EIRINI MARIA/O-6049-2019","Minucci, Guido/0000-0001-7195-0239; SKRIMIZEA, EIRINI MARIA/0000-0001-7952-3303; Chelleri, Lorenzo/0000-0003-0229-5028",Fondazione ACRA-CCS,Fondazione ACRA-CCS,"Authors acknowledge Fondazione ACRA-CCS and Carlo Krusich for their support in the research activities.

It however remains to be seen, whether N, P and K fertiliser application, would produce similar results, across different water stress conditions. A study was therefore conducted to determine how N, P and K fertiliser application, would influence cassava growth on nutrient poor soils, under various water stress conditions. Effects on new leaf formation and leaf size were also investigated. The study was a 2x3x4 factorial pot experiment, in a randomised complete block design. It included: two cassava varieties, three water stress levels and four fertiliser treatments. The water stress levels kept some plants watered at field capacities of 30% (severe water stress), 60% (mild water stress) and 100% (zero water stress). The fertiliser treatments consisted of a control (no fertiliser), a sole K fertiliser treatment (25 mg K/kg), a moderate N, P and K fertiliser treatment (25 mg N + 5 mg P + 25 mg K/kg) and a high N, P and K fertiliser treatment (50 mg N + 13 mg P + 50 mg K/kg). All data were analysed using the analysis of variance. Cassava growth was assessed by monitoring changes in the dry shoot mass of cassava plants. High and moderate N, P and K fertiliser application, produced cassava plants with higher and similar dry shoot masses, under mild water stress (10.5 g/plant, SE = 0.6 and 9.0 g/plant, SE = 0.6, respectively). High N, P and K fertiliser application, however gave cassava the highest dry shoot mass, under severe water stress (7.9 g/plant, SE = 0.4). Relatively high cassava growth was consistently achieved with high N, P and K fertiliser application, across all water stress conditions.","[Imakumbili, Matema L. E.; Semu, Ernest; Semoka, Johnson M.

Despite the fact that theoretical arguments have been developed and evidence collected from small-scale case studies, few studies have attempted to explain the substantial variation in the adoption of DRR measures across countries. This study combines available data on DRR measures, natural hazard events, governance, and socioeconomic characteristics to provide a systematic assessment of the changes that have occurred in the state of DRR at the national level. In line with theoretical explanations, there are indeed associations between several measures of frequency and severity and the development of DRR status. Additionally, voice and accountability mechanisms, as well as development aid, might facilitate positive change. Although these first results of a global comparative study on change in DRR have to be taken cautiously, it is a step forward to understanding the drivers of change at the national level.","[Wanner, Maximilian S.

Although these smart systems can provide adaptable shading during the year, they cannot meet the varying thermal comfort needs of building users in a short time because the microalgae medium's culture remains almost unchanged during the day. This paper reports on an innovative method that helps microalgae bioreactive facade respond to solar radiation and users' thermal needs in a short time. To achieve it, a smart window panel will be introduced, which contains two remotely-controlled adjustable bioreactors which can regulate the algae medium in height based on the users' thermal needs. This novel panel can serve as a bio-adaptable sunshade integrated with the building facade. Thus, the internal building thermal loads can be adjusted via the height of the bioreactor facade. Experimental and simulation research was conducted to compare the thermal performance of bioreactor facades at different microalgae medium height levels in the BSk climate zone. The results indicate that indoor and outdoor temperature differences for full, 3/4, 1/2, and 1/4 medium height level every 15-minute time interval are 12.55, 11.50, 10.87, and 6.53, respectively, indicating that the full-height level has the most influence to control the thermal load of the system. According to the results, the bioreactor facade with adjustable medium height greatly impacts building thermal control in a short time.","[Talaei, Maryam; Mahdavinejad, Mohammadjavad; Haghighi, Hadi Motevali; Atashdast, Ali] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Jalal Ale Ahmad St, Tehran 14115111, Iran; [Talaei, Maryam] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Dept Architecture, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Azadi Sq, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran; [Azari, Rahman] Penn State Univ, Coll Arts & Architecture, State Coll, PA 16801 USA",Tarbiat Modares University; Ferdowsi University Mashhad; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Mahdavinejad, M (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Jalal Ale Ahmad St, Tehran 14115111, Iran.",mahdavinejad@modares.ac.ir,,"Talaei, Maryam/0000-0002-9428-116X; Azari, Rahman/0000-0002-4844-639X",,,,,64,4,4,5,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-1388,2213-1396,,SUSTAIN ENERGY TECHN,Sustain.

However, there is a lack in support tools that translate the preferences and constraints of stakeholders to assess the viability of goals and strategies for adaptation planning. In this study, we introduce a decision-support model that simulates adaptation pathways using a multiobjective optimization algorithm. The model has been applied to find optimal adaptation pathways for reducing heat related morbidity in Seoul, South Korea under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5. We analyzed the effects of six hard and soft adaptation strategies from 2020 to 2100. Decision-maker preference scenarios based on three budget levels, two goal setting approaches and two investment delay plans were evaluated. The results show that after 2065, current adaptation strategies cannot reduce the impacts of heat mortality even with high budgets. A low budget limits adaptation for both ambitious and conservative goal settings while a higher budget did lead to greater adaptation but was not necessary for the conservative goal setting suggesting that efficient pairing of budget level based on the adaptation goal can be beneficial. Further, the longer the delay in investment toward adaptation results in irrecoverable reduction in adaptation. These results imply that different planning approaches are necessary for the desired adaptation effect and level of cost efficiency. This study is significant in that the methodology can be expanded to include other sectors and applied to various locations of different scales to help stakeholders develop more effective long-term adaptation plans based on their needs and constraints.

One important obstacle to reach this goal relates to adequate provisioning of data to ensure good governance of BGI, i.e., appropriate planning, design, construction, and maintenance. This study explores the gap between data availability and implementation of BGI in urban planning authorities in Sweden. A multi method approach including brainstorming, semi-structured interviews with urban planners and experts on BGI and Geographical Information System (GIS), and validating workshops were performed to develop a framework for structured and user-friendly data collection and use. Identified challenges concern data availability, data management, and GIS knowledge. There is a need to improve the organisation of data management and the skills of trans-disciplinary cooperation to better understand and interpret different types of data. Moreover, different strategic goals require different data to ensure efficient planning of BGI. This calls for closer interactions between development of strategic political goals and data collection. The data management framework consists of three parts: A) Ideal structure of data management in relation to planning process, data infrastructure and organisational structure, and B) A generic list of data needed, and C) The development of structures for data gathering and access. We conclude that it is essential to develop pan-municipal data management systems that bridge sectors and disciplines to ensure efficient management of the urban environment, and which is able to support the involvement of citizens to collect and access relevant data. The framework can assist in such development.","[Sorensen, J.] Lund Univ, Water Resources Engn, Lund, Sweden; [Persson, A. S.; Olsson, J.

These regions will be among the hardest hit by the impacts of climate change. This article urges governments and their development partners to put SAL inhabitants and their activities at the heart of efforts to support adaptation and climate resilient development, identifying opportunities to capitalize on the knowledge, institutions, resources and practices of SAL populations in adaptation action. Technical abstract Semi-arid lands (SALs) in developing countries are climate change 'hotspots' where climate hazards will affect poor populations disproportionately. This represents a major threat to the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda pledge to 'leave no one behind'. In this paper we argue that national governments have underestimated opportunities to support climate resilient development in SALs and highlight ways in which the resilience of SAL populations has been undermined by current top-down approaches to adaptation and development. We argue a radical shift in national policy landscapes is required that refocuses on leveraging the existing adaptive capacities of private actors - women, farmers, cooperatives and firms - to cope with and respond to prevailing environmental shocks and weather extremes. This, we argue, requires providing enabling business environments that are tailored to the diverse and specific needs of the private sector in SALs and which support the full range of private sector actors in SALs to meet the challenges and opportunities of climate change. In doing this, we identify opportunities to overcome structural weaknesses that currently contribute to a lack of private investment, undermine important resilience strategies and limit opportunities to unlock broader resilience in SALs through the private sector.","[Gannon, Kate Elizabeth; Crick, Florence; Conway, Declan; Fankhauser, Sam; Rouhaud, Estelle] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Crick, Florence] Internat Inst Environm & Dev IIED, London, England; [Atela, Joanes] African Ctr Technol Studies ACT, Nairobi, Kenya; [Babagaliyeva, Zhanna] Reg Environm Ctr Cent Asia CAREC, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan; [Batool, Samavia; Ludi, Eva; Qaisrani, Ayesha; Suleri, Abid] Sustainable Dev Policy Inst SDPI, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Carabine, Elizabeth; Jobbins, Guy; Ludi, Eva; Simonet, Catherine] Overseas Dev Inst, London, England; [Diop, Mamadou; Wade, Cheikh Tidiane] Innovat Environm Developpement IED Afr, Dakar, Senegal",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Gannon, KE (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England.",k.e.gannon@lse.ac.uk,"Batool, Samavia/GZN-1491-2022; Conway, Declan/HCH-7778-2022","Gannon, Kate/0000-0001-6742-8982; Rouhaud, Estelle/0000-0002-7316-4677; DIOP, Mamadou/0000-0002-4208-0577; Ludi, Eva/0000-0002-9069-7598; Fankhauser, Samuel/0000-0003-2100-7888","UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy [ES/R009708/1]","UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada(CGIAR); Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","This work was carried out under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA), with financial support from the UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID) and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada.

Since 1993, GST has consistently been above the 13 degrees C cool climate viticulture threshold. Alone, GST does not reliably assure yield predictability but does correlate more closely following the recent increasing UK focus on sparkling wine cultivars. June precipitation demonstrates the strongest relationship with yield. Conclusions: Increasing GST superficially suggests enhanced UK cool climate viticultural opportunities, but critically masks the additional impact of shorter term temperature and precipitation events and a high degree of inter-annual variability that continues to threaten productivity. A recent change in dominant UK vine cultivars appears to have increased viticultural sensitivity to inter-annual weather variability. Significance of the Study: This first quantitative and qualitative analysis of climate vulnerability in UK viticulture identifies threats and opportunities and helps steer studies of the impact of future climate change.","[Nesbitt, A.; Steele, C.; Lovett, A.; Dorling, S.] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Kemp, B.] Brock Univ, CCOVI, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada",University of East Anglia; Brock University,"Nesbitt, A (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",a.nesbitt@uea.ac.uk,"Lovett, Andrew/Q-6723-2019; Lovett, Andrew A/C-9942-2011","Lovett, Andrew/0000-0003-0554-9273; ","UK Natural Environment Research Council [NE/J500069/1]; Plumpton College, Plumpton, England; NERC [NE/J500069/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [1210046] Funding Source: researchfish","UK Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Plumpton College, Plumpton, England; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This work was supported through the award of a PhD research studentship to Alistair Nesbitt by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (grant number NE/J500069/1) and by funding from Chateau de Sours, kindly provided through its beneficiary: Plumpton College, Plumpton, England.",,57,33,33,11,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1322-7130,1755-0238,,AUST J GRAPE WINE R,Aust.

It can be used for the identification of robust adaptation options at site level. The assessment scheme was applied to the management of Europe's largest population of wild mountain reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) living in the arctic-alpine plateau of Hardangervidda in south-western Norway. At first, the last four decades (1964-2004) were analysed to identify climate- and non-climate-related driving forces affecting the population. In addition, regional projections of climate change were used to build scenarios for the potential effects on these driving forces until 2050. In the second step, the potential effects of climate change were classified according to the risk they pose to the conservation of reindeer in Hardangervidda. Based on this assessment, no-regret strategies for biodiversity management under changing climate conditions could be identified.","Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev, D-01217 Dresden, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur okologische Raumentwicklung,"Rannow, S (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev, D-01217 Dresden, Germany.",s.rannow@ioer.de,,,German Academic Exchange Service; European Community; ERDF [2CE168P3]; CENTRAL EUROPE Programme,German Academic Exchange Service(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); European Community(European Commission); ERDF(European Commission); CENTRAL EUROPE Programme,I would like to thank the German Academic Exchange Service and the European Community for providing a scholarship and a Marie Curie Fellowship.

This applies to the mitigation of climate change, in particular when federal governments (as in the U.S.) are inactive. More recently, federalism is also expected to empower sub-national actors in adapting to local impacts of climate change. The present paper analyses the role federalism in Austria played in greening the decentralised building sector (relevant for mitigation) on the one hand, and in improving regional flood risk management (relevant for adaptation) on the other. In line with the so-called matching school of the environmental federalism research strand we conclude that Austrian federalism proved to be more appropriate for regional flood protection than for mitigating climate change. We highlight that it is not federalism per se but federalism embedded in various contextual factors that shape environmental policy-making. Among these factors are the spatial scale of an environmental problem, the nitty-gritty of polity systems, and national politics (such as federal positions on climate change mitigation).","[Steurer, Reinhard; Clar, Christoph] BOKU Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, InFER Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Steurer, R (corresponding author), BOKU Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, InFER Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",reinhard.steurer@boku.ac.at,,,"Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP) of the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund [K10AC0K00054, KR14AC7K11809, K10AC0K00004]",Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP) of the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund,We thank the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP) of the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund for financing the following three projects that led to this article: (i) CLIP-IN (Project No. K10AC0K00054); (ii) Flood-Adapt (Project No. KR14AC7K11809); and (iii) FAMOUS (K10AC0K00004).,,75,8,8,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1523-908X,1522-7200,,J ENVIRON POL PLAN,J.

While many conceptual analyses of JNP exist, empirical studies that actually try to assess JNP processes are rare. This paper aims to fill this gap through an empirical analysis of the 'Hotspot Zuidplaspolder' project in which scientists, policymakers and other actors collaboratively looked for ways to 'climate proof' existing plans for urban development in one of the deepest polders of the Netherlands. The analysis is done by identifying and explaining the credibility and salience of the knowledge produced as well as the perceived legitimacy of the JNP process. Seven success factors derived from existing literature were used in the analysis. Stakeholders appeared to evaluate this project as positive, but the analysis shows that criteria and thresholds regarding success differ between the actors involved. We found three underlying design principles that should be followed to enhance the success of future JNP projects. First, it is necessary to organize several instances for reflection on the project processes. Second, new reward structures are needed to stimulate actors to take new initiatives and come up with creative ideas. Third, projects and programs should provide room to make mistakes and learn from them. This first set of empirical design principles for JNP is useful but should be further refined and nuanced in order to better deal with the social complexity of climate change and other wicked problems.","[Hegger, Dries; Dieperink, Carel] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Van Zeijl-Rozema, Annemarie] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Maastricht University,"Hegger, D (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.",dries_hegger@yahoo.com,"Hegger, Dries/S-8727-2016","Hegger, Dries/0000-0003-2721-3527",Dutch National Partnership for Sustainable Earth Research,Dutch National Partnership for Sustainable Earth Research,"This paper was prepared with the support of the Dutch National Partnership for Sustainable Earth Research.

FUEL; ORGANIC-MATTER; RESIDUE MANAGEMENT; CARBON DYNAMICS; LANDSCAPE POSITION; INCREASING AMOUNTS; YIELD COMPONENTS; SURFACE RESIDUE,"Biofuel production from crop residues is widely recognized as an essential component of developing a bioeconomy, but the removal of crop residues still raises many questions about the sustainability of the cropping system. Therefore, this study reviews the sustainability effects of crop residues removal for biofuel production in terms of crop production, soil health and greenhouse gas emissions. Most studies found little evidence that residue management had long-term impacts on grain yield unless the available water is limited. In years when water was not limiting, corn and wheat removal rates >= 90% produced similar or greater grain yield than no removal in most studies. Conversely, when water was limiting, corn grain yield decreased up to 21% with stover removal >= 90% in some studies. Changes in soil organic fractions and nutrients depended largely on the amount of residue returned, soil depth and texture, slope and tillage. Reductions in organic fractions occurred primarily with complete stover removal, in the top 15-30 cm in fine-textured soils. Soil erosion, water runoff and leaching of nutrients such as total nitrogen (N) and extractable soil potassium decreased when no more than 30% of crop residues were removed. Stover management effects on soil bulk density varied considerably depending on soil layer, and residue and tillage management, with removal rates of less than 50% helping to maintain the soil aggregate stability. Reductions in CO2 and N2O fluxes typically occurred following complete residue removal. The use of wheat straw typically increased CH4 emissions, and above or equal to 8 Mg/ha wheat straw led to the largest CO2 and N2O emissions, regardless of N rates. Before using crop residues for biofuel production, it should therefore always be checked whether neutral to positive sustainability effects can be maintained under the site-specific conditions.","[Battaglia, Martin] Cornell Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Dept Anim Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Thomason, Wade; Fike, John H.; Evanylo, Gregory K.] Virginia Tech, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Dept Crop & Soil Environm Sci, Blacksburg, VA USA; [von Cossel, Moritz] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci, Biobased Resources Bioecon 340b, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Babur, Emre] Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam Univ, Fac Forestry, Soil & Ecol Dept, Kahramanmaras, Turkey; [Iqbal, Yasir] Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Biosci & Biotechnol, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China; [Diatta, Andre A.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agron, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Cornell University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University Hohenheim; Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University; Hunan Agricultural University; Kansas State University,"von Cossel, M (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci, Biobased Resources Bioecon 340b, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.;Iqbal, Y (corresponding author), Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Biosci & Biotechnol, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China.",moritz.cossel@uni-hohenheim.de; yasir.iqbal1986@gmail.com,"Iqbal, Yasir/I-2855-2019; Babur, Emre/AEQ-3596-2022; Von Cossel, Moritz/I-6596-2019","Iqbal, Yasir/0000-0003-1253-204X; Babur, Emre/0000-0002-1776-3018; Von Cossel, Moritz/0000-0002-1132-3281; Battaglia, Martin/0000-0001-5999-3367","Universitat Hohenheim; Hunan Agricultural University [2020JJ5228, 540721900299]; Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University",Universitat Hohenheim; Hunan Agricultural University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,"Universitat Hohenheim; Hunan Agricultural University, Grant/Award Number: 2020JJ5228 and 540721900299; Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University",,108,33,33,27,111,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1757-1693,1757-1707,,GCB BIOENERGY,GCB Bioenergy,JAN,2021,13,1,,,,,45,57,,10.1111/gcbb.12774,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcbb.12774,,NOV 2020,13,Agronomy; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Energy & Fuels,PC3US,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000587708900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It argues that the interpretation and application of these obligations can compel and shape anticipatory, proactive state measures on, and support for, adaptation. To accomplish this, the article begins from the premise that the regime's climate treaties are a dynamic part of a system of international law that should strive for coherence. Accordingly, it takes an evolutive approach to interpreting obligations. The article applies the tools of treaty interpretation, and systemic integration in particular, to incorporate positive duties from human rights law into an understanding of adaptation obligations. It also applies the regime's operative principles alongside integration. Taken together, they help to shape adaptation obligations, strengthening arguments for action in advance of foreseeable harm and for support based on differentiation. Such an approach can lead to adaptation that better avoids risks to people and their rights, to prioritize those most vulnerable and to ensure access to essential resources.","[Nishimura, Lauren] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Nishimura, L (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",lauren.nishi@gmail.com,,,,,,,98,0,0,0,0,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1878-6553,1878-6561,,CLIM LAW,Clim.

Recent decision-making employs flexible options that can be modified/adjusted over time to address uncertainty. This research analyses a real option based method for assessing adaptation investment timing under coastal flooding and sea-level rise. This method recognises and values the flexibility of waiting as an additional adaptation option under an uncertain future, that is, the key question concerns when the option is best implemented? Real options are applied using a test-case in Lymington (UK), a floodprone coastal town. Our findings show that the option value (i.e., the net value of the overall benefit minus cost) grows with rising sea level to a maximum, which is the optimal time for the adaptation investment. The optimum investment time tends to occur at the same magnitude of sea-level rise (relative to 1990) across most sea-level rise scenarios for the same socio-economic scenario. Hence, monitoring sea-level rise provides important information to plan adaptation. The analysis provides an analytical framework on how and when to implement the adaptation option given the various future scenarios which can be developed further.","[Kim, Myung-Jin; Nicholls, Robert J.; Preston, John M.; de Almeida, Gustavo A.

This creates an opportunity during relicensing for modification or removal of dams to render them safe, maximise their services and minimise social and environmental impacts. We examined case studies of reassessment of dams from Australia (New South Wales), China, France and the United States that illustrated the following: the management challenge of aging and unsafe dams; unrealised opportunities to improve environmental, social and economic benefits; and the benefits of inventory and relicensing systems. Key elements of an ideal regulatory system to optimise water infrastructure performance are identified, comprising periodic (time-limited) relicensing of all infrastructure overseen by an independent regulatory agency that would take decisions in the public interest through a transparent process, involving public participation.

Environmental design is increasingly engaged in this transition, but little is known about purposefully designed renewable energy landscapes. To improve the design of large-scale energy landscapes we reviewed the literature on three innovative large-scale landscape transformations: Room for the River Nijmegen-Lent (The Netherlands), Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park (UK) and Freshkills Park (USA). We analysed 61 papers on landscape quality and the role of design, governments and participation. Concerning landscape quality, literature reports on functionality and certain aspects of experience rather than firmness (future values) of the transformation. While designers played an important role in large-scale landscape transformations, local governments seem not to be in control of the decision-making and participation was limited. The three cases illustrate how executed projects influence the discourse on landscape transformation and provide valuable insights for the design of renewable energy landscapes.","[Oudes, Dirk; Stremke, Sven] Wageningen Univ & Res, Environm Sci Grp, Landscape Architecture Chair Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Oudes, Dirk; Stremke, Sven] Amsterdam Univ Arts, Acad Architecture, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Oudes, D (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Environm Sci Grp, Landscape Architecture Chair Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.;Oudes, D (corresponding author), Amsterdam Univ Arts, Acad Architecture, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",dirk.oudes@wur.nl,,"Oudes, Dirk/0000-0003-4469-0966",,,,,64,12,12,7,53,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-6397,1469-9710,,LANDSCAPE RES,Landsc.

In this paper, by adapting this framework to the study of UHI countermeasures, we propose a statistical method suited for assessing their effects in the field. The framework demonstrates that direct comparisons between case and control sites cannot isolate the impacts of UHI countermeasure. It also shows that the interstation differences before and after countermeasure implementation cannot be considered as statistically independent. Consequently, statistical procedures suited for handling dependent observations are necessary such as a linear mixed or fixed effects model. As a case study, experimental data from pavement-watering experiments conducted in Paris since 2013 are used, with the goal of assessing its cooling effects for two different watering strategies. With the fixed effects model, long-lasting statistically-significant effects are found. Results indicate beneficial thermal effects for pedestrians with reductions of UTCI-equivalent temperature up to 2 degrees C, and duration of statistically-significant effects directly linked to the watered surface area. The method is limited by the number of measurements that must be gathered both before and after the UHI countermeasure implementation.","[Parison, Sophie; Hendel, Martin; Royon, Laurent] Univ Paris, LIED, CNRS, UMR 8236, F-75006 Paris, France; [Parison, Sophie] Paris City Hall, Water & Sanitat Div, Paris, France; [Parison, Sophie] Paris City Hall, Rd & Transportat Div, Paris, France; [Hendel, Martin] Univ Gustave Eiffel, Dept SEN, ESIEE Paris, F-93162 Noisy Le Grand, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; ESIEE Paris,"Parison, S (corresponding author), Univ Paris, LIED, CNRS, UMR 8236, F-75006 Paris, France.",sophie.parison@univ-paris-diderot.fr,,"ROYON, LAURENT/0000-0002-2458-144X","Water and Sanitation and Roads and Traffic Divisions of the Paris City Hall, France","Water and Sanitation and Roads and Traffic Divisions of the Paris City Hall, France","Funding for this study was provided by the Water and Sanitation and Roads and Traffic Divisions of the Paris City Hall, France.",,32,5,6,1,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,SEP,2020,33,,,,,,,,100651,10.1016/j.uclim.2020.100651,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2020.100651,,,13,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,ND4TF,,Green Submitted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000561893900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The purpose of this study is to apply the CRIDA approach to a water supply case study in Central Cebu, the Philippines in order to evaluate the added benefits of the method for planning and design under climate change uncertainty.

The resiliency of a household to disruption is usually a separate consideration, if at all. The up-front costs of both can present themselves as nonessential expenses limiting their adoption. There exist few tools to integrate design for sustainability and resiliency that are available to average homeowners. This inhibits their ability to implement climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. Herein is a systems approach to integrate sustainability efforts with resilience solutions into a computational multi-objective decision support methodology with a financial analysis. The methodology, dubbed ReSus, is shown here with an example case study of a midsize single detached house in southwestern Ontario, Canada through simulation of retrofitting scenarios to support decision making on building upgrades. Applying this methodology details several retrofitting pathways that have the potential to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions as well as provide a positive return on investment that addresses both mitigation and adaptation.","[Bristow, David N.] Univ Victoria, POB 1700,Stn CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Bristow, Michele] Univ Waterloo, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Victoria; University of Waterloo,"Bristow, DN (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, POB 1700,Stn CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.",dbristow@uvic.ca,,,,,,,25,4,4,0,19,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0315-1468,1208-6029,,CAN J CIVIL ENG,Can.

We built and describe this framework through discussion of two case studies of coastal restoration efforts in southern New England salt marshes. The first case study focuses on the use of sediment placement to increase the elevation of the surface of a drowning marsh in Rhode Island as an interim measure to protect against sea level rise. The second case study describes the use of living shorelines for erosion mitigation on a salt marsh in Massachusetts. These cases included significant partner and stakeholder engagement and provided important lessons learned for practical implementation of the SESAME framework. Valuable lessons included the need for engagement throughout the entirety of the process, specific clarification of roles within the restoration efforts, and flexibility in implementation and goal setting.","[Mulvaney, Kate; Ayvazian, Suzanne; Wigand, Cathleen; Canfield, Katherine; Schoell, Mary] US EPA, Atlantic Coastal Environm Sci Div, Ctr Environm Measurement & Modeling, Off Res & Dev, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA; [Chaffee, Caitlin; Schoell, Mary] Narragansett Bay Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, Prudence Isl, RI 02872 USA; [Schoell, Mary] NOAA, Prudence Isl, RI 02872 USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Mulvaney, K (corresponding author), US EPA, Atlantic Coastal Environm Sci Div, Ctr Environm Measurement & Modeling, Off Res & Dev, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA.",mulvaney.kate@epa.gov,,"Mulvaney, Kate/0000-0003-2581-7677",Hurricane Sandy Coastal Resiliency Competitive Grant Program NFWF [41739],Hurricane Sandy Coastal Resiliency Competitive Grant Program NFWF,The Ninigret project was funded through the Hurricane Sandy Coastal Resiliency Competitive Grant Program NFWF Grant No. 41739.,,38,1,1,10,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-4861,1572-9834,,WETL ECOL MANAG,Wetl.

Results showed that EGCC exhibits a distinct semiconducting electrical behavior, the relatively high Seebeck coefficient at a temperature range of 30-100 degrees C and extremely high electrical conductivity of 24.8 S/cm for cement-based materials. The higher power factor and thermoelectric figure of merit 6.82 x 10(-4) were then achieved in the case of keeping thermal conductivity of 3.213 Wm(-1) K-1, while the EGCC held a high compressive strength (106.51 MPa). The excellent thermoeleCtric property of EGCC has promising prospects for alleviating the urban heat island effect by harvesting and converting solar radiation thermal energy in large-scale, and thus decreasing cooling energy demand of cities.

In addition, this study finds weak support for the complementarity hypothesis between internal and external sources of innovation and suggests strongly that these sources of innovation are not substitutable. The capacity and vulnerability of municipalities, as well as political support for initiatives to improve the management of weather disasters, seem to be significant drivers of innovation.

Complying with the main WFD objective of achieving 'good ecological status' in all water bodies in Denmark requires Programmes of Measures (PoMs) to reduce nitrogen (N) pollution from point and diffuse sources. Denmark is among the world's most intensively farmed countries and in spite of thirty years of significant policy actions to reduce diffuse nutrient emissions, there is still a need for further reductions. In addition, the impacts of climate change are projected to lead to a situation where nutrient loads will have to be reduced still further in comparison to current climate conditions. There is an urgent need to address this challenge in WFD action programmes in order to develop robust and cost-effective adaptation strategies for the next WFD RBMP cycles. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate and discuss how a map-based PoMs assessment tool can support the development of adaptive and cost-effective strategies to reduce N losses in the Isefjord and Roskilde Fjord River Basin in the north east of Denmark. The tool facilitates assessments of the application of agri-environmental measures that are targeted towards low retention agricultural areas, where limited or no surface and subsurface N reduction takes place. Effects of climate change on nitrate leaching were evaluated using the dynamic agro-ecosystem model 'Daisy'. Results show that nitrate leaching rates increase by approx. 25% under current management practices. This impact outweighs the expected total N reduction effect of Baseline 2015 and the first RBMP in the case study river basin. The particular PoMs investigated in our study show that WFD N reduction targets can be achieved by targeted land use changes on approx. 4% of the agricultural area under current climate conditions and approx. 9% of the agricultural area, when projected climate change impacts on nitrate leaching rates are included in the assessment. The study highlights the potential of the PoMs assessment tool to assist in evaluation of alternative WFD RBMP scenarios to achieve spatially targeted and cost-effective reductions of N loads at catchment scale in the context of a changing climate.

The aim of this paper was to determine the environmental and economic impacts of a pilot FST that was built in Sao Carlos (Brazil) using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC). As a result, the components with the greatest contributions to the total impacts of the FST were the infiltration trench and the grass cover. The system has a carbon footprint of 0.13 kg CO2 eq./m(3) of infiltrated stormwater and an eco-efficiency ratio of 0.35 kg CO2 eq./USD. Moreover, the FST prevented up to 95% of the runoff in the area. Compared to a grey infrastructure, this system is a good solution with respect to PVC stormwater pipes, which require a long pipe length (1070 m) and have a shorter lifespan. In contrast, concrete pipes are a better solution, and their impacts are similar to those of the FST. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the changes in the impacts with the varying lifespan of the system components. Thus, the proper management of the FST can reduce the economic and environmental impacts of the system by increasing its durability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To limit this problem, there is a need for a robust agricultural policy that aims at stabilizing agricultural production and socio-economic entitlement among the farmers. The present study analyses the production trend of maize, sorghum and millet (i.e., staple food crops) under rain fed agriculture in Kongwa District, the semi-arid agro-ecological zone of Central Tanzania, and envisage their implications to food security and policy. We collected a set of crop data (1980-2015) from the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries. In addition, 400 respondents were sampled randomly in the study area during household survey while a series of interviews and discussions were conducted mostly basing on the expertise. The Mann-Kendall Test and Microsoft excel (window 13) and theme content methods were employed for data analyses. The results showed that the production trends for maize, sorghum and millet yields have been decreasing at R-2 = 0.40, 0.35 and 0.11 respectively and this trend was supported by 80% of the respondents. This decrease was greatly influenced by the temporal decrease in the mean annual rainfall (R-2 = 0.21). The diminishing production trend has already decreased food security for 30% in the area. Since agricultural policy can be among the main sources of this poor yields, an explicit and sound agricultural policy should be the central aspect in planning and implementing agricultural activities.","[Mkonda, Msafiri Y.; He, Xinhua] Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Ctr Excellence Soil Biol, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Mkonda, Msafiri Y.] Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Solomon Mahlangu Coll Sci & Educ, Morogoro 3038, Tanzania; [He, Xinhua] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",Southwest University - China; Sokoine University of Agriculture; University of Western Australia,"Mkonda, MY; He, XH (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Ctr Excellence Soil Biol, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.;Mkonda, MY (corresponding author), Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Solomon Mahlangu Coll Sci & Educ, Morogoro 3038, Tanzania.;He, XH (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",msamkonda81@yahoo.co.uk; xinhua.he@uwa.edu.au,"Mkonda, Msafiri/H-9317-2019; He, Xinhua/AAK-1548-2020; He, Xinhua/D-6920-2011","Mkonda, Msafiri/0000-0002-1626-3724; He, Xinhua/0000-0002-5570-3454",Chinese Government Scholarship (CSC); China Scholar Council International PhD Program; Chongqing 100 Talents Program,Chinese Government Scholarship (CSC); China Scholar Council International PhD Program; Chongqing 100 Talents Program,"We are indebted to the Chinese Government Scholarship (CSC) for providing the scholarship for Msafiri Y.

These, as well as historic landscapes, make up a significant part of an urban area's identity and cannot just be rebuilt or significantly changed without taking into account the historic value, cultural background, and prescribed regulations. Systematic resilience building for historic areas is becoming essential, and research supporting it will be in the spotlight. However, questions still exist concerning how to best transfer research results into practice at the community level. Standardization of resilience-enhancing methods and tools deriving from research projects is one option, chosen, e.g., for the EU-Horizon 2020 project ARCH. Within the project, a disaster risk management (DRM) framework has been composed and then transferred into a standard, supported by a co-creation approach involving relevant stakeholders. This article outlines the project's different standardization steps and its impact on the development of the ARCH DRM Framework. It highlights the systematic inclusion of project-external stakeholders who actively contribute to the validation and enhancement of the ARCH DRM framework to guarantee maximum applicability in historic areas, supporting them in their fight against the impacts of climate change and natural hazards.","[Lindner, Rene; Maresch, Saskia] DIN German Inst Standardizat, D-10787 Berlin, Germany; [Lindner, Rene; Hernantes, Josune; Jaca, Carmen] Univ Navarra, TECNUN Escuela Ingn, San Sebastian 20018, Spain; [Lueckerath, Daniel; Milde, Katharina; Ullrich, Oliver] Fraunhofer Inst Intelligent Anal & Informat Syst, D-53757 St Augustin, Germany; [Peinhardt, Katherine; Latinos, Vasileios] ICLEI Local Governments Sustainabil, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany",University of Navarra; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Lindner, R (corresponding author), DIN German Inst Standardizat, D-10787 Berlin, Germany.;Lindner, R (corresponding author), Univ Navarra, TECNUN Escuela Ingn, San Sebastian 20018, Spain.",rene.lindner@din.de; daniel.lueckerath@iais.fraunhofer.de; katharina.milde@iais.fraunhofer.de; oliver.ullrich@iais.fraunhofer.de; saskia.maresch@din.de; katherine.peinhardt@iclei.org; vasileios.latinos@iclei.org; jhernantes@tecnun.es; cjaca@tecnun.es,"Jaca, Carmen/A-2667-2013; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Lindner, Rene/HLG-3762-2023","Jaca, Carmen/0000-0002-8438-5387; Luckerath, Daniel/0000-0002-4988-5511; Lindner, Rene/0000-0002-6152-1390; Ullrich, Oliver/0000-0002-5103-2059; Milde, Katharina/0000-0002-8140-0617",European Union [820999],European Union(European Commission),This research within the ARCH project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement number 820999.

This assessment led to the derivation of six overarching design frameworks and affiliated physical site strategies. A selection of Olmsted's projects were then assessed for their embodiment of each of these frameworks and deployment of physical design strategies. Resilient design themes such as 'systems thinking', 'safe to fail', 'redundancy' and 'accounting for indeterminacy' were found to be consistently prevalent and central to the Olmsted Office.

This paper describes a model for estimating the cost and materials of elevating coastal seaport infrastructure in the United States to prevent damage from sea level rise associated with climate change. This study pilots the use of a generic port model (GenPort) as a basis from which to estimate regional materials and monetary demands, resulting in projections that would be infeasible to calculate on an individual port-by-port basis. We estimate the combined cost of adding two meters of additional fill material to elevate the working surface and then reconstructing the generic port. We use the resulting unit area cost to develop an estimate to elevate and retrofit 100 major United States commercial coastal ports. A total of $ 57 billion to $ 78 billion (2012 US dollars) and 704 million cubic meters of fill would be required to elevate the 100 ports by two meters and to reconstruct associated infrastructure. This estimation method and the results serve as a thought exercise to provoke considerations of the cumulative monetary and material demands of widespread adaptations of seaport infrastructure. The model can be adapted for use in multiple infrastructure sectors and coastal managers can use the outlined considerations as a basis for individual port adaptation strategy assessments.","[Becker, Austin; Mclean, Elizabeth L.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Marine Affair, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Hippe, Ariel] DOWL, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA",University of Rhode Island,"Becker, A (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Marine Affair, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",abecker@uri.edu; ahippe@dowl.com; elmclean@uri.edu,"Brown, Sally/I-2662-2014; Wahl, Thomas/ABE-6405-2020; Mclean, Elizabeth/HNB-9042-2023; Brown, Sally/AAD-6943-2020","Brown, Sally/0000-0003-1185-1962; Becker, Austin/0000-0001-9224-7913",,,,,47,11,11,0,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1312,,J MAR SCI ENG,J.

However, amidst global disruptions by climate change, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and other disasters, hospitals' ability to cope continues to be highly variable. Hence, there are increasing calls to improve hospitals' capabilities to grow and adapt towards enhanced resilience. Aim: This study aims two-fold: (1) to characterize the current state of knowledge about how hospitals are gaining knowledge from their responses to disasters, and (2) to explore how this knowledge can be applied to inform organizational practices for hospital resilience. Method: This study used Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for data collection and framework for data analysis, Covidence software, and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords relevant to hospitals, learn, disaster response, and resilience. The quality appraisal used an adapted version of the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool (MMAT). Results: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria and quality appraisal, out of the 420 articles retrieved, 22 articles remained for thematic and content analysis. The thematic analysis included the hospital's functional (operational) and physical (structural and non-structural) sections. The content analysis followed nine learning areas (Governance and Leadership, Planning and Risk Assessment, Surveillance and Monitoring, Communication and Network Engagement, Staff Practices and Safety, Equipment and Resources, Facilities and Infrastructure, Novelty and Innovation, and Learning and Evaluation). On applying the Deming cycle, only four studies described a completed learning cycle wherein hospitals adapted their organizational structures using the prior experience and evaluation gained in responding to disaster(s). Conclusions: There is a gap between hospitals' organizational learning and institutionalized practice. The conceptualized Hybrid Resilience Learning Framework (HRLF) aims to guide the hospitals' decision makers in evaluating organizational resilience and knowledge. In the face of disasters, both the stressful factors and the coping strategies that affect the health care workers (HCWs) should be substantially considered.","[Mohtady Ali, Heba; Roiko, Anne; Desha, Cheryl] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Gold Coast, Australia; [Mohtady Ali, Heba; Desha, Cheryl] Griffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Gold Coast, Australia; [Ranse, Jamie] Gold Coast Hlth, Dept Emergency Med, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Ranse, Jamie; Roiko, Anne] Griffith Univ, Menzies Hlth Inst Queensland, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University; Menzies Health Institute Queensland,"Ali, HM (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Gold Coast Campus,Bldg G06,Room 3 45,Parklands Dr, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia.",heba.ali@griffithuni.edu.au,"Ranse, Jamie/AAU-1649-2020; Desha, Cheryl/J-1340-2012","Ranse, Jamie/0000-0002-5265-6365; Mohtady Ali, Heba/0000-0002-7817-6570; Desha, Cheryl/0000-0002-4026-0830; Roiko, Anne/0000-0003-0395-307X",Griffith University,Griffith University(Griffith University),The corresponding author is a recipient of the Griffith University PhD scholarship (Postgraduate Research scholarship) and a Griffith University International Postgraduate Research scholarship.,,53,2,2,12,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1049-023X,1945-1938,,PREHOSPITAL DISASTER,Prehospital Disaster Med.,OCT,2022,37,5,,,,,665,673,PII S1049023X2200108X,10.1017/S1049023X2200108X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1049023X2200108X,,AUG 2022,9,Emergency Medicine,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Emergency Medicine,4M1NU,35924715,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000835995200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Subsequently, the adjacent Hutelmoor was flooded with the aim to restore it as a brackish coastal moor. Coastal protection measures at the Baltic Sea coastline were abandoned to enable natural dynamics, a coastal realignment and salt water intrusions. The entire process until full implementation took 14 years and was associated with very problematic public participation and a strong local polarization. Based on a literature and media review, two surveys, and expert interviews we retrospectively document and analyse the planning process with focus on public information, perception and participation. The local population and holidaymakers did not perceive coastal changes and if, did not associate them with climate change. Interviewees remembered single storm surges, but felt save from it and sea level rise was not perceived as a threat. 89% said that they feel insufficiently informed about the combined coastal protection wetland restoration measure, but did not use the offered information possibilities. 81% had their information from newspapers and freely distributed advertisers. It seems that insufficient information was the major reason for the problems with local acceptance and public participation. The media played a dominating role. The decline of traditional newspapers and the growths of free advertisers seemed to have a negative impact on quality of information and favoured a polarization. Additionally, we discuss local specifics like the cultural background (GDR history), traditions, frustration and the relatively old population and their role in public participation. We strongly promote a pro-active and long-term information and public relation strategy.","[Schernewski, Gerald; Schumacher, Johanna; Weisner, Eva; Donges, Larissa] Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res Warnemunde, Coastal Res & Management Grp, Seestr 15, D-18119 Rostock, Germany; [Schernewski, Gerald] Klaipeda Univ, Marine Sci & Technol Ctr, Herkus Mantas G 84, LT-92294 Klaipeda, Lithuania",Leibniz Institut fur Ostseeforschung Warnemunde; Klaipeda University,"Schernewski, G (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res Warnemunde, Coastal Res & Management Grp, Seestr 15, D-18119 Rostock, Germany.;Schernewski, G (corresponding author), Klaipeda Univ, Marine Sci & Technol Ctr, Herkus Mantas G 84, LT-92294 Klaipeda, Lithuania.",gerald.schernewski@io-warnemuende.de,,"Schumacher, Johanna/0000-0003-4881-7776; Schernewski, Gerald/0000-0002-4036-7646","BONUS BaltCoast project; BONUS from the European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration [185]; Baltic Sea national funding institutions","BONUS BaltCoast project; BONUS from the European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration; Baltic Sea national funding institutions","The work was part-funded by the BONUS BaltCoast project.

Though useful to analyse general trends and identify potential risks and opportunities internationally, these resolutions are unable to capture the complexity of coastal areas where aquaculture is located, and poorly represent the environmental variabilities to which cultured organisms are subjected. Consequently, most aquaculture planning and management decisions require information at a much finer scale. If climate projections do not adequately represent conditions experienced at aquaculture sites, potential impacts could be missed, adaptation strategies may be inappropriate, and time and resources could be spent implementing ineffective measures. To demonstrate this, we focus on sea temperature and the production of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in Norway, the world's leading salmon producer and a country with a latitudinal range that exemplifies the challenges related to generalization of farming practises. The results show that if coarse resolution climate model temperatures were used directly, then impacts on salmon culture could be severely over or underestimated. For overlapping reference periods, the average daily modelled temperatures at selected sites frequently differed by several degrees, with the largest differences being over 6 degrees C, when compared to daily average farm measurements. This has serious biological and economic implications as potential risks to production could be underestimated unless corrected. Here two bias-correction techniques were used to calibrate the climate projections to farm scale and shown to more accurately reflect the conditions experienced. The calibrated future projections for RCP4.5 suggest increased temperatures at all sites may require adjustments to existing farm management practices, but the nature and severity of the impact will vary with location. Our research clearly shows that local scale conditions must be considered, using locally resolved climate projections, to develop meaningful adaptation plans to meet the growing demand for seafood in a changing climate.","[Falconer, Lynne; Telfer, Trevor C.; McAdam, Bruce J.] Univ Stirling, Inst Aquaculture, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Hjollo, Solfrid Saetre] Inst Marine Res, Box 1870 Nordnes, N-5817 Bergen, Norway; [Hermansen, Oystein; Ytteborg, Elisabeth] Nofima, Muninbakken 9-13,Box 6122 Langnes, NO-9291 Tromso, Norway",University of Stirling; Institute of Marine Research - Norway; Nofima,"Falconer, L (corresponding author), Univ Stirling, Inst Aquaculture, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",lynne.falconer1@stir.ac.uk,"; Ytteborg, Elisabeth/J-1032-2017","Falconer, Lynne/0000-0002-1899-1290; Ytteborg, Elisabeth/0000-0002-3131-020X; Hjollo, Solfrid Saetre/0000-0003-2897-474X","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [677039]; Centre for Climate Dynamics (SKD) in Bergen, Norway through the PARADIGM project; BBSRC [BB/P017223/1] Funding Source: UKRI","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; Centre for Climate Dynamics (SKD) in Bergen, Norway through the PARADIGM project; BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC))","This work has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 677039 (ClimeFish).

This was the case of the events of 1997 and 2015 that resulted in monthslong hazardous atmospheric pollution levels in Equatorial Asia and record greenhouse gas emissions. Nonetheless, anomalously active fire seasons have also been observed in non-drought years. In this work, we investigated the impact of temperature on fires and found that when the July-October (JASO) period is anomalously dry, the sensitivity of fires to temperature is modest. In contrast, under normal-to-wet conditions, fire probability increases sharply when JASO is anomalously warm. This describes a regime in which an active fire season is not limited to drought years. Greater susceptibility to fires in response to a warmer environment finds support in the high evapotranspiration rates observed in normal-to-wet and warm conditions in Indonesia. We also find that fire probability in wet JASOs would be considerably less sensitive to temperature were not for the added effect of recent positive trends. Near-term regional climate projections reveal that, despite negligible changes in precipitation, a continuing warming trend will heighten fire probability over the next few decades especially in non-drought years. Mild fire seasons currently observed in association with wet conditions and cool temperatures will become rare events in Indonesia.","[Fernandes, Katia; Baethgen, Walter; Pinedo-Vasquez, Miguel] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc IRI, 61 Route 9 W, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Verchot, Louis] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Km 17 Recta Cali Palmira, Cali 6713, Colombia; [Gutierrez-Velez, Victor] Temple Univ, Dept Geog & Urban Studies, 1115W Berks St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Pinedo-Vasquez, Miguel; Martius, Christopher] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Jalan CIFOR,Situ Gede, Bogor 16115, Barat, Indonesia",Columbia University; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),"Fernandes, K (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc IRI, 61 Route 9 W, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",katia@iri.columbia.edu,"Verchot, Louis/C-4537-2008; Baethgen, Walter/B-6610-2009; Gutierrez-Velez, Victor Hugo/B-6882-2012; Baethgen, Walter/M-8084-2016","Gutierrez-Velez, Victor Hugo/0000-0003-1338-2020; Martius, Christopher/0000-0002-6884-0298; Verchot, Louis/0000-0001-8309-6754; Fernandes, Katia/0000-0001-8160-0769; Baethgen, Walter/0000-0003-2052-2052",United States Agency for International Development [MTO 069018],United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"Funding was provided by the United States Agency for International Development (Grant agreement #MTO 069018).

We investigated the hydrological processes of Lake Qinghai and the surrounding watershed that have influenced water level and lake area from 1956 to 2019. Relationships among water level, climate change and human activities were also assessed. Water level and lake area were positively correlated with precipitation and runoff into the lake, and negatively correlated with evaporation. Climate change factors including precipitation and runoff were the primary causes of lake level change, whereas human activities, including variation in a human footprint index, land use, and grassland irrigation, were secondary factors. A time series model forecasted that from 2020 to 2050 water levels will increase further by 2.45 m. Although this increase in water level may have some benefits, such as reduced local desertification, the expansion of lake area will continue to flood low beaches, pasture lands, near shore infrastructure and roads, and impact tourism locations. However, continued water level rise may also have negative ecological effects, such as reduce habitat of seasonal birds and reduced water quality due to erosion and sediment resuspension in shallow nearshore lake areas. Local stakeholders, government authorities, and scientists should give greater attention to anticipated changes in water level, and further ecological studies and infrastructure adaptation measures should be implemented.","[Hou, Pengfei; Liu, Qi; Duan, Lizeng; Zhang, Xiaonan; Liu, Fengwen; Gao, Youhong; Xu, Jing; Li, Huayu; Zhang, Hucai] Yunnan Univ, Inst Ecol Res & Pollut Control Plateau Lakes, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Hou, Pengfei; Liu, Qi; Duan, Lizeng; Zhang, Xiaonan; Liu, Fengwen; Gao, Youhong; Xu, Jing; Li, Huayu; Zhang, Hucai] Southwest United Grad Sch, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Hou, Pengfei; Weidman, R.

Grounded in an ethnographic study conducted in a lifestyle destination with lifestyle travellers moored across multiple domestic nature-based destinations, this paper finds that the motivations towards lifestyle mobility are rooted in how people relate their health and desired ways of life with the natural environment through tourism practices, everyday practices at original homes and destinations, and mobility practices. Consistent movements of human bodies, objects and skills enable lifestyle travellers to perceive and understand environmental pollution and adapt to different climates. Rather than focussing on identity construction or the sense of belonging, we provide a different way to conceptualise lifestyle mobilities by appreciating the sensitivity, reflexivity and adaptability that an emerging Chinese mobile population develops when living with environmental crises, climate change and changing climates across various indoor and outdoor spaces. This paper reflects on the potential of intersecting practice theories with mobilities paradigm and pollution perception studies and suggests policy intervention on lifestyle mobilities in a rapidly industrialising and highly mobile era.","[Liu, Qi; Browne, Alison L.] Univ Manchester, Dept Geog, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Liu, Q (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Dept Geog, Manchester, Lancs, England.",qi.liu-8@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk,,"Browne, Alison L/0000-0002-1048-6724; Liu, Qi/0000-0001-6077-361X",,,,,79,0,0,7,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1745-0101,1745-011X,,MOBILITIES-UK,Mobilities,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/17450101.2022.2109985,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17450101.2022.2109985,,SEP 2022,17,Geography; Transportation,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography; Transportation,4H0EH,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000849557200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, their participation in these off-farm reform processes has received limited research attention. This paper investigates farmer participation in state-mandated common-pool resource governance. Using groundwater governance in California as a case study, we show that existing social networks, in combination with asymmetries in resource access within the farming community, and a collective identity framed against central government intervention, explain participation and representation in groundwater governance processes. An important governance paradox has emerged, in which groundwater-dependent users are unequally represented in the very groundwater management agencies that have been developed to protect them. This case sheds light on documented shortcomings of common-pool resource governance reforms and aims to inform the design of future reform processes.","[Mendez-Barrientos, Linda Esteli; Rudnick, Jessica; Lowry, Bridget; Gould, Kennedy] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [DeVincentis, Alyssa] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Dahlquist-Willard, Ruth] Univ Calif Cooperat Extens Fresno Cty, Fresno, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Mendez-Barrientos, LE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, 2126 Wickson Hall, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",lemendez@ucdavis.edu,,"Mendez Barrientos, Linda Esteli/0000-0001-8759-6908","National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Climate Change, Water and Society (CCWAS) IGERT at the University of California Davis","National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Climate Change, Water and Society (CCWAS) IGERT at the University of California Davis(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We would like to thank the National Science Foundation (NSF) for its financial support through the Climate Change, Water and Society (CCWAS) IGERT at the University of California Davis.",,77,15,15,2,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0894-1920,1521-0723,,SOC NATUR RESOUR,Soc.

We consider direct erosion on open sandy coasts and indirect erosion near selected tidal inlets and estuaries, using six global mean sea-level scenarios (in the range of 0.2-0.8 m) and six SRES socio-economic development scenarios for the 21st century. Impacts are assessed both without and with adaptation in the form of shore and beach nourishment, based on cost-benefit analysis that includes the benefits of maintaining sandy beaches for tourism. Without nourishment, global land loss would amount to about 6000-17,000 km(2) during the 21st century, leading to 1.6-5.3 million people being forced to migrate and migration costs of US$ 300-1000 billion (not discounted). Optimal beach and shore nourishment would cost about US$ 65-220 billion (not discounted) during the 21st century and would reduce land loss by 8-14%, forced migration by 56-68% and the cost of forced migration by 77-84% (not discounted). The global share of erodible coast that is nourished increases from about 4% in 2000 to 18-33% in 2100, with beach nourishment being 3-4 times more frequent than shore nourishment, reflecting the importance of tourism benefits. In absolute terms, with or without nourishment, large counties with long shorelines appear to have the largest costs, but in relative terms, small island states appear most impacted by erosion. Considerable uncertainty remains due to the limited availability of basic coastal geomorphological data and models on a global scale. Future work should also further explore the effects of beach tourism, including considering sub-national distributions of beach tourists. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we use a conceptual model study to illustrate the built-in adaptive capability of ecosystems to reduce a wide range of wave heights, occurring at different water levels, to a narrower range. Our model shows that wave height of waves running through a forested section is independent of initial height or of water level. Although the underlying phenomenon of non-linear wave attenuation within coastal vegetation is well studied, implications of reducing variability in wave heights for design of ecosystem and levee combinations have not yet been properly outlined. Narrowing the range of wave heights by a vegetation field generates an adaptive levee that is robust to a whole range of external conditions rather than only to a maximum wave height. This feature can substantially reduce costs for retrofitting of levees under changing future wave climates. Thereby, in wave prone areas, inclusion of ecosystems into flood defense schemes constitutes an adaptive and safe alternative to only hard engineered flood risk measures.","[van Wesenbeeck, Bregje K.; de Vries, Mindert B.] Deltares, Unit Marine & Coastal Syst, POB 177, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands; [van Wesenbeeck, Bregje K.] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Hydraul Engn, POB 5048, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; [de Boer, Wiebe] Deltares, Unit Hydraul Engn, POB 177, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands; [Narayan, Siddharth] UCSB, NCEAS, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [van der Star, Wouter R.

One priority objective in the adoption of national drought policies is to promote standardized approaches to vulnerability assessment. To reach this objective, however, there is a need to address the noticeable lack of reconciliation between the two major epistemic frameworks that have been used to determine who is vulnerable and why: the so-called outcome and contextual frameworks. This study presents a novel procedure called the convergent approach to assess drought vulnerability under an integral framework. The procedure has been applied to the study of the vulnerability of water security to drought in water-use sectors in a basin located in north-central Chile. The study is justified by the role that drought plays as the major threat to water security in a context of global water crisis. The results show that the convergent approach outperforms traditional procedures such as those based on composite indicators, showing sound robustness and reaching sufficient levels of reliability and validity. The potential expansion of this approach to other applications, such as those related to global estimations of vulnerability to drought, is also discussed.","[Nunez, Jorge; Vergara, Abraham; Leyton, Camila] Univ La Serena, Dept Ingn Minas, Benavente 980, La Serena, Chile; [Nunez, Jorge; Mancilla, Gabriel] Ctr Agua Zonas Aridas & Semiaridas Amer Latina &, Benavente 980, La Serena, Chile; [Metzkes, Christine] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Hydrol & Meteorol, D-01069 Dresden, Germany; [Bettancourt, Dagoberto] Junta Vigilancia del Rio Elqui, Embalse Puclaro Ruta 41 S-N,Casilla 183, Vicuna, Chile",Universidad de La Serena; Technische Universitat Dresden,"Nunez, J (corresponding author), Univ La Serena, Dept Ingn Minas, Benavente 980, La Serena, Chile.;Nunez, J (corresponding author), Ctr Agua Zonas Aridas & Semiaridas Amer Latina &, Benavente 980, La Serena, Chile.",jhnunez@userena.cl; abraham.vergara@outlook.cl; cleyton3@alumnosuls.cl; christine.metzkes@tu-dresden.de; gmancilla@cazalac.org; dbetta@rioelqui.cl,,"Nunez Cobo, Jorge/0000-0002-3601-7803",Elqui River Water Board; Water Center for Arid and Semi-Arid Zones in Latin America; Caribbean (CAZALAC); Regional Productive Development Corporation of the Coquimbo Region; Agricultural Society of the North; Maipo Canal Society; Fondecyt-CONICYT Chile [11140343],Elqui River Water Board; Water Center for Arid and Semi-Arid Zones in Latin America; Caribbean (CAZALAC); Regional Productive Development Corporation of the Coquimbo Region; Agricultural Society of the North; Maipo Canal Society; Fondecyt-CONICYT Chile(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),"The authors acknowledge the Elqui River Water Board, the Water Center for Arid and Semi-Arid Zones in Latin America and the Caribbean (CAZALAC), the Regional Productive Development Corporation of the Coquimbo Region, the Agricultural Society of the North and the Maipo Canal Society for their support in this study.

The European Green Deal sets out a new growth strategy aimed at turning the European Union into a just and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient, and competitive economy, which will no longer generate net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Cities in this context are committed on several fronts to rapid adaptation to improve their resilience capacity. The historic centre is the most vulnerable part of a city, with a reduced capacity for adaptation, but also the densest of values, which increase the complexity of the challenge. This study proposes an integrated tool, Heuristic Planning Support System (HPSS), aimed at exploring green-blue strategies for the historic centre. The tool is integrated with classic Planning Support System (PSS), a decision process conducted from the perspective of heuristic approach and Geographic Information System (GIS). It comprises modules for technical assessment, environmental assessment Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), economic assessment Life Cycle Cost (LCC), Life Cycle Revenues (LCR), and Discounted Cash Flow Analysis (DCFA) extended to the life cycle of specific interventions, the Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT) for the assessment of energy, environmental, identity, landscape, and economic values. The development of a tool to support the ecological transition of historic centres stems from the initiative of researchers at the University of Catania, who developed it based on the preferences expressed by a group of decision makers, that is, a group of local administrators, scholars, and professionals. The proposed tool supports the exploration of green-blue strategies identified by decision makers and the development of the plan for the historic district of Borgata di Santa Lucia in Syracuse.","[Trovato, Maria Rosa] Univ Catania, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, I-95124 Catania, Italy; [Cappello, Cheren] Univ Sassari, Dept Architecture Design & Urban Planning, Piazza Duomo 6, I-07041 Sassari, Italy",University of Catania; University of Sassari,"Trovato, MR (corresponding author), Univ Catania, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, I-95124 Catania, Italy.",mrtrovato@dica.unict.it; c.cappello@studenti.uniss.it,,"Trovato, Maria Rosa/0000-0002-6220-7483",University of Catania of the Department of Civil Engineering and Architecture,University of Catania of the Department of Civil Engineering and Architecture,"This work was financed by the University of Catania in a project entitled Architettura a Rischio: Demolire, Recuperare, Restaurare.

Survey among farmers in Northeast and Northwest Switzerland According to current climate scenarios, drought could become a major challenge for agriculture in Switzerland. To better understand the practitioner's perspective, we surveyed fruit-growers in Northeast and Northwest Switzerland to investigate the previous impact of drought and the countermeasures taken, as well as the information requirements and the willingness to act on the part of farmers in case of more frequent drought events in the future. Our results show that in the last ten years, drought-induced damage has been limited for most farmers. Nevertheless, most respondents believe that in the future they will be affected more often and more intensely by drought. Thus, many are willing to implement countermeasures in the future. A detailed analysis shows that farmers who generate most of their income through fruit-growing are affected by drought differently than farmers for whom fruit-growing is of less commercial relevance. These two groups also differ in their willingness to realize countermeasures and in their information needs. We conclude that adaptation, professional training, and consultation are necessary and must adequately consider these differences.","[Kruse, Sylvia; Seidl, Irmi] Eidgenoss Forsch Sanstalt Wald Schnee & Landschaf, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland",,"Kruse, S (corresponding author), Eidgenoss Forsch Sanstalt Wald Schnee & Landschaf, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",sylvia.kruse@wsl.ch,"Kruse, Sylvia/E-7096-2014; Seidl, Irmi/B-8686-2018","Seidl, Irmi/0000-0002-7740-7875",,,,,16,0,0,0,9,AGRARFORSCHUNG,POSIEUX,"AGROSCOPE LIEBEFELD-POSIEUX, POSIEUX, CH-1725, SWITZERLAND",1663-7852,1663-7909,,AGRARFORSCH SCHWEIZ+,Agrarforschung Schweiz,FEB,2015,6,2,,,,,56,63,,,,,,8,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,CY2KX,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000366238600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the present three-years long study, spanning over two entirely different agro-ecological zones of India and Bhutan, highlights the impacts of the burning of agricultural waste in soil physio-chemical properties, biological properties and crop production. The current study also focuses on the alternative usage of crop residue to enhance soil organic carbon, soil moisture, soil nutrients and soil biological activity through the application of biochar and raw agricultural waste generated from the field. It was observed that crop residue used as raw mulch and biochar improved the agricultural production up to 36%-64% over the experimental fields of India and Bhutan. The results from the study disseminated among the local farmers and technological support were provided for practicing alternative crop residue management. Nearly 1450-1500 farmers in India and 100-125 farmers in Bhutan have adopted the agro-waste management practices of removal and re-application of agro-wastes in the field. A total of similar to 26000 t of CO2 emission has been reduced in two intervention sites during the study period.

Within this policy void, many state governments are stepping up and taking action on adaptation planning. Yet we know little about why some states adopt State Adaptation Plans (SAPs), while others do not. This article investigates factors that predict the emergence of SAPs, both in terms of policy adoption and policy intensity (goal ambitiousness). Applying the diffusion of innovation theory, I consider the relative influence of internal state characteristics, regional pressures, and test for conditional effects between government ideologies and severity of the problem. The results show interesting differences between predictors that influence policy adoption and ambitiousness. States are more motivated to adopt a policy when faced with greater climate vulnerability, have more liberal citizenry, and where governments have crossed policy hurdles by previously passing mitigation plans. The intensity of policies and goal setting, moreover, is more likely to be driven by interest group politics and diffuse through policy learning or sharing information among neighboring states in Environmental Protection Agency regions. These findings support an emerging scholarship that uses more complex dependent variables in policy analysis. These variables have the potential to differentiate symbolic from substantive policies and capture finer information about predictors of importance.","[Rai, Saatvika] Univ Toledo, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Environm Policy, 2801 W Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Toledo,"Rai, S (corresponding author), Univ Toledo, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Environm Policy, 2801 W Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USA.",saatvika.rai@utoledo.edu,,"Rai, Saatvika/0000-0001-6234-996X",NSF [1431082]; NSF IGERT C-CHANE Program,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF IGERT C-CHANE Program,"An earlier version of this article was presented at the 2016 annual meeting of the Midwest Political Science Association, Chicago, April 7-10.

The high vulnerability of these systems to droughts will be exacerbated even further under future climate change (CC) and socio-economic scenarios. A novel integrated bottom-up/top-down approach is used to identify climate resilient pathways, from which to co-design adaptation strategies to reduce the impact of potential future CC and socio-economic scenarios. The approach followed two steps (1) the generation of local CC and socio-economic scenarios by downscaling global/regional climate models and (2) the identification and assessment of potential adaptation strategies through an iterative bottom-up/top-down approach. Top-down assessments of the impact of CC have been undertaken by propagating local scenarios within a chain of mathematical models based on expert criteria/assumptions. This allowed us to analyse of the physical vulnerability of the system under different potential CC and socio-economic scenarios by simulating them with a sequential modelling of rainfall-recharge, agriculture, and hydrological processes through a distributed ground-water finite difference model. These model results were discussed with the stakeholders at a first workshop, which aimed to identify potential adaptation strategies. The influence of the adaptation strategies on the future hydrological status was assessed by simulating them through the chain of models. These results were the inputs into the discussions at a second workshop, which aimed to validate and/or improve the results of the first workshop. The methodology was applied in the Upper Guadiana River Basin, where there is a long-standing conflict between wetland conservation and groundwater overexploitation for intensive agriculture. The future horizon 2016-2045 is analysed with the scenarios compatible with the emission scenario RCP4.5. The research has allowed us to conclude that groundwater pumping reduction would be the most robust and effective measure to reduce the impact of CC in the area.","[Pulido-Velazquez, David; Baena-Ruiz, Leticia] CSIC, Spanish Geol Survey IGME, Urb Alcazar del Genil,4 Edificio Zulema, Granada 18006, Spain; [Mayor, Beatriz; Zorrilla-Miras, Pedro; Lopez-Gunn, Elena] ICATALIST, C Borni 20, Madrid, Spain; [de Dios Gomez-Gomez, Juan] CSIC, Spanish Geol Survey IGME, C La Calera 1, Tres Cantos 28760, Madrid, Spain; [de la Hera-Portillo, Africa; Mejias Moreno, Miguel] CSIC, Spanish Geol Survey IGME, Rio Rosas 23, Madrid 28003, Spain; [Collados-Lara, Antonio-Juan] Univ Granada, Water Inst, Dept Civil Engn, Ramon & Cajal,4, Granada 18003, Spain; [Garcia Arostegui, Jose Luis] CSIC, Spanish Geol Survey IGME, Ave Miguel Cervantes 45,5 A, Murcia 30009, Spain; [Garcia Arostegui, Jose Luis] Univ Murcia, Inst Univ Agua & Medio Ambiente, Campus de Espinardo, Murcia 30010, Spain; [Alcala, Francisco J.] Estn Expt Zonas Aridas EEZA CSIC, Dept Desertificac & Geoecol, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Alcala, Francisco J.] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Ingn, Inst Ciencias Quim Aplicadas, Santiago 7500138, Chile",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); University of Granada; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); University of Murcia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Experimental de Zonas Aridas (EEZA); University of Valencia; Universidad Autonoma de Chile,"Baena-Ruiz, L (corresponding author), CSIC, Spanish Geol Survey IGME, Urb Alcazar del Genil,4 Edificio Zulema, Granada 18006, Spain.",d.pulido@igme.es; l.baena@igme.es; pedro.zorrilla.miras@greenpeace.org; elopezgunn@icatalist.eu; elopezgunn@icatalist.eu; j.dedios@igme.es; a.delahera@igme.es; ajcollados@ugr.es; m.mejias@igme.es; j.arostegui@igme.es; fjalcala@eeza.csic.es,"Alcala, Francisco/C-4533-2013","Alcala, Francisco/0000-0002-8165-8669","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [RTI2018-101397-B-I00, PID2021-128021OB-I00]; European Union [GeoE.171.008-TACTIC]; NextGenerationEU Fund through the programme Fondos de Recuperacion","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities(Spanish Government); European Union(European Commission); NextGenerationEU Fund through the programme Fondos de Recuperacion","This research was partially supported by the research projects SIGLO-AN (RTI2018-101397-B-I00) and SIGLO-PRO (PID2021-128021OB-I00) from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (Programa Estatal de ICDCI orientado a los Retos de la Sociedad) , the GeoE.171.008-TACTIC Project funded by European Union's Horizon 2020-Research and Innovation Framework Programme, and the NextGenerationEU Fund through the programme Fondos de Recuperacion.",,106,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

The region is a biodiversity hotspot affected by more billion-dollar disasters than any other region in the country. Assessing the impacts of climate change in southeastern United States is important and often requires knowledge of plausible future climate change (e.g. scenarios of temperature and precipitation change). Although several methods are available in literature to develop plausible scenarios of the changes, there exists a usability gap [gap between what scientists understand as useful information and what users recognize as usable]. A novel conceptual framework that represents the plausible future climate change scenarios in southeastern United States was developed using information from meta-analysis and outputs from similar to 19 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) Global Climate Models (GCMs) [data analysis] in the form of scenario funnels (represent the plausible trajectories of changes in climate). The systematic literature review provided 33 values of precipitation changes from 15 studies and 35 for temperature changes from 14 studies. In general, the meta-analysis revealed, the precipitation changes observed ranged from -30 to + 35% and temperature changes between - 2 degrees C to 6 degrees C by 2099. Fiftieth percentile of the GCMs predicts no precipitation change and an increase of 2.5 degrees C temperature in the region by 2099. Among the GCMs, 5th and 95th percentile of precipitation changes range between - 40% to 110% and temperature changes between - 2 degrees C to 6 degrees C by 2099. Finally, the usability of scenario information to stakeholders in various southeastern United States ecosystems and guidelines for developing causal chains and feedback loops with three levels of complexity were provided. They include utilizing the information from impact assessment studies, stakeholder's expertise and requirement as well as understanding the potential impacts in ecosystems (e.g. agroecosystems, coastal, wetland) by relating the structural components of an ecosystem, their interactions with each other, within and across ecosystems for improved management and sustainable use of their resources. These would improve understanding of ecosystem functioning for better management and sustainable use of resources. Although the methodology was demonstrated for southeastern United States, it could also be applicable to other regions of the world. However, the scenario funnels, potential impacts on ecosystems and causal chain/loops are subjective to the study region, availability of literature, the changes observed in the literature and data analyzed, the characteristics of the study region, the stakeholder and their requirement.","[Anandhi, Aavudai] Florida A&M Univ, Biol Syst Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32307 USA; [Bendey, Chance] Florida A&M Univ, Coll Agr & Food Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32307 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida A&M University; State University System of Florida; Florida A&M University,"Anandhi, A (corresponding author), Florida A&M Univ, Biol Syst Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32307 USA.",anandhi@famu.edu; chance.bentley@famu.edu,,"Anandhi, Aavudai/0000-0002-5323-1983",National Science Foundation as part of the National Science Foundation Research Traineeship [1735235]; USDA-NIFA [2017-38821-26405]; USDA-NIFA Evans-Allen Project [11979180/2016-01711]; USDA-NIFA grant [2018-68002-27920]; Department of Energy Minority Serving Institution Partnership Program (MSIPP) [DE-AC09-08SR22470],National Science Foundation as part of the National Science Foundation Research Traineeship; USDA-NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); USDA-NIFA Evans-Allen Project; USDA-NIFA grant; Department of Energy Minority Serving Institution Partnership Program (MSIPP),"This material is based upon work partially supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1735235 awarded as part of the National Science Foundation Research Traineeship, USDA-NIFA capacity building grant 2017-38821-26405, USDA-NIFA Evans-Allen Project, Grant 11979180/2016-01711, USDA-NIFA grant No. 2018-68002-27920 and Department of Energy Minority Serving Institution Partnership Program (MSIPP) managed by the Savannah River National Laboratory under SRNS contract DE-AC09-08SR22470.

Given the diversity and complexity of ecological responses to climate change ecosystem management approaches are needed to provide solutions for meeting both ecological and human needs, while reducing anthropogenic warming and climate-related impacts on society. For instance, ecosystem management can contribute to a reduction in the greenhouse gas emissions through improved land-use and reduced deforestation at a regional scale. Further, conserving and restoring naturally-functioning ecosystems, which is often one of the goals of ecosystem management can significantly contribute to buffering ecological responses to climate extremes such as droughts and wildfires. Moreover, ecosystem management helps build capacity for learning and adaptation at multiple scales. As a result, societies will be better prepared to respond to surprises and uncertainties associated with climate change. In this regard, it is imperative to reframe climate change issues based on the ecosystem approach. Although climate change and ecosystem management plans have largely developed independently, it is now essential for all stakeholders to work together to achieve multiple goals. The ecosystem-based approaches can enable flexible and effective responses to the uncertainties associated with climate change. Reframing ecosystem management helps to face an urgent need for reconsideration and improvement of social-ecological resilience in order to mitigate and adapt to the changing climate.

A critical limitation of most existing sediment transport models is that they assume that the transport characteristics of fine sediment can be described using the same approaches that are used for coarse-grained non-cohesive sediment, thereby ignoring the tendency of fine sediment to flocculate. Here, a modelling framework to simulate flow and fine sediment transport in the Crowsnest River, the Castle River, the Oldman River and the Oldman Reservoir after the 2003 Lost Creek wildfire in Alberta, Canada was developed and validated. It is the first to include explicit description of fine sediment deposition/erosion processes as a function of bed shear stress and the flocculation process. This framework integrates four existing numerical models: MOBED, RIVFLOC, RMA2 and RMA4 using river geometry, flow, fine suspended sediment characteristics and bathymetry data. Sediment concentration and particle size distributions computed by RIVFLOC were used as the upstream boundary condition for the reservoir dispersion model RMA4. The predicted particle size distributions and mass of fine river sediment deposited within various sections of the reservoir indicate that most of the fine sediment generated by the upstream disturbance deposits in the reservoir. Deposition patterns of sediment from wildfire-impacted landscapes were different than those from unburned landscapes because of differences in settling behaviour. These differences may lead to zones of relatively increased internal loading of phosphorus to reservoir water columns, thereby increasing the potential for algae proliferation. In light of the growing threats to water resources globally from wildfire, the generic framework described herein can be used to model propagation of fine river sediment and associated nutrients or contaminants to reservoirs under different flow conditions and land use scenarios. The framework is thereby a valuable tool to support decision making for water resources management and catchment planning.","[Stone, Micheal] Univ Waterloo, Environm Studies, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Krishnappan, Bommanna G.] Environm Canada, Burlington, ON L7R 4A6, Canada; [Silins, Uldis; Williams, Chris H.

When broilers fed the complete diet for 1 to 5 wk (T2, T3, T4) were changed to choice feeding, on the Ist d, their feed choice intake was similar to that of T1 chicks at the same age. Visual observation and tactile assessment of the feed particles during the initial period allowed the chicks to quickly evaluate the new feeds and to adapt their feeding behavior.

Urban planning must account for the diverse and changing interactions among the social, ecological, and technological systems (SETS) of a city. Cities struggle with long-range approaches to explore, anticipate, and plan for sustainability and resilience-and scenario development is one way to address this need. In this paper, we present the framework for developing what we call 'strategic' scenarios, which are scenarios or future visions created from governance documents expressing unrealized municipal priorities and goals. While scenario approaches vary based on diverse planning and decision-making objectives, only some offer tangible, systemic representations of existing plans and goals for the future that can be explored as an assessment and planning tool for sustainability and resilience. Indeed, the strategic scenarios approach presented here (1) emphasizes multi-sectoral and interdisciplinary interventions; (2) identifies systemic conflicts, tradeoffs, and synergies among existing planning goals; and (3) incorporates as yet unrealized goals and strategies representative of urban short-term planning initiatives. We present an example strategic scenario for the Central Arizona-Phoenix metropolitan region, and discuss the utility of the strategic scenario in long-term thinking for future sustainability and resilience in urban research and practice. This approach brings together diverse-sometimes competing-strategies and offers the opportunity to explore outcomes by comparing and contrasting their implications and tradeoffs, and evaluating the resulting strategic scenario against scenarios developed through alternative, participatory approaches.","[Iwaniec, David M.] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Urban Studies Inst, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Cook, Elizabeth M.] Barnard Coll, Environm Sci Dept, New York, NY USA; [Davidson, Melissa J.; Berbes-Blazquez, Marta; Grimm, Nancy B.] Arizona State Univ, Julie Ann Wrigley Global Inst Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Davidson, Melissa J.; Berbes-Blazquez, Marta; Grimm, Nancy B.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Berbes-Blazquez, Marta] Arizona State Univ, Sch Future Innovat Soc, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Grimm, Nancy B.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Box 874501, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Grimm, NB (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Box 874501, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",diwaniec@gsu.edu; ecook@barnard.edu; melissa.j.davidson@asu.edu; mberbes@asu.edu; nbgrimm@asu.edu,"Iwaniec, David M./M-7993-2014; Grimm, Nancy/D-2840-2009","Iwaniec, David M./0000-0002-0410-4152; Grimm, Nancy/0000-0001-9374-660X; Berbes-Blazquez, Marta/0000-0002-2685-873X","United States National Science Foundation [1637590, 1444755, 1934933]; Chilean CONICYT-FONDECYT (Science, Technology, Knowledge and Innovation Ministry of Chile) [3150290]","United States National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Chilean CONICYT-FONDECYT (Science, Technology, Knowledge and Innovation Ministry of Chile)","This research was funded by United States National Science Foundation grant numbers 1637590 (Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research Program), 1444755 (Urban Resilience to Extremes Sustainability Research Network), and 1934933 (SETS Convergence) and Chilean CONICYT-FONDECYT grant number 3150290 (Science, Technology, Knowledge and Innovation Ministry of Chile).

They allow hot-spots to be identified, and serve as input for the prioritization and design of adaptation actions. Over recent years, at the level of international climate science and policy, there has been a shift in the conceptualization of vulnerability toward emergence of 'climate risk' as a central concept. Despite this shift, few studies have operationalized these latest concepts to deliver assessment results at local, national, or regional scales, and clarity is lacking. Drawing from a pilot study conducted in the Indian Himalayas we demonstrate how core components of hazard, vulnerability, and exposure have been integrated to assess flood risk at two different scales, and critically discuss how these results have fed into adaptation planning. Firstly, within a state-wide assessment of glacial lake outburst flood risk, proxy indicators of exposure and vulnerability were combined with worst-case scenario modelling of the outburst hazard. At this scale, first-order assessment results are coarse, but have guided the design of monitoring strategies and other low-regret adaptation actions. Secondly, an assessment of seasonal monsoon and cloudburst-related flood risk was undertaken for individual mapped elements exposed along the main river valleys of Kullu district, drawing on innovative techniques using dendrogeomorphology to reconstruct potential flood magnitudes. Results at this scale have allowed specific adaptation strategies to be targeted towards hot-spots of risk. A comprehensive risk assessment must integrate across disciplines of physical and social science, to provide the necessary robust foundation for adaptation planning.","[Allen, S.

A systematic analysis of potential impacts related to multi-seasonal dry spells, effective adaptation measures, and the economic value of climate information (VoI) may inform decision-making and facilitate the uptake and use of climate information. Hence, we have developed an integrated modeling framework consisting of a statistical climate model, a crop rotation model, a bio-physical process model, a portfolio optimization model, the computation of the economic value of climate information, and a spatial hot spot analysis and applied it to the context of water stress management in crop production in Austria. Results from the integrated modeling framework show that the average economic value of climate information ranges between 13 and 99 (sic)/ha for Austrian cropland, depending on the scenario of multi-seasonal dry spells and the farmers' risk aversion level. On average, the value of climate information is highest on flat and productive soils, for root and oil crops, under more extreme multi-seasonal dry spells, and if farmers are highly risk averse. Quantifying the value of climate information may guide data provision efforts and highlight agricultural production regions, which would particularly benefit from such information to improve water stress management.","[Mitter, Hemline; Schmid, Erwin] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Inst Sustainable Econ Dev, Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Mitter, H (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Inst Sustainable Econ Dev, Vienna, Austria.",hermine.mitter@boku.ac.at,"Schmid, Erwin/Z-1946-2019","Schmid, Erwin/0000-0003-4783-9666; Mitter, Hermine/0000-0003-0799-9489",project: COMBIRISK - Combined weather related risk assessment monitor for tailoring climate change adaptation in Austrian crop production - Austrian Climate and Energy Fund within the Austrian Climate Research Programme [KR15AC8K12614]; project: UncertProp - Uncertainty propagation in integrated modelling approaches for global change impacts on the bio-economy - Austrian Climate and Energy Fund within the Austrian Climate Research Programme [KR16AC0K13332],project: COMBIRISK - Combined weather related risk assessment monitor for tailoring climate change adaptation in Austrian crop production - Austrian Climate and Energy Fund within the Austrian Climate Research Programme; project: UncertProp - Uncertainty propagation in integrated modelling approaches for global change impacts on the bio-economy - Austrian Climate and Energy Fund within the Austrian Climate Research Programme,"Research to this article has been supported by two research projects: (1) COMBIRISK - Combined weather related risk assessment monitor for tailoring climate change adaptation in Austrian crop production (Grant-ID: KR15AC8K12614), and (2) UncertProp - Uncertainty propagation in integrated modelling approaches for global change impacts on the bio-economy (Grant-ID: KR16AC0K13332).

As part of a growing research stream on the effectiveness of these systems, this article presents the results of a study on the impacts of an automated phone warning and advising system for individuals vulnerable to air pollution. A sample of 1328 individuals were recruited and randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. The treatment group received smog warning while the control group did not. Data were collected via three phone surveys, two before and one after issuing the smog warning. The comparison between treatment and control groups indicates that exposure to a smog warning improved information on the occurrence of smog episodes (n = 484, OR = 5.58, p = 0.00), and knowledge on protective behaviors. Furthermore, members of treatment group were more likely to avoid exposure to smog episodes by spending more time inside with the windows closed than usual (n = 474, OR = 2.03, p = 0.00). Members of treatment group who take medication in the form of aerosol pumps also kept these devices on themselves more frequently than those of control group (n= 109, OR = 2.15, p = 0.03). The system however had no discernible effects on the awareness of air pollution risks, reduction of health symptoms related to smog and the use of health system services. The absence of health benefits could be related to the lower actual exposure to air pollution of such vulnerable groups during winter.","[Mehiriz, Kaddour] Doha Inst Grad Studies, Sch Publ Adm & Dev Econ, POB 200592,Zone 70,Al Tarfa St Al Daayen, Doha, Qatar; [Gosselin, Pierre] Inst Natl Sante Publ & Ouranos, 945 Ave Wolfe, Quebec City, PQ G1V 5B3, Canada",Doha Institute for Graduate Studies,"Mehiriz, K (corresponding author), Doha Inst Grad Studies, Sch Publ Adm & Dev Econ, POB 200592,Zone 70,Al Tarfa St Al Daayen, Doha, Qatar.",Kaddour.mehiriz@dohainstitute.edu.qa; Pierre.gosselin@inspq.qc.ca,,,"Quebec Government's Fonds Vert, under the health component of 2013-2020 Climate Change Action Plan; Health Canada","Quebec Government's Fonds Vert, under the health component of 2013-2020 Climate Change Action Plan; Health Canada","This project was funded by the Quebec Government's Fonds Vert, under the health component of 2013-2020 Climate Change Action Plan, and by Health Canada.",,22,5,5,0,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1661-7827,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Despite considerable effort by both national and international agricultural organizations to promote CSAPs in India, adoption of these practices is low. This study aims to examine the elements that affect the likelihood and intensity of adoption of multiple CSAPs in Bihar, India. Design/methodology/approach The probability and intensity of adoption of CSAPs are analyzed using multivariate and ordered probit models, respectively. Findings The results show significant correlations between multiple CSAPs, indicating that their adoptions are interrelated, providing opportunities to exploit the complementarities. The results confirm that both the probability and intensity of adoption of CSAPs are affected by numerous factors, such as demographic characteristics, farm plot features, access to market, socio-economics, climate risks, access to extension services and training. Farmers who perceive high temperature as the major climate risk factor are more likely to adopt crop diversification and minimum tillage. Farmers are less likely to adopt site-specific nutrient management if faced with short winters; however, they are more likely to adopt minimum tillage in this case. Training on agricultural issues is found to have a positive impact on the likelihood and the intensity of CSAPs adoption. Practical implications The major policy recommendations coming from of our results are to strengthen local institutions (public extension services, etc.) and to provide more training on CSAPs. Originality/value By applying multivariate and ordered probit models, this paper provides some insights on the long-standing discussions on whether farmers adopt CSAPs in a piecemeal or in a composite way.","[Aryal, Jeetendra Prakash; Rahut, Dil Bahadur] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Socioecon Program, El Batan, Mexico; [Jat, M.

Natural foreshores can keep pace with sea-level rise by accumulating sediment and attenuate waves before reaching the adjacent flood defences. In this study we address how natural foreshores affect the future need for dike heightening. A simplified model of vertical marsh accretion was combined with a wave model and a probabilistic evaluation of dike failure by overtopping. The sensitivity of a marsh-dike system was evaluated in relation to a combination of processes: (1) sea-level rise, (2) changes in sediment concentration, (3) a retreat of the marsh edge, and (4) compaction of the marsh. Results indicate that foreshore processes considerably affect the need for dike heightening in the future. At a low sea-level rise rate, the marshes can accrete such that dike heightening is partially mitigated. But with sea-level rise accelerating, a threshold is reached where dike heightening needs to compensate for the loss of marshes, and for increasing water levels. The level of the threshold depends mostly on the delivery of sediment and degree of compaction on the marsh; with sufficient width of the marsh, lateral erosion only has a minor effect. The study shows how processes and practices that hamper or enhance marsh development today exacerbate or alleviate the challenge of flood protection posed by accelerated sea-level rise.","[Marijnissen, Richard; Kroeze, Carolien; van Loon-Steensma, Jantsje] Wageningen Univ & Res, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kok, Matthijs; van Loon-Steensma, Jantsje] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, POB 5048, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; [Kok, Matthijs] HKV Consultants, Botter 11 29, NL-8232 JN Lelystad, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Delft University of Technology,"Marijnissen, R (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",richard.marijnissen@wur.nl; Matthijs.Kok@tudelft.nl; carolien.kroeze@wur.nl; jantsje.vanloon@wur.nl,,"Marijnissen, Richard Johannes Cornelis/0000-0002-9840-450X; van Loon-Steensma, Jantsje M./0000-0002-6181-7829",NWO Domain Applied and Engineering Sciences [P15-21],NWO Domain Applied and Engineering Sciences,"This work is part of the Perspectief research programme All-Risk with project number P15-21, which is financed by NWO Domain Applied and Engineering Sciences.",,82,2,2,2,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1312,,J MAR SCI ENG,J.

Based on a random sample survey of 278 households, three focus-group discussions and seven key-informant interviews, the article investigates the nature and extent of corruption in pre- and post-disaster interventions in Khulna before and after Cyclone Aila in May 2009. Ninety nine percent of households reported losses from corrupt practices. Post-disaster interventions (such as food aid and public works schemes) suffered from greater levels, and worse types, of corruption than pre-disaster interventions (such as cyclone warning systems and disaster-preparedness training). Using an asset index created using principal component analysis, the article assesses how corruption affected wealth quartiles. Ultra-poor households were affected more by corruption in pre-disaster interventions, the wealthiest quartile more in certain post-disaster interventions, in particular public works and non-governmental interventions. These findings may hold lessons for attempts to increase resilience as current adaptation measures mirror some cyclone preparedness and relief efforts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

For centuries, milpa farming has been sustainable for subsistence; however, in the last 50 years, milpas have become less reliable due to accelerating climate change, resource degradation, declining markets, poverty, and other factors. Increasing climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices may be needed. Using interviews with extension leaders and milpa farmers in Belize, this qualitative study examines the capacity for increasing CSA aspects of existing traditional milpa practices, specifically no-burn mulching, soil enrichment, and the use of cover plants. Applying a modified Community Capitals Framework, this study finds four key capitals were perceived by farmers and agriculture extension leaders as barriers for increasing CSA practices. Recommendations to reduce the key barriers include reinstating markets and crop-buying programs and easing border customs restrictions (Governance-Justice and Financial Capitals), improving roads and cellular access for farmers (Infrastructure Capital), and increasing budgets and resources for agriculture extension services and building farmer capacity for CSA practices of mulching, soil enrichment, and cover plants (Human-Capacity Capital). Reducing barriers to these key capitals can facilitate an increase in milpa CSA practices and crop productivity, promote food and livelihood security, and enable climate resilience of Mayan milpa communities in Belize.","[Drexler, Kristin] Amer Publ Univ Syst, Sch Sci Technol & Engn & Math, Dept Space Studies & Earth Sci, Charles Town, WV 25414 USA",American Public University System,"Drexler, K (corresponding author), Amer Publ Univ Syst, Sch Sci Technol & Engn & Math, Dept Space Studies & Earth Sci, Charles Town, WV 25414 USA.",kristin.drexler@mycampus.apus.edu,,,,,,,83,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,NOV,2022,10,11,,,,,,,176,10.3390/cli10110176,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli10110176,,,16,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,6U6GB,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000894461800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is often unclear why cities would adopt such policies, however, given that the benefits from climate mitigation will be felt globally, rather than exclusively locally. Studies have identified a rationale for urban mitigation and energy policies rooted in local co-benefits, such as improvements in local environmental quality or job creation. Here we explore the possibility of financial co-benefits: whether municipal climate policies lead to an enhanced creditworthiness. This would translate into reduced borrowing costs for other infrastructure projects. Interviewing key informants from cities, investment firms and rating agencies, we find that rating agencies do consider climate policies in their ratings. This clearly applies to those climate policies that can result in demonstrable net economic gains to the municipality. However even those mitigation and energy policies that come at net costs to cities can have positive impacts on rating assessments, either because the policies are seen as reducing regulatory risks, or because they send positive signals to those investors having global sustainability agendas. Interestingly, those least aware of these factors appear to be city leaders themselves. This suggests a need to make them aware of how rating agencies and investors positively view climate mitigation policies.","[Rashidi, Kaveh; Patt, Anthony] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Rashidi, Kaveh] Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Environm Change Inst, South Pk Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Stadelmann, Martin] South Pole Carbon Asset Management Ltd, Technopk Str 1, CH-8005 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Oxford,"Rashidi, K (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",kaveh.rashidi@usys.ethz.ch,,,Climate-KIC; European Research Council [313553],Climate-KIC; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),"This research received funding from Climate-KIC and the European Research Council, grant number 313553.

Second, the expected land suitability reduction during the 21st century will be driven primarily by catchment-level irrigation potential deficits even over the declining farm-level biophysical conditions.

In such nations the establishment of strong property rights regimes is considered to be one of the main factors attributing to the advancement of western nations during the last two centuries. Such rights feature attributes including exclusivity, transferability and enforceability for rights-holders. The design of these packages of rights are tied to specific types of assets or land and sea uses. Therefore, as uses change, the specifics of the package of rights often change in response. The activity of coral reef restoration is expanding rapidly in response to the continued loss of coral cover, health and condition of the world's coral reefs. Therefore by definition, as this activity increases globally the management regimes used to govern coral reefs will in many cases need to adapt to this increasing activity. It is therefore expected that increasing calls to strengthen rights-regimes will begin to occur as many reef restoration activities, despite mostly occurring in low-income nations, are led from or by entities from high-income and mostly western nations who are accustomed to strong rights-based management. However, management approaches in many low-income nations that host coral reefs are often based on more customary and traditional management in-struments. Therefore, communities hosting increased reef restoration activities need to consider very carefully how best to manage these activities as they increase in order to avoid unwanted and unintended consequences of the imposition of governance and management instruments widely used in the western world.","[Gibbs, Mark T.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Newlands, Maxine] James Cook Univ, Coll Arts, Sch Social Sci, Soc Educ, Douglas, Qld, Australia",Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University,"Gibbs, MT (corresponding author), Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia.",m.gibbs@aims.gov.au,,,Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program - Great Barrier Reef Foundation,Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program - Great Barrier Reef Foundation,"Both authors are funded by the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program, funded by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation.",,22,1,1,2,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

In order to reduce climate risk destination wide, this paper first enhances the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change risk framework by extending it with destination specific features. This extended framework was drawn upon to develop a system model for Vanuatu, called the Vanuatu Tourism Adaptation System, using a qualitative multi-phase research design. The system highlights economic, socio-cultural, political, and environmental variables, how they are interlinked and thereby influence climate risk to destinations in Vanuatu. It provides a novel tool for understanding climate risk reduction within destinations as a holistic system and based on this understanding, destination trade-offs and policy recommendations are discussed. It can thus aid tourism and climate change decision makers in identifying and testing adaptation measures that benefit not only tourism but the destination more broadly, including the local community and ecosystem health. This study fills a gap in the academic literature by enhancing the systemic understanding of climate risk in small island developing states destinations and contributes to our understanding of tourism as a climate-resilient development pathway.","[Loehr, Johanna] Griffith Univ, Dept Tourism Sport & Hotel Management, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia; [Loehr, Johanna] Griffith Univ, Griffith Inst Tourism, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University,"Loehr, J (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Dept Tourism Sport & Hotel Management, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia.;Loehr, J (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Inst Tourism, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia.",johanna.loehr@griffithuni.edu.au,"Loehr, Johanna/AAL-2129-2021","Loehr, Johanna/0000-0001-7361-0086",,,,,81,19,20,4,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-9582,1747-7646,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

Programs of monitoring and evaluation must therefore compare restoration progress and effectiveness relative to untreated conditions and to target conditions, particularly with respect to the attributes and functions essential to land use objectives. It is usually not feasible to directly monitor all important forest attributes and functions, so a few indicators must be selected. It is argued that natural recovery (or passive restoration) should always be considered a management option, and that the most appropriate evaluation of restoration techniques is by comparison with untreated areas that have been left for the same period of time as treated areas. Unambiguous evaluation therefore requires all restoration projects to be considered as formal experiments with proper controls, replicates, and the randomized application of treatment options. Adaptation to anticipated levels of climate change can be incorporated by emulating forest compositions and structures currently prevailing elsewhere under analogues of future climates and associated disturbance regimes. A structured program of monitoring and evaluation within a framework of adaptive management will engender management flexibility and resilience in an uncertain future.","[Burton, Philip J.] Univ No British Columbia, Terrace, BC, Canada",University of Northern British Columbia,"Burton, PJ (corresponding author), Univ No British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management, 4837 Keith Ave, Terrace, BC V8G 1K7, Canada.",phil.burton@unbc.ca,"Burton, Philip J./X-5808-2019","Burton, Philip J./0000-0002-5956-2716",,,,,29,14,15,1,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1054-9811,1540-756X,,J SUSTAIN FOREST,J.

However, we currently know little about whether the improved predictions will actually lead to better conservation outcomes once the costs of gaining improved models or data are accounted for. This severely limits our ability to make strategic decisions for adaptation to global pressures, particularly in landscapes subject to dynamic change such as the coastal zone. In such landscapes, the global phenomenon of sea level rise is a critical consideration for preserving biodiversity. Here, we address this issue in the context of making decisions about where to locate a reserve system to preserve coastal biodiversity with a limited budget. Specifically, we determined the cost-effectiveness of investing in high-resolution elevation data and process-based models for predicting wetland shifts in a coastal region of South East Queensland, Australia. We evaluated the resulting priority areas for reserve selection to quantify the cost-effectiveness of investment in better quantifying biological and physical processes. We show that, in this case, it is considerably more cost effective to use a process-based model and high-resolution elevation data, even if this requires a substantial proportion of the project budget to be expended (up to 99% in one instance). The less accurate model and data set failed to identify areas of high conservation value, reducing the cost-effectiveness of the resultant conservation plan. This suggests that when developing conservation plans in areas where sea level rise threatens biodiversity, investing in high-resolution elevation data and process-based models to predict shifts in coastal ecosystems may be highly cost effective. A future research priority is to determine how this cost-effectiveness varies among different regions across the globe.","[Runting, Rebecca K.; Wilson, Kerrie A.; Rhodes, Jonathan R.] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Runting, Rebecca K.; Rhodes, Jonathan R.] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Runting, Rebecca K.; Wilson, Kerrie A.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Runting, RK (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",r.runting@uq.edu.au,"Runting, Rebecca/I-1470-2013; Wilson, Kerrie A/C-8058-2009; Wilson, Kerrie/W-4181-2019; Rhodes, Jonathan/C-4841-2008","Runting, Rebecca/0000-0003-0614-1456; Wilson, Kerrie A/0000-0002-0092-935X; Wilson, Kerrie/0000-0002-0092-935X; Rhodes, Jonathan/0000-0001-6746-7412",,,,,86,50,51,2,109,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Here, we introduce the CROSSLINK project that investigates the role of forested riparian buffers in modified European landscapes by measuring a wide range of ecosystem attributes in stream-riparian networks. CROSSLINK involves replicated field measurements in four case-study basins with varying levels of human development: Norway (Oslo Fjord), Sweden (Lake Malaren), Belgium (Zwalm River), and Romania (Arge River). Nested within these case-study basins include multiple, independent stream-site pairs with a forested riparian buffer and unbuffered section located upstream, as well as headwater and downstream sites to show cumulative land-use impacts. CROSSLINK applies existing and bespoke methods to describe habitat conditions, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning in aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Here, we summarize the approaches used, detail protocols in supplementary materials, and explain how data is applied in an optimization framework to better manage tradeoffs in multifunctional landscapes. We then present results demonstrating the range of riparian conditions present in our case-study basins and how these environmental states influence stream ecological integrity with the commonly used macroinvertebrate Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) index. We demonstrate that a qualitative index of riparian integrity can be positively associated with stream ecological status. This introduction to the CROSSLINK project shows the potential for our replicated study with its panoply of ecosystem attributes to help guide management decisions regarding the use of forested riparian buffers in human-impacted landscapes. This knowledge is highly relevant in a time of rapid environmental change where freshwater biodiversity is increasingly under pressure from a range of human impacts that include habitat loss, pollution, and climate change.","[Burdon, Francis J.; Ramberg, Ellinor; Sargac, Jasmina; Grandin, Ulf; Johnson, Richard K.; McKie, Brendan G.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Sci & Assessment, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Forio, Marie Anne Eurie; de Saeyer, Nancy; Goethals, Peter] Univ Ghent, Dept Anim Sci & Aquat Ecol, Aquat Ecol Res Unit, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Mutinova, Petra Thea; Moe, Therese Fosholt; Kupilas, Benjamin; Friberg, Nikolai] Norwegian Inst Water Res NIVA, N-0349 Oslo, Norway; [Mutinova, Petra Thea] Univ Rostock, Inst Biol Sci, D-18059 Rostock, Germany; [Pavelescu, Mihaela Oprina; Dinu, Valentin; Cazacu, Constantin; Risnoveanu, Geta] Univ Bucharest, Dept Syst Ecol & Sustainabil, Bucharest 050095, Romania; [Witing, Felix; Volk, Martin] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Kupilas, Benjamin] Univ Munster, Inst Landscape Ecol, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Risnoveanu, Geta] Univ Bucharest, Res Inst, Bucharest 050663, Romania; [Friberg, Nikolai] Univ Copenhagen, Freshwater Biol Sect, Dept Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Friberg, Nikolai] Univ Leeds, Water Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Friberg, Nikolai] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Ghent University; Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA); University of Rostock; University of Bucharest; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); University of Munster; University of Bucharest; University of Copenhagen; University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Burdon, FJ (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Sci & Assessment, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",francis.burdon@slu.se; ellinor.karin.ramberg@slu.se; jasmina.sargac@slu.se; marie.forio@ugent.be; Nancy.DeSaeyer@UGent.be; petra.Mutinova@niva.no; therese.fosholt.moe@niva.no; mihaela.oprina@g.unibuc.ro; valentindinu23@yahoo.com; constantin.cazacu@g.unibuc.ro; felix.witing@ufz.de; benjamin.kupilas@niva.no; ulf.grandin@slu.se; martin.volk@ufz.de; geta.risnoveanu@g.unibuc.ro; Peter.Goethals@UGent.be; Nikolai.Friberg@niva.no; Richard.Johnson@slu.se; Brendan.Mckie@slu.se,"Dinu, Valentin/ABD-9154-2020; Cazacu, Constantin/AAD-7419-2019; Risnoveanu, Geta/Q-3790-2019; Volk, Martin/F-1172-2010; Goethals, Peter LM/A-1116-2008; Burdon, Francis/ABC-2827-2020; Moe, Therese Fosholt/AAX-6404-2020; Grandin, Ulf/HKO-5291-2023; Johnson, Richard/P-4991-2014","Cazacu, Constantin/0000-0003-4521-7185; Risnoveanu, Geta/0000-0002-5194-5448; Volk, Martin/0000-0003-0064-8133; Burdon, Francis/0000-0002-5398-4993; Moe, Therese Fosholt/0000-0002-1004-5961; Grandin, Ulf/0000-0003-0320-0692; McKie, Brendan/0000-0002-1796-9497; Forio, Marie Anne Eurie/0000-0001-6675-4751; Mutinova, Petra Thea/0000-0003-1040-1564; Sargac, Jasmina/0000-0001-7006-8092; Kupilas, Benjamin/0000-0002-4211-1679; Johnson, Richard/0000-0001-7979-6563; Witing, Felix/0000-0002-7314-4908","CROSSLINK project through the 2015-2016 BiodivERsA COFUND call for research proposals; Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development (FORMAS) [2016-01945]; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Research Council of Norway (NFR) [264499]; Research Foundation of Flanders (FWO), Belgium [G0H6516N]; Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation (CCCDI-UEFISCDI within PNCDI III) [BiodivERsA3-2015-49-CROSSLINK]; Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Germany [FKZ: 01LC1621A]","CROSSLINK project through the 2015-2016 BiodivERsA COFUND call for research proposals; Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development (FORMAS)(Swedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Research Council of Norway (NFR)(Research Council of Norway); Research Foundation of Flanders (FWO), Belgium(FWO); Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation (CCCDI-UEFISCDI within PNCDI III)(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI)); Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Germany(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","This research was conducted as part of the CROSSLINK project funded through the 2015-2016 BiodivERsA COFUND call for research proposals.

Climate change affects ecosystem services and interactions between biotic and abiotic factors. The most drastic consequences have been observed in the agricultural and livestock sector, with diminished production and productivity potential. Agriculture and allied sectors contribute markedly to the production of greenhouse gases; however, integrated management practices can be used to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and its adverse impacts. Forage crops and their wild relatives maintain biodiversity and ecosystem services and minimise the drastic effects of climate change. Forage crops adapted to harsh environments have certain unique features such as perenniality, deep root system, high resource-use efficiency (light, nutrients and water), and low production of methane and N2O, making them suitable for future use under climate change. This review highlights the prominent features of various cultivated and rangeland forage crops that may be crucial to understanding impacts of climate change. We discuss the wild relatives of forage crops, which are often adapted for multiple stresses, and highlight their mechanisms for adaptation under climate change. We consider the advanced breeding and biotechnological tools useful for developing climate-smart forage crops. This review provides novel insight into forage crops and their wild relatives in terms of their exploitation in future stress breeding programmes and paths for developing climate-resilient crops.","[Indu, I.; Mehta, Brijesh Kumar; Shashikumara, P.; Gupta, Gaurendra; Dikshit, Nilamani; Chand, Subhash; Yadav, Praveen Kumar; Ahmed, Shahid; Singhal, Rajesh Kumar] ICAR Indian Grassland & Fodder Res Inst, Jhansi 284003, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Grassland & Fodder Research Institute,"Singhal, RK (corresponding author), ICAR Indian Grassland & Fodder Res Inst, Jhansi 284003, Uttar Pradesh, India.",rajasinghal151@gmail.com,"Yadav, Praveen/HHN-5289-2022","Singhal, Rajesh/0000-0003-2685-6299",,,,,158,0,0,11,12,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1836-0947,1836-5795,,CROP PASTURE SCI,Crop Pasture Sci.,,,,,,,SI,,,,,10.1071/CP22200,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP22200,,SEP 2022,17,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,4M5YT,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000853400500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Anticipatory planning to adapt to such changes is a key management challenge. The aim of this study was to explore how adaptation planning for recreation sites in these areas can be supported using participatory scenario planning (PSP). For this purpose, a study area in southeast Iceland was chosen where management is likely to be heavily impacted in the near future. PSP involves local stakeholder workshops in which participants generate maps reflecting plausible glacial land cover and land use in the near future. This process takes place in stages, including the identification of potential drivers of land-use change, development of multiple land-use scenarios, and examination of the potential consequences of these scenarios and options for adapting to them. The study demonstrates that PSP can be a valuable tool to support recreational land-use planning in glacial landscapes, and to improve anticipatory adaptation to potentially undesirable future changes. PSP also has the potential to provide salient and usable knowledge for local stakeholders, stimulate stakeholders to elaborate on long-term changes and associated uncertainties through scenario construction and visualization, provide insight into the adaptive capacity of current recreational planning systems, and reframe stakeholders' guiding assumptions to encourage a more future-oriented mentality. This approach could be valuable in other glaciated mountain areas and in recreation areas where there are multiple significant future changes in landscape attributes, processes, and uses at play simultaneously.","[Welling, Johannes; Olafsdottir, Rannveig] Univ Iceland, Dept Geog & Tourism Studies, Sturlugata 7, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Arnason, Porvarour] Hornafjordur Res Ctr, Litlubru 2, IS-780 Hornafjorour, Iceland; [Guomundsson, Snaevarr] South East Iceland Nat Res Ctr, Litlubru 2, IS-780 Hornafjorour, Iceland",University of Iceland,"Welling, J (corresponding author), Univ Iceland, Dept Geog & Tourism Studies, Sturlugata 7, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",hwelling@hi.is,"Árnason, Þorvarður/M-3157-2015; Ólafsdóttir, Rannveig/AAC-9011-2022","Árnason, Þorvarður/0000-0002-4105-7869; ",European Union Interreg Northern Periphery and Arctic Programme; Kviskerjasjodur research fund,European Union Interreg Northern Periphery and Arctic Programme; Kviskerjasjodur research fund,"This work is a part of a larger project supported by the European Union Interreg Northern Periphery and Arctic Programme (Interreg.npa.eu), titled BuSK (Building shared knowledge capital to support natural resource governance in the northern periphery).

Cane burning is undertaken before harvest mostly due to labor shortages. A cane harvester has been promoted to counter labor shortages and increase cane productivity; however, its adoption has been slow. This paper examines incentive schemes for harvester adoption using a choice experiment. Forty large-scale farmers with the capacity to buy their own harvesters and 400 small-scale farmers who could potentially use harvesters on a fee basis were surveyed. The results suggest a variety of economic incentives for harvester adoption. Most important among these is subsidizing of interest rates for purchase. Also of merit at the milling stage are priority queuing, and subsidies for unburned cane to a lesser extent.","[Mahasuweerachai, Phumsith; Suksawat, Jakrapun] Khon Kaen Univ, Econ Fac, Khon Kaen 40002, Thailand",Khon Kaen University,"Suksawat, J (corresponding author), Khon Kaen Univ, Econ Fac, Khon Kaen 40002, Thailand.",jaksawats@kku.ac.th,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1049-0078,1873-7927,,J ASIAN ECON,J.

Data were gathered using household surveys, observation, key informant interviews and focus group discussions. During the entire study, 231 households (131 from PFM; 100 form non-PFM households), 35 key informants (25 from PFM; 10 from non-PFM) and 10 focus groups (6 from PFM; 4 from non-PFM) were involved. The livelihood assets framework was used to organize and analyze the quantitative data. The qualitative data was analyzed using topic coding and building categories, themes, and patterns of relationships. The introduction of PFM significantly (P < 0.05) improved the overall natural (index value of 0.72 and 0.58 for PFM and non-PFM, respectively), financial (0.73 and 0.61), physical (0.49 and 0.37), human (0.62 and 0.57) and social (0.77 and 0.59) livelihood asset values of local communities and contributed to the mitigation of forest degradation. On average, households involved in PFM displayed a 61.6%, 45.7%, 30.8% and 24.2% improvements in natural, financial, physical, and social assets, respectively. Households engaged in PFM showed a 37.4% improvement on the overall livelihood assets value, suggesting that PFM households displayed better livelihood assets compared to non-PFM households. However, the overall contribution of PFM to the livelihood assets showed skewed structure, suggesting that the improvements deviate from sustainability. The existing institutional structure including bylaws contributed a lot to strengthen PFM. Yet, it is crucial to strengthening the protection of forestlands through improving rule enforcement and commitments of both formal and informal institutions in managing forest resources. Also, sustaining the extraction of wood and non-wood forest products and the benefits from as well as integration of other interventions in PFM areas such as the provision of improved cook stoves and solar PV could help reduce forest degradation, improve the sense of ownership among local communities and sustain PFM activities. Further, expanding capacity building trainings and improving access to market could play a great role to sustainably manage forest resources through increasing the participation of local communities in decision making processes.","[Girma, Gonche] Ethiopian Environm & Forest Res Inst, POB 24536, Addis Ababa 1000, Ethiopia; [Girma, Gonche; Melka, Yoseph] Hawassa Univ, Wondo Genet Coll Forestry & Nat Resources, POB 128, Hawassa, Ethiopia; [Haileslassie, Amare; Mekuria, Wolde] East African & Nile Basin Reg Off, Int Water Management Inst IWMI, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Hawassa University; CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI),"Mekuria, W (corresponding author), East African & Nile Basin Reg Off, Int Water Management Inst IWMI, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",a.haileslassie@cgiar.org; w.bori@cgiar.org,,,Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA),Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA),"We thank the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) for providing financial support to Nature for Future project implemented in Central Rift Valley, Ethiopia.

University buildings have great energy-saving potential as part of energy consumption where 70% of energy loss is caused by heat transfer from the envelope. However, most of the research on energy-saving factors for envelopes is limited to a certain climate or a specific building type, and the optimal configuration of envelopes under different climatic regions has not been well solved. Therefore, the influence degree and appropriate parameters of each factor of the teaching-office building envelopes on energy consumption under different climates were analyzed in this paper by orthogonal design and numerical simulation. Results show that: (1) Solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) and indoor air change rates (ACH) [the heat transfer coefficient of the exterior wall (Kwall) and ACH] are the main factors affecting the cooling [heating] load, the insulation form of the exterior wall (Wins) and Kwall [Wins and solar radiation absorption coefficient of exterior surface materials (rho s)] have less influence; (2) The important ranking and optimal level of the influence of each factor on the cooling (or heating) loads are related to local load demands; (3) For the annual load, Kwall and the heat transfer coefficient of the exterior window (Kwin) is the focus of energysaving in severe cold and cold zones, but their impact is not significant in Guangzhou and Kunming, and the high significance of SHGC is only shown in Hohhot, Lhasa, Guangzhou, and Haikou; (4) The annual load energy savings reach 39.64%-57.57% in different climates by optimizing all factors. The research results can provide directions and data references for the energy-saving design and renovation of educational building envelopes in different climates (China).","[Liu, Zu'an; Hou, Jiawen; Dewancker, Bart Julien] Univ Kitakyushu, Fac Environm Engn, Fukuoka 8080135, Japan; [Zhang, Lili; Hou, Chaoping] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Architecture & Urban Rural Planning, Dujiangyan 611830, Peoples R China; [Meng, Xi] Qingdao Univ Technol, Innovat Inst Sustainable Maritime Architecture Res, Qingdao 266033, Peoples R China",University of Kitakyushu; Sichuan Agricultural University; Qingdao University of Technology,"Hou, JW (corresponding author), Univ Kitakyushu, Fac Environm Engn, Fukuoka 8080135, Japan.",jw_hou@outlook.com,"Hou, Jiawen/HGU-4997-2022; Liu, Zu-An/HDM-1843-2022","Liu, Zu-An/0000-0003-0210-173X; Hou, Jiawen/0000-0001-9642-6193",,,,,83,1,1,13,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,AUG,2022,8,8,,,,,,,e10056,10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10056,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10056,,AUG 2022,19,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,5F3MH,36016524,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000866222700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

We have invited researchers from a range of eclectic research areas to provide a Roadmap of how superconducting technologies could address these major challenges confronting humanity. Superconductivity has, over the century since its discovery by Kamerlingh Onnes in 1911, promised to provide solutions to many challenges. So far, most superconducting technologies are esoteric systems that are used in laboratories and hospitals. Large science projects have long appreciated the ability of superconductivity to efficiently create high magnetic fields that are otherwise very costly to achieve with ordinary materials. The most successful applications outside of large science are high-field magnets for magnetic resonance imaging, laboratory magnetometers for mineral and materials characterization, filters for mobile communications, and magnetoencephalography for understanding the human brain. The stage is now set for superconductivity to make more general contributions. Humanity uses practically unthinkable amounts of energy to drive our modern way of life. Overall, global power usage has been predicted to almost double from 16.5 to 30 TW in the next four decades (2011 Equinox Summit: Energy 2030 http://wgsi.org/publications-resources). The economy with which electrons carry energy compels the continued quest for efficient superconducting power generation, energy storage, and power transmission. The growing global population requires new arable land and treatment of water, especially in remote areas, and superconductivity offers unique solutions to these problems. Exquisite detectors give warning of changes that are otherwise invisible. Prediction of climate and disasters will be helped by future supercomputer technologies that support huge amounts of data and sophisticated modeling, and with the aid of superconductivity these systems might not require the energy of a large city. We present different sections on applications that could address (or are addressing) a range of environmental issues. The Roadmap covers water purification, power distribution and storage, low-environmental impact transport, environmental sensing (particularly for the removal of unexploded munitions), monitoring the Earth's magnetic fields for earthquakes and major solar activity, and, finally, developing a petaflop supercomputer that only requires 3% of the current supercomputer power provision while being 50 times faster. Access to fresh water. With only 2.5% of the water on Earth being fresh and climate change modeling forecasting that many areas will become drier, the ability to recycle water and achieve compact water recycling systems for sewage or ground water treatment is critical. The first section (by Nishijima) points to the potential of superconducting magnetic separation to enable water recycling and reuse. Energy. The Equinox Summit held in Waterloo Canada 2011 (2011 Equinox Summit: Energy 2030 http://wgsi.org/publications-resources) identified electricity use as humanity's largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Our appetite for electricity is growing faster than for any other form of energy. The communique from the summit said 'Transforming the ways we generate, distribute and store electricity is among the most pressing challenges facing society today .... If we want to stabilize CO2 levels in our atmosphere at 550 parts per million, all of that growth needs to be met by non-carbon forms of energy' (2011 Equinox Summit: Energy 2030 http://wgsi.org/publications-resources). Superconducting technologies can provide the energy efficiencies to achieve, in the European Union alone, 33-65% of the required reduction in greenhouse gas emissions according to the Kyoto Protocol (Hartikainen et al 2003 Supercond. Sci. Technol. 16 963). New technologies would include superconducting energy storage systems to effectively store power generation from renewable sources as well as high-temperature superconducting systems used in generators, transformers and synchronous motors in power stations and heavy-industry facilities. However, to be effective, these systems must be superior to conventional systems and, in reality, market penetration will occur as existing electrical machinery is written off. At current write-off rates, to achieve a 50% transfer to superconducting systems will take 20 years (Hartikainen et al 2003 Supercond. Sci. Technol. 16 963). The Roadmap next considers dc transmission of green power with a section by Eckroad and Marian who provide an update on the development of superconducting power transmission lines in view of recent sustainability studies. The potential of magnetic energy storage is then presented by Coi and Kim, who argue that a successful transition to wind and solar power generation must be harmonized with the conventional electrical network, which requires a storage technology with a fast response and long backup times. Transport. Superconducting Maglev trains and motors for international shipping have the potential to considerably reduce the emissions that contribute to greenhouse gases while improving their economic viability by reducing losses and improving efficiencies. International shipping, alone, contributes 3% of the greenhouse gas emissions. Three sections of the Roadmap identify how high-speed rail can be a major solution to providing fast, low energy, environmentally-friendly transport enabling reduction in automobile and aircraft travel by offering an alternative that is very competitive. With maritime international environmental regulations tightening, HTS motors with the characteristics of high torque and compactness will become important devices for high-performance and low-emission electric ship propulsion systems. A section on the development of a megawatt-class superconducting motor for ship propulsion is presented by Umemoto. Monitoring in manufacturing for waste reduction. Environmental impact from the waste created by the manufacturing sector and the need to make manufacturing efficient can be addressed by terahertz imaging. This technology has great potential in non-destructive testing, industrial process monitoring and control to greatly improve the industry process efficiency and reliability by reducing waste materials and toxic by-products. The section by Du shows how terahertz imaging can provide process and property information such as rust levels under paint that can assist with the reduction of waste in manufacturing and maintenance. Monitoring for naturally occurring disturbances. The environmental and social impact of natural disasters is mounting. Febvre provides the Roadmap for the use of ultra-sensitive magnetometry to understand geomagnetic phenomena and Earth-ionosphere couplings through the study of very small variations of the magnetic field. This magnetic monitoring has many implications for understanding our environment and providing new tools for early warning of natural hazards, either on Earth or in space which will enable us to be better prepared for natural disasters. Restoring environments after military use. Throughout the world, there are many areas confirmed or suspected of being contaminated by unexploded munitions known as unexploded ordnance (UXO). Its presence is the result of wars and training of military forces. Areas affected by UXO contamination are hazardous to the public and have a major influence on the nature of land use. UXO has impact in developed as well as developing nations. For example, the USA has UXO dating back to the American Civil War and countries such as Cambodia are living with landmines as a daily issue due to more recent wars. Underwater UXO has caused severe impacts such as the explosion in 1969 in the waters of Kent in the UK that caused a reading of 4.5 on the Richter scale for earthquake monitors. Another example was a land-based detonation of a 500 kg World War II bomb in Germany killing three people in 2010. There is countless UXO from recent conflicts worldwide. Detection and accurate location with 100% reliability is required to return land to safe civilian use. Keenan provides details of a prototype magnetic gradiometer developed for this purpose. Reducing power needs for high-end IT. Supercomputers are so large that they are close to requiring their own small power plant to support the energy needed to run the computer. For example, in 2011 Facebook data centers and operations used 532 million kW hours of energy. Mukhanov explores the potential of reducing the power dissipation for future supercomputers from more than 500 MW for Exascale systems to 0.2 MW by using superconducting-ferromagnetic Josephson junctions for magnetic memory and programmable logic. Clearly superconductivity is an ultimate energy-saving technology, and its practical implementation will contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions, improved water purification, reduction of waste and timely preparedness for natural disasters or significant events. This Roadmap shows how the application of superconducting technologies will have a significant impact when they are adopted.","[Nishijima, Shigehiro] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Eckroad, Steven] Elect Power Res Inst, Charlotte, NC 28262 USA; [Marian, Adela] Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, D-14467 Potsdam, Germany; [Choi, Kyeongdal; Kim, Woo Seok] Korea Polytech Univ, Gyeonggi Do 429793, South Korea; [Terai, Motoaki] Cent Japan Railway Co, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088204, Japan; [Deng, Zigang; Zheng, Jun; Wang, Jiasu] Southwest Jiaotong Univ SWJTU, State Key Lab Tract Power, Appl Superconduct Lab ASCLab, Chengdu 610031, Peoples R China; [Umemoto, Katsuya] Kawasaki Heavy Ind Co Ltd, Akashi, Hyogo 6738666, Japan; [Du, Jia; Keenan, Shane; Foley, Cathy P.] CSIRO, Div Mat Sci & Engn, Lindfield, NSW 2070, Australia; [Febvre, Pascal] Univ Savoie, IMEP LAHC CNRS UMR 5130, F-73376 Le Bourget Du Lac, France; [Mukhanov, Oleg] HYPRES Inc, Elmsford, NY 10523 USA; [Cooley, Lance D.] Fermilab Natl Accelerator Lab, Tech Div, Superconducting Mat Dept, Batavia, IL 60510 USA; [Hassenzahl, William V.] Adv Energy Anal, Piedmont, CA 94611 USA; [Izumi, Mitsuru] Tokyo Univ Marine Sci & Technol, Dept Marine Elect & Mech Engn, Appl Phys Lab, Koto Ku, Tokyo 1358533, Japan",Osaka University; Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI); Korea Polytechnic University; Southwest Jiaotong University; Kawasaki Heavy Industries; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Engineering & Systems Sciences (INSIS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite de Savoie; United States Department of Energy (DOE); University of Chicago; Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory; Tokyo University of Marine Science & Technology,"Nishijima, S (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, 2-1 Yamada Oka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",nishijima@see.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp; seckroad@EPRI.com; choidal@kpu.ac.kr; m.terai@jr-central.co.jp; asclabcn@gmail.com; umemoto_katsuya@khi.co.jp; jia.du@csiro.au; Pascal.Febvre@univ-savoie.fr; shane.keenan@csiro.au; mukhanov@hypres.com; ldcooley@fnal.gov; cathy.foley@csiro.au; advenergy1@aol.com; izumi@kaiyodai.ac.jp,"China, ASCLab/A-1629-2010; Deng, Zigang/C-4245-2008; Cooley, Lance D/E-7377-2015; ZHENG, J/T-3179-2019; Mukhanov, Oleg/V-5554-2018; Febvre, Pascal/AAE-2443-2019; Izumi, Mitsuru/F-4380-2014; Zheng, Jun/B-1422-2009; Cooley, Lance/AAE-5646-2021; Foley, Catherine/F-6407-2012","Deng, Zigang/0000-0001-7937-9081; Cooley, Lance D/0000-0003-3488-2980; ZHENG, J/0000-0002-8493-0592; Mukhanov, Oleg/0000-0003-2397-2171; Febvre, Pascal/0000-0002-9302-0419; Izumi, Mitsuru/0000-0001-8157-2198; Cooley, Lance/0000-0003-3488-2980; Foley, Catherine/0000-0002-3503-9672; Marian, Adela/0000-0002-9159-5227; Du, Jia/0000-0001-8111-9588",,,,,109,98,103,16,484,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0953-2048,1361-6668,,SUPERCOND SCI TECH,Supercond.

As a consequence, the thermal resilience of actual buildings might not be sufficient to keep comfortable conditions for their inhabitants. Cooling strategies to keep the houses fresh and cool will as -sume more and more important as the severity of these climatic events will intensify. Several simulations have been performed to compare how a selected case study apartment behaves with passive measures like natural ventilation and active measures, like mechanical ventilation and air conditioning. Two different types of be-haviours are discerned, depending on the commitment of the user and its willingness to take measures to counteract the building overheating. The effect of retrofitting is taken into account as well. The simulations use of historic data from the summer of 2018 and 2022 and future climate scenarios from the summer of 2030 and 2050. Results highlight how external overheating progressively degrades the thermal resilience of the building with ventilation scenarios, but how air conditioning is more appropriate to keep comfortable conditions inside the house. The behaviour is fundamental, as an aware user can significantly increase comfort in the case of natural ventilation and reduce energy consumption averagely by 15% in case of the air conditioning.","[Borghero, Luca; Cleries, Elisenda; Pean, Thibault; Ortiz, Joana; Salom, Jaume] IREC Catalonia Energy Res Inst, Jardins Dones de Negre 1,2a Pl, Barcelona 08930, Spain",,"Borghero, L (corresponding author), IREC Catalonia Energy Res Inst, Jardins Dones de Negre 1,2a Pl, Barcelona 08930, Spain.",lborghero@irec.cat,"Salom, Jaume/C-2504-2019","Salom, Jaume/0000-0001-7035-3248",AGAUR (Agencia de Gestio d'Ajust Universitaris i de Recerca) [2020PANDE00116],AGAUR (Agencia de Gestio d'Ajust Universitaris i de Recerca),"The research conducted is performed in the framework of the project 2020PANDE00116 - ComMit-20 Designing Resilient Communities to Mitigate Pandemic and Climate Change effects, funded by the AGAUR (Agencia de Gestio d'Ajust Universitaris i de Recerca).",,78,0,0,1,1,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

A strategy to avoid snowdrifts in the plant is to adapt the design of the plant itself. To provide a background for the adaptation of solar power plants to Polar climates, the effect of performing parameter adjustments on the snow accumulation conditions as well as the plant yield should be quantified. This study uses Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) and energy yield simulations, validated with field measurements, to investigate the sensitivity of snowdrift accumulation and energy yield to solar power plant design parameters. The investigated parameters include the panel tilt, the row spacing, the gap-to-ground, the system scale and the azimuth/wind direction. Here it is shown that the investigated design parameters exhibit a large variation in sensitivity and that only two parameter adjustments which reduce the risk of snowdrift accumulation increase or have an insignificant impact on the energy yield, namely increasing the gap-to-ground and the system scale. Tilt, pitch and azimuth adjustments can reduce the risk of snowdrift accumulation but for a trade-off in energy yield. As the snowdrift accumulation conditions depend on the local snow and wind climate and PV system characteristics such as plant size, the design adjustments should be performed for the specific design scenario. This study provides a background for adjusting the design of the plant to the local climate to increase the snowdrift resilience while minimizing adverse effects on the system yield.","[Frimannslund, Iver; Thiis, Thomas] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Bldg and Environm Technol, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Ferreira, Almerindo D.] Univ Coimbra, Dept Mech Engn, ADAI LAETA, P-3030788 Coimbra, Portugal; [Thorud, Bjorn] Multiconsult ASA, Dept Solar, Smart Grid & Storage, NO-0276 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Universidade de Coimbra,"Frimannslund, I (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Bldg and Environm Technol, NO-1432 As, Norway.",iver.frimannslund@nmbu.no,,,,,,,35,0,0,1,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0165-232X,1872-7441,,COLD REG SCI TECHNOL,Cold Reg.

In this study, we systematically analyze how the different components of heat vulnerability are related to household income, and present empirical evidence on the determinants of heat adaptation, focusing on the role of income. We contribute the first empirical analysis of heat vulnerability using household-level data at the national level, based on a longitudinal survey, including data points for 10,226 households in Germany in the period 2012-2020. Our results indicate that low income households are significantly more heat sensitive and have lower adaptive capacity than high income households, measured inter alia by health status, household composition, and economic and psychological resources to implement adaptation measures. However, heat hazard and exposure levels are comparable between income groups, hence there is no sorting of richer households into less hazardous or exposed locations on a national scale. We also contribute robust empirical evidence on the factors influencing household decisions to implement technical adaptation measures (e.g. installation of air conditioning), ultimately showing that the adaptation behavior of the most vulnerable households (e.g. people with poor health conditions or the elderly) is not limited by financial constraints.","[Osberghaus, Daniel] ZEW Leibniz Ctr European Econ Res, L7 1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Abeling, Thomas] UBA German Environm Agcy, Worlitzer Pl 1, D-06844 Dessau Rosslau, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Osberghaus, D (corresponding author), ZEW Leibniz Ctr European Econ Res, L7 1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",osberghaus@zew.de; thomas.abeling@uba.de,,,German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) [01LA1823B]; German Environment Agency [FKZ 3718 481010],German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Environment Agency,"This work was financially supported by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) under grant no. 01LA1823B, Evalu-ating Germany's Climate Mitigation and Adaptation Practice, and by the German Environment Agency, under grant no.

While apocalyptic environmentalism warns of future catastrophe in case of inaction, its postapocalyptic sibling assumes that catastrophe is already here or unavoidable. Here I explore the overlooked strategic implications of postapocalyptic narratives in climate change movements. I present data from a qualitative study of climate activism in five European cities: Malmo, Hamburg, Antwerp, Bristol, and Manchester, based on ethnographic observations and 46 qualitative interviews. I argue that postapocalyptic narratives are indeed widely present but are, following the logics of appropriateness, habit and affect, kept out of strategizing; in turn, this enables a continued focus on climate mitigation. Debates about the need for strategies to adapt to present or unavoidable climate disruptions tend to be foreclosed, though exceptions like the co-creation of local adaptation measures are discussed.","[de Moor, Joost] Leiden Univ, Inst Secur & Global Affairs, Dept Polit Sci, Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"de Moor, J (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Inst Secur & Global Affairs, Dept Polit Sci, Leiden, Netherlands.",demoorj@vuw.leidenuniv.nl,,"de Moor, Joost/0000-0002-0413-9590",Economic and Social Research Council [ESRC: ES/M010163/1]; Stockholms Universitet,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Stockholms Universitet,This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [ESRC: ES/M010163/1]; Stockholms Universitet [Environmental Research in the Human Sciences Area].,,35,13,13,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

Behavioural responses and heat-resistant characteristics of residential buildings are key aspects of exposure and adaptation to heat stress. We report a study that investigates heat exposure and adaptation responses across two neighbourhoods of different socio-economic status in Akure, Nigeria. The study involved a survey of 70 residents in each of the neighbourhoods. The study shows differences and commonalities in personal behavioural responses to heat stress, further revealing that education (p < 0.000), household income (p < 0.001) and gender (p < 0.002) were significant predictors of behavioural responses. Heat-resistant features in dwellings in both neighbourhoods were also identified. The poorer neighbourhood was more disadvantaged in this regard as their housing features did not completely prevent heat exposure. People in the richer neighbourhood, much more than the poorer one, were able to include features such as A/C, ceramic tiles, shady plants to cope with heat. These findings highlight intra-urban inequality in heat exposure and adaptation.

The combination of ecosystem service losses from forest disturbances that are immediate as well as the slower post-disturbance process of forest regrowth could result in long-lasting social, economic, and environmental costs. Using economic and geospatial analysis, we estimate the value of recreational services losses due to drought and quantify the social cost of carbon emissions due to wildfires and bark beetle damage in three National Forests in the Sierra Nevada region, California (Inyo National Forest, Tahoe National Forest, and Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit). Our findings indicate that recent droughts resulted in an annual reduction of about $73 million, $36 million, and $15 million for Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit, Tahoe, and Inyo National Forests, respectively. Tree biomass loss due to wildfires and bark beetle damage generated around 10 Mt CO2 of total emissions from 2003 and 2012. The estimated cumulative social costs of such emissions were around $0.8 million for fire and $2.4 million for bark beetle (using a 3% discount rate for related climate change damage). The social costs almost tripled under extreme climate damage projections.

However, as the influence of climate change has become more apparent, there is a need to establish a systematic understanding of the impacts of climate change on the operations of sport. The aim of this review is to take stock of existing literature on climate change's impacts on organized competitive sport entities, with further attention paid to their adaptation efforts. A scoping review was conducted to identify relevant studies published between 1995 and 2021. After evaluating more than 2100 publications, we retained 57 articles and analyzed them to answer the research questions: (1) What evidence is available regarding the impacts of climate change on the operation of organized competitive sport entities? (2) What is known from the literature about the measures taken by organized competitive sport entities to adapt to the impacts of climate change? Our analysis yielded five major themes: (1) Heat impacts on athlete and spectator health; (2) heat impacts on athlete performance; (3) adaptive measures taken in sport; (4) suitability of various cities for event hosting; and (5) benchmarking and boundary conditions. This review reveals that there is evidence of some climate change impacts on sport, but the literature reflects only a small share of the global sport sector. Equally, much remains to be understood about the nature of adaptation.

A major challenge facing resource managers is not knowing the exact timing and nature of those impacts. To confront this problem, scientists, adaptation specialists, and resource managers have begun to use scenario planning (SP). This structured process identifies a small set of scenarios-descriptions of potential future conditions that encompass the range of critical uncertainties-and uses them to inform planning. We reflect on a series of five recent participatory CC SP projects at four US National Park Service units and derive guidelines for using CC SP to support natural and cultural resource conservation. Specifically, we describe how these engagements affected management, present a generalized CC SP approach grounded in management priorities, and share key insights and innovations that (1) fostered participant confidence and deep engagement in the participatory CC SP process, (2) shared technical information in a way that encouraged informed, effective participation, (3) contextualized CC SP in the broader picture of relevant longstanding or emerging nonclimate stressors, (4) incorporated quantitative approaches to expand analytical capacity and assess qualitative findings, and (5) translated scenarios and all their complexity into strategic action.","[Miller, Brian W.; Robb, Brecken C.] US Geol Survey, North Cent Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Schuurman, Gregor W.; Runyon, Amber N.] US Natl Pk Serv Climate, Change Response Program, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Symstad, Amy J.] US Geol Survey, Northern Prairie Wildlife Res Ctr, Hot Springs, SD USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Miller, BW (corresponding author), 2150 Ctr Ave,Bldg C, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA.",bwmiller@usgs.gov,,"Robb, Brecken/0000-0001-9016-249X; Schuurman, Gregor/0000-0002-9304-7742; Runyon, Amber/0000-0002-7282-1217; Miller, Brian/0000-0003-1716-1161",U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystems Mission Area; U.S. Geological Survey North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center; U.S. National Park Service Climate Change Response Program,U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystems Mission Area; U.S. Geological Survey North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center; U.S. National Park Service Climate Change Response Program,U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystems Mission Area; U.S. Geological Survey North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center; U.S. National Park Service Climate Change Response Program,,57,3,3,6,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,2578-4854,,CONSERV SCI PRACT,Conserv.

This paper proposes a methodological approach to guide citizens moving around the city when extreme temperatures occur, minimizing climatic risks and negative health comes, using a very simple method based on Landsat 8 temperature data images at a subsection spatial scale level. The results obtained indicate the places of higher extreme temperatures risks, as well as some of the potential places that people can use to protect themselves.

The theory of reasoned action (TRA) suggests that attitude and subjective norms are important for persuasive communication. This study assesses how to apply TRA, its constructs and other relevant factors to predict behavior intention and beliefs and to change behavior tendency. The randomized field experiment method was applied to explore the differences between pre- and post-communication treatments (2 x 2 design). Can Tho city, located in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam, was selected as the research context because of its vulnerability to climate change. The results show that, first, TRA was found to be a significant predictor model of children's climate change behavior intentions. Second, attitude has a significant effect on the children's intention to act while videos with subjective norm treatment had not. The treatment interaction of both constructs also had a significant effect. Third, TRA theory-based treatments are positively associated with changes in children' salient beliefs on attitude and normative belief on social norm toward climate change. In addition, past practices, knowledge and gender are further factors that influence children's behavior intentions. A theory-inspired design of communication strategy allows the prediction and influencing of intentions. This finding has strong implications for both research and development in Vietnam.","[Quynh Anh Nguyen; Sinh Bach Tan] NISTPASS, 38 Ngo Quyen, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam; [Hens, Luc] Univ Nova Lisboa, Campus Campolide, P-1099085 Lisbon, Portugal; [MacAlister, Charlotte] IDRC, 150 Kent St, Ottawa, ON CA1P 0B2, Canada; [Johnson, Lester] Swinburne Univ Technol, Dept Management & Mkt, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Lebel, Boripat; Lebel, Louis] Chiang Mai Univ, Sch Publ Policy, USER, 239 Huay Kaew Rd, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Hung Manh Nguyen] Winrock Int Livestock Res & Training Ctr, 98 To Ngoc Van, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam; [The Ninh Nguyen] Thuongmai Univ, Fac Mkt, 79 Ho Tung Mau, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Swinburne University of Technology; Chiang Mai University; Thuongmai University,"Nguyen, QA (corresponding author), NISTPASS, 38 Ngo Quyen, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam.",anh.quynh.nguyen@gmail.com; luchens51@gmail.com; cmacalister@idrc.ca; lwjohnson@swin.edu.au; boripat@sea-user.org; sinhanh@hn.vnn.vn; ng.hungmanh@gmail.com; ninhnguyen@tmu.edu.vn; louis@sea-user.org,"Nguyen, The Ninh/R-2900-2019; Lebel, Louis/D-4130-2014","Nguyen, The Ninh/0000-0001-6050-2633; Lebel, Boripat/0000-0002-5564-8379; Lebel, Louis/0000-0001-6187-6418",International Development Research Centre (IDRC)-Canada [106707-001],International Development Research Centre (IDRC)-Canada,This research was funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC)-Canada grant number [106707-001].,,51,19,20,0,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2018,10,6,,,,,,,2019,10.3390/su10062019,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10062019,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GK9LE,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000436570100331,View Full Record in Web of Science

In these processes, the willingness and ability of older people, living in owner-occupied housing, to adapt and improve their home or move to a suitable dwelling are crucial. However, our understanding of how and why older people undertake home improvements, and how these practices intersect with policy agendas is still limited. In this paper we draw on a qualitative study with 33 older Dutch homeowner households, to understand how older people conceive home improvements and investments, and their motivations for pursuing them (or not). We find that home improvement as well as moves through and into homeownership are usually deeply connected with ideas of a good life. That may involve adapting to decreasing mobility and cognitive functions, closer relations with children and grandchildren, traveling and hobbies, comfort, and even luxury. However, these practices often lack the coherence implied by policymakers and include intricate considerations of physical, mental, social, and financial well-being.","[Druta, Oana] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Schilder, Frans; Lennartz, Christian] Dutch Environm Assessment Agcy, The Hague, Netherlands",Eindhoven University of Technology,"Druta, O (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands.",o.druta@tue.nl,,"Druta, Oana/0000-0002-4939-2231",,,,,46,1,1,5,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1949-1247,1949-1255,,INT J HOUS POLICY,Int.

They play a very important role in household nutrition management and resource management in terms of labor, off-farm products, and small savings. In the absence of help from formal and informal R and D and technology institutions, their knowledge and resources' exchange system has to be very robust to cope with the seasonal shortages arising due to climate fluctuations. The study found that these exchanges, spilling over caste or class boundaries, serve as valuable informal safety nets and contribute to household resilience. Researchers seeking to strengthen community coping strategies should pursue such polices and institutional interventions which strengthen women's resource exchange and exploitation mechanisms. We offer in the end a 4-E model involving exchange, expertise, ethics, and environmental consciousness which describes how these empower women and help in articulation of their unique coping strength at intra- and inert community levels. Lateral learning among community members sustains and enhances over time collective and household coping strategies with climate risks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Improved soil management practices are crucial to tackle these problems by enhancing agro-ecosystem productivity, soil fertility, and carbon sequestration. To meet Paris climate treaty pledges, soil management must address validated approaches for carbon sequestration and stabilization. The present synthesis assesses a range of current and potential future agricultural management practices (AMP) that have an effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and sequestration. Through two strategies-increasing carbon inputs (e.g., enhanced primary production, organic fertilizers) and reducing SOC losses (e.g., reducing soil erosion, managing soil respiration)-AMP can either sequester, up to 714 +/- 404 (compost) kg C ha(-1) y(-1), having no distinct impact (mineral fertilization), or even reduce SOC stocks in the topsoil (bare fallow). Overall, the carbon sequestration potential of the subsoil (>40 cm) requires further investigation. Moreover, climate change, permanent soil sealing, consumer behavior in dietary habits and waste production, as well as the socio-economic constraints of farmers (e.g., information exchange, long-term economic profitability) are important factors for implementing new AMPs. This calls for life-cycle assessments of those practices.","[Tiefenbacher, Alexandra; Sanden, Taru; Haslmayr, Hans-Peter; Miloczki, Julia; Spiegel, Heide] Austrian Agcy Hlth & Food Safety AGES, Dept Soil Hlth & Plant Nutr, A-1220 Vienna, Austria; [Tiefenbacher, Alexandra] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Soil Phys & Rural Water Management, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Wenzel, Walter] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Soil Res, A-3430 Tulln, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Tiefenbacher, A (corresponding author), Austrian Agcy Hlth & Food Safety AGES, Dept Soil Hlth & Plant Nutr, A-1220 Vienna, Austria.;Tiefenbacher, A (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Soil Phys & Rural Water Management, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",a_tiefenbacher@gmx.at; taru.sanden@ages.at; hahape@gmx.at; julia.miloczki@ages.at; walter.wenzel@boku.ac.at; adelheid.spiegel@ages.at,,"Tiefenbacher, Alexandra/0000-0003-2297-1329; Spiegel, Heide/0000-0003-1285-8509; Sanden, Taru/0000-0002-9542-0117",EJP Soil (EU H2020) [862695]; Austrian Climate and Energy Fund; FEMTech programme (FFG);  [ACRP11-CASAS-KR18AC0K14633],EJP Soil (EU H2020); Austrian Climate and Energy Fund; FEMTech programme (FFG); ,"The authors received funds from the EJP Soil (EU H2020), grant number 862695.

This relatively new concept has become a key element in strategies for green recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. NbS consist of a range of measures that address various societal challenges, including climate change, natural disasters, and water security, by combining human well-being and biodiversity benefits. Although the importance of NbS has been widely recognized, existing studies on aspects of their governance are limited and mainly focus on NbS in European countries. There is little relevant research in other regions, including Asia. This study aimed to explore challenges for NbS governance by analyzing the development and implementation of NbS in Asia. We focused on NbS in the fields of climate change mitigation and adaptation, disaster risk reduction, and infrastructure. In these three fields, NbS are linked to climate security issues and have been widely implemented in Asian countries. This analysis identified the challenges for NbS governance for countries at different stages of economic development, and for developing measures for NbS with different institutions and actors. It recognizes the importance of a framework that matches the need for NbS with relevant institutions and actors at various scales and in various sectors.

Since 2010, a group of university researchers, public utility water resource managers and operators, water management district personnel, and local planners have engaged in a sustained collaboration for the development, sharing, and application of cutting-edge research to the practical issues of water management and distribution in the highly urbanized state of Florida. The authors, all members of FloridaWCA, present a case study of the organization's history, its achievements, and lessons learned at the organizational, scientific/technical, and personal levels. Their goals are to 1) describe how the organizational process has contributed to actionable science based on posing and answering questions of importance; 2) share its scientific impact and technical contributions; 3) demonstrate the value of such a stakeholder-scientist partnership, and 4) identify organizational and structural components that have influenced its effectiveness, including personal reflections. The FloridaWCA, having reached its tenth anniversary, continues to evolve today as a sustained stakeholder-scientist partnership resulting in both guiding researchers of what is applicable in the field (creating an area of research that is useful to society) while also helping the practitioners to push the envelope on the state-of-the practices that can be informed by current research.","[Misra, Vasubandhu] Florida State Univ, Ctr Ocean Atmospher Predict Studies, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Misra, Vasubandhu] Florida State Univ, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Misra, Vasubandhu] Florida State Univ, Florida Climate Inst, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Irani, Tracy] Univ Florida, Dept Family Youth & Community Sci, Gainesville, FL USA; [Staal, Lisette; Graham, Wendy] Univ Florida, Water Inst, Gainesville, FL USA; [Morris, Kevin] Peace River Manasota Reg Water Supply Author, Lakewood Ranch, FL USA; [Asefa, Tirusew] Tampa Bay Water, Planning & Syst Decis Support, Clearwater, FL USA; [Asefa, Tirusew] Univ S Florida, Patel Coll Global Sustainabil, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Martinez, Chris] Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Gainesville, FL USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Misra, V (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Ctr Ocean Atmospher Predict Studies, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.;Misra, V (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.;Misra, V (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Florida Climate Inst, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",vmisra@fsu.edu,,,NOAA Climate Program Office; Offices of Research at the Florida State University; University of Florida; NASA [80NSSC19K1199],NOAA Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Offices of Research at the Florida State University; University of Florida(University of Florida); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"We would like to acknowledge the support of NOAA Climate Program Office, the Offices of Research at the Florida State University, and the University of Florida to support the Florida Climate Institute and the Water Institute, respectively, and NASA Grant 80NSSC19K1199.",,72,4,4,0,3,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693, UNITED STATES",0003-0007,1520-0477,,B AM METEOROL SOC,Bull.

Here we present analysis of the ENSEMBLES decadal simulations, the first multi-model decadal hindcasts, focusing on the skill in prediction of temperature and precipitation-important for impact prediction. Whilst previous work on this dataset has focused on the skill in multi-year averages, we focus here on the skill in prediction at smaller timescales. Considering annual and seasonal averages, we look at correlations, potential predictability and multi-year trend correlations. The results suggest that the prediction skill for temperature comes from the long-term trend, and that precipitation predictions are not skilful. The potential predictability of the models is higher for annual than for seasonal means and is largest over the tropics, though it is low everywhere else and is much lower for precipitation than for temperature. The globally averaged temperature trend correlation is significant at the 99% level for all models and is higher for annual than for seasonal averages; however, for smaller spatial regions the skill is lower. For precipitation trends, the correlations are not skilful on either annual or seasonal scales. Whilst climate models run in decadal prediction mode may be useful by other means, the hindcasts studied here have limited predictive power on the scales at which climate impacts and the results presented suggest that they do not yet have sufficient skill to drive impact models on decadal timescales.","[MacLeod, D.

One potential strategy to moderate drought-induced stress is reducing basal area through the repeat application of prescribed fire. However, use of prescribed fire as a management tool to reduce drought vulnerability has been largely untested. Here, we report the long-term effects of repeat fires on the climate-growth response of adult oaks (Quercus spp.) in the Missouri Ozarks, USA. We measured the annual radial growth of trees that experienced either no fire, periodic (every 4 yr), or annual prescribed fires from 1950 to 2015. To assess whether increased fire frequency interacts with climate to determine long-term forest productivity, we modeled annual growth as a function of potential evapotranspiration, fire treatment, and their interaction. We also quantified the effect of fire-driven reductions in tree density on carbon and oxygen isotope composition of tree rings and drought resistance (growth during drought) and resilience (growth recovery after drought) during past drought events. Annual radial growth and isotopic composition data indicated trees experienced reduced growth due to moisture stress, but drought vulnerability did not vary between frequently burned forests and unburned controls. In contrast, periodic, but not annual, fires reduced annual growth by 9.6% during wet periods favorable to growth with the effect consistent over time. Fire had minimal effects on total and inorganic soil nitrogen after 65 yr of treatment, regardless of frequency, suggesting other underlying causes of the observed growth declines under periodic burning (e.g., crown, bole, or root injury). Our results suggest that long-term, increased fire frequency can have negative effects on long-term tree growth, but effects are contingent upon the fire return interval. These findings highlight important differences in how fire and thinning influence density-dependent competition and the response of tree growth to climate. Although additional studies are needed from other forest ecosystems, this study provides early evidence that increased fire frequency will not alleviate drought stress and instead, may reduce long-term, aboveground carbon storage in forests.","[Refsland, Tyler; Fraterrigo, Jennifer] Univ Illinois, Program Ecol Evolut & Conservat Biol, 505 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Knapp, Benjamin] Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, 1111 W Rollins Rd, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Stephan, Kirsten] West Virginia Univ, Div Forestry & Nat Resources, 1145 Evansdale Dr, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Fraterrigo, Jennifer] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, 1102 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; West Virginia University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Refsland, T (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Program Ecol Evolut & Conservat Biol, 505 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",trefsland@unr.edu,"Refsland, Tyler/ABF-4075-2021; Refsland, Tyler K/ABF-4073-2021","Refsland, Tyler/0000-0002-7210-9174","Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, US Department of Agriculture [ILLU 875-925]; Department of Defense [W911NF 05 2 0003]","Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture); Department of Defense(United States Department of Defense)","This work was supported by the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, US Department of Agriculture, under project number ILLU 875-925 and the Department of Defense (W911NF 05 2 0003).

The consideration of heat waves in this context is a novel approach. The survey data was collected from 877 Viennese respondents. Structural equation modelling shows a very good fit of the final model to the data; model extensions yield a strong increase of explained variance. The results suggest that heat-related change of intention is influenced by the strength of heat stress perceived during past heat waves. Nevertheless, subjective and social norm are the strongest determinants of intention, whereas attitude is a very weak predictor. Additional significant predictors are outdoor sports as a travel motive, media coverage, and past behaviour. The first application of an extended TPB model to summer tourism in the context of climate change yields important insights as to how climate change affects the destination choice of summer tourists. The results provide valuable starting points for attracting heat stressed metropolitan visitors.","[Juschten, Maria; Unbehaun, Wiebke; Hoessinger, Reinhard] Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci BOKU, Inst Transport Studies, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Jiricka-Puerrer, Alexandra] BOKU, Inst Landscape Dev Recreat & Conservat Planning, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Jiricka-Purrer, A (corresponding author), BOKU, Inst Landscape Dev Recreat & Conservat Planning, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",maria.juschten@boku.ac.at; alexandra.jiricka@boku.ac.at; wiebke.unbehaun@boku.ac.at; reinhard.hoessinger@boku.ac.at,,"Jiricka-Purrer, Alexandra/0000-0002-6842-1835; Juschten, Maria/0000-0002-8486-9322; Hossinger, Reinhard/0000-0002-0090-0573",Austrian Climate and Energy Fund under the 8th Call of the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP),Austrian Climate and Energy Fund under the 8th Call of the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP),This paper stems from a Research Project funded by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund under the 8th Call of the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP).

While the effects of changing climatic patterns are well documented with respect to the physical geographical sphere, research into the effects of climate change upon the regional socio-economic systems in the Alps is still rare. What is almost entirely missing is conceptual work identifying possible path-ways towards the implementation of adaptation measures with respect to climate change (see as one notable exception the contribution by Richard et al. 2010 in the last issue of the RGA). It is in this context that the paper at hand whishes to make a contribution by showing where the main barriers towards the successful implementation of adaptation measures lay. Theoretically, the paper builds upon distinct psychological and sociological concepts related to the actor-structure duality as suggested by structuration theory, while the Alps serve as the geographical frame of reasoning for the conceptual debate brought forward within the paper.","Univ Appl Sci HTW Chur, Inst Tourism & Leisure Res ITF, Catholic Univ Eichstatt Ingolstadt, Berlin, Germany",,"Wyss, R (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci HTW Chur, Inst Tourism & Leisure Res ITF, Catholic Univ Eichstatt Ingolstadt, Berlin, Germany.",romano.wyss@htwchur.ch,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,0,IGA-ASSOC DIFFUSION RECHERCHE ALPINE,GRENOBLE,"14 BIS AVENUE MARIE REYNOARD, GRENOBLE, 38100, FRANCE",0035-1121,1760-7426,,REV GEOGR ALP,Rev.

South Korea was analyzed as a case study for which the government has shown motivation to increase renewable energy penetration. Herein, a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) including solar and wind energies were selected due to their relatively stable and mature technology. In addition, Power-to-X has been incorporated to cover other renewable energy options such as hydrogen and synthetic natural gas (SNG). Therefore, an approach of forecasting the weather characteristics and demand loading over a relatively long timeframe was implemented via deep learning techniques (LSTM and GRU) and statistical approaches (Fbprophet and SARIMA), respectively. A deployment strategy incorporating HRES and Power-to-X is then proposed in correspondence to the forecasted results of the 15 regions considered in this study. An extension of this, the reliability of the designed system is further assessed based on the probability of the demand losses with the aid of Monte-Carlo simulation. With the proposed deployment strategy, a total annual cost of 9.88 x 10(11) $/year and a greenhouse gas reduction of 1.24 x 10(6) tons/year are expected for a 35% renewable energy penetration. However, only SNG shows relatively competitive cost (at 23.20 $/m(3) SNG), whereas the average costs of electricity (0.133 $/kWh) and hydrogen (7.784 $/kg H-2) across the regions are yet to be competitive compared to the current market prices.

By law, in Denmark, protecting your property from flooding from the sea is a private responsibility. This obliges communities to debate their own flood risk and their ability and options to fund additional protection. However, creating and maintaining flood protection are challenging. The related negotiations frequently develop into conflicts, which prolong the processes. This research concludes that the main challenges are not the technical issues, but the planning and negotiation between different interests. The paper presents the results of four qualitative case studies of existing dikes and dike projects in Denmark. By applying a situated analysis, the controversies in each case have been unravelled, with the aim of understanding the deeper reasons behind them. The paper concludes that the controversies often revolve around broader issues in the local communities such as liveability and population decline, but also feed on less visible aspects to do with people's long- and short-term experience of living and moving around in their local landscape. The results of the paper underline the need to move beyond risk assessments and meteorological calculations when flood risk protection projects are planned and managed.

However, measuring resilience and monitoring adaptation efforts have received only limited attention from science and practice so far. Thus, this paper aims to provide an indicator set to measure urban climate resilience and monitor adaptation activities. In order to develop this indicator set, a four-step mixed method approach was implemented: (1) based on a literature review, relevant resilience indicators were selected, (2) researchers, consultants and city representatives were then invited to evaluate those indicators in an online survey before the remaining indicator candidates were validated in a workshop (3) and finally reviewed by sector experts (4). This thorough process resulted in 24 indicators distributed over 24 action fields based on secondary data. The participatory approach allowed the research team to take into account the complexity and interdisciplinarity nature of the topic, as well as place- and context-specific parameters. However, it also showed that in order to conduct a holistic assessment of urban climate resilience, a purely quantitative, indicator-based approach is not sufficient, and additional qualitative information is needed.","[Feldmeyer, Daniel; Birkmann, Joern] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Spatial & Reg Planning IREUS, D-70049 Stuttgart, Germany; [Wilden, Daniela; Diller, Christian] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Geog, D-35390 Giessen, Germany; [Kind, Christian; Kaiser, Theresa] Adelphi, D-10559 Berlin, Germany; [Goldschmidt, Ruediger] DIALOGIK, D-70176 Stuttgart, Germany",University of Stuttgart; Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Feldmeyer, D (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Spatial & Reg Planning IREUS, D-70049 Stuttgart, Germany.",daniel.feldmeyer@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de; daniela.wilden@geogr.uni-giessen.de; kind@adelphi.de; kaiser@adelphi.de; goldschmidt@dialogik-expert.de; christian.diller@geogr.uni-giessen.de; joern.birkmann@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de,"Birkmann, Joern jb/J-5736-2015; Wilden, Daniela/AAR-2260-2021","Wilden, Daniela/0000-0001-6132-180X; Birkmann, Joern/0000-0001-8733-3964",German Federal Ministry of Science and Education (BMBF),German Federal Ministry of Science and Education (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the German Federal Ministry of Science and Education (BMBF) for the research Monitoring and Evaluation of climate resilience and urban adaptation measures (MONARES).

The question arises as to which design strategies help to identify and balance relevant solar, green, and densification interventions that would lead to new qualities in the built environment. This work relies on a threefold research by design approach to acquire this knowledge base. Within a research-based design studio, four teams of master's students in architecture faced the design task in a case study of an inner-city perimeter block development in Munich, thus covering the first two phases of the research by design process: Phase 1-pre-design, comprises a shared knowledge literature research, among other things, and concludes with specific research questions for the subsequent phase; Phase 2-design. Here, design concepts answer the research questions and are iteratively adapted and evaluated in an interdisciplinary expert discourse. Phase 3-post-design, synthesises the design proposals into design strategies. By gaining insights into the benefits and disadvantages of solar and green interventions, the research provides designers and urban planners with strategies to design the practical transformation and upgrading of urban residential structures.","[Fassbender, Elisabeth; Ludwig, Ferdinand; Hild, Andreas; Auer, Thomas; Hemmerle, Claudia] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Engn & Design, Dept Architecture, D-80333 Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Fassbender, E (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Sch Engn & Design, Dept Architecture, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",elisabeth.fassbender@tum.de; ferdinand.ludwig@tum.de; andreas.hild@tum.de; thomas.auer@tum.de; claudia.hemmerle@tum.de,,"Ludwig, Ferdinand/0000-0001-5877-5675; Fassbender, Elisabeth/0000-0001-8157-7343; Auer, Thomas/0000-0001-7682-0652; Hemmerle, Claudia/0000-0001-5202-3579",Bavarian Ministry of Science and the Arts in the context of the Bavarian Climate Research Network (bayklif),Bavarian Ministry of Science and the Arts in the context of the Bavarian Climate Research Network (bayklif),This project is sponsored by the Bavarian Ministry of Science and the Arts in the context of the Bavarian Climate Research Network (bayklif).,,34,0,0,3,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR,2022,14,6,,,,,,,3438,10.3390/su14063438,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14063438,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0B0JU,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000774331100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper explores the complex roots of disaster risk creation in the region through the lens of disaster justice, asking: by what standards should we consider whether disaster risk is justly created or shared? And how might urban development professionals account for increasing vulnerabilities to natural hazards and climate change in their everyday work? To answer these questions, we develop a framework for disaster justice derived from the literature on procedural equity that considers the franchise, scope, and authenticity of development processes. We apply this framework in the Darjeeling Himalayas using the construction of multi-storied concrete buildings as our object of analysis and based on data collected from interviews, plans and policy documents, and participant observation. This case study shows that a standard framework of justice is a useful starting point for examining development processes and their contribution to disaster risk, but also illuminates how considerations of disaster justice are unique to particular places. By using such a framework, modified to fit particular contexts and circumstances, we believe that urban development professionals can establish a more transparent and informed way to evaluate the justice of their work.","[Rumbach, Andrew; Nemeth, Jeremy] Univ Colorado, Denver, CO 80202 USA",,"Rumbach, A (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Denver, CO 80202 USA.",andrew.rumbach@ucdenver.edu,,,Office of Research Services at the University of Colorado Denver,Office of Research Services at the University of Colorado Denver,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by a grant from the Office of Research Services at the University of Colorado Denver.",,82,9,9,2,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2514-8486,2514-8494,,ENVIRON PLAN E-NAT,Environ.

We find that the average number of days spent working in unsafe conditions will double by mid-century, and, without mitigation, triple by the end of it. Increases in rest time and the availability of climate-controlled recovery areas can eliminate this risk but could affect farm productivity, farm worker earnings, and/or labor costs much more than alternative measures.

These risk, discourses, and practices occur at multiple scales that are embedded within one another and draw their significance from cross-scalar connections; from global estimates of ocean density and emission scenarios, local design criteria for flood management, networks of tidal gauges, and individual and collective experiences of loss and change. Thus social actors responding to the complex physical challenges posed by climate change across space and time must deal with an inherent politics of building shared understanding and agreeing on (or not) desirable courses of action. These dynamics produce 'scalar politics,' i.e. strategies for defining and managing perceived risks at specific scales, resulting in more or less equitable and effective responses to the uneven consequences of SLR. To highlight the scalar politics of knowledge systems in adaptation planning, we present findings from two case studies of the Pacific Islands and coastal areas of Florida, USA. Drawing on our findings, we propose the concept 'scalar knowledge politics of risk.' As knowledge claims flow between global, regional, and local decision-making spaces, we identify five scales at which knowledge systems experience friction: 1) construction of the global climate; 2) regional downscaling of climate impacts; 3) local definition of risks; 4) transformation of on-the-ground social-ecological-technical systems and infrastructures; and, 5) evaluation of interventions. Through our case study investigation of the scalar politics of SLR adaptation, we hope to help illuminate and inform strategies to overcome long-standing barriers to effective and inclusive urban adaptation.","[Rozance, Mary Ann] Univ Washington, Climate Impacts Grp, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Denton, Ashlie] Portland State Univ, Coll Urban & Publ Affairs, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Matsler, A.

Ensuring stable food security before, during, and after disasters requires resilient food systems that can withstand and recover from disruptions. However, few U.S. cities have considered food systems in disaster preparedness or resilience planning. This reflective case study from the participant-observer perspective examines the process and outcomes of a city-university collaboration to assess and begin to improve the resilience of Baltimore City's food system. An academic center and municipal department of planning partnered to assess and plan for short- and long-term food system resilience. An Emergency Food Working Group convened for three meetings over three months, resulting in the creation of an emergency food access protocol for acute event response. A broader Baltimore Food System Resilience Advisory Report was then developed based on 36 key-informant interviews with food system stakeholders, literature reviews, and geographic information system (GIS) mapping. That report included an assessment of the Baltimore City food system's vulnerability to hazards, the extent of stakeholder preparedness for food supply disruptions, and identified opportunities for enhancing long-term food system resilience. It presented policy recommendations for Baltimore and a framework for conceptualizing food system vulnerabilities. Policy recommendations and lessons learned from this planning process can serve as an example for other cities interested in enhancing the resilience of their food system or broadening the scope of their resilience planning.","[Biehl, Erin; Neff, Roni A.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Johns Hopkins Ctr Livable Future, Dept Environm Hlth & Engn, 111 Market Pl,Suite 840, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA; [Buzogany, Sarah] Baltimore City Off Sustainabil, Baltimore Food Policy Initiat, 417 East Fayette St,8th Floor, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Baja, Kristin] Urban Sustainabil Directors Network, Oakland, CA USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,"Biehl, E (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Johns Hopkins Ctr Livable Future, Dept Environm Hlth & Engn, 111 Market Pl,Suite 840, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA.",ebiehl1@jhu.edu; sarah.buzogany@baltimorecity.gov; kristinbaja@usdn.org; rneff1@jhu.edu,,"Neff, Roni/0000-0002-0010-2635",Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future,Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future,"This work was funded by the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future with a gift from the GRACE Communications Foundation, the Johns Hopkins 21st Century Cities Initiative, and the Johns Hopkins Urban Health Institute.

We focused on the Elbe River Basin District and how global warming is addressed in its water management. We used the social-ecological systems (SES) approach as our theoretical framework, representing an eminent analytical frame of biosphere-based sustainability science. In our study, we analysed core characteristics of SES in the context of global warming to evaluate the effectiveness of current water management in the Elbe River basin concerning long-term changing climate conditions. To determine to what extent each SES feature is considered in the Elbe water management, we applied a scale of 1 to 5. Our results show that the SES feature scale and openness is best addressed (score 4.0) by the Elbe River basin management, followed by context dependency (score 3.9); however, non-linearity, uncertainty, unpredictability (score 3.2), self-organisation and adaptability (score 3.1), and dynamics (score 3.0) have only moderate impacts.

This approach leverages additive manufacturing, SMA, and origami to suggest a lightweight, motorless, and silently operable kinetic building module with compact actuation parts. User-customization is prioritized in its manufacturing, installation, and operation: the device is made by 3D-printed thermoplastic components and is self-supportively installable. User-engaged operation is considered by involving an app-based remote control, along with sensor-integrated automation. The results of responsive building performance simulation and mockup tests demonstrate that the thermo-responsive building module enables control of solar radiation and light, reducing room temperature dynamically. The study findings speak to the limitations and potential of material-based actuation for adaptive building technologies.","[Yi, Hwang; Kim, Yuri; Kim, Mi-Jin] Ajou Univ, Dept Architecture, Architectural Design & Technol Lab, 206 World Cup Ro, Suwon 443749, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Kim, Dongyun] Univ Penn, Sch Design, Dept Architecture, 210 S 34th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kim, Dongjin; Koh, Je-sung] Ajou Univ, Dept Mech Engn, 206 World Cup Ro, Suwon 443749, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Ajou University; University of Pennsylvania; Ajou University,"Yi, H (corresponding author), Ajou Univ, Dept Architecture, Architectural Design & Technol Lab, 206 World Cup Ro, Suwon 443749, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",hwy@ajou.ac.kr,"Kim, Mi Jin/GXH-9639-2022","Koh, Je-sung/0000-0002-7739-0882",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIP; Ministry of Science and ICT) [NRF-2018R1C1B5084299],National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIP; Ministry of Science and ICT),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIP; Ministry of Science and ICT) (No. NRF-2018R1C1B5084299).,,46,17,18,8,44,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

California rangeland ecosystems have experienced substantial conversion to residential land use and more intensive agriculture. Objectives To understand the potential impacts to rangeland ecosystem services, we developed six spatially explicit (250 m) climate/land use change scenarios for the Central Valley of California and surrounding foothills consistent with three Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission scenario narratives. Methods We quantified baseline and projected change in wildlife habitat, soil organic carbon (SOC), and water supply (recharge and runoff). For six case study watersheds we quantified the interactions of future development and changing climate on recharge, runoff and streamflow, and precipitation thresholds where dominant watershed hydrological processes shift through analysis of covariance. Results The scenarios show that across the region, habitat loss is expected to occur predominantly in grasslands, primarily due to future development (up to a 37 % decline by 2100), however habitat loss in priority conservation errors will likely be due to cropland and hay/pasture expansion (up to 40 % by 2100). Grasslands in the region contain approximately 100 teragrams SOC in the top 20 cm, and up to 39% of this SOC is subject to conversion by 2100. In dryer periods recharge processes typically dominate runoff. Future development lowers the precipitation value at which recharge processes dominate runoff, and combined with periods of drought, reduces the opportunity for recharge, especially on deep soils. Conclusion Results support the need for climate-smart land use planning that takes recharge areas into account, which will provide opportunities for water storage in dry years. Given projections for agriculture, more modeling is needed on feedbacks between agricultural expansion on rangelands and water supply.","[Byrd, Kristin B.; Sleeter, Benjamin M.; Soulard, Christopher E.] US Geol Survey, Western Geog Sci Ctr, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Flint, Lorraine E.; Flint, Alan L.] US Geol Survey, Calif Water Sci Ctr, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA; [Alvarez, Pelayo] Calif Rangeland Conservat Coalit Defenders Wildli, Davis, CA 95617 USA; [Casey, Clyde F.] US Geol Survey, Sci & Decis Ctr, Reston, VA 20192 USA; [Sohl, Terry L.] US Geol Survey, EROS Data Ctr, Sioux Falls, SD 57198 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Byrd, KB (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Western Geog Sci Ctr, 345 Middlefield Rd,MS-531, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",kbyrd@usgs.gov,"Sohl, Terry/W-5486-2019","Sohl, Terry/0000-0002-9771-4231; Soulard, Christopher/0000-0002-5777-9516; Byrd, Kristin/0000-0002-5725-7486",California Landscape Conservation Cooperative; USGS LandCarbon Project,California Landscape Conservation Cooperative; USGS LandCarbon Project,"We thank The Nature Conservancy for use of the critical priority habitat map for the California Rangeland Conservation Coalition Focus Area.

We study this question in the context of the evolution of polycentric systems of sea-level rise adaptation in the San Francisco Bay Area. We focus on how the structure of polycentric systems changes over time to support cooperation and learning and whether those changes represent a process of centralization or decentralization. The ecology of games framework provides the theoretical background for developing hypotheses about the structure of the system over time. We test the hypotheses by analyzing the polycentric system as a two-mode network where actors are linked to policy, divided into five time periods from 1991 to 2016. The results suggest that the polycentric system for sea-level rise adaptation started with a centralized set of actors, which evolved over time to a more decentralized structure. The research has general implications with respect to how polycentric systems manage the trade-off between maintaining local autonomy and coordinating decisions at the regional level across fragmented policy communities.","[Lubell, Mark] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Lubell, Mark] Ctr Environm Policy & Behav, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Robbins, Matthew] Univ Calif Davis, Ecol Grad Grp, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Lubell, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;Lubell, M (corresponding author), Ctr Environm Policy & Behav, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",mnlubell@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,69,8,8,4,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0190-292X,1541-0072,,POLICY STUD J,Policy Stud.

To build resilience and societal preparedness towards climate change, integration of adaptation into development is being increasingly emphasized. To date, much of the adaptation literature has been theoretical, reflecting the absence of empirical data from activities on the ground. However, the Funds established under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and managed by the Global Environment Facility, the Least Developed Countries Fund, the Special Climate Change Fund and the Strategic Priority for Adaptation, have approved financing for 133 adaptation projects in 70 countries with sufficient documented experience to allow for initial categorization and evaluation. This article provides the first substantial compendium of adaptation actions identified through the allocation and disbursement of these Funds and organizes these actions into a generalized typology of adaptation activities. The information obtained sheds new insight into what adaptation is, in practice, and suggests some next steps to strengthen the empirical database. Ten types of overarching adaptation activities were identified through an analysis of 92 projects financed through these Funds. This paper analyzes these adaptation activities and compares them with theoretical constructs of adaptation typologies. We find that many of the early ideas and concepts advanced by theoreticians are consistent with results from the field. The adaptation categories that recur the most in Global Environment Facility projects are enabling and relatively inexpensive measures, such as those related to capacity building, policy reform, and planning and management. However, a rich panoply of technical actions ranging from information and communications technology, to early warning systems, to new or improved infrastructure, are also identified as common project goals. Future refinements of the costs of various adaptation actions, the mixture of technical and management options, and evaluating the efficacy of actions implemented, will be key to informing the future global adaptation agenda.

The analysis focuses on the differences in planning procedures and planning mandates (determined by different plans in authority) before and after the launch of the Sponge City Plan which calls for numerous spatial resilience measures to address the increasing flood risk. The analysis reveals that the introduction of the Sponge City Plan has changed the role of planning from onlooker to active participant in the arena of flood governance. In addition, new plans combine long-term strategic visions, soft principles, and strict regulations with an aim to promote concrete planning practice between multiple layers with a clear mandate.

This paper examines India's Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and its effects on climate risk reduction. Although the MGNREGA was not designed specifically as a climate programme, it incorporates three key elements with the potential to advance pro-poor climate assistance objectives: (a) social protection through the provision of minimum wage labour; (b) the development of small-scale, natural resource-focused infrastructure; and (c) a decentralized, 'community-based' planning architecture. Analysis of a primary dataset comprising 1400 households and 798 projects in India's state Himachal Pradesh, interpreted through intensive qualitative fieldwork, shows that both projects and labour have helped vulnerable households confront climate and other risks, while the Act's decentralized architecture has expanded the channels for citizens to claim support for local challenges. The paper argues for the importance of building a broader 'ecosystem' of support to target diverse local needs, and of the need to strengthen the political architectures through which vulnerable groups access these benefits on the ground - especially in the context of decentralized approaches for climate assistance.","[Fischer, Harry W.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, POB 7012, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Fischer, Harry W.] Univ Melbourne, Australia India Inst, 147-149 Barry St, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Melbourne,"Fischer, HW (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, POB 7012, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.;Fischer, HW (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Australia India Inst, 147-149 Barry St, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia.",harry.fischer@slu.se,,"Fischer, Harry/0000-0001-7967-1154",,,,,73,9,9,2,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Dairy farming is highly dependent on local weather and climate. The case study is in Western Victoria, Australia, part of a major dairy farming region that contributes 26 per cent of national milk production and 86 per cent of the country's dairy exports. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This study utilised a survey and semi-structured interviews in Corangamite Shire, to document dairy farmers' perceptions of climate variability and the adaptation strategies they have implemented, compared to meteorological data collected on climate variability in the recent past. Findings - Farmers in this region perceive a change in rainfall and temperature broadly in line with meteorological records. Those that have experienced a greater degree of climate variability in drier regions were found to perceive it more accurately. Almost all respondents had already made changes to their dairy businesses, but in doing so only a small percentage were responding directly to seasonal variability or to longer term changes (9 and 15 per cent, respectively); the majority said they were responding to changing economic conditions in the industry. Originality/value - A primary survey of dairy farming adds to knowledge of how climate variability is perceived, and how it is adapted to in a region heavily reliant on rainfall for its prime economic activity.","[Elgin-Stuczynski, Iain R.] CBRE Agribusiness, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Batterbury, Simon] Univ Melbourne, Dept Resource Management & Geog, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Batterbury, S (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Resource Management & Geog, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia.",simonpjb@unimelb.edu.au,"Batterbury, Simon/H-3373-2019","Batterbury, Simon/0000-0002-2801-7483",,,,,58,4,4,2,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Due to its distinctive natural and man-made spatial features (e.g., coastal features, wadis, agricultural areas) studying changes in the mean climate and extreme events requires higher-resolution climate projections than those available from the current generation of Earth System Models. Here, a high-resolution convection-permitting regional climate model is used to downscale the middle of the 21st century (2041-2050) climate projections of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 and for a historical time period (2008-2017) focusing on two months (August and November) within KSA's dry-hot and wet seasons, where extreme events have historically been observed more frequently. Downscaling of climate reanalysis is also performed for the historical time period (2008-2017) to evaluate the downscaling methodology. An increase in the intensity and frequency of precipitation events is found in August by mid-century, particularly along the mountainous western coast of KSA, suggesting potential for water harvesting.

Flood defence engineering works are highly capital intensive and can be limited by land availability, leaving land and communities exposed to repeated flooding. Any adaptive drainage structure must have engineered inlets and outlets that control the water level and the rate of release. In Scotland, there are a relatively high number of drinking water reservoirs (operated by Scottish Water), which fall within this defined category and could contribute to flood management control. Reducing the rate of runoff from the upper reaches of a catchment will reduce the volume and peak flows of flood events downstream, thus allowing flood defences to be reduced in size, decreasing the corresponding capital costs. A database of retention basins with flood control potential has been developed for Scotland. The research shows that the majority of small and former drinking water reservoirs are kept full and their spillways are continuously in operation. Utilising some of the available capacity to contribute to flood control could reduce the costs of complying with the EU Flood Directive. Furthermore, the application of a previously developed classification model for Baden in Germany for the Scottish data set showed a lower diversity for basins in Scotland due to less developed infrastructure. The principle value of this approach is a clear and unambiguous categorisation, based on standard variables, which can help to promote communication and understanding between stakeholders.

This paper explores two issues: (1) indigenous strategies for preventing sea erosion and (2) the effects the modern coastal flood defence structures constructed along the southeastern coast of Ghana are having on the people. This study provides new insights into the understanding of indigenous methods that were used to address coastal flooding in the eastern section of Ghana and the effects the modern coastal defence structures are having on the people. Through multiphase sampling, a sample of 282 residents living in 17 communities affected by sea erosion in the Keta, Anloga, and Ada East District Assemblies where coastal defence structures were constructed were selected. Questionnaires were administered to these 282 respondents. Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were also held in three communities, namely Keta, Atorkor and Totepe where coastal defence structures were constructed. The planning officers of the 3 district assemblies, the chief fishermen in the 3 communities where the FGDs were held, leaders of salt winners and 3 elders in each community were the key informants. Using descriptive statistics, the study revealed that, indigenous strategies like filling the beach with sand, building away from the seashore, and raising the foundations of buildings were used to protect the houses and communities from sea erosion but these strategies are no longer working thereby forcing the government to construct 'modern' coastal flood defence wallson the coast. The 'modern' coastal defence structures are in some places protecting the people and the land since they no longer experience sea erosion on a large scale. However, in places where armour rocks are used to protect the land, people now see them as preventing them from enjoying the natural beach as they used to and as a hindrance to their livelihoods of fishing. It is recommended that, as far as possible, soft engineering strategies like beach nourishment or sand dunes which are in line with the indigenous methods be used since they can lead to easy adaptation for sustainability.","[Gbedemah, Shine Francis] Univ Environm & Sustainable Dev PMB, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Somanya, Ghana",,"Gbedemah, SF (corresponding author), Univ Environm & Sustainable Dev PMB, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Somanya, Ghana.",sfkgbedemah@gmail.com,,,,,,,81,0,0,0,0,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2662-9984,,DISCOV SUSTAIN,Discov.

Blue-green roofs are constructed as a means to reduce the runoff of stormwater from roofs and reduce the risk of urban flooding. However, compared to conventional roofs, blue-green roofs represent different construction and operation conditions, which may affect the long-term integrity of the roof. The purpose of this research is to understand the variety of perspectives on how different actors perceive and manage quality risks related to blue-green roofs-that is, the probabilities and consequences of defects. The quality risks of blue-green roofs have been investigated through document studies and interviews with actors in the Norwegian building sector. Data have been collected from actors across the building sector to map differences in how risk is managed from several perspectives. The findings show that actors view quality risk in very different ways. While building owners are primarily concerned with the quality of the finished product, the primary concern of other involved actors may be to ensure that eventual defects cannot be attributed to their own activities. The efforts of the various actors to reduce the risks in their own activities may not necessarily reduce the risk of defects in roofs. To ensure a more comprehensive management of quality risk in blue-green roofs, it is necessary to consider the perspectives and incentives of all involved actors. This way, a framework could be developed as a feasible tool in blue-green roof projects.","[Andenaes, Erlend; Engebo, Atle; Time, Berit; Lohne, Jardar; Torp, Olav; Kvande, Tore] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Andenaes, E (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",erlend.andenas@ntnu.no; atle.engebo@ntnu.no; berit.time@sintef.no; jardar.lohne@ntnu.no; olav.torp@ntnu.no; tore.kvande@ntnu.no,"Lohne, Jardar/HGA-4028-2022","Lohne, Jardar/0000-0002-2135-3468; Torp, Olav/0000-0002-1916-5097; Kvande, Tore/0000-0003-0522-9974; Time, Berit/0000-0002-3506-6494; Andenaes, Erlend/0000-0002-8732-0925",Research Council of Norway [237859],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"This research was funded by the Research Council of Norway, grant number 237859.",,66,3,3,5,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,OCT,2020,10,10,,,,,,,189,10.3390/buildings10100189,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings10100189,,,18,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,OJ8OZ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000584214600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper seeks to investigate the impact of climate change on farmers' productivity and their adaptive responses to these impacts.Methodology: One hundred and fifteen small-scale farmers were interviewed throughout Mauritius. A questionnaire was devised for this study and included both close-ended and open-ended questions.Findings: It was found that farmers have observed a net decrease in their crop yield over the past several years, mainly owing to changes in the quantum and pattern in precipitation, and resurgence of pests and diseases. Their only recourse to adapt to these was to increase the amount of pesticides and fertilizers in order to maintain their level of production. This survey finding was validated by a model.Practical implications: This study will enable extension officers to review the advice they normally give to farmers with a view to ensure that farmers respond to the climatic changes by adopting a more sustainable approach of using environmentally friendly measures such as application of organic amendments, non-chemical pest control, reduced fertilizers and pesticides, soil and water management.Theoretical implications: Promoting a shift toward an ecological way of farming will result in less reliance on chemicals and lowered GHG emissions.Originality/Value: The study depicted the weaknesses of the extension services to make farmers shift from their conventional practice toward a sustainable agriculture","[Ramborun, V.; Facknath, S.; Lalljee, B.] Univ Mauritius, Dept Agr & Food Sci, Reduit, Mauritius",University of Mauritius,"Ramborun, V (corresponding author), Univ Mauritius, Dept Agr & Food Sci, Reduit, Mauritius.",vagish.ramborun1@umail.uom.ac.mu,"Ramborun, Vagish/AAY-8889-2021","Ramborun, Vagish/0000-0001-8964-7078",,,,,93,9,10,11,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1389-224X,1750-8622,,J AGRIC EDUC EXT,J.

If so, does the observed influence have potential for more transformational adaptation? We inform these questions by reviewing and coding the first 50 NAPAs, prepared by the world's poorest nations with support from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We then apply categorical statistics and qualitative comparative analysis to test for stakeholder influence on the planning process and outcomes. We find little evidence that the composition of stakeholder participation influenced climate vulnerability analysis or adaptation planning in the NAPAs. Although the NAPAs were designed to be participatory and country-driven, they were constrained by limited budgets, prescribed guidelines from the UNFCCC, and the challenges of cultivating effective stakeholder participation. Key aspects of NAPAs even worked against generating transformational adaptation. Chief amongst these, risk exposure and sensitivity were emphasized over adaptive capacity in assessing vulnerability, and cost-effectiveness and synergies with existing development and environmental policies were priorities for selecting adaptation actions. These barriers to effective stakeholder engagement and transformational adaptation are timely reminders for those countries currently in the process of preparing their National Adaptation Plans to the UNFCCC.","[Holler, Joseph] Middlebury Coll, Dept Geog, 287 Bicentennial Way, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA; [Bernier, Quinn; Roberts, J.

The following study imparts a distinctive view of the performance-based effect of architectural and engineering design parameters on high-rise office buildings by exploiting the advantages of climatic features in different climate environments. Therewith, the study identifies and compares the major sensitive design parameters on the energy performance of high-rise buildings in different climate contexts. Furthermore, the most applicable passive strategies to attaining stipulated building sustainability criteria are established. The results indicate that the energy performance in a certain climate environment is highly sensitive to the design characteristics, such as plan ratio, core position and atrium effect. In a cold climate environment, a high-rise building with a rectangular building plan (plan ratio = 1:1.44, with vertical split-core in the absence of an atrium), satisfies the Passivhaus engineering criteria on air-tightness and fabric insulation; and adopts double-glass curtain walls, presented the best energy performance. Whereas, a square building plan (with vertical split-core and no atrium) that complies with the air-tightness and fabric insulation criteria under Passivhaus engineering standards, minimizes east-and west-bound window exposures, and adopts double-glass curtain walls exhibited the best energy performance in the hot climate zone. However, it requires renewable energy systems as an additional energy source to attain the stipulated building sustainability criteria.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In these spaces, traditional cultural practices and production converge with the periphery of global financial markets and systems of trade and production. These hybrid, nonconforming urban systems fall between regional policy agendas, requiring practitioners to embed urban considerations within broader regional platforms such as climate change. This paper demonstrates how these covert processes are used to advance urban justice at a settlement scale, both within and in resistance to city-level resilience frameworks and governance. In addition to a wider review of secondary data and Pacific urban literature the authors - non-Indigenous Pacific urban experts - draw upon empirical evidence from climate resilient development initiatives across the region. This includes case studies from the two Vanuatu municipalities of Luganville and Port Vila, and Honiara, the capital of Solomon Islands. Approaches for negotiating divergences between these functional systems of traditional and state justice within the urban domain are proposed, particularly in relation to disaster response and climate resilient development. Adaptation pathways are also presented, that draw upon decolonized visions of Pacific cities. These build upon observations of endogenous resilience in Pacific informal settlements; imaginaries centered upon quasi-customary urban governance, social structures, and ecosystem services.","[Trundle, Alexei] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Melbourne Ctr Cities, GO2,Baldwin Spencer Bldg 113,Masson Rd, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Trundle, A (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Melbourne Ctr Cities, GO2,Baldwin Spencer Bldg 113,Masson Rd, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",alexei.trundle@unimelb.edu.au,"Trundle, Alexei/D-5762-2018","Trundle, Alexei/0000-0002-7076-4626",,,,,108,2,2,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0272-3638,1938-2847,,URBAN GEOGR,Urban Geogr.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/02723638.2022.2143692,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2022.2143692,,NOV 2022,25,Geography; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography; Urban Studies,6D8KU,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000882934200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Accordingly, two configurations are developed that integrate a Rankine cycle (RC) and an ejector refrigeration cycle (ERC) for two purposes: power and cooling co-generation (CGS) and power generation (MGS). Water losses in both systems are studied considering three cold utilities and two fossil fuel cycles using the WExN analysis, and the performance of the CGS and the MGS are compared employing several organic fluids. The results showed that the MGS had greater energetic and exergetic efficiencies, better environmental performance, and less hazardous risk impacts compared to the CGS employing almost all working fluids.

Based on ethnographic interviews with farmers, employees and volunteers of food access organizations, and local government employees, our work found that connection, networking, innovation, and technology adoption were sources of strength and growth. Lessons: food system actors found that their social connections helped them to exchange information and resources, meet increased food needs among SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) participants and Latina/os immigrants, and combine efforts to adopt technologies and learn from new labor pools. Challenges: while navigating COVID-19, food system actors faced challenges spanning labor, safety, information, government policies, supply shortages, weather, and unreliable information. In addition to lessons and challenges, we offer a series of future research directions that we identified in our study findings. Our study shows that small-scale production and local food organization and government responses are important and dynamic parts of a resilient food system. Regional systems' actors were able to pivot more quickly than large-scale systems and presented a more flexible, locally suitable model that will likely prove adaptive beyond the pandemic.","[O'Connell, Caela; Gay, Rosemary; McDonald, Noreen; Tayal, Sita] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine,"O'Connell, C (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",caela@email.unc.edu,,"O'Connell, Caela/0000-0002-5114-8270",UNC Institute for Arts and Humanities and City and Regional Planning,UNC Institute for Arts and Humanities and City and Regional Planning,"We wish to thank the UNC Institute for Arts and Humanities and City and Regional Planning for research funding, our research participants for their generous sharing of time during the ongoing pandemic, Kristen Baughman of Curly Girl Farm in Zanesville, OH, the SECR Lab research team, the COVID-19 + Regional Food Systems Working Group collective, Laura-Anne Minkoff-Zern for assistance, our fellow contributors, and the wonderful CAFE editors.",,37,2,2,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2153-9553,2153-9561,,CULT AGRIC FOOD ENVI,Cult.

Then, three methods were used for impact differentiation: climatic elasticity, least-squares support-vector machine (LS-SVM), and the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). The results showed that climate change (38-67%) and human activities (33-62%) influence runoff reduction. Thus three management scenarios are introduced to reduce the effects of climate change and human activity: (1) adjusting wheat and barley cultivation levels; (2) maintaining wheat and barley cultivation levels and replacing other crops with potatoes; (3) increasing irrigation efficiency. All scenarios showed an increase in runoff, but the first scenario had the most impact.","[Jalali, Jamshid; Ahmadi, Azadeh] Isfahan Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Esfahan, Iran; [Ahmadi, Azadeh] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Civil Water & Environm Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Abbaspour, Karim] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Eawag, Dubendorf, Switzerland",Isfahan University of Technology; Shahid Beheshti University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG),"Ahmadi, A (corresponding author), Isfahan Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Esfahan, Iran.;Ahmadi, A (corresponding author), Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Civil Water & Environm Engn, Tehran, Iran.",aahmadi@cc.iut.ac.ir,"Ahmadi, Azadeh/ABC-7336-2020","Ahmadi, Azadeh/0000-0002-5248-0638",,,,,48,3,3,5,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0262-6667,2150-3435,,HYDROLOG SCI J,Hydrol.

Resilience assessment is an important tool in this context. Resilience is multidimensional as well as place-, scale- and time-specific, which requires a comprehensive approach for measuring and analysing. In this regard, composite indicators are preferred, and extensive literature is available on resilience indices on all spatial and temporal scales as well as hazard-specific or multi-hazard related indicators. However, transparent, robust, validated and transferable metrics are still missing from the scientific discourse. Hence, the research follows a novel composite index development approach: First, to develop and operationalise climate resilience on the county level in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany; second, to develop multiple composite indices in order to assess the impact of the construction methodology to increase transparency and decrease uncertainty; third, validating the index by statistical as well as empirical data and machine learning models - which is a novel endeavour so far. The results underscored that the two-step inclusive validation of data-driven statistical analysis in combination with empirical data proved to be essential in developing the index during the selection and aggregation of indicators. The results also highlighted a lower climate resilience of rural regions compared to metropolitan regions despite their better environmental status. Overall, machine learning proved to be essential in understanding and linking indicators and indices to policy, resilience and empirical data. The research contributes to a better understanding of climate resilience as well as to the methodological construction of composite indicators.","[Feldmeyer, Daniel; Jamshed, Ali; Birkmann, Joern] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Spatial & Reg Planning, Pfaffenwaldring 7, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Wilden, Daniela] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Geog, Senckenbergstr 1, D-35390 Giessen, Germany",University of Stuttgart; Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Feldmeyer, D (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Spatial & Reg Planning, Pfaffenwaldring 7, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",daniel.feldmeyer@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de; daniela.wilden@geogr.uni-giessen.de; Ali.jamshed@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de; Joern.birkmann@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Birkmann, Joern jb/J-5736-2015; Wilden, Daniela/AAR-2260-2021","Wilden, Daniela/0000-0001-6132-180X; Birkmann, Joern/0000-0001-8733-3964; Jamshed, Ali/0000-0003-4802-1225",,,,,68,16,17,6,33,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

This paper discusses guidelines and norms that promote the benefits of viewing green, living amongst green, and having easy access to green spaces for recreational use. Having trees and other vegetation in sight from one's home, place of work, or school has important mental health and performance benefits. Local tree canopy cover is positively associated with cooling and other aspects of climate moderation. With public green spaces in proximity to one's home stimulates regular use of these areas and results in positive impacts on mental, physical, and social health. After analyzing existing guidelines and rules for urban green space planning and provision, a new, comprehensive guideline is presented, known as the '3-30-300 rule' for urban forestry. This guideline aims to provide equitable access to trees and green spaces and their benefits by setting the thresholds of having at least 3 well-established trees in view from every home, school, and place of work, no less than a 30% tree canopy in every neighbourhood; and no more than 300 m to the nearest public green space from every residence.

During the last decade, many different design solutions, including those based on shape memory alloys, have been experimented to obtain appropriate responses without being dependent on electro-mechanically actuated systems. Several recent and ongoing studies have been published in the scientific literature regarding the different actuator typologies, as well as the different properties of the materials used, which usually determine the adaptive solution characteristics after a series of complex and time-consuming simulations using specialised dynamic modelling software. Due to the time and resources required, this kind of evaluation is usually delivered during the last and more advanced design stage as a form of assessment of already-taken architectural and technological choices. The study reported in the paper aims to offer a quick, time-saving simplified algorithm to calculate the response of an adaptive facade, according to the ISO 13790 standards, to be adopted during the early design stage to evaluate the possible effects of design decisions. The study includes three main steps: (a) the conceptualisation of the adaptive solution considering the context conditions; (b) the definition of the calculation algorithm; (c) the application of the method to a test room in a case study building located in Bologna for supporting the discussion of the related outcomes.","[Gaspari, Jacopo; Fabbri, Kristian] Univ Bologna, Dept Architecture, I-40136 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Fabbri, K (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dept Architecture, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.",kristian.fabbri@unibo.it,"Gaspari, Jacopo/AAC-5542-2019; Fabbri, Kristian/P-5585-2015","Gaspari, Jacopo/0000-0002-8361-2963; Fabbri, Kristian/0000-0003-0919-7455",,,,,82,0,0,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,NOV,2022,15,21,,,,,,,8168,10.3390/en15218168,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15218168,,,19,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,6B2YM,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000881204900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two urban districts, which differ from one another both in terms of urban planning and social structure, were compared, in particular, regarding the question of whether there was a fair distribution or procedural justice concerning the effects of subjective heat burden and influencing factors. Results The results showed that especially inhabitants of the urban area with predominantly prefabricated buildings, less green space and an increased proportion of socially disadvantaged felt more exposed to the summer heat and had fewer opportunities to adapt to the high temperature.

Practical experience and research results of recent years have showed that our actions to cover the gap between real situation and aims of climate agreements are not enough and that improvements in climate policy are needed, primarily in the energy sector. It is becoming increasingly clear that hydrocarbon resources, which production volume is increasing annually, will remain a significant part of the global fuel balance in the foreseeable future. Taking this into account, the main problem of the current climate policy is a limited portfolio of technologies, focused on replacement of hydrocarbon resources with renewable energy, without proper attention to an alternative ways of decreasing carbon intensity, such as carbon sequestration options. This study shows the need to review the existing climate policy portfolios through reorientation to CO2 utilization and disposal technologies and in terms of forming an appropriate appreciation for the role of hydrocarbon industries as the basis for the development of CO2-based production chains. In this paper we argue that: (1) focusing climate investments on a limited portfolio of energy technologies may become a trap that keeps us from achieving global emissions goals; (2) accounting for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions losses, without taking into account the potential social effects of utilization, is a barrier to diversifying climate strategies; (3) with regard to hydrocarbon industries, a transition from destructive to creative measures aimed at implementing environmental projects is needed; (4) there are no cheap climate solutions, but the present cost of reducing CO2 emissions exceeds any estimate of the social cost of carbon.","[Tcvetkov, Pavel] St Petersburg Min Univ, Dept Econ Org & Management, 21 Line,2, St Petersburg 199106, Russia",Saint Petersburg Mining University,"Tcvetkov, P (corresponding author), St Petersburg Min Univ, Dept Econ Org & Management, 21 Line,2, St Petersburg 199106, Russia.",pscvetkov@yandex.ru,"Tcvetkov, Pavel/A-3106-2016","Tcvetkov, Pavel/0000-0002-3049-7893",Russian Science Foundation [18-18-00210]; Saint Petersburg Mining University; Russian Science Foundation [18-18-00210] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation,Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); Saint Petersburg Mining University; Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),"The research is carried out with the financial support of the grant of the Russian Science Foundation (Project No. 18-18-00210, Development of assessment methodology of public efficiency of projects devoted to carbon dioxide sequestration).

Urban surface water flooding is one of the most worrisome issues, due to their negative impacts on public health. Green infrastructure has developed as an alternative approach to cope with urban surface water flooding. The runoff reduction capacity of green infrastructure needs to be elucidated to better support green infrastructure planning. There are some models to assess the runoff reduction capacity of the landscape. However, these models do not consider landscape patterns and usually need large time, data, making it less accessible to urban planners and decision-makers. A group of studies have indicated that landscape structures are significantly affecting the surface runoff. Therefore, an empirical model was adapted in this study, including two parameters of runoff coefficient and landscape metrics, to map the runoff reduction capacity of green infrastructure in the city of Ghent. The results show that grasslands contribute most to stormwater runoff reduction of 118.3 million and forests controlled the lowest runoff of 44.8 million . Agriculture lands with the highest reduction amount per square kilometer of 3.51 million /, and Forests with the lowest of 1.92 million /. The spatial distribution of runoff reduction capacity of green infrastructure indicates the high capacity green infrastructure is mainly concentrated in the southwest and northeast suburban areas. The core areas scattered with less green infrastructure and low runoff reduction capacity.

Accordingly, darker, intermediate and lighter phenotypes of body melanization were analyzed in wild and laboratory reared Drosophila melanogaster L. ( Diptera: Clyclorrapha) populations from highland and lowland sites located in close proximity at five different latitudinal locations (11.15 degrees N to 31.06 degrees N) within the Indian subcontinent. In large population samples, occurrence of significant within population variability made it possible to assort non-overlapping phenotypes of body coloration (i.e. lighter (<25%), intermediate (30 to 40%) and darker (>45%)) for all the populations which were further investigated for desiccation resistance and rate of water loss/hr. Significantly, higher desiccation resistance but much reduced rate of water loss/hr were observed in darker and intermediate phenotypes in all the populations. By contrast, lighter phenotypes exhibited lower desiccation tolerance but higher rate of water loss/hr. A regression analysis between traits provided similar slope values for wild and laboratory populations. For all three physiological traits, predicted trait values from multiple regression analysis as a simultaneous function of annual average temperature and relative humidity, matched the observed values. We infer that parallel changes in melanization and desiccation resistance may result from decreasing annual average temperature and relative humidity along increasing latitude as well as altitude on the Indian subcontinent.","[Parkash, Ravi; Rajpurohit, Subhash; Ramniwas, Seema] Maharshi Dayanand Univ, Dept Biochem & Genet, Rohtak 124001, Haryana, India",Maharshi Dayanand University,"Rajpurohit, S (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Sch Life Sci, 4505 Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",srmailbox@rediffmail.com,"RAJPUROHIT, SUBHASH/D-7499-2011; Rajpurohit, Subhash/O-9912-2018","Rajpurohit, Subhash/0000-0001-9149-391X; Parkash, Ravi/0000-0001-9880-3941; Ramniwas, Seema/0000-0002-4899-4687",,,,,30,22,23,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1536-2442,2250-2645,,J INSECT SCI,J Insect Sci.,JUL 8,2009,9,,,,,,,,49,,,,,10,Entomology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Entomology,468GL,20050769,"Green Published, Green Accepted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000267804900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We examine policy players' perceptions of climate science alongside prevailing political influences on evidence-based policy making. In Queensland, the evidence-based mandate has been weakened by partisan politics so that the political acceptability of evidence is a foremost concern for policy makers. In the UK, the evidence-based mandate is enshrined in the Climate Change Act (2008), yet here too political forces have sought to limit the acceptable use of climate science for policy making. Both cases reveal normative and political tensions in the interpretation and use of climate science, suggesting that important political challenges must be overcome by the scientific community to ensure the ongoing utility of climate science for policy making.","[Tangney, Peter] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, 170 Kessels Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; Griffith Univ, Urban Res Program, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University,"Tangney, P (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, 170 Kessels Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",pntangney@gmail.com,"Tangney, Peter/O-2153-2015","Tangney, Peter/0000-0003-3878-4034",Australian Government International Postgraduate Research Scholarship; Griffith University's School of Environment,Australian Government International Postgraduate Research Scholarship(Australian Government); Griffith University's School of Environment,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Peter Tangney was funded by an Australian Government International Postgraduate Research Scholarship and by Griffith University's School of Environment during the research and authorship of this article.",,84,20,20,2,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0263-774X,1472-3425,,ENVIRON PLANN C,Environ.

This study uses a top-down, end-to-end approach consisting of dynamical downscaling, a novel bias-correction technique, and custom-developed decision-aid tools to assess regional climate changes in the Southwest and to derive decision aids that are based on direct communication with the planners at four military installations in the region. Dynamical downscaling is performed with the Weather Research and Forecasting model driven by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalysis and the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology's ECHAM5 general circulation model for two time periods: current (2000s) and future (2030s). A unique two-stage bias correction is developed to adjust current and future hourly temperature and precipitation to be consistent with historical reference data. The authors' assessment of regional climate change, which is based on downscaled bias-corrected fields, points to a dryer and warmer future climate in the Southwest. The energy-usage modeling produced a statistically significant increase in natural gas consumption and a possible decrease in electricity usage in two military installations in Colorado, which is a direct consequence of decrease/increase in heating/cooling degree-days resulting from warmer temperatures in the future. In addition, the results indicate an increasing number of oppressive heat days in the future, which may impact long-term planning practices with respect to heat-stress control and heat-casualty management.","[Darmenova, Kremena; Apling, Duane; Higgins, Glenn; Hayes, Philip; Kiley, Heather] Northrop Grumman Informat Syst, Environm & Energy Dept, Chantilly, VA 20151 USA",Northrop Grumman Corporation,"Darmenova, K (corresponding author), Northrop Grumman Informat Syst, Environm & Energy Dept, 15010 Conf Ctr Dr, Chantilly, VA 20151 USA.",kremena.darmenova@ngc.com,,,Northrop Grumman Information Systems Energy and Environment Initiative,Northrop Grumman Information Systems Energy and Environment Initiative,This work was funded by the Northrop Grumman Information Systems Energy and Environment Initiative.

In hot, arid regions, the passive design traditional architecture is known for its ability to provide comfortable indoor environments and outdoor shaded areas, in contrast to the use of energy-intensive air conditioners in a great deal of modern architecture. Thus, this research used a qualitative methodology based on ENVI-met software to study, investigate, and compare the thermal performance of two urban fabrics as case studies (traditional and modern districts) in the hot, arid climate of the United Arab Emirates. The thermal performance of the old urban districts was better than the new ones, with a lower maximum potential air temperature and an improvement in the level of thermal comfort, measured by a predicted mean vote. Moreover, it was found that enhancing the shade in the outdoor open areas in the modern district, mimicking the traditional passive design solutions, resulted in lower air temperature and PMVs.

Frequent fire in some vegetation types can lead to transformational change beyond which the vegetation type is radically altered. Such feedbacks limit our ability to project fuel loads under future climatic conditions or to consider the ecological tradeoffs associated with management burns. We present a  pathway modelling approach to consider multiple transitional pathways that may occur under different fire frequencies. The model combines spatial layers representing current and future fire danger, biomass, flammability, and sensitivity to fire to assess potential future fire activity. The layers are derived from a dynamically downscaled regional climate model, attributes from a regional vegetation map, and information about fuel characteristics. Fire frequency is demonstrated to be an important factor influencing flammability and availability to burn and therefore an important determinant of future fire activity. Regional shifts in vegetation type occur in response to frequent fire, as the rate of change differs across vegetation type. Fire-sensitive vegetation types move towards drier, more fire-adapted vegetation quickly, as they may be irreversibly impacted by even a single fire, and require very long recovery times. Understanding the interaction between climate change and fire is important to identify appropriate management regimes to sustain fire-sensitive communities and maintain the distribution of broad vegetation types across the landscape.","[Harris, Rebecca Mary Bernadette; Remenyi, Tomas; Love, Peter; Bindoff, Nathaniel L.] Univ Tasmania, Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr ACE, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Fox-Hughes, Paul] Bur Meteorol, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Bindoff, Nathaniel L.] Univ Tasmania, IMAS, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Bindoff, Nathaniel L.] Univ Tasmania, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Bindoff, Nathaniel L.] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org CSIRO Marine & Ato, CAWCR, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",Antarctic Climate & Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre (ACE CRC); University of Tasmania; Bureau of Meteorology - Australia; University of Tasmania; ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science; University of Tasmania; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Harris, RMB (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr ACE, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",rmharris@utas.edu.au; tom.remenyi@utas.edu.au; paul.fox-hughes@bom.gov.au; p.t.love@utas.edu.au; N.Bindoff@utas.edu.au,"Love, Peter/O-6421-2017; Bindoff, Nathaniel L/C-8050-2011; Harris, Rebecca/N-2790-2013","Love, Peter/0000-0001-7840-0467; Bindoff, Nathaniel L/0000-0001-5662-9519; Harris, Rebecca/0000-0002-6426-2179; Remenyi, Tomas/0000-0002-4145-9323",National Bushfire Mitigation-Tasmanian Grants Program (NBMP); Humboldt Research Fellowship,National Bushfire Mitigation-Tasmanian Grants Program (NBMP); Humboldt Research Fellowship(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),"This work was funded by the National Bushfire Mitigation-Tasmanian Grants Program (NBMP).

Depending on the availability of data and the geographic scale of the analysis, different methodologies can be adopted. Here, we show a complete open source GIS-based methodology based on satellite-driven data for investigating and mapping the impact of the UHI on the heat-related elderly risk (HERI) in the Functional Urban Area of Padua. Thermal anomalies in the territory were mapped by modelling satellite data from Sentinel-3. After a socio-demographic analysis, the HERI was mapped according to five levels of risk. The highest vulnerability levels were localised within the urban area and in three municipalities near Padua, which represent about 20% of the entire territory investigated. In these municipalities, a percentage of elderly people over 20%, a thermal anomaly over 2.4 degrees C, and a HERI over 0.65 were found. Based on these outputs, it is possible to define nature-based solutions for reducing the UHI phenomenon and promote a sustainable development of cities.

Here we focus on how climate awareness might be better incorporated into planning and decision-making in the electric power sector. To do so, we consider lessons from decision science literature where researchers have specifically focused on how to make better decisions under uncertainty. We perform a three-part review: of decision science literature on best practices for decision-making under uncertainty, of industry practice documents to understand how new uncertainties may affect the types of decisions electric utilities are making today, and of literature on electricity sector planning under climate change to assess how lessons from decision science might fit into sector-specific analyses. We discuss how characterizations of uncertainty from the decision science literature might guide approaches in the electricity sector to appropriately capture climate-related uncertainties. We also distill three key ideas from the decision science literature that can be incorporated into electricity sector planning to manage these new uncertainties: robustness, adaptive planning, and multi-stakeholder engagement. We offer example recommendations for how these key ideas might be incorporated into one essential type of planning activity, capacity expansion.","[Brockway, Anna M.; Wang, Liyang; Callaway, Duncan; Jones, Andrew] Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Brockway, Anna M.; Callaway, Duncan] Univ Calif Berkeley, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Liyang; Jones, Andrew] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA USA; [Dunn, Laurel N.] Ping Things, Sacramento, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Brockway, AM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Brockway, AM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",anna.brockway@berkeley.edu,"Jones, Andrew/AHH-1227-2022; Jones, Andrew D/M-4363-2013","Jones, Andrew/0000-0002-1913-7870; Jones, Andrew D/0000-0002-1913-7870; Wang, Liyang/0000-0003-1426-5010; Brockway, Anna/0000-0002-5167-7594; Callaway, Duncan/0000-0003-3316-9008","Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Climate and Environmental Science Division, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231, DE-SC0016605]; HyperFACETS Project, 'A framework for improving analysis and modeling of Earth system and intersectoral dynamics at regional scales' [DE-SC0016605]; Berkeley Research Impact Initiative (BRII) - UC Berkeley Library","Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Climate and Environmental Science Division, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); HyperFACETS Project, 'A framework for improving analysis and modeling of Earth system and intersectoral dynamics at regional scales'; Berkeley Research Impact Initiative (BRII) - UC Berkeley Library","We are grateful for helpful comments from Jill Moraski, Nichole Hanus, Emma Tome, and David Anthoff.

Apart from its effects on economies, education systems and societies, the pandemic has also influenced climate change research. This paper examines the extent to which COVID-19 has influenced climate change research worldwide during the first wave at the beginning of 2020 and how it is perceived to exploit it in the future. This study utilised an international survey involving those dedicated to climate change science and management research from Academia, Government, NGOs, and international agencies in 83 countries. The analysis of responses encompasses four independent variables: Institutions, Regions, Scientific Areas, and the level of economic development represented by the Human Development Index (HDI). Results show that: (1) COVID-19 modified the way the surveyed researchers work, (2) there are indicators that COVID-19 has already influenced the direction of climate change and adaptation policy implementation, and (3) respondents perceived (explicitly concerning the COVID-19 lockdowns of March-April 2020), that the pandemic has drawn attention away from climate policy. COVID- 19 has influenced the agenda of climate change research for more than half of the respondents and is likely to continue in the future, suggesting that the impacts on their research will still be felt for many years. The paper concludes by outlining critical implications for policy-making.","[Filho, Walter Leal] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Res & Transfer Ctr Sustainable Dev & Climate Chan, Ulmenliet 20, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany; [Wall, Tony] Univ Chester, Int Ctr Thriving, Chester, Cheshire, England; [AlVES, Fatima] Univ Aberta, Rua Anim 752, P-4200055 Porto, Portugal; [AlVES, Fatima] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Funct Ecol Sci People & Planet, Rua Anim 752, P-4200055 Porto, Portugal; [Nagy, Gustavo J.] Univ Republ FC UdelaR, Fac Ciencias, IECA, Montevideo 4225, Uruguay; [Carril, Luis Ricardo Fernandez] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Humanities & Educ, Campus Puebla,Atlixcayotl 5718, Puebla 72453, Pue, Mexico; [Li, Chunlan] East China Normal Univ, Ctr Geopolit & Strateg Studies, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Li, Chunlan] East China Normal Univ, Inst Global Innovat & Dev, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Li, Chunlan] East China Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Mucova, Serafino] Lurio Univ, Fac Nat Sci, POB 958, Pemba, Mozambique; [Mucova, Serafino; Azeiteiro, Ulisses M.] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Aveiro, Portugal; [Mucova, Serafino; Azeiteiro, Ulisses M.] Univ Aveiro, CESAM Ctr Environm & Marine Studies, Aveiro, Portugal; [Joost, Johannes Platje] WSB Univ Wroclaw, Ul Fabryczna 29-31, PL-53609 Wroclaw, Poland; [Rayman-Bacchus, Lez] Univ Winchester, Business Sch, Winchester SO22 5HT, Hants, England; [Totin, Edmond] Univ Natl Agr, Ecole Foresterie Trop, BP 43, Ketou, Benin; [Ayal, Desalegn Y.] Addis Ababa Univ, Ctr Food Secur Studies, Coll Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Lutz, Johannes M.] CHC Higher Educ, Sch Social Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4152, Australia; [Lutz, Johannes M.] Univ New South Wales UNSW, Sch Social Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Lutz, Johannes M.] Univ Sunshine Coast USC, Sch Law & Soc, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia; [Vinuesa, Antonio Garcia] Univ Santiago de Compostela, SEPA Interea, Social Pedag & Environm Educ Res Grp, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Minhas, Aprajita] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Res & Transfer Ctr Sustainable Dev & Climate Chan, Ulmenliet 20, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany; [Filho, Walter Leal] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Chester St, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England","Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg; University of Chester; Universidade Aberta; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Tecnologico de Monterrey; East China Normal University; East China Normal University; East China Normal University; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro; University of Winchester; Addis Ababa University; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of the Sunshine Coast; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg; Manchester Metropolitan University","Nagy, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Republ FC UdelaR, Fac Ciencias, IECA, Montevideo 4225, Uruguay.",walter.leal2@haw-hamburg.de; t.wall@chester.ac.uk; fatimaa@uab.pt; gnagy@fcien.edu.uy; lfernandezcarril@tec.mx; 15598022233@163.com; serafinomucova@ua.pt; johannes.platje@wsb.wroclaw.pl; lezmichael@gmail.com; edmond.totin@gmail.com; desalula@gmail.com; jluetz@chc.edu.au; ulisses@ua.pt; a.garcia.vinuesa@usc.es; Aprajita.Minhas@haw-hamburg.de,"Azeiteiro, Ulisses Manuel de Miranda/C-5933-2008; Leal, Walter/AAU-6997-2021; Platje, Johannes/AAX-8860-2020; Luetz, Johannes M./AAH-5131-2019; Alves, Fatima/P-2895-2019; Leal, Walter/ACX-9082-2022; Garcia-Vinuesa, Antonio/AAI-2922-2020; nagy, gustavo/G-8097-2017","Azeiteiro, Ulisses Manuel de Miranda/0000-0002-5252-1700; Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Platje, Johannes/0000-0002-6274-1467; Luetz, Johannes M./0000-0002-9017-4471; Alves, Fatima/0000-0003-2600-8652; Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Garcia-Vinuesa, Antonio/0000-0003-3969-4647; nagy, gustavo/0000-0002-8296-4465; Wall, Tony/0000-0003-2334-3279; Totin, Edmond/0000-0003-3377-6190; Fernandez Carril, Luis/0000-0002-2078-4362",,,,,46,3,3,2,23,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

This study aims to analyze the heatwave vulnerability of the 23 districts of the Hungarian capital, Budapest, by applying a weighted indicator method. For this purpose, 12 indicators were collected, normalized, and finally categorized to reveal spatial heterogeneity through the selected administration units. Socio-economic variables and remote sensing data have also been involved in the study in order to point out as many aspects as possible. Generally, downtown districts have medium vulnerability due to their increased land surface temperature, higher population density and low yearly income per capita. In the case of both Pest-, and Buda-side outer districts, higher NDVI values pose them at the top of the ranking. At the same time, considerable differences can be found regarding other sensitivity and adaptive capacity values. The high ratio of elderly people with cardiovascular disease and the low number of pharmacies per 1000 people were identified as common weak points in the case of almost every district. The revealed weak points may contribute to defining those aspects where urgent and targeted adaptation actions are needed.","[Buzasi, Attila] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Environm Econ & Sustainabil, Muegyet Rkp 3, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Buzasi, A (corresponding author), Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Environm Econ & Sustainabil, Muegyet Rkp 3, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary.",buzasi.attila@gtk.bme.hu,"Buzási, Attila/AAG-1339-2020","Buzási, Attila/0000-0002-4088-9276","Ministry of Innovation and Technology of Hungary from the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund [137595];  [FK_21]","Ministry of Innovation and Technology of Hungary from the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund; ","Project no. 137595 has been implemented with the support provided by the Ministry of Innovation and Technology of Hungary from the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund, financed under the FK_21 funding scheme.",,102,2,2,6,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,MAR,2022,42,,,,,,,,101127,10.1016/j.uclim.2022.101127,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2022.101127,,FEB 2022,17,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,0J2DH,,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000779915700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adaptation requires addressing immediate conservation threats while also attending to long term, highly uncertain and potentially transformative future changes. To date, conservation research has focused more on projecting climate impacts and identifying possible strategies, rather than understanding how governance enables or constrains adaptation actions. We outline an approach to future-oriented conservation that combines the capacities to anticipate future ecological change; to understand the implications of that change for social, political and ecological values; and the ability to engage with the governance (and politics) of adaptation. Our approach builds on the adaptive management and governance literature, however we explicitly address the (often contested) rules, knowledge and values that enable or constrain adaptation. We call for a broader focus that extends beyond technical approaches to acknowledge the socio-political challenges inherent to adaptation. More importantly, we suggest that conservation policy makers and practitioners can use this approach to facilitate learning and adaptation in the context of complexity, transformational change and uncertainty.","[Wyborn, Carina] WWF Int, Luc Hoffmann Inst, Ave Mt Blanc, CH-1296 Gland, Switzerland; [van Kerkhoff, Lorrae] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, ANU Coll Med Biol & Environm, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Dunlop, Michael] CSIRO, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Dudley, Nigel] Equilibrium Res, 47 Quays Cumberland Rd, Bristol BS1 6UQ, Avon, England; [Dudley, Nigel] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Guevara, Oscar] WWF Colombia, Carrera 35 4a-24, Cali, Colombia",World Wildlife Fund; Australian National University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Queensland,"Wyborn, C (corresponding author), WWF Int, Luc Hoffmann Inst, Ave Mt Blanc, CH-1296 Gland, Switzerland.",cwyborn@wwfint.org,"van Kerkhoff, Lorrae/AAF-2275-2020; Wyborn, Carina/AAU-4818-2021","van Kerkhoff, Lorrae/0000-0003-0247-1511; Wyborn, Carina/0000-0002-4314-347X; Dunlop, Michael/0000-0001-8032-9196",,,,,46,40,40,4,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,1572-9710,,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

Of importance are emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) nitrogen oxides (NO.), aerosols and their precursors (soot and sulphate), and increased cloudiness in the form of persistent linear contrails and induced-cirrus cloudiness. The recent Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) quantified aviation's RF contribution for 2005 based upon 2000 operations data. Aviation has grown strongly over the past years, despite world-changing events in the early 2000s; the average annual passenger traffic growth rate was 5.3% yr(-1) between 2000 and 2007, resulting in an increase of passenger traffic of 38%. Presented here are updated values of aviation RF for 2005 based upon new operations data that show an increase in traffic of 22.5%, fuel use of 8.4% and total aviation RF of 14% (excluding induced-cirrus enhancement) over the period 2000-2005. The lack of physical process models and adequate observational data for aviation-induced cirrus effects limit confidence in quantifying their RF contribution. Total aviation RF (excluding induced cirrus) in 2005 was similar to 55 mW m(-2) (23-87 mW m(-2), 90% likelihood range), which was 3.5% (range 1.3-10%. 90% likelihood range) of total anthropogenic forcing. Including estimates for aviation-induced cirrus RF increases the total aviation RF in 2005-78 mW m(-2) (38-139 mW m(-2), 90% likelihood range), which represents 4.9% of total anthropogenic forcing (2-14%, 90% likelihood range). Future scenarios of aviation emissions for 2050 that are consistent with IPCC SIZES A1 and B2 scenario assumptions have been presented that show an increase of fuel usage by factors of 2.7-3.9 over 2000. Simplified calculations of total aviation RF in 2050 indicate increases by factors of 3.0-4.0 over the 2000 value, representing 4-4.7% of total RF (excluding induced cirrus). An examination of a range of future technological options shows that substantive reductions in aviation fuel usage are possible only with the introduction of radical technologies. Incorporation of aviation into an emissions trading system offers the potential for overall (i.e., beyond the aviation sector) CO2 emissions reductions. Proposals exist for introduction of such a system at a European level, but no agreement has been reached at a global level. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This region exhibits the most conspicuous manifestations of climate change. The study sites were selected to represent different elevation zones. A total of 108 indicators for the sectors were chosen to assess climate vulnerability as a methodological framework suitable for a mountain perspective. The net climate vulnerability in the agriculture sector was lowest in blocks that had greater accessibility to the road network, were nearer to markets, had high literacy and more institutions, and were shifting to enterprises other than agriculture. The net vulnerability index (VI) for horticulture revealed that vulnerability was reduced by a shift toward off-season vegetable cultivation, productive soils for crops, and the establishment of new orchards. The net VI of the livestock sector was lower if there were fewer diseases and pests and they were quickly managed, if there was good access to veterinary facilities, if slopes were less steep, and if improved grassland was available. The composite net VI of all blocks in different sectors of this farming system revealed that the Naggar block, followed by Kullu and Nirmand, was the least vulnerable.","[Rana, Ranbir Singh; Kalia, Vaibhav; Singh, Sharda] Chaudhary Sarwan Kumar Himachal Pradesh Krishi Vi, Ctr Geoinformat Res & Training, Palampur 176062, Himachal Prades, India; [Randhawa, S.

This paper answers two questions. First, how do heat risk measures vary by housing type and location in San Jose, California? Second, what housing and neighborhood factors are associated with greater heat risk? We first create a parcel dataset with housing, heat risk, and neighborhood characteristics. We then use a combination of descriptive statistics, exploratory mapping, and linear regression models to analyze associations between housing, neighborhoods, and heat risk. The results indicate that households of different housing types face varying degrees of heat risk, and the largest disparities are between detached single-family (lowest heat risk) and multifamily rental (highest heat risk). Air conditioning availability is a major contributing factor: the probability of not having central air conditioning is much lower for detached single-family (44.9%) compared with multifamily rental (73.7%). There are also heat risk disparities for households in neighborhoods with larger proportions of Hispanic and Asian residents. This research demonstrates the need to understand heat risk at the parcel scale and suggests to policymakers the importance of heat mitigation strategies that focus on multifamily rental housing and communities of color.","[Gabbe, C.

This paper draws on data from a qualitative climate change study with Australian Aboriginal people in the remote semi-arid region of Northwest Queensland and other regional studies to explore ways that yards can enhance thermal performance around conventional housing. Our investigations demonstrate that despite evidence of appropriate housing designs, living spaces outside of the house continue to be overlooked and under-utilised. Aboriginal people have modified their behaviour and made changes to their external living environments, often without sufficient resources, to achieve social and cultural continuity, energy efficiency and particularly to enhance thermal comfort. For these reasons, yards demand greater attention in the policy, planning and provision of housing and associated services for Aboriginal people.","[O'Rourke, Timothy] Univ Queensland, Sch Architecture, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Nash, Daphne] Univ Queensland, Sch Architecture, Aboriginal Environm Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"O'Rourke, T (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Architecture, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",t.orourke@uq.edu.au,,"O'Rourke, Timothy/0000-0002-6598-5045",National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF) under the Climate Change Adaptation Research Grants Program (ARGP) 2011 [IC1104],National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF) under the Climate Change Adaptation Research Grants Program (ARGP) 2011,Data used in this paper draws on a research project funded by the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF) under the Climate Change Adaptation Research Grants Program (ARGP) 2011 (Project Number IC1104).

While riverine communities in the region rely upon a variety of adaptation strategies to live with these destructive floods, climate change is expected to further exacerbate this challenge, as melting Himalayan glaciers and changes in the South Asian monsoon lead to an increase in the frequency of severe floods. At the same time, a multitude of new dams are under construction in the Brahmaputra river basin, to meet India's growing energy demands. Though these dams could provide flood protection for downstream communities, political and economic factors have led dam-builders to prioritize hydroelectricity generation over flood control. Furthermore, hydroelectricity generated along the Brahmaputra is evacuated to distant urban centers, while rural dwellers in Northeast India suffer from high levels of energy poverty. Using the Ranganadi Hydroelectric Project in Arunachal Pradesh as a case study, this paper examines how, by changing the flood regime and undermining current adaptive strategies, large dams along the Brahmaputra are testing the capacity of downstream communities to live with summer floods. This work highlights the ways in which poor and vulnerable communities in Northeast India are forced to bear the costs of both climate change impacts and decarbonization efforts.","[Rampini, Costanza] San Jose State Univ, San Jose, CA 95192 USA",California State University System; San Jose State University,"Rampini, C (corresponding author), San Jose State Univ, Dept Environm Studies, One Washington Sq, San Jose, CA 95192 USA.",costanza.rampini@sjsu.edu,,"Rampini, Costanza/0000-0002-8060-4386","United States Environmental Protection Agency Science to Achieve Results [FP 91724201]; University of California, Santa Cruz","United States Environmental Protection Agency Science to Achieve Results; University of California, Santa Cruz(University of California System)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency Science to Achieve Results (FP 91724201), and by the University of California, Santa Cruz.",,146,2,2,3,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2514-8486,2514-8494,,ENVIRON PLAN E-NAT,Environ.

Regional authorities play an important role in adaptation, but they have few binding guidelines to carry out strategies and plans. Sectoral impacts and adaptive measures strongly differ between regions; therefore, specific results for each territory are needed. Impacts are often not exhaustively reported by literature, dataset and models, thus making it impossible to objectively identify specific adaptive measures. Usual expert elicitation helps to fill this gap but shows some issues. For the Piedmont Strategy, an innovative approach has been proposed, involving experts of private and public bodies (regional authorities, academia, research institutes, parks, associations, NGOs, etc.). They collaborated in two work group, first to identify current and future impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, and secondly to elaborate and prioritize measures. Involving 143 experts of 46 affiliations, it was possible to quickly edit a cross-validated list of impacts (110) and measures (92) with limited costs. Lastly, a public return of results took place. This approach proved to be effective, efficient and influenced the policymakers, overcoming the tendency to enact long-term actions to face climate change. It could be used internationally by subnational authorities also in other sectors.","[Pollo, Alessandra; Piccini, Irene; Gili, Fabrizio; Alba, Riccardo; Siniscalco, Consolata; Bonelli, Simona] Univ Turin, Dept Life Sci & Syst Biol DBIOS, I-10123 Turin, Italy; [Chiara, Jacopo; Porro, Elena; Chiantore, Daniela; Malenotti, Elisa; Garazzino, Agostina] Reg Piemonte, I-10122 Turin, Italy; [Barbi, Andrea] Univ Ghent, Dept Pathobiol Pharmacol & Zool Med, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium; [Bogliani, Giuseppe] Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Bagliani, Marco] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, I-10153 Turin, Italy; [Doretto, Alberto] Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Sustainable Dev & Ecol Transit DiSSTE, I-13100 Vercelli, Italy; [Ruffino, Carlo] Univ Sassari, Dept Vet Med, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Pelosini, Renata] Agenzia Reg Protez Ambientale ARPA Piemonte, I-10135 Turin, Italy",University of Turin; Ghent University; University of Pavia; University of Turin; University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro; University of Sassari; Regional Environmental Protection Agency - Italy,"Pollo, A (corresponding author), Univ Turin, Dept Life Sci & Syst Biol DBIOS, I-10123 Turin, Italy.",alessandra.pollo@unito.it; irene.piccini@unito.it; jacopo.chiara@regione.piemonte.it; elena.porro@regione.piemonte.it; daniela.chiantore@regione.piemonte.it; fabrizio.gili@unito.it; riccardo.alba@unito.it; andrea.barbi@ugent.be; giuseppe.bogliani@unipv.it; marco.bagliani@unito.it; alberto.doretto@uniupo.it; c.ruffino@studenti.uniss.it; elisa.malenotti@regione.piemonte.it; agostina.garazzino@regione.piemonte.it; r.pelosini@arpa.piemonte.it; consolata.siniscalco@unito.it; simona.bonelli@unito.it,"Alba, Riccardo/AAL-2746-2020","Alba, Riccardo/0000-0002-7548-8173; Gili, Fabrizio/0000-0002-1817-0193; Piccini, Irene/0000-0001-8468-2587; Pollo, Alessandra/0000-0002-4443-1991; Bogliani, Giuseppe/0000-0001-9066-6540; DORETTO, ALBERTO/0000-0002-4105-473X",Fondazione Giovanni Goria; Fondazione CRT,Fondazione Giovanni Goria; Fondazione CRT(Fondazione CRT),"This research was funded by Fondazione Giovanni Goria and Fondazione CRT thanks to the scholarship of the project Talenti della Societa Civile.

Local stakeholders have developed various measures for coping with flooding impacts according to past experience. These adaptive measures not only involve managing the impact of heavy rainfall but also resisting the disastrous effects of land subsidence. However, in 2009, Typhoon Morakot caused multiple days of intense rainfall and nearly rendered ineffective the adaptive measures employed to prevent damage. Stakeholders adopt diverse measures according to different needs and vulnerabilities. Consequently, some adaptive measures are likely to cause an increase in the vulnerability of different sectors and induce additional socioeconomic impacts. This paper presents the results of a semistructured questionnaire and field survey conducted for analyzing the adaptive measures adopted by local stakeholders before and after Typhoon Morakot. According to the routes and pathways of maladaptation in the Jiadung coastal area, this study analyzed the main adaptive measures and functions as well as identified the entities affected by maladaptation.

Recent studies have designed policies with structures linking infrastructure and management actions to threshold values of indicator variables observed over time. Typically, one or more of these components are held fixed while the others are optimized, constraining the flexibility of policy generation. Here we develop a framework to address this challenge by designing and testing dynamic adaptation policies that combine indicators, actions, and thresholds in a flexible structure. The approach is demonstrated for a case study of northern California, where a mix of infrastructure, management, and operational adaptations are considered over time in response to an ensemble of nonstationary hydrology and water demands. We first identify a subset of non-dominated policies that are robust to held-out scenarios, and then analyze their most common actions and indicators compared to non-robust policies. Results show that the robust policies are not differentiated by the actions they select, but show substantial differences in their indicator variables, which can be interpreted in the context of physical hydrologic trends. In particular, the most frequent statistical transformations of indicator variables highlight the balance between adapting quickly versus correctly. Additionally, we determine the indicators most frequently associated with each action, as well as the distribution of action timing across scenarios. This study presents a new and transferable problem framing for adaptation under uncertainty in which indicator variables, actions, and policy structure are identified simultaneously during the optimization.","[Cohen, Jonathan S.; Herman, Jonathan D.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Cohen, JS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",joncohen@ucdavis.edu,"; Herman, Jonathan/M-9079-2017","Cohen, Jonathan/0000-0001-5516-1379; Herman, Jonathan/0000-0002-4081-3175","U.S. National Science Foundation [CBET-2041826, CNS-1639268]",U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank three anonymous reviewers for their constructive feedback.

Drawing on three waves of national panel household survey data, we find that participation in MASAF significantly increases the probability that farm households adopt the resource intensive CSA practices of building soil water conservation structures and applying organic fertilizers. Moreover, participation in MASAF contributes to a sustained adoption of these practices over multiple agricultural seasons. We empirically demonstrate that the standalone impact of the CSA practices on maize productivity and the value of crops harvested under normal and dry conditions is, in most cases, not significantly different from zero. However, we find a reduction in sensitivity to low precipitation when MASAF participation occurs in the previous agricultural season. Moreover, the joint treatment effect of MASAF participation with sustained adoption of soil water conservation structures substantially increases households' productivity and welfare. This synergistic benefit is likely driven by the transfer of skills learned during MASAF public works to farmers' own fields. Results suggest that the CSA agenda can be enhanced by explicitly integrating existing social protection interventions with the promotion of CSA practices. (c) 2021.

A number of these influence their attractiveness on economic grounds, including both the size and timing of the premium and potential payouts, and the degree of risk aversion of the potential customers. Other factors make programs attractive for reasons that are not economic, but no less valid. These have to do with the trust that people have in the insurance product and the organizations involved in selling and managing it. Indeed, data from India, Africa, and South America show that these factors may be more important than the economic ones in influencing demand. Index insurance pilot projects, in order to estimate demand for alternative products, have typically involved a great deal of interaction with potential customers. It is important to recognize that such interaction is crucial not just as a research tool, but also as a means to build understanding and trust in the products. When scaling up from isolated pilots to operational programs, it is vital to recognize this trust building function by replicating participation efforts in every community. In this paper, we examine the role of field games in establishing and building trust in three important aspects of these projects for participants: trust in the insurance product, trust in the participating organizations, and trust in their own ability to make good decisions. While games have previously been used as a way to gauge interest in the product and to identify design features, we argue that these games are also valuable tools for constructing these kinds of trust.","[Patt, Anthony] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Peterson, Nicole; Velez, Maria] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA; [Carter, Michael] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Hess, Ulrich] World Food Programme, Rome, Italy; [Suarez, Pablo] Red Cross Climate Ctr, The Hague, Netherlands",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Columbia University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Patt, A (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",patt@iiasa.ac.at,"Patt, Anthony/E-5437-2017","Velez, Maria Alejandra/0000-0002-8916-8808; Peterson, Nicole/0000-0002-2176-3109; Carter, Michael/0000-0003-0960-9181",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"This paper resulted from the workshop Technical issues in index insurance, held in October 2008 at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University.

The literature found that actors' perceptions of forum performance depend on both their individual characteristics (goals, expertise, resources) and forum processes (trust, learning, beliefs). However, we do not know how different combinations of actors, embodying different types of knowledge or expertise, relate to forum performance. We distinguish between policy and institutional specialization. Forum participants can be policy specialists, who are experts on the policy issue, and/or institutional specialists, who are expert of the policy process in the governance system. The former excel at problem definition and facilitation; the latter enable inclusivity. We surmise that higher proportions of specialized actors positively affect the group's perceptions of forum performance in terms of both process and outcomes, particularly in high conflict forums. We test this claim using survey data on 55 policy forums working on adaptation to sea level rise in the San Francisco Bay Area, collected in summer 2018. The empirical findings lend support to our hypothesis as concerns policy specialists but not as concerns institutional specialists. Further research should devote more effort to study how actor composition affects forum performance.","[Vantaggiato, Francesca Pia] Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, Bush House North East Wing,40 Aldwych, London WC2B 4BG, England; [Lubell, Mark] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of London; King's College London; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Vantaggiato, FP (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, Bush House North East Wing,40 Aldwych, London WC2B 4BG, England.",francesca.vantaggiato@kcl.ac.uk,"Vantaggiato, Francesca/GPS-9047-2022",,,,,,62,2,2,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0190-292X,1541-0072,,POLICY STUD J,Policy Stud.

It was derived from a combination of simple mathematical principles, approximations and fitted to 10 year return levels taken from intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves representing 14 sites in Oslo. The formula was subsequently evaluated against IDF curves from independent sites elsewhere in Norway. Since it only needs 24 h rain gauge data as input, it can provide approximate estimates for the IDF curves used to describe sub-daily rainfall return levels. In this respect, it can be considered as means of downscaling with respect to timescale, given an approximate power-law dependency between temporal scales. One clear benefit with this framework is that observational data is far more abundant for 24 h rain gauge records than for sub-daily measurements. Furthermore, it does not assume stationarity, and is well-suited for projecting IDF curves for a future climate.","[Benestad, Rasmus E.; Lutz, Julia; Dyrrdal, Anita Verpe; Haugen, Jan Erik; Parding, Kajsa M.; Dobler, Andreas] Norwegian Meteorol Inst, POB 43 Blindern, Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Meteorological Institute,"Benestad, RE (corresponding author), Norwegian Meteorol Inst, POB 43 Blindern, Oslo, Norway.",rasmus.benestad@met.no,"Parding, Kajsa/AFT-7894-2022; Dobler, Andreas/C-7586-2011","Parding, Kajsa/0000-0001-6840-7243; Benestad, Rasmus E./0000-0002-5969-4508; Dobler, Andreas/0000-0001-9490-0840; Lutz, Julia/0000-0002-7960-7619","Norwegian Meteorological Institute; Norwegian Research Council [281059, 281022, 302457]",Norwegian Meteorological Institute; Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"This work was supported by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and the KlimaDigital project (Norwegian Research Council Grant No. 281059), SURF (Norwegian Research Council Grant No. 281022) and Climdesign (Norwegian Research Council Grant No. 302457).",,25,3,3,0,3,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

The trials were located at Loppi (60 degrees 39'N) in southern Finland, at Kannonkoski (62 degrees 58'N), Ilomantsi (62 degrees 58'N) and Toholampi (63 degrees 47'N) in central Finland and at Rovaniemi (66 degrees 21'N) in northern Finland. Four trials were growing on moist upland forest sites and one on agricultural land. The material consisted of altogether 38 stand seed origins from Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Great Britain and Russia ranging between latitudes 53 degrees and 67 degrees N. Survival, height, diameter at breast height, stem volume/ha and number of stem defects per tree were assessed when the trees were 19 years old. Seed transfer distance was calculated either as latitudinal or temperature sum difference between the seed origin and the trial location. According to coefficients of determination (R-2), the latitude-based transfer models gave a slightly better fit with the data than the models based on temperature sum differences. Significant differences were found among the origins regarding all studied traits in all trials. In all traits, the pattern of variation in relation to the transfer distance was curvilinear, and the effect of transfer distance was significant A long transfer from both directions led to a reduction in all measured traits. The optimal transfer distance and direction varied depending on the trait and covariate used in the models. According to the latitudinal model, local or slightly more northern origins had highest survival and lowest number of stem defects. Height growth and yield was at highest with the local or slightly more southern origins. A northward transfer of ca. 2 degrees of latitude increased yield, while a southward transfer or a longer northward transfer, decreased the yield. According to the temperature sum model, origins within the limits of approximately +/- 200 d.d. compared to the trial location produced the highest yield. Origins with similar or slightly lower temperature sums compared to the trial locations had highest survival and best stem quality. The current seed transfer guidelines for silver birch in Finland, which recommend transfer distances of 150 km or 150 d.d. at maximum in southward or northward direction, seem still valid. Because of the low gain in expected yield by even moderate northward transfers and the uncertainties in the success of more southern origins in varying future climate, we recommend no changes in seed transfer guidelines.

The argument is based principally on the observation that nasal height is globally more variable than nasal breadth, with nasal breadth thus contributing little to variation in the index. This argument does not take into account the confounding effect of absolute size of these variables on their variances. In this study we compare the intrinsic variation in skeletal nasal height and breadth within and among 26 mixed-sex populations (N = 2,408) at globally diverse localities (Howells, 1989), using 2 x 2 variance-covariance matrices of the logarithmically transformed variates. Hypothesis tests for homogeneity of matrices and equal-variance/equal-covariance indicate that the intrinsic variation in nasal breadth is greater than that for nasal height within populations, and that nasal breadth and nasal height exhibit equivalent intrinsic variation among populations. The argument that nasal breadth contributes little to the world-wide variation in the human nasal index is rejected. Given our present understanding of nasal physiological morpho-function, these results support, but do not demonstrate, an adaptive role for human nasal index variation.

This article analyzes the spatial form, design, and use of Halley VI as well as the rhetoric surrounding it, seeing in Halley VI an expression of a particular socio-technical imaginary that implicitly gestures toward a tendential integration of climate science and global logistics. Alongside claims toward fostering a comfortable, communal life among its inhabitants, the imaginary embedded in Halley VI is one where climate research is subsumed within capital's broader aims to facilitate stable logistical movements and infrastructural durability amid chaotic, volatile conditions, a subsumption that bears in particular on the knowledge workers who inhabit the base. What a reading of the base's layout, interior, and lived-in uses exposes, the paper claims, is an implicit portending of a growing proletarianization of sensual experience and knowledge work among residents at the base, increasingly displaced as they are from the subjective core of the base's operations. This reading both extends and complicates recent calls in polar geographies to attend to speculative figurations of Antarctic futures, channeling Halley VI's polar futurism through structural determinants drawn out of literatures critically dealing with design, the history of systems sciences, and theorizations of ongoing restructurings of contemporary labor. The article suggests then that imaginaries of Anthropocenic futures such as those embedded in Halley VI's polar futurism might serve at once as speculative-projective tools and implicit sites for carrying out critiques of tensions and pernicious trends that underlie such Anthropocenic speculation.","[Adams, Spencer] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Adams, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Rhetor, 7408 Dwinelle Hall 2670, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",spencera716@berkeley.edu,,"Adams, Spencer/0000-0001-6990-6060",,,,,58,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2514-8486,2514-8494,,ENVIRON PLAN E-NAT,Environ.

The lack of data and information to support the planning process is often mentioned as a factor hampering the adaptation processes in cities. In this paper, we developed and tested a methodology for heat stress vulnerability and risk assessment at the neighborhood scale to support designers, planners, and decision makers in developing and implementing adaptation strategies and measures at the local level. The methodology combines high-resolution spatial information and crowdsourcing geospatial data to develop sensitivity, adaptive capacity, vulnerability, exposure, and risk indicators. The methodology is then tested on the urban fabric of the city of Padova, Italy. Our results show that different vulnerability and risk values correspond to different typologies of urban areas. Furthermore, the possibility of combining high-resolution information provided by the indicators and land use categories is of great importance to support the adaptation planning process. We also argue that the methodology is flexible enough to be applied in different contexts.","[Maragno, Denis; Musco, Francesco] Univ Iuav Venice, Dept Architecture & Arts, I-30135 Venice, Italy; [Dalla Fontana, Michele] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Publ Hlth, BR-01246904 Sao Paulo, Brazil",IUAV University Venice; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Maragno, D (corresponding author), Univ Iuav Venice, Dept Architecture & Arts, I-30135 Venice, Italy.",dmaragno@ivav.it; mdallafontana@usp.br; francesco.musco@ivav.it,"Maragno, Denis/AHE-1762-2022","Maragno, Denis/0000-0002-9489-7538; Musco, Francesco/0000-0002-8377-0128; Dalla Fontana, Michele/0000-0002-0700-1554",LIFE Veneto ADAPT--Central VENETO Cities netWorking for ADAPTation to Climate Change in a multi-level regional perspective [LIFE16 CCA/IT/000090],LIFE Veneto ADAPT--Central VENETO Cities netWorking for ADAPTation to Climate Change in a multi-level regional perspective,This research was funded by LIFE Veneto ADAPT--Central VENETO Cities netWorking for ADAPTation to Climate Change in a multi-level regional perspective (LIFE16 CCA/IT/000090).,,41,18,19,11,29,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2020,12,3,,,,,,,1056,10.3390/su12031056,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12031056,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LB8SF,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000524899600040,View Full Record in Web of Science

According to a 2013 World Bank study, annual average losses from natural disasters have increased from $50 billion in the 1980s to about $200 billion nowadays. Adaptation to such changes requires early recognition of vulnerable areas and the extent of the future risk due to weather factors. Despite the well-documented impact of climate change on the insurance sector, there exists a relatively limited number of studies addressing the effect of the so-called normal extreme weather (i.e., higher frequency and lower individual but high cumulative impact events) on the insurance dynamics. To reduce financial repercussions of such weather events, we develop a nonlinear attribution analysis of integer-valued insurance claims and atmospheric variables. Using data-driven nonparametric procedures, we identify triggering thresholds, or tipping points, leading to an increase in the number of claims. We develop a new data-adaptive method to compare tails of observed and projected weather variables and employ its outcomes to assess future dynamics of insurance claims. We illustrate our approach by application to modeling and forecasting of flood-related home insurance claims in Norway.","[Lyubchich, Vyacheslav] Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Chesapeake Biol Lab, POB 38, Solomons, MD 20688 USA; [Gel, Y.

In this paper, a novel risk assessing approach based on a climate risk assessment framework with copula-based approaches is proposed. Firstly, extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) and their marginal distributions are estimated for historical and future periods. Next, the joint probability distributions of extreme precipitation are constructed by copula methods and tested by goodness-of-fit indices. The future joint probabilities and joint return periods (JRPs) of the EPIs are then evaluated. Finally, change rates of JRPs for future periods are estimated to assess climate risk with the quantitative data of exposure and vulnerability of a protected target. An actual application in Taiwan Island is successfully conducted for climate risk assessment with the impacts of extreme precipitation. The results indicate that most of regions in Taiwan Island might have higher potential climate risk under different scenarios in the future. The future joint probabilities of precipitation extremes might cause the high risk of landslide and flood disasters in the mountainous area, and of inundation in the plain area. In sum, the proposed climate risk assessing approach is expected to be useful for assisting decision makers to draft adaptation strategies and face high risk of the possible occurrence of natural disasters.","[Jhong, Bing-Chen] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Civil & Earth Resources Engn, Kyoto 6158540, Japan; [Huang, Jung; Tung, Ching-Pin] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioenvironm Syst Engn, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",Kyoto University; National Taiwan University,"Jhong, BC (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Civil & Earth Resources Engn, Kyoto 6158540, Japan.",jhongbc0516@gmail.com,,"Jhong, Bing-Chen/0000-0003-3817-3946",Taiwan Climate Change Projection and Information Platform Project (TCCIP) - Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST),Taiwan Climate Change Projection and Information Platform Project (TCCIP) - Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST),"The authors are grateful to the Taiwan Climate Change Projection and Information Platform Project (TCCIP) funded by Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) providing the projections of general circulation models with the climate scenarios and revised by the method of bias correction and spatial disaggregation.

They are also a major cause of non-linearity between climate and erosion rates in agricultural systems as noted fromalluvial and colluvial studies. Newresearch in the `critical zone' has shown that we must now treat soil production as an ecologically sensitive variable with implications for soil carbon sequestration. In this reviewand synthesis paperwe present a modified classification of agricultural terraces, review the theoretical background of both terraces and lynchets, and show how new techniques are transforming the study of these widespread and often ancient anthropogenic landforms. The problems of dating terraces and the time-consuming nature of costly surveys have held back the geomorphological and geoarchaeological study of terraces until now. The suite of techniques nowavailable, and reviewed here, includes Digital ElevationModels (DEMs) - Structure fromMotion (SfM) photogrammetry, Airborne and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (ALS-TLS); optically stimulated luminescence (OSL and pOSL), portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF), Fourier-transform infra-red analysis (FTIR), phytoliths from plants, and potentially environmental DNA. Three process-related geomorphological questions arise from using this suite of methods; a) can they provide both a chronology of formation and use history, b) can we identify the sources of all the soil components? c) Can terrace soil formation and ecosystem services be modelled at the slope to catchment scale? The answers to these questions can also informthe management of the large areas of abandoned and under-used terraces that are resulting from both the economics of farming and rural population changes. Where possible, examples are drawn from a recently started ERC project (TerrACE; ERC-2018-2023; https://www.terrace.no/) that isworking at over 15 sites in Europe ranging from Norway to Greece.

In this study, we test for the maintenance of fertility in overwintering males from the eastern Australian D. melanogaster cline. Males from southern temperate populations maintained in field cages in temperate Melbourne had a higher fertility in spring compared with males from tropical locations. Temperate males successfully inseminated more females, and there were also more offspring produced per inseminated female. The resulting linear post-winter fertility clines were unrelated to male body size. In contrast, there was no clinal variation for fertility in nonoverwintering males held in the laboratory. The cline in overwintering male fertility is likely to have evolved as an adaptive response to latitudinal climatic variation over the last 100 years.","[Hoffmann, A.

The slopes of least squares regression lines relating EWL to rho(va) at different temperatures were not significantly different and averaged -0.50 mg H2O. m-3. g-2. h-1 (range: -0.39 to -0.61). Increased rho(va) restricted EWL in C. anna more than has been reported for other endotherms in dry air. The percent of metabolic heat production dissipated by evaporation (H(e)/H(m)) was lower than that of other birds in dry air, but higher than that for other birds at high humidity when T(a) < 33-degrees-C. When T(a) > 33-degrees-C the effect of humidity on H(e)/H(m) was similar to that in other birds. Calypte anna might become slightly hyperthermic at T(a) > 37-degrees-C, which could augment heat transfer by increasing the T(b) - T(a) gradient. Body temperature for C. anna in this study was 43-degrees-C (intramuscular) at T(a)S between 25 and 35-degrees-C, which is above average for birds.

A strict adaptation plan, usually made for reducing the impact of climate change, may not be the solution, as different heritage site locations, materials, and hazard types need tailored plans. Therefore, in this research paper, a resilience approach was introduced to help adapt the most problematic sites to the impacts of climate change, i.e., coastal heritage sites. To fulfill the objective of achieving adaptation in a resilient way that can easily be developed in relation to different types of sites, mixed research methods were used. First, the literature was reviewed using the Connected Papers tool. Then, machine learning methods were used to process and analyze the input data of the resilience adaptation plan for an Egyptian coastal heritage site case study, i.e., Alexandria. Next, the data were arranged and analyzed, highlighting the main classifying algorithms responsible for identifying the resilience range, using the machine learning software packages Infra Nodus and WEKA, according to the differences in the climate change impact at the heritage sites. The final outcome of this research is a resilience approach that can be adapted to rescue plans for coastal heritage sites via machine learning.","[Hegazi, Yasmine Sabry] Zagazig Univ, Fac Engn, Architecture Dept, Zagazig 44519, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Zagazig University,"Hegazi, YS (corresponding author), Zagazig Univ, Fac Engn, Architecture Dept, Zagazig 44519, Egypt.",yasmine_sabry@yahoo.com,"Hegazi, Yasmine Sabry/GWC-0308-2022","Sabry Hegazi, Yasmine/0000-0001-6675-1307",,,,,27,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Advocates of NBFD point to their cost-effectiveness, flexibility and the range of co-benefits they produce beside flood risk reduction. However, NBFD are not yet common practice. One reason for this may be found in financial barriers. To date, there has been little attention for financial aspects of NBFD, as the literature has focused on design, effectiveness and socio-economic impact of such projects. We address this gap by analysing the financial attractiveness of real-world NBFD from the perspective of the public actor. We address the following research questions: through which mechanisms can public investments in NBFD projects be leveraged? and ii) what are the enabling conditions for these mechanisms? We find two types of revenue generating mechanisms: value capture, in which the public actor generates revenues from private beneficiaries through taxes; and co-investment, in which the project attracts in-kind or cash contributions from other actors. We illustrate the potential of these leveraging mechanisms in four case studies and find that NBFD can generate significant tax revenues in locations with high demand for certain co-benefits, whereas project size, type, timing and beneficiaries of cobenefits determine the potential for co-investment.","[Kok, Sien; de Bel, Mark] Deltares, Delft, Netherlands; [Bisaro, Alexander; Hinkel, Jochen] Global Climate Forum, Berlin, Germany; [Bouwer, Laurens M.] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, Hamburg, Germany",Deltares; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung,"Kok, S (corresponding author), Deltares, Delft, Netherlands.",sien.kok@deltares.nl,"Bouwer, Laurens/AAV-7628-2021; Bouwer, Laurens/ABE-7170-2021","Bouwer, Laurens/0000-0003-3498-2586; Hinkel, Jochen/0000-0001-7590-992X; de Bel, Mark/0000-0003-2701-5985",Horizon 2020 programme of the European Commission [642018],Horizon 2020 programme of the European Commission,"This study is part of the GREEN -WIN project, supported by the Horizon 2020 programme of the European Commission (Grant Agreement 642018).

As climate-related loss and damage mount, there is growing interest in the role of law in dealing with the complex and multi-scalar problem of climate change. This article builds on a shorter piece entitled 'Acts of God, human influence and litigation' published by the authors in Nature Geoscience in August 2017. It is an interdisciplinary and cross-jurisdictional analysis of the emerging science of extreme weather event attribution (which analyses the human impact on extreme weather events), and the implications this new science may have for the law, litigation and the scope of the duty of care of a range of actors. We suggest that the science of event attribution may become a driver of litigation, as it shifts understanding of what weather is expected and, relevantly for law, foreseeable. This may have an impact on the duties of government actors as well as private parties. We explain the discipline of event attribution science to lawyers, discuss some technical issues related to the use of this evidence in court and make some suggestions regarding the types of 'climate change' cases it may influence. We conclude that the first kind of litigation to emerge is most likely to arise from failures to adapt to, or to prepare for, our changing climate.","[Marjanac, Sophie] ClientEarth, London, England; [Patton, Lindene] Earth & Water Law LLC, Washington, DC USA",,"Marjanac, S (corresponding author), ClientEarth, London, England.",smarjanac@clientearth.org; lindene.patton@earthandwatergroup.com,,,,,,,84,48,48,1,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-6811,2376-4538,,J ENERGY NAT RESO LA,J.

However, current knowledge on effective climate mainstreaming has rarely translated into policy outcomes and radical, transformational change. This 'implementation gap' relates to the limitations of current approaches, which do not adequately address so-called 'internal' or 'personal' spheres of transformation. Here, we address this gap and provide an integrative climate mainstreaming framework for improving and guiding future sustainability research, education, policy and practice. Technical summary Current knowledge on what makes climate mainstreaming effective has, so far, seldom translated into policy outcomes and radical, transformational change. This 'implementation gap' is related to the limitations of current approaches. The latter tend to focus on isolated, highly tangible, but essentially weak leverage points that do not adequately link practical and political solutions with 'internal' or 'personal' spheres of transformation. This link involves an internal (mindset/consciousness) shift leading to long-lasting changes in the way that we experience and relate to our self, others, the world and future generations. It requires unleashing people's internal potential and capacity to care, commit to, and effect change for a more sustainable life across individual, collective, organisational and system levels. To address this gap, we analyse how such internal dimensions can be integrated into climate mainstreaming, to move beyond its current, partial focus on external and technological solutions. Through a robust investigation of how to scale up climate mainstreaming in a more transformative manner, we explore how mainstreaming and conscious full-spectrum theories can be related to fundamentally advance the field and improve current approaches. The resulting integrative framework breaks new ground by linking the mainstreaming of climate considerations and internal dimensions across all spheres of transformation. We conclude with some policy recommendations and future research needs.

This study investigated the implications of short-term changes in the water quality from Lake Bolmen on the treatment process at the downstream located Ringsjo water treatment plant. The main objective was to understand short-term organic matter fluctuations to efficiently manage drinking water treatment. The ability to make predictions about expected raw water quality based on variations in the watershed and upstream waters facilitates optimal adjustment of drinking water treatment processes. Key elements in the water supply system studied included a tunnel and pipeline system and a sub-basin of Lake Bolmen. A wealth of data were available for the analysis to establish temporal and spatial properties of the water quality in the system and its dependence on the governing factors. The main factors controlling water quality were identified, both regarding the transport in the tunnel and through the sub-basin, including surface runoff, hydrodynamic properties, sedimentation, resuspension, and biomass availability. Although an particular case was investigated, the study has implications for improving drinking water treatment.","[Klante, Clemens; Larson, Magnus] Lund Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Water Resources Engn, Lund, Sweden; [Klante, Clemens] Sweden Water Res, Ideon Sci Pk,Scheelevagen 15, S-22370 Lund, Sweden; [Hagg, Kristofer] Sydvatten AB, Malmo, Sweden",Lund University,"Klante, C (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Water Resources Engn, Lund, Sweden.;Klante, C (corresponding author), Sweden Water Res, Ideon Sci Pk,Scheelevagen 15, S-22370 Lund, Sweden.",Clemens.Klante@tvrl.lth.se,,,Sydvatten AB; SwedenWater Research AB,Sydvatten AB(HOGANAS ABStatisticon AB); SwedenWater Research AB,"Greatly appreciated is the financial support from Sydvatten AB and SwedenWater Research AB which made this study possible.

In that decade, extreme summer heat conditions and low precipitation levels led to repeated crop failures. These extreme climatic conditions coincided with economic recession, falling commodity prices, and rising unemployment to create widespread hardship and suffering across the rural population. Thousands of households adapted by leaving the drought-stricken region and migrating to more northerly regions unaffected by drought, often suffering still further hardship as they reestablished themselves in a new environment. Through secondary research of historical documents and interviews with surviving migrants and non-migrants, this study identifies how economic, human, and social capital influenced the adaptive capacity, adaptation decisions, and migration behavior of rural households and describes how institutional responses affected household adaptation. Differential access to capital in its various forms was a key factor that distinguished households that adapted via migration from those that did not. The findings from this study of historical environment-related population change provide insights that enhance our broader understanding of potential future migration responses to the impacts of anthropogenic climate change and important considerations for policy-makers and planners seeking to build adaptive capacity in rural populations.","[Gilbert, Genevieve; McLeman, Robert] Univ Ottawa, Dept Geog, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"McLeman, R (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Geog, Room 015 Simard Hall, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",rmcleman@uottawa.ca,,"McLeman, Robert/0000-0001-9593-1606",,,,,96,26,28,1,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0199-0039,1573-7810,,POPUL ENVIRON,Popul.

They framed Haiyan as a climate change emergency, and sought to respond to future risks to the city and country. This focus on future recovery came at the expense of attention to the transitional needs of those worst affected by the Typhoon. International humanitarian organizations were co-opted into the government's refusal of transitional assistance to Tacloban City shoreline residents. This was because they construed their mandate of apolitical assistance in a particular way. An alternative framing of emergency deployed by a local organization produced a very different result.

Climate changes add to the complexity via effects on forest ecosystem processes, such as primary production and respiration, and also by adding a new goal on the agenda: the role of forests in climate mitigation. In recent years, the generation of climate model projections, representing a range of future scenarios, has enabled the development of strategic decisions in relation to risk management, and created a demand for cross-sectorial adaptation and mitigation processes. In this ecosystem model study we address these issues from the perspective of Swedish forest owners, by focusing on climate impacts and forest management effects on the potential harvest level, net income, predisposition to storm damage, biodiversity and carbon storage. The objective was to evaluate alternative management strategies, applicable to northern boreal, southern boreal and nemoral conditions. A general finding is that targeted combinations of forest stand management strategies can lead to a higher degree of goal fulfilment at the landscape level than current forest management practice.

However, measures like improved insulation and airtightness may increase their vulnerability to overheating and climate change may further worsen their performance in the future. This paper investigates indoor overheating risks brought by climate change in retrofitted historic buildings and proposes effective adaptation strategies. Firstly, local weather conditions are analysed to identify homogenous climatic zones. For each climatic zone, a business-as-usual emissions scenario is adopted, and most representative regional climate models are selected to obtain hourly output of future climate projection. A comparative study is adopted where typical alpine residential buildings, Portici house, are simulated with regard to future energy use and indoor thermal state using the dynamic model in EnergyPlus. Energy use and indoor thermal conditions are compared before and after energy retrofit, as well as under present and future climate conditions. The results demonstrate that retrofit interventions could significantly improve energy efficiency of historic buildings in both present and future scenarios. A change in climate together with retrofit interventions will, however, result in higher risk of indoor overheating in South Tyrol. Potential negative side effects of energy retrofit could be controlled by adopting adequate shading and ventilation approaches that minimise, or eliminate, the risk of overheating during high temperature periods while optimising historic buildings' energy performance.","[Hao, Lingjun] Hebei Univ Technol, Ctr Urban & Rural Renewal, Dept Architecture & Art Design, Built Heritage Conservat, Tianjin 300131, Peoples R China; [Herrera-Avellanosa, Daniel; Troi, Alexandra] Eurac Res, Inst Renewable Energy, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Del Pero, Claudio] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Hebei University of Technology; European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Hao, LJ (corresponding author), Hebei Univ Technol, Ctr Urban & Rural Renewal, Dept Architecture & Art Design, Built Heritage Conservat, Tianjin 300131, Peoples R China.",lingjun.hao@hebut.edu.cn; daniel.herrera@eurac.edu; claudio.delpero@polimi.it; alexandra.troi@eurac.edu,,"Del Pero, Claudio/0000-0003-4205-2805; Herrera-Avellanosa, Daniel/0000-0002-9661-8387; Troi, Alexandra/0000-0002-7450-4688",Hebei Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities,Hebei Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities,The APC was funded by Hebei Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities.,,51,1,1,9,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

In response to the growing call for adaptive capacity development amid a worsening climate, it pays particular attention to the effects of organizational adaptive capacity. Three components of an organization's adaptive capacity are investigated: formal institutions, organizational slack and contracting out (inverse of capacity). We focus on organizations' technical efficiency as a key performance indicator. Using a sample of 108 bus transit system in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest from 2008 to 2017, the analysis applies the Battese and Coelli (1995) specification for stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) with panel data. A general model is estimated to incorporate the heterogeneity in both the level and efficiency of output. The results confirm the efficacy of organizational adaptive capacity to enhance efficiency amid extreme weather. Specifically, higher levels of organizational slack or lower levels of contracting out can boost technical efficiency under extreme weather. Formal institutions, while temporarily compromising technical efficiency, holds potential for salient efficiency gains in the long run. The conclusion ends with a discussion on the theoretical and practical implications of this study.","[Zhang, Fengxiu] George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, Van Metre Hall,3351 Fairfax Dr, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",George Mason University,"Zhang, FX (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, Van Metre Hall,3351 Fairfax Dr, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",fzhang22@gmu.edu,,"Zhang, Fengxiu/0000-0001-5784-9708",,,,,74,4,4,1,9,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

It facilitates urban transition and the adoption of more systemic approaches and innovations. Social learning in water governance is a growing field, but the triple-loop learning concept remains vague and underexplored. Additionally, the focus is often on how social learning can contribute to progress with little attention being paid to barriers to learning. The aim of this paper is to increase understanding of triple-loop social learning to improve the learning infrastructure. It investigates key learning barriers for realizing green (livable) and adaptive cities in Malmo and Gothenburg, Sweden. Integration of nature-based solutions in spatial planning and development of these cities has been slow. The results found three types of barriers contributing to this: systemic (disconnecting parts with the whole); opacity (reducing communication between error detection and correction); and process-related (reducing the adoption of innovations). The paper contributes to understanding the social learning barriers for implementing planning. These insights could help overcome adaptation inertia and speed up policy learning towards sustainability and resilience.","[Johannessen, Ase] Lund Univ, Div Risk Management & Societal Safety, POB 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Johannessen, Ase; Mostert, Erik] Delft Univ Technol TU Delft, Dept Water Management, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands",Lund University,"Johannessen, A (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Div Risk Management & Societal Safety, POB 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.;Johannessen, A (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol TU Delft, Dept Water Management, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands.",ase.johannessen@gmail.com; E.Mostert@tudelft.nl,"Mostert, Erik/L-2711-2014","Mostert, Erik/0000-0002-9546-0522; Johannessen, Ase/0000-0002-8752-5496",Swedish Research Council VR [2017-06214],Swedish Research Council VR(Swedish Research Council),This study was financed by the Swedish Research Council VR (international postdoc grant number 2017-06214).,,129,5,5,2,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2020,12,17,,,,,,,6916,10.3390/su12176916,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12176916,,,28,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NO8FC,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000569722400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Landscapes evolve. They are manifestations of the complex negotiations between nature and cultures, over millennia. In the Anthropocene, humans are the dominant evolutionary force reshaping the biosphere. Landscape management involves all human activities and interventions that change the forms and functions of landscapes. It also involves the ways we learn about, and understand the world, and our place in it. Responses to climate change are driving changes in natural resources policy, research and management. Building capability for large-scale, adaptive management is critical in an era of global change. By rigorously examining and learning from recent experience-bioregional conservation planning, natural resource management (NRM), landcare, and water reform-Australia can build capacity for integrated and adaptive resource management. Climate change compounds existing stressors on ecosystems. It adds complexity and presents new challenges for integrated assessment, planning, and management of natural resources. Given the dynamic nature of the ecosystems, static conservation paradigms and stationary hydrology models are increasingly redundant. In the face of inherent complexity and uncertainty, 'predict and control' strategies are likely to be less useful. Adaptive approaches are called for, due to the complex relationships and non-linear feedbacks between social, ecological, and climatic systems. Australia should invest in building professional and community capacity. Australia's scientific and professional capacity in natural resources provides useful foundations, but substantially increased investment is called for. Research should be focused on guiding and influencing management at large scales and on avoiding undesirable thresholds or tipping points in complex ecological systems. Cultural and governance aspects are emphasised as central to effective adaptation strategies, because landscape management is an intergenerational, societal challenge that requires participatory, adaptive learning approaches.",,,"Alexandra, J (corresponding author), POB 477, Dickson, ACT 2602, Australia.",jason.alexandra@mdba.gov.au,,,,,,,116,20,20,2,44,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1836-0947,1836-5795,,CROP PASTURE SCI,Crop Pasture Sci.,,2012,63,3,,,SI,,215,231,,10.1071/CP11189,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP11189,,,17,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,948FT,,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000304489700005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Represented via the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), a multivariate thermophysiological-relevant parameter, the highest heat stress is found to be most frequent and geographically widespread during the rainy season (August, September, and October). UTCI trends indicate an increase of more than 0.2 degrees C center dot decade(-1), with southern Florida and the Lesser Antilles witnessing the greatest upward rates (0.45 degrees C center dot decade(-1)). Correlations with climate variables known to induce heat stress reveal that the increase in heat stress is driven by increases in air temperature and radiation, and decreases in wind speed. Conditions of heat danger, as depicted by the heat index (HI), have intensified since 1980 (+1.2 degrees C) and are found to occur simultaneously to conditions of heat stress suggesting a synergy between heat illnesses and physiological responses to heat. This work also includes the analysis of the record-breaking 2020 heat season during which the UTCI and HI achieved above average values, indicating that local populations most likely experienced heat stress and danger higher than the ones they are used to. These findings confirm the gradual intensification of heat stress in the Caribbean and aim to provide a guidance for heat-related policies in the region.","[Di Napoli, Claudia] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, POB 237, Reading RG6 6EU, Berks, England; [Di Napoli, Claudia] Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [Di Napoli, Claudia; Pappenberger, Florian] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England; [Allen, Theodore] Caribbean Inst Meteorol & Hydrol, St James, Barbados; [Mendez-Lazaro, Pablo A.] Univ Puerto Rico, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Environm Hlth Dept, San Juan, PR 00936 USA",University of Reading; University of Reading; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); University of Puerto Rico; University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus,"Di Napoli, C (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, POB 237, Reading RG6 6EU, Berks, England.",c.dinapoli@reading.ac.uk,"Di Napoli, Claudia/GRR-8287-2022; Pappenberger, Florian/A-2839-2009","Di Napoli, Claudia/0000-0002-4901-3641; Pappenberger, Florian/0000-0003-1766-2898",Royal Society [FOS\R1\191010]; Wellcome Trust [209734/Z/17/Z],Royal Society(Royal Society of London); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust),"Royal Society, Grant/Award Number: FOS\R1\191010; Wellcome Trust, Grant/Award Number: 209734/Z/17/Z",,90,1,1,3,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

This study compares the heating and cooling loads reduction effects of static and EC glazing under various conditions to evaluate the regional applicability of EC glazing in Japan. Furthermore, to maximize the effect, we employ a machine learning (ML)-based operation and evaluate its efficiency. A parametric study is conducted based on a standard office model in Japan using the DesignBuilder software. The result shows that the heating and cooling loads reduces by 17.1% compared with low-E glazing in warm climates (Miyazaki, Zone 7). However, in cold climates (Obihiro, Zone 2), the energy increase is 25.4% and the trend of the effect changes near Zone 4. Therefore, on days when the heating load is expected to occur in Zones 3-5, we incorporate solar heat before working hours.

I reveal that what distinguishes ecotourism is not merely its arrangements for the commodification of nature and related scientific enterprises. Instead, ecotourism depends in part on how people live with environmental degradation and the flexible ways in which they relate ideas of care to such lived experiences. Drawing on research conducted in urban Guyana, the article lays out people's struggles to plan for mangrove tourism despite the presence of garbage and the threat of erosion to forests. In so doing, I illustrate that ecotourism expresses itself through self-organizing processes and therefore, is dialectically intertwined with sociopolitical strategies of care and its distribution.","[Vaughn, Sarah Elizabeth] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Vaughn, SE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Anthropol, 232 Kroeber Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",sev83@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,63,1,1,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2514-8486,2514-8494,,ENVIRON PLAN E-NAT,Environ.

Research has focused on developing such tools and evaluating their use in workshops but has not measured tools' effects over time on real planning processes, on the participants involved, and on the final outcomes. The role that tools play in adaptation planning, therefore, remains unclear. A longitudinal case study was made to evaluate a PSS, the Adaptation Support Tool (AST), in a design workshop for sustainable urban water management, in Berlin, Germany. The case study also served to test the evaluation framework and generate insights regarding systematic evaluations of tools in planning processes. The case study was carried out over eighteen months, to capture both the details of the workshop and its longer-term effects on the project and participants. Our results show that the AST's most evident effects were (1) contributory and less tangible in nature (e.g., supporting learning), than directly causal and concrete (e.g., affecting planning decisions), and (2) a function of the process and context in which the workshop took place.

This paper focuses on emerging markets and developing economies. The conventional agenda of providing safe drinking water supply and sanitation has met with growing success. The newer water resources agenda covering flood, drought and irrigation, in contrast, has to address rapid alterations in the landscape due to destruction of catchments, and rapid water use growth. By approximately 2045 the world will transition from a predominantly water-abundant place to a predominantly water-scarce one. Though this masks large regional differences, pressure will grow to improve water management and broaden adoption of technologies and policies for recycling, desalination and water efficiency. Climate change will exacerbate these trends. Finance for the water agenda has been dominated by public budgets. To meet the SDGs, the need for finance in emerging markets and developing economies is 2-4 times larger than current practice. National budgets have grown significantly while international development assistance has grown modestly. Commercial finance holds promise but is constrained by high-risk profiles of many water investments: deals are small or risky and creditworthiness of water utilities and municipalities is weak. Access to commercial finance can be enhanced through blended finance, intermediary institutions and, increasingly, local capital markets. However, though the capacity to access finance is constrained in many developing economies, the capacity to absorb finance and prepare bankable proposals proves even more constraining. Climate change is emerging as a systemic threat to corporate and financial assets. Water insecurity undercuts the financial viability of production assets, services and real estate. It is argued that the longer-term interests of the water and financial sectors will converge.","[Alaerts, Guy J.] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, NL-2282 XS Delft, Netherlands; [Alaerts, Guy J.] Global Ctr Adaptat, NL-3072 AP Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Alaerts, Guy J.] Global Ctr Adaptat, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands",IHE Delft Institute for Water Education,"Alaerts, GJ (corresponding author), IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, NL-2282 XS Delft, Netherlands.;Alaerts, GJ (corresponding author), Global Ctr Adaptat, NL-3072 AP Rotterdam, Netherlands.;Alaerts, GJ (corresponding author), Global Ctr Adaptat, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands.",g.alaerts@un-ihe.org,,"Alaerts, Guy/0000-0002-9537-2928",,,,,64,17,17,2,32,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB 1,2019,11,3,,,,,,,821,10.3390/su11030821,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11030821,,,25,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HL7NY,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000458929500266,View Full Record in Web of Science

The economies of many SIDS are also highly dependent on tourism, much of which occurs in potentially hazardous coastal areas and are closely linked to environmental quality. Despite the importance of catalyzing investment in coastal infrastructure to reduce vulnerability and enhance resilience, there is a paucity of research exploring the economic returns to investment to substantiate a business case for this investment. This paper addresses this research gap and develops a model for estimating the economic benefits of shoreline stabilization and illustrates the approach with an application to a US$24.2 million coastal infrastructure investment in Barbados. Results show that the investment generated significant benefits for both tourists and residents, as well as reduced beach erosion and property damage. The approach is versatile facing data constraints, provides evidence to support decisions to scale-up existing investments, and can support and inform the design of new investments.","[Banerjee, Onil; Lemay, Michele] Interamer Dev Bank, Environm Rural Dev Environm & Disaster Risk Manag, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA; [Boyle, Kevin] Virginia Tech, 430A Bishop Favrao,1345 Perry St, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Rogers, Cassandra T.] Inter Amer Dev Bank, Environm Rural Dev Environm & Disaster Risk Manag, Maxwell Main Rd, BB-17068 Christchurch, Barbados; [Cumberbatch, Janice] Univ West Indies, Ctr Resource Management & Environm Studies CERMES, Cave Hill Campus, Wanstead, Barbados; [Kanninen, Barbara] Arlington Publ Sch, 1426N Quincy St, Arlington, VA 22207 USA; [Schling, Maja] Interamer Dev Bank, Off Strateg Planning & Dev Effectiveness, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA",Inter-American Development Bank; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Cave Hill Campus; Inter-American Development Bank,"Banerjee, O (corresponding author), Interamer Dev Bank, Environm Rural Dev Environm & Disaster Risk Manag, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",obanerjee@gmail.com; kjboyle@vt.edu; cassandrar@iadb.org; janice.cumberbatch@cavehill.uwi.edu; barbara.kanninen@apsva.us; michelel@iadb.org; majas@iadb.org,,,Inter-American Development Bank; Barbados' Coastal Zone Management Unit,Inter-American Development Bank; Barbados' Coastal Zone Management Unit,"This work was funded by the Inter-American Development Bank.

This work showcases a general guideline for implementing an operational climate service based on subseasonal predictions. At this timescale, many strategic decisions can benefit from timely predictions of climate variables. Still, the use of subseasonal predictions is not fully exploited. Here, we describe the key aspects considered to set up an operational climate service from the conception to the production phase. These include the choice of the subseasonal systems, the data sources and the methodology employed for post-processing the predictions. To illustrate the process with a real case, we present the detailed workflow design of the imple-mentation of a climate service based on subseasonal predictions and describe the bias adjustment and verifi-cation methodologies implemented. This work was developed in the H2020 S2S4E project, where industrial and research partners co-developed a fully-operational Decision Support Tool (DST) providing 18 months of real-time subseasonal and seasonal forecasts tailored to the specific needs of the renewable energy sector. The operational workflow can be adapted to serve forecast products to other sectors, as has been proved in the H2020 vitiGEOSS project, where the workflow was modified to provide downscaled subseasonal predictions to specific locations. We consider this a valuable contribution to future developments of similar service implementations and the producers of the climate data.","[Manrique-Sunen, Andrea; Palma, Lluis; Gonzalez-Reviriego, Nube; Doblas-Reyes, Francisco J.; Soret, Albert] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr BSC, Carrer Jordi Girona 29, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Doblas-Reyes, Francisco J.] Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats ICREA, Passeig Lluis Co 23, Barcelona 08010, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC-CNS); ICREA,"Palma, L (corresponding author), Barcelona Supercomp Ctr BSC, Carrer Jordi Girona 29, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",lluis.palma@bsc.es,,,"European Union [7767874, 869565]",European Union(European Commission),The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union'ss Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grants 7767874 (S2S4E) and 869565 (VitiGEOSS).

Both theory and practice consider urban living labs (ULLs) as promising vehicles for policy integration, as ULLs can overcome institutional structures. This article presents a framework that assesses how the urban living lab can contribute to policy integration in BGI projects and applies this to three case studies in Antwerp (Belgium), Dordrecht (the Netherlands), and Gothenburg (Sweden). Our findings demonstrate that ULLs can enhance policy integration through defining integrative aims, creating shared accountability structures, and assigning a clear problem owner with authority. ULLs can equally hinder policy integration because their dependence on sectoral funding results in narrowed-down goals. Moreover, their experimental, non-committal position gives them limited power to pull down institutional structures. Thus, ULLs do not automatically enhance policy integration in BGI projects.","[Willems, Jannes J.] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Human Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, POB 15629, NL-1001 NC Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Willems, Jannes J.; Kuitert, Lizet; Van Buuren, Arwin] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Social & Behav Sci, Dept Publ Adm & Sociol, Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Willems, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Human Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, POB 15629, NL-1001 NC Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.j.willems@uva.nl,,"Willems, Jannes/0000-0002-3318-9706",,,,,46,0,0,8,9,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",1756-932X,1756-9338,,ENVIRON POLICY GOV,Environ.

In the present research work, the authors investigated the relevance of the selected passive design measures for heating and cooling energy use of single-family detached buildings at five European locations. To this end, a multiple linear regression analysis was performed, and least-squares estimates were used to identify the most relevant passive design measures under current and three future periods. The statistical analysis showed that the importance of passive design measures would change under the projected global warming effects. In general, the most relevant for the heating energy use of the analysed building models is the opaque envelope U value. Besides effective shading, the most relevant parameter affecting the cooling energy use is the window-to-floor ratio. Furthermore, relevance diagrams for the influence of passive design parameters on the resulting energy use under the climate change scenario and specific U values of the opaque envelope were defined. Building designers and policymakers can use them as designsupport tool to find appropriate ways of converting the number of unknowns in future climate into information for designers and decision-makers to assure low vulnerability of the built environment to global warming.

Concentrating on the city of Hamilton, New Zealand, we investigate possible water use and infrastructure needs for a range of climate and population projections. We find that water demand (at the monthly aggregate level) is largely driven by changes in population, and not significantly affected by changes in climate. However, as population increases, the effect of climate variables on per capita consumption will be magnified. Monthly aggregate changes may further mask potenially significant short-term shortages. In several scenarios, water supply shortages in 2030 occur with a 30--40% probability, suggesting needs for long-term capacity expansion or aggressive demand side management, rather than implementation of short-term management of water demand.","Univ Maryland, Div Res, Ctr Integrat Environm Res, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Univ Maryland, A James Clark Sch Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Massey Univ, New Zealand Ctr Ecol Econ, Palmerston North, New Zealand; Landcare Res, Palmerston North, New Zealand",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Massey University; Landcare Research - New Zealand,"Ruth, M (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Div Res, Ctr Integrat Environm Res, Van Munching Hall,Suite 2202, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",mruth1@umd.edu,,,,,,,24,45,47,2,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

The aim of this study is to tailor the SDGs, as a universally recognized policy framework, to assess the sustainability performance for coastal flood protection management to enhance climate-resilient and adaptable coastal development. To operationalize this aim, the SDG Sustainability Impact Score (SDG-SIS) framework was developed. Based on system functionalities for the land-sea interface, 38 SDGs were identified in the SDG-SIS framework. Given the availability of public numeric data, only 12 SDG targets are connected with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The SDG-SIS framework was applied to two different sets of cases, including five coastline and five sand nourishment cases. This study shows that the geographical and socioeconomic characteristics of the two sets of cases should be considered in the selection of system functionalities as well as the consideration of SDG targets. Moreover, cross-linking cumulative consequences of SIS do not directly indicate the level of sustainability, but the individual SDG target data are essential to reveal the underlying details. This stresses the importance of prioritizing SDGs to serve as leverage for policymakers to optimize the climate resilience and adaptation of coastal management. The SDG-SIS framework enables the support of coastal policy by addressing long-term measures and providing a sustainable vision for future implementation.","[Schipper, Cor A.; Dekker, Gerben G.

These adaptations can then be culturally appropriate and grounded in Indigenous knowledge systems; however, the accelerating rate of change in social-ecological systems can be a challenge for traditional knowledge. Appropriate participatory modeling tools such as agent-based models (ABMs) may be of assistance to Indigenous groups in thinking through how systems may change in the future. Using the Zimbabwe Agro-Pastoral Management Model (a community-based ABM cocreated with farmer-researchers in Mazvihwa Communal Area), we explored how different definitions of sustainability affected the conclusions from the model, including average annual harvest and the persistence of resources (livestock, harvest, and woodland biomass) in the modeled system above minimum thresholds. For very low persistence thresholds, these two measures of success traded off against each other (with higher cropland proportions favoring harvest success and lower cropland proportions favoring persistence success); and different combinations of management interventions favored one or the other definition of sustainability. New insights came from community suggestions of higher persistence thresholds for livestock, crops, and woodland, whereby the model suggested that an intermediate proportion of cropland could be most successful. In all cases, higher year-to-year rainfall variation reduced sustainability success, regardless of the definition or thresholds used. Cocreating, cotesting, and coadaptation of the model and the use of multiple definitions rendered the findings more relevant for local application. The community in Mazvihwa has many ways to adapt to challenging circumstances, and local nongovernmental organization The Muonde Trust has used the model to work with local leaders to support collective action on land use planning to protect woodland from deforestation.","[Eitzel, M., V] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Solera, Jon] Seven Points Consulting, San Diego, CA USA; [Wilson, K.

Policies often institute new understandings, procedures or practices, something the logics, as originally articulated, fall somewhat short of capturing. To overcome these methodological challenges this article constructs a framework for poststructuralist policy analysis that brings together the Logics Approach with more textually oriented tools developed within Critical Discourse Analysis, namely assumptions and genre chains. For empirical illustration it draws on a case study of the European Union's adaptation policy in response to climate change. The resulting framework offers a means through which more implicit social and political logics can be examined, and contributes new insights to methodological debates around the use of the Logics Approach (and PDT more broadly), specifically in relation to critical policy analysis. The article concludes with seven observations of relevance for future studies and suggests avenues for further empirical and conceptual exploration.","[Remling, Elise] Sodertorn Univ, Sch Nat Sci Technol & Environm Studies, Huddinge, Sweden",Sodertorn University,"Remling, E (corresponding author), Sodertorn Univ, Sch Nat Sci Technol & Environm Studies, Huddinge, Sweden.",elise.remling@sh.se,,"Remling, Elise/0000-0003-2466-3506",,,,,36,14,14,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1740-5904,1740-5912,,CRIT DISCOURSE STUD,Crit.

In sub-Saharan Africa, attempts to understand AWP has seen a lamping of input values which paints an unrealistic picture of AWP. We employed the residual imputation method to isolate the marginal productivity value of water in six paddy farming systems viz. the conventional transplant and flooding system (CTFS), the system of rice intensification (SRI), and the Kilombero Plantation Limited (KPL) mechanized system. Findings showed that AWP for rainfed CTFS is 0.39 Kg/m(3) or 0.003 US$/m(3), irrigated CTFS (0.30 Kg/m(3) or 0.002 US$/m(3)), rainfed SRI (0.68 Kg/m(3) or 0.08 US$/m(3)), irrigated SRI (0.52 Kg/m(3) or 0.06 US$/m(3)), rainfed KPL (0.33 Kg/m(3) or 0.05 US$/m(3)), and irrigated KPL (0.68 Kg/m(3) or 0.11 US$/m(3)). This shows that rainfed systems have good AWP, especially physical ones. We recommend a rollout of rainfed SRI to secure local food security and downstream ecosystem services. In addition, groupings of farmers will assist in optimizing resources, stabilizing markets, and prices for the better economic value of water (US$/m(3)). Adoption of SRI will require intensive demonstration that needs public financing. In addition, revamping the KPL off-taker arrangement with small-holder farmers could also be a good PPP anchor.","[Sigalla, Onesmo Zakaria; Selemani, Juma Rajabu] Nelson MandelaAfrican Inst Sci & Technol, Nelson Mandera Rd,POB 447, Arusha, Tanzania; [Sigalla, Onesmo Zakaria] Water Right T Ltd, 109 Regent Estate,POB 8703, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Kadigi, Reuben Mpuya Joseph] Sokoine Univ Agr, Sch Agr Econ & Business Studies, POB 3007, Morogoro, Tanzania",Sokoine University of Agriculture,"Sigalla, OZ (corresponding author), Nelson MandelaAfrican Inst Sci & Technol, Nelson Mandera Rd,POB 447, Arusha, Tanzania.;Sigalla, OZ (corresponding author), Water Right T Ltd, 109 Regent Estate,POB 8703, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.",onesigalla@gmail.com,,"Kadigi, Reuben MJ/0000-0001-8676-1852; Sigalla Zakaria, Onesmo/0000-0001-6436-4645",Climate Research for Development (CR4D) Project-Tanzania.

Subsequently, adaptation decisions carry strong risks of under- or over-investment, and could lead to costly retrofitting or unnecessary high margins. To better allocate resources timely and effectively, and achieve long-term sustainability, planners could utilise adaptation pathways, revealing the path-dependencies of adaptation options. This helps to identify low-regret short-term decisions that preserve options in an uncertain future, while monitoring to detect signals to adapt. A major barrier to the application of adaptation pathways is limited experience. To facilitate this, here we generalize this pathways approach for six common coastal archetypes, resulting in generic pathways suitable to be adjusted to local conditions. This provides a much richer analysis of coastal adaptation than provided by any previous analysis, by assessing the solution space and options over time for a variety of coastal regions. Based on this analysis, we find that the number of adaptation options declines while sea-level rises. For some archetypes, it becomes clear that long-term thinking is needed now, about if, how and when to move to transformative options, such as planned retreat, which may presently not be considered or acceptable. Our analysis further shows that coastal adaptation needs to start earlier than anticipated, especially given time required for local debate and choice and to implement measures.","[Haasnoot, Marjolijn] Deltares, Delft, Netherlands; [Haasnoot, Marjolijn] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Brown, Sally; Nicholls, Robert J.] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England; [Brown, Sally] Bournemouth Univ, Bournemouth, Dorset, England; [Scussolini, Paolo] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Jimenez, Jose A.] Univ Politecn Catalunya BarcelonaTech, Barcelona, Spain; [Vafeidis, Athanasios T.] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Dept Geog, Kiel, Germany",Deltares; Utrecht University; University of Southampton; Bournemouth University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; University of Kiel,"Haasnoot, M (corresponding author), Deltares, Delft, Netherlands.;Haasnoot, M (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.",marjolijn.haasnoot@deltares.nl,"Brown, Sally/I-2662-2014; Jimenez, Jose A./I-7827-2014; Scussolini, Paolo/AAA-8133-2019; Jimenez, Jose A./N-3267-2019; Scussolini, Paolo/ABB-5247-2021; Brown, Sally/AAD-6943-2020; Vafeidis, Athanasios Thomas/Z-6053-2019; Nicholls, Robert James/ABD-1481-2020; Nicholls, Robert James/G-3898-2010; Haasnoot, Marjolijn/H-4827-2012","Brown, Sally/0000-0003-1185-1962; Jimenez, Jose A./0000-0003-0900-4684; Jimenez, Jose A./0000-0003-0900-4684; Scussolini, Paolo/0000-0001-6208-2169; Vafeidis, Athanasios Thomas/0000-0002-3906-5544; Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109; Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109; Haasnoot, Marjolijn/0000-0002-9062-4698","EUresearch projects RISES-AM [FP7-ENV-693396]; MINECO/AEI/FEDER, UE [CTM2017-83655-C2-1-R]","EUresearch projects RISES-AM; MINECO/AEI/FEDER, UE","This paper has been partly supported by the EUresearch projects RISES-AM-(FP7-ENV-693396.

From 1962 to 1966, a total of 58 intentionally buried skeletons were uncovered at the site. Diagnostic microliths indicative of the Qadan industry as well as the site's geology suggest an age of 14-12ka for these burials. In this study, the body proportions of the Jebel Sahaba sample are compared with those of a large (max N=731) sample of recent human skeletons from Europe, Africa and circumpolar North America, as well as to terminal Pleistocene Iberomaurusian' skeletons from the Algerian sites of Afalou-Bou-Rhummel and the later Capsian-associated Ain Dokhara specimen, as well as Natufian skeletons from the southern Levantine site of El Wad. Bivariate analyses distinguish Jebel Sahaba from European and circumpolar samples, but do not tend to segregate them from recent North or sub-Saharan African samples. Multivariate analyses (principal components analysis, principal coordinates analysis with minimum spanning tree and neighbour-joining cluster analyses) indicate that the body shape of the Jebel Sahaba humans is most similar to that of recent sub-Saharan Africans and different from that of either the Levantine Natufians or the northwest African Iberomaurusian' samples. Importantly, these results corroborate those of both Irish and Franciscus, who, using dental, oral and nasal morphology, found that Jebel Sahaba was most similar to recent sub-Saharan Africans and morphologically distinct from their penecontemporaries in other parts of North Africa or the groups that succeed them in Nubia.

This has been done by a formal comparative analysis of eight water management regimes, by using multi-value qualitative comparative analysis, focusing on the relationship between regime characteristics (as explanatory variables) and different levels of policy learning (as output value). This research has revealed the importance of the socio-cognitive dimension, as an essential emerging property of complex adaptive governance systems. This socio-cognitive dimension depends on a specific set of structural conditions; in particular, better integrated cooperation structures in combination with advanced information management are the key factors leading towards higher levels of policy learning. Furthermore, this research highlights a number of significant positive correlations between different regime elements, thereby identifying a stabilizing mechanism in current management regimes, and this research also highlights the necessity of fine-tuning centralized control with bottom-up approaches.

Using data collected in a survey of 338 citizens of Malmo, Sweden, we tested two hypotheses. H1: the motivation for personal decisions because they favour adaptation to the impacts of climate change correlates with the decision-making agent's knowledge of specific local impacts of climate change, and H2: the motivation for personal decisions because they favour mitigation of climate change correlates with the risk perception of the decision-making agent. While decisions made because they favour mitigation correlated with negative net values of expected impacts of climate change (risk perception), decisions made because they favour adaptation correlated with its absolute value unless tipping point behaviour occurred. Tipping point behaviour occurs here when the decision-making agent abstains from decisions in response to climate change in spite of a strongly negative or positive net value of expected impacts. Hence, the decision-making agents' lack of knowledge of specific climate change impacts inhibited decisions promoting adaptation. Moreover, positive experiences of climate change inhibited mitigation decisions. Discussing the results, we emphasised the importance of understanding the drivers of adaptation and mitigation decisions. In particular, we stress that attention needs to be paid to the balance between decisions solving problems 'here and now' and those focusing on the 'there and then'.","[Blennow, Kristina] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Landscape Architecture Planning & Management, SLU Alnarp, S-23422 Lomma, Sweden; [Persson, Johannes] Lund Univ, Dept Philosophy, S-22222 Lund, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Lund University,"Blennow, K (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Landscape Architecture Planning & Management, SLU Alnarp, S-23422 Lomma, Sweden.",Kristina.Blennow@slu.se; Johannes.Persson@fil.lu.se,"Persson, Johannes/HMD-4673-2023; Blennow, Kristina/D-7388-2016","Persson, Johannes/0000-0003-4568-1850; Blennow, Kristina/0000-0002-7602-5322",Swedish Energy Agency [45808-1]; Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences [M14-0138:1],Swedish Energy Agency(Swedish Energy AgencyMaterials & Energy Research Center (MERC)); Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences,"The research was supported by The Swedish Energy Agency, grant number 45808-1 (to K.B.) and The Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences, grant number M14-0138:1 (to J.P.).",,26,2,2,3,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,MAR,2021,10,3,,,,,,,240,10.3390/land10030240,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land10030240,,,13,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RE0JI,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000633851700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on the Eora database, this paper aims to constructs a multi-region input-output database of 185 countries or regions, analyzes a spatial correlation network of embodied net carbon transfer in global agricultural trade by using UCINET, selects multi-dimensional network measurement indicators, and comprehensively studies the global evolution characteristics and functional features of network plate role of embodied carbon transfer in the global agricultural trade. The result shows that the embodied net carbon transfer network of global agricultural trade is densely connected, the spatial correlation spillover effect is significant, and the edge of the network core structure is clear. On the one hand, the top four countries or regions in terms of embodied carbon outflow in agricultural trade are the USA, Australia, Vietnam, and China. On the other hand, the top four countries or regions of embodied carbon inflow are Malaysia, Central Africa, Singapore, and Serbia. From the perspective of outdegree, indegree, proximity centrality, and intermediary centrality, Cambodia, the Netherlands, Vietnam, Ghana, and South Africa, with the high frequency of the shortest path of the globally embodied net carbon transfer network, have a strong influence and linking facility in spatial correlation and have a strong control ability to the spatial correlation of other countries or regions. The embodied carbon emission network of global agricultural trade can be divided into four sectors: main spillover, two-way spillover, broker, and main benefit. The main spillover segment, constituted by the USA, India, Germany, and China, has significant embodied carbon spillover effects on the internal segment and other segments. It is the main embodied carbon spillover sector of embodied net carbon transfer of global agricultural trade.

Climate change is projected to increase sea level rise, coastal storm events, and natural resource scarcity, impacting coastal ecosystems and societies. These climate impacts intersect with other anthropogenic stressors contributing to the degradation of coastal habitats and ecosystems (driven by, among other things, development, encroachment and pollution), increasing the risk of coastal hazards. Given the complexities of coastal adaptation and the reality of scarce financial and human resources, policymakers must make challenging decisions regarding which adaptation strategies to prioritize. This study seeks to understand: 1) What approaches to coastal adaptation have been most commonly implemented in projects financed through multilateral adaptation funds? and 2) Were the projects designed to build climate-specific or broader adaptive capacity? Using a content analysis of project proposals for 60 coastal adaptation projects financed through multilateral adaptation funds across 39 countries (as well as two regional projects), we categorized adaptation approaches and assessed contributions to adaptive capacity. Our findings indicate that policy, planning, and capacity-building, as compared to more tangible implementation activities, have characterized most coastal adaptation projects in the past 15 years. We also found a common emphasis on climate-specific adaptive capacity which diverges from the widely discussed need to address climate change and development priorities synergistically. In the context of limited resources, decisions regarding which adaptation approaches to invest in inherently involves trade-offs that need to be explicitly acknowledged. While numerous regional studies have analyzed these trade-offs, our study provides a global context and identifies potential areas of underinvestment for coastal adaptation in developing countries.

Here, we present the results of a workshop process to connect researchers and practitioners across academia, industry, and government and to enable a multidisciplinary group of participants to coalesce on a set of cross-cutting issues and prioritise a research agenda to address and advance GI research and uptake in Australia. We found that many of the challenges were ubiquitous across regions and scales, but research in a few key priority areas could advance GI across multiple cities. The key research areas were: Attitudes & Perceptions of GI; Increasing Biodiversity through GI; Optimising Spatial Configuration and Composition for Multiple Benefits; Economic Valuation of GI; Metrics, Models and Tools for Benchmarking Assessments; and Turning Research into Policy and Implementation. Although participants saw that there were many synergies across the research topics, there were challenges of translating the science for decision making and of establishing long-term institutional collaborations. However, urgency for sound evidence to support policy development and planning will require an interdisciplinary process to be maintained so that clear communication can be established across sectors.","[Lin, Brenda B.] CSIRO Land & Water, Land & Water, Aspendale, Vic, Australia; [Meyers, Jacqui A.; Barnett, Guy B.] CSIRO Land & Water, Land & Water, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Lin, BB (corresponding author), CSIRO Land & Water, Private Bag 1, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia.",Brenda.Lin@csiro.au,"Lin, Brenda/O-3578-2019; Lin, Brenda B/A-8834-2011; Barnett, Guy/A-7034-2011","Lin, Brenda/0000-0002-6011-9172; Lin, Brenda B/0000-0002-6011-9172; Barnett, Guy/0000-0002-4991-9427",,,,,67,11,11,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0811-1146,1476-7244,,URBAN POLICY RES,Urban Policy Res.,JAN 2,2019,37,1,,,,,30,44,,10.1080/08111146.2018.1523054,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08111146.2018.1523054,,,15,Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,HW0HR,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000466362000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper uses a panel dataset of 311 selected Indian districts ranging from 1966 to 2009 to investigate how application of chemical fertilizers varies in response to rainfall shocks. Two rainfall shock measures are constructed based on deviation in rainfall from the normal, a categorical measure of rainfall shock; and another, a continuous index of negative rainfall deviation. Based on a panel fixed effect regression, the study finds no apparent reduction in the level of fertilizer use in negative rainfall shock years. However, with a one-year lagged rainfall shock, a reduction in fertilizer application rate is observed for the continuous drought index. Further, exposure to higher intensity droughts in the previous year leads to an increase in the amount of fertilizer application in the current year.","[Bora, Kaushik] Indian Stat Inst, Bangalore Ctr, Econ Anal Unit, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Bangalore,"Bora, K (corresponding author), Indian Stat Inst, Bangalore Ctr, Econ Anal Unit, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",kaushikbora1991@gmail.com,,"Bora, Kaushik/0000-0003-1259-1955",,,,,92,4,4,2,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

However, despite inhabiting glacial Europe, the Upper Paleolithic Europeans possessed high indices, prompting Trinkaus (1981) to argue for gene flow from warmer regions associated with modern human emergence in Europe. In contrast, Frayer et al. (1993) point out that Late Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic Europeans should not exhibit tropically-adapted limb proportions, since, even assuming replacement, their ancestors had experienced cold stress in glacial Europe for at least 12 millennia. This study investigates three questions tied to the brachial and crural indices among Late Pleistocene and recent humans. First, which limb segments (either proximal or distal) are primarily responsible for variation in brachial and crural indices? Second, are these indices reflective of overall limb elongation? And finally, do the Late Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic Europeans retain relatively and/or absolutely long limbs! Results indicate that in the lower limb, the distal limb segment contributes most of the variability to intralimb proportions, while in the upper limb the proximal and distal limb segments appear to be equally variable. Additionally, brachial and crural indices do not appear to be a good measure of overall limb length, and thus, while the Late Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic humans have significantly higher (i.e., tropically-adapted) brachial and crural indices than do recent Europeans, they also have shorter (i.e., cold-adapted) limbs. The somewhat paradoxical retention of tropical indices in the context of more cold-adapted limb length is best explained as evidence for Replacement in the European Late Pleistocene, followed by gradual cold adaptation in glacial Europe.

Given the complexity of climate change, assessing health impacts presents new challenges that may require different approaches compared to traditional applications of HIA. This research focuses on the development of health consequence scales suited to assessing and comparing health effects associated with climate change and applied within a HIA framework. This assists in setting priorities for adaptation plans to minimize the public health impacts of climate change. The scales presented in this paper were initially developed for a HIA of climate change in Perth in 2050, but they can be applied across spatial and temporal scales. The design is based on a health effects pyramid with health measures expressed in orders of magnitude and linked to baseline population and health data. The health consequence measures are combined with a measure of likelihood to determine the level of risk associated with each health potential health impact. In addition, a simple visual framework that can be used to collate, compare and communicate the level of health risks associated with climate change has been developed.","[Brown, Helen; Spickett, Jeffery] World Hlth Org Collaborating Ctr Environm Hlth Im, Sch Publ Hlth, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",World Health Organization,"Brown, H (corresponding author), World Hlth Org Collaborating Ctr Environm Hlth Im, Sch Publ Hlth, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",h.brown@curtin.edu.au; j.spickett@curtin.edu.au,,"Brown, Helen/0000-0001-9873-5969",Climate and Health Cluster - Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization Flagship Collaboration Fund,Climate and Health Cluster - Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization Flagship Collaboration Fund,This research was supported by the Climate and Health Cluster which is funded by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization Flagship Collaboration Fund.,,23,7,7,7,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The paper first describes SimCLIM and then focuses on a case study of the reliability of domestic RWH systems as the sole source of water in South East Queensland, a region of high spatial and temporal variability in rainfall. Using the SimCLIM scenario generator along with gridded daily time-series data and a domestic water tank model, 'risk landscapes' are created based on the risk of failure of the domestic systems to provide water under both current climate and scenarios of future change. Steep risk gradients were found, with major implications for RWH system configuration. Simulations are then performed in order to examine the trade-offs between two broad strategies - increasing runoff area and increasing tank size - required to maintain a reliable system. The paper concludes that, instead of set specifications, location-specific customisation of RWH systems is preferable in order to ensure reliability under current rainfall variability and sustainability over the long term under climate change. The availability of gridded daily rainfall datasets along with modelling tools like SimCLIM makes this customisation practicable.","[Warrick, R.; Ashford, G.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Sci Hlth Educ & Engn, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia; [Kouwenhoven, P.; Li, Y.; Urich, P.] CLIMsyst Ltd, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Ye, W.] Univ Waikato, Fac Sci & Engn, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of the Sunshine Coast; University of Waikato,"Warrick, R (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Sci Hlth Educ & Engn, Locked Bag 4, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia.",rwarrick@usc.edu.au,"Ashford, Graham/AAK-3974-2021","Ashford, Graham/0000-0002-8458-6218",,,,,14,8,8,0,18,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",2040-2244,2408-9354,,J WATER CLIM CHANGE,J.

Its use in agriculture includes animal feeding, manure treatment (e.g. as additive for bedding, composting, storage or anaerobic digestion), fertilizer component or direct soil application. Because the feedstock carbon is photosynthetically fixed CO2 from the atmosphere, producing and applying biochar is essentially a carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technology, which has a high-technology readiness level. However, for swift implementation of pyrogenic carbon capture and storage (PyCCS), biochar use in agriculture needs to deliver co-benefits, for example, by improving crop yields and ecosystem services and/or by improving climate change resilience by ameliorating key soil properties. Agronomic biochar research is a rapidly evolving field of research moving from less than 100 publications in 2010 to more than 15,000 by the end of 2020. Here, we summarize 26 rigorously selected meta-analyses published since 2016 that investigated a multitude of soil properties and agronomic performance parameters impacted by biochar application, for example, effects on yield, root biomass, water use efficiency, microbial activity, soil organic carbon and greenhouse gas emissions. All 26 meta-analyses show compelling evidence of the overall beneficial effect of biochar for all investigated agronomic parameters. One of the remaining challenges is the standardization of basic biochar analysis, still lacking in many studies. Incomplete biochar characterization increases uncertainty because adverse effects of individual studies included in the meta-analyses might be related to low-quality biochars, which would not qualify for certification and subsequent use (e.g. high content of contaminants, high salinity, incomplete pyrolysis, etc.). In summary, our systematic review suggests that biochar use in agriculture has the potential to combine CDR with significant agronomic and/or environmental co-benefits.","[Schmidt, Hans-Peter] Ithaka Inst, Ancienne Eglise 9, CH-1974 Arbaz, Switzerland; [Kammann, Claudia] Hsch Geisenheim Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, Geisenheim, Germany; [Hagemann, Nikolas] Ithaka Inst, Freiburg, Germany; [Hagemann, Nikolas; Leifeld, Jens; Bucheli, Thomas D.] Agroscope, Zurich, Switzerland; [Sanchez Monedero, Miguel Angel; Luz Cayuela, Maria] CSIC, CERAS, Dept Soil & Water Conservat & Waste Management, Espinardo, Spain",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC),"Schmidt, HP (corresponding author), Ithaka Inst, Ancienne Eglise 9, CH-1974 Arbaz, Switzerland.",schmidt@ithaka-institut.org,"Leifeld, Jens/A-3298-2014; Cayuela, Maria Luz/B-5612-2008; Leifeld, Jens/GYR-0349-2022; Sanchez-Monedero, Miguel A./B-7298-2011","Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Cayuela, Maria Luz/0000-0003-0929-4204; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Sanchez-Monedero, Miguel A./0000-0002-2233-7144; Hagemann, Nikolas/0000-0001-8005-9392; Schmidt, Hans-Peter/0000-0001-8275-7506","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; German Federal Ministry for Economy and Energy [ZF4203804SB8]; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [IZ08Zo_177346]; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [RTI2018-099417-B-I00]","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Federal Ministry for Economy and Energy; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; German Federal Ministry for Economy and Energy, Grant/ Award Number: ZF4203804SB8; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Number: IZ08Zo_177346; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, Grant/Award Number: RTI2018-099417-B-I00",,143,59,59,96,258,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1757-1693,1757-1707,,GCB BIOENERGY,GCB Bioenergy,NOV,2021,13,11,,,,,1708,1730,,10.1111/gcbb.12889,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcbb.12889,,SEP 2021,23,Agronomy; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Energy & Fuels,WF5RW,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000691887900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The influences of UHI intensity on the building energy consumption and temperature-related mortalities were then quantified. Results show that the impact of UHI on urban dwellers is not always negative in terms of building energy consumption and temperature-related mortality. In most severe-cold-region cities in China, UHI reduces the annual building energy consumption caused by the cooling and heating load, because the amount of heating load reduced in winter is larger than the cooling load increased in summer. The annual temperature-related mortality is also reduced by UHI in certain cities. These reductions indicate that UHI has favourable effects in certain regions.

This fact is a challenge to societies as they prepare for the consequences of climate change, especially with respect to the ocean. Here the authors review the requirements for human actions from the ocean's perspective. In the near term (similar to 2030), goals such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be critical. Over longer times (similar to 2050-2060 and beyond), global carbon neutrality targets may be met as countries continue to work toward reducing emissions. Both adaptation and mitigation plans need to be fully implemented in the interim, and the Global Ocean Observation System should be sustained so that changes can be continuously monitored. In the longer-term (after similar to 2060), slow emerging changes such as deep ocean warming and sea level rise are committed to continue even in the scenario where net zero emissions are reached. Thus, climate actions have to extend to time scales of hundreds of years. At these time scales, preparation for high impact, low probability risks - such as an abrupt showdown of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, ecosystem change, or irreversible ice sheet loss - should be fully integrated into long-term planning.","[Abraham, John] Univ St Thomas, Sch Engn, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Cheng, Lijing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Lijing] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Ocean Mega Sci, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Mann, Michael E.] Penn State, Dept Meteorol & Atmospher Sci, State Coll, PA USA; [Trenberth, Kevin] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [von Schuckmann, Karina] Mercator Ocean Int, Toulouse, France; [Trenberth, Kevin] Univ Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand","University of St Thomas Minnesota; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Auckland","Abraham, J (corresponding author), Univ St Thomas, Sch Engn, St Paul, MN 55105 USA.;Cheng, LJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Cheng, LJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Ocean Mega Sci, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",JPABRAHAM@stthomas.edu; chenglij@mail.iap.ac.cn,"Mann, Michael E/B-8472-2017; cheng, lijing/W-2261-2017; 郭, 青霞/GZH-2618-2022","Mann, Michael E/0000-0003-3067-296X; cheng, lijing/0000-0002-9854-0392; ","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB42040402]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42122046, 42076202]; National Science Foundation",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"L.

The urban environment is characterized by its sensitivity to small-scale meteorological, hydrological and environmental processes. These are generally not fully described in climate models, largely because of the models' insufficient spatial resolution. The Urban SIS climate service offers historical and future simulated data downscaled to 1 km x 1 km resolution over selected European metropolitan areas. The downscaled data are subsequently used as input to air quality and hydrological impact models, all made available to users as Essential Climate Variables and Sectoral Impact Indicators through a web portal. This paper presents the Urban SIS climate service and demonstrates its functionality in a case study in Stockholm city, Sweden. Good model performance was attained for intra-city temperature gradients and small-scale precipitation extremes. Less positive results were obtained for large-scale precipitation and hydrology, mainly due to an insufficient domain size in the meteorological and climate modelling, in turn related to the substantial computational requirements. An uncertainty classification approach was developed to aid the interpretation and user application of the data. We hope our lessons learnt will support future efforts in this direction.","[Gidhagen, Lars; Olsson, Jonas; Amorim, Jorge H.; Asker, Christian; Belusic, Danijel; Carvalho, Ana C.; Hundecha, Yeshewatesfa; Kornich, Heiner; Lind, Petter; Lindstedt, David; Olsson, Esbjorn; Rosberg, Jorgen; Segersson, David; Stromback, Lena] SMHI FoUh, Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Norrkoping 60176, Sweden; [Engardt, Magnuz] Environm & Hlth Adm, Box 8136, Stockholm 10420, Sweden",Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute,"Olsson, J (corresponding author), SMHI FoUh, Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Norrkoping 60176, Sweden.",jonas.olsson@smhi.se,"Segersson, David/AAP-3056-2021; Carvalho, Ana Cristina/ABH-4800-2020; Amorim, Jorge Humberto h/E-7515-2010; Belusic, Danijel/E-5672-2012","Segersson, David/0000-0002-5935-962X; Carvalho, Ana Cristina/0000-0001-5643-0307; Amorim, Jorge Humberto h/0000-0002-2074-7764; Belusic, Danijel/0000-0002-5665-3866; Stromback, Lena/0000-0001-5517-2940; Kornich, Heiner/0000-0003-0524-6440",EU Copernicus Climate Change Service [2015/C3S_441_Lot3_SMHI],EU Copernicus Climate Change Service,"The Urban SIS project was funded by EU Copernicus Climate Change Service, contract 2015/C3S_441_Lot3_SMHI.",,45,10,10,1,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,MAR,2020,31,,,,,,,,100549,10.1016/j.uclim.2019.100549,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2019.100549,,,20,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,LJ8SC,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000530430400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Budbreak number was evaluated to quantify seedling response to chilling and selection on excised and intact 1-year-old apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.) seedlings under controlled and natural environmental conditions. Indices based on: 1) the number and distribution of budbreak (prolonged dormancy grade = PDG); 2) the number of buds breaking, including shoot length with increased budbreak as part of the calculation (prolonged dormancy index = PDI); and 3) budbreak number per 100-cm shoot (NB) were tested in association with budbreak time (TB). The indices expressed the effects of cold treatments that induce earlier and higher numbers of budbreak. PDI and NB, but not PDG, identified families with increased budbreak. Seedlings with high PDG and NB were also associated with families in which high chill requiring parents were used, indicating that TB as pre-selection criterion may fail to identify seedlings with increased budbreak. Response to pre-selection for increased budbreak using PDG could be verified with the PDS and NB indices in seedlings and seedling clones. The NB of intact 1-year-old shoots under natural conditions is recommended as a pre-selection criterion against prolonged dormancy in suboptimal winter conditions.","S African Agr Res Council Fruit Vine & Wine Res I, ZA-7599 Stellenbosch, South Africa","Agricultural Research Council of South Africa; Institute for Deciduous Fruit, Vines & Wine, Agricultural Research Council","Labuschagne, IF (corresponding author), S African Agr Res Council Fruit Vine & Wine Res I, Private Bag X5013, ZA-7599 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",iwan@infruit.agric.za,,,,,,,33,5,5,0,2,AMER SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,ALEXANDRIA,"113 S WEST ST, STE 200, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2851 USA",0018-5345,2327-9834,,HORTSCIENCE,Hortscience,OCT,2003,38,6,,,,,1186,1190,,10.21273/HORTSCI.38.6.1186,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI.38.6.1186,,,5,Horticulture,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,743GD,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000186563300028,View Full Record in Web of Science

Strictly speaking, are retreat programs successful? Using an expansive intersectional justice approach to examine 138 post-resettlement case studies published between 2000 and 2021 across the Global North and South, we identified five typologies of success - techno-managerial, eco-restorative, compensatory, reformative, and transformative - and their trade-offs and synergies. Our meta-analysis incorporated a variety of metrics: relocation types, funding, decision making, socio-economic class, land use change, livelihood options, and social impacts. We found 26% of cases failed, 43% were successful, and 30% are on-going and therefore success was undetermined. The techno-managerial cases, while successful in the limited terms of relocating residents, paid little attention to equity and justice. The eco-restorative and compensatory cases reduced hazard exposure but revealed the synergies and tensions associated with social, ecological, and intergenerational justice. The reformative and transformative cases improved community wellbeing, rootedness, and access to livelihoods while incorporating diverse justice concerns to different degrees. By intersecting these typologies with multiple dimensions of justice, this study advances a novel planning and analytical tool for assessing the potential success or failure of current and future retreat programs.","[Ajibade, Idowu; Sullivan, Meghan; Lower, Chris] Portland State Univ, Dept Geog, 1721 SW Broadway, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Yarina, Lizzie] MIT, Sch Architecture & Planning, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Reilly, Allie] WSP, Climate Resilience & Sustainabil Team, New York, NY USA",Portland State University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Ajibade, I (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, Dept Geog, 1721 SW Broadway, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",jajibade@pdx.edu,,,Portland State University,Portland State University,"Funding for this research was provided by Portland State University (Faculty enhancement grant; Global Diversity Fund, and Vision 2025 Grant) .",,132,2,2,6,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

This affected economic activities, individual and community livelihoods and wellbeing especially in rural communities in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Drought's direct and indirect impacts on public health require urgent institutional responses, especially in South Africa's stride to eliminate HIV as a public health threat by 2030 in line with the UNAIDS goals. This paper draws on qualitative data from interviews and policy documents to discuss how the devastating effect of the 2015 drought experience in the rural Hlabisa sub-district of uMkhanyakude, a high HIV prevalence area, imposes an imperative for more proactive institutional responses to drought and other climate-related events capable of derailing progress made in South Africa's HIV/AIDS response. We found that drought had a negative impact on individual and community livelihoods and made it more difficult for people living with HIV to consistently engage with care due to economic losses from deaths of livestock, crop failure, food insecurity, time spent in search of appropriate water sources and forced relocations. It also affected government institutions and their interventions. Interviewed participants' reflections on drought-related challenges, especially those related to institutional and coordination challenges, showed that although current policy frameworks are robust, their implementation has been stalled due to complex reporting systems, and inadequate interdepartmental collaboration and information sharing. We thus argue that to address the gaps in the institutional responses, there is a need for more inclusive systems of drought-relief implementation, in which government departments, especially at the provincial and district levels, work with national institutions to better share data/information about drought-risks in order to improve preparedness and implementation of effective mitigation measures.","[Orievulu, Kingsley S.; Iwuji, Collins C.] Africa Hlth Res Inst, ZA-3935 Kwa Zulu, Mtubatuba, South Africa; [Orievulu, Kingsley S.; Iwuji, Collins C.] Univ Sussex, Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Dept Global Hlth & Infect, Brighton BN1 9PX, E Sussex, England; [Orievulu, Kingsley S.] Univ Johannesburg, Ctr Africa China Studies, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa",Africa Health Research Institute; University of Brighton; University of Sussex; University of Johannesburg,"Iwuji, CC (corresponding author), Africa Hlth Res Inst, ZA-3935 Kwa Zulu, Mtubatuba, South Africa.;Iwuji, CC (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Dept Global Hlth & Infect, Brighton BN1 9PX, E Sussex, England.",kingsley.orievulu@ahri.org; c.iwuji@bsms.ac.uk,,"Iwuji, Collins/0000-0003-2045-1717; Orievulu, Kingsley/0000-0002-6154-3231",,,,,32,1,1,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

This area contains parklands managed by New York City, the National Park Service, and other agencies, four sewage treatment plants, three former landfills, and urban and suburban communities, all of which were heavily impacted by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Here successful resilience planning and response requires participation from a wide variety of government and civil society players each with different types of knowledge, value systems, and expectations about what resilience means. To investigate how visions of future resilience differed among several communities living in or concerned with Jamaica Bay, New York, we deployed a free, Internet-based modeling framework called Visionmaker that enabled interactive scenario creation and testing. Through a series of standardized workshops, we recruited participants from a variety of different communities of practice (i.e. researchers, land managers, educators, non-governmental organization staff, and community board members) to design visions of resilience. Visions spanned terrestrial and marine environments and contained natural and built ecosystems. Most users favored increasing resilience through expanding salt marsh and green infrastructure while, for the most part, keeping the built city landscape of streets and buildings intact.

Growing use of fossil fuel and climate change are increasing O-3 concentrations to levels that threaten food supply. Historically, farmers have successfully adapted agricultural practices to cope with changing environments. However, high O-3 concentrations are a new threat to food production and possibilities for adaptation are not well understood. We simulate the impact of ozone damage on four key crops (wheat, maize, rice and soybean) on a global scale and assess the effectiveness of adaptation of agricultural practices to minimize ozone damage. As O-3 concentrations have a strong seasonal and regional pattern, the adaptation options assessed refer to shifting crop calendars through changing sowing dates, applying irrigation and using crop varieties with different growth cycles. Results show that China, India and the United States are currently by far the most affected countries, bearing more than half of all global losses and threatened areas. Irrigation largely affects ozone exposure but local impacts depend on the seasonality of emissions and climate. Shifting crop calendars can reduce regional O-3 damage for specific crop-location combinations (e.g. up to 25% for rain-fed soybean in India) but has little implication at the global level. Considering the limited benefits of adaptation, mitigation of O-3 precursors remains the main option to secure regional and global food production. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the aims of these models is to predict the effects of human activities on climate, and thus the delivery of information that is useful to devise mitigation actions. Moreover, if they can be properly downscaled to a regional and local level, they might be useful to deliver support for adaptation actions. For example, they may be used as an input for the better design of the features of buildings in order to make them resilient to climate modification, e.g., able to passively control heat flows to produce comfortable indoor conditions not only in the present climate, but also in future climate conditions. Taking into account the future weather scenarios that show an increase in the global temperature and climate severity, a likely consequence on building energy use will be a substantial shift from space heating to space cooling, and potentially uncomfortable thermal conditions during the summer will became a major challenge, both for new and existing buildings. In this paper, a deep energy retrofit of a child care centre located in Milan (Italy) is analysed on the basis of future weather scenarios; the analysis aims to identify to what extent choices that are made nowadays on the basis of a typical meteorological year may succeed to provide acceptable energy and indoor environmental performance throughout the future decades. The analysis confirms that climate change might require the installation of active cooling systems to compensate for harsher summer conditions over a long-term horizon, however, in the mid-term, passive cooling strategies combined with envelope refurbishment may still guarantee thermally comfortable conditions, and they will reduce energy cooling needs when active cooling is eventually installed.

Reliance on various diversification strategies and traditional risk sharing among kin and families has serious limitations, such as the problem of covariate risk within such networks. Index-based crop insurance could help to reduce people's climate-related risk, but raising the necessary capital to make insurance schemes financially secure is difficult for micro-insurance providers. We examine the extent to which spatial pooling of micro-insurance schemes could reduce these capital requirements. We simulate a hypothetical insurance market operating in Ethiopia, using rainfall data and yield estimates for 15 stations. By performing a Monte Carlo analysis, risk capital required to keep the probability of financial ruin below a threshold value is identified. We investigate the marginal benefits of pooling increasing numbers of sites, as well as the relationship between the benefits of pooling and the spatial covariance of rainfall. We find spatial diversification to offer considerable savings in required capitalization with as few as three sites pooled, as well as a weak but significant relationship between rainfall covariance and those benefits. The results suggest that spatial pooling may be an attractive option for micro-insurers, worthy of a detailed case-by-case analysis when designing index-insurance schemes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The role of two-dimensional (2D) landscape patterns in UHIs are well documented; while the effects and contributions of three-dimensional (3D) urban structures remain unclear, especially across different climatic zones. Here we investigated the relationship between 2D/3D urban morphology and the urban thermal environment in summer and winter during the day and at night in 62 representative large cities across four major climate zones in China. First, we extracted the seasonal surface regional heat island intensity (SRHII) using the MODIS 8-Day land surface temperature product. Subsequently, we constructed 25 2D and five 3D urban features and explored their relative importance and respective roles in UHIs in different climatic contexts. Results show that: (1) significant differences (p < 0.05) exist in SRHII between various climate zones; cities with a humid subtropical climate experience temperatures approximately 2 degrees C higher during the day in summer compared to those with the other climate types. (2) 3D urban features can effectively improve the interpretation of urban features for SRHII, with an average optimization level of 21%. (3) Urban trees have a higher cooling effect than other green spaces, whereas tall buildings can also reduce the UHI effect. (4) On summer days, equal proportions of tree to building volume provide the greatest cooling effects. This study provides new insights into the effect of 3D urban characteristics on SRHII and has promising implications for climate resilience planning and heat-related risk management","[Wu, Wan-Ben; Ma, Jun; Zhao, Bin] Fudan Univ, Minist Educ, Natl Observat & Res Stn Wetland Ecosyst Yangtze Es, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Wu, Wan-Ben; Ma, Jun; Zhao, Bin] Fudan Univ, Shanghai Inst EcoChongming SIEC, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Yu, Zhao-Wu] Fudan Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Fudan University; Fudan University,"Zhao, B (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Minist Educ, Natl Observat & Res Stn Wetland Ecosyst Yangtze Es, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.;Zhao, B (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Shanghai Inst EcoChongming SIEC, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.;Yu, ZW (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",wbwu19@fudan.edu.cn; zhaowu_yu@fudan.edu.cn; ma_jun@fudan.edu.cn; zhaobin@fudan.edu.cn,,"Wu, Wanben/0000-0002-0581-9774","National Key Research and Development Project of China [2021YFE0193100, 2018YFD0900806]; European Union [821016]; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai [19DZ1203405]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42171093]; Scientific and Innovative Action Plan of Shanghai [21ZR1408500]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [21PJ1401600]; Shanghai Key Lab for Urban Ecological Processes and Eco-Restoration [SHUES2021A02]; China Scholarship Council [202106100112]",National Key Research and Development Project of China; European Union(European Commission); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai(Science & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific and Innovative Action Plan of Shanghai; Shanghai Pujiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program); Shanghai Key Lab for Urban Ecological Processes and Eco-Restoration; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Project of China (grant numbers: 2021YFE0193100, 2018YFD0900806) , European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (Grant No. 821016) , the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai (grant number: 19DZ1203405) , the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number: 42171093) , Scientific and Innovative Action Plan of Shanghai (grant number: 21ZR1408500) , Shanghai Pujiang Program (grant number: 21PJ1401600) , Shanghai Key Lab for Urban Ecological Processes and Eco-Restoration (grant number: SHUES2021A02) and China Scholarship Council (grant no. 202106100112) .",,59,9,9,89,122,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-2046,1872-6062,,LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN,Landsc.

In contrast, when analysed independently of their real-world usage for informing decision-making, the tendency can be to prioritise their representative role rather than their instrumental role. This paper takes as a case study the development of the UK Climate Projections 2009 in relation to its probabilistic treatment of uncertainties and the implications of this approach for adaptation decision-making. It is considered that the move towards ensemble-based probabilistic climate projections has the benefit of encouraging organisations to reshape their adaptation strategies and decisions towards a risk-based approach, where they are confronted definitively with climate modelling uncertainties and drawn towards a more nuanced understanding of how climate impacts could affect their operations. This is further illustrated through the example of the built environment sector, where it can be seen that the probabilistic approach may be of limited salience for the urban heat island in the absence of a corresponding effort towards a more place-based analysis of climate vulnerabilities. Therefore, further assessment of the adequacy-for-purpose of climate models might also consider the usability of climate projections at the urban scale.","Sci Po, Medialab, F-75337 Paris 07, France",,"Heaphy, LJ (corresponding author), Sci Po, Medialab, 27 Rue St Guillaume, F-75337 Paris 07, France.",liam.heaphy@sciencespo.fr,,,Sustainable Consumption Institute's former Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) at the University of Manchester,Sustainable Consumption Institute's former Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) at the University of Manchester,"My thanks to Wendy Parker, Joel Katzav, and the two anonymous reviewers for their very helpful comments and critiques, and to Suraje Dessai, for recommending my research to the guest editors for this special issue.

In contrast, in the satyrine butterfly Ypthima multistriata Butler, local populations with different voltinism patterns are geographically intermingled, suggesting that life-history traits related to diapause may differ even between geographically and phylogenetically close populations. In this study, we experimentally examined the critical photoperiod for diapause induction and the larval developmental period in two univoltine and two bivoltine populations of Y. multistriata, all of which inhabit virtually the same latitude ( 34.652-34.750 degrees N). We found that the critical photoperiod for diapause induction was longer in the univoltine populations than in the bivoltine populations. Moreover, the larval period under the long day length treatment was different among populations in both sexes, although significant differences were also detected between populations with the same voltinism. These results indicate that in Y. multistriata, life-history traits related to diapause can not be attributed merely to climatic conditions such as temperature or day length, which depend largely on latitude.

However, the present results demonstrate that short-term exposure to freezing can release bud dormancy in Betula pubescens (Ehrh.) and B. pendula (Roth). Short-term freezing during the dormancy induction phase improved the release of bud dormancy only if an adequate level of dormancy had been reached. In fully dormant or chilled plants both the percentage and the speed of bud-burst increased, the more so the lower the temperature. Our results rule out the possibility that endogenous abscisic acid could be directly involved in the physiological control of bud dormancy release. The fast, easily applicable method presented here for bud dormancy release could further investigations into the biochemical and biophysical background to the process. The mechanisms of bud dormancy release and its relationship to cold acclimation are discussed in the light of these results, as also are the implications of the findings for modelling of bud dormancy.","UNIV OULU, DEPT BIOL, FIN-90571 OULU, FINLAND; UNIV JOENSUU, FAC FORESTRY, FIN-80101 JOENSUU, FINLAND; UNIV OULU, DEPT CHEM, FIN-90571 OULU, FINLAND",University of Oulu; University of Eastern Finland; University of Oulu,,,,,,,,,45,28,36,2,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0140-7791,1365-3040,,PLANT CELL ENVIRON,Plant Cell Environ.,SEP,1997,20,9,,,,,1199,1204,,10.1046/j.1365-3040.1997.d01-148.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3040.1997.d01-148.x,,,6,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,XX606,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:A1997XX60600012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Whether such adjustments are accomplished often depends upon the presence of institutional entrepreneurship: actors who take responsibility to initiate the necessary actions to redesign existing institutional practices. The question arises under which conditions can institutional entrepreneurship be developed? And, what might be the cause of lacking institutional entrepreneurship?In this article, the latter question is examined through in-depth collaborative research project for exploring alternative, adaptive flood risk strategies for flood proofing the unembanked area of the north-end of the city district Feijenoord in Rotterdam. Due to climate change, these areas are increasingly vulnerable to flooding. The traditional, institutionalized solution of raising the ground level before initiating new spatial developments does not suffice in the long term. Therefore, the city government explored alternative strategies for more adaptive ways of dealing with flood risks. Together with representatives of key stakeholders in the area, two key strategies for the unembanked areas were elaborated. These strategies have significant implications for the distribution of costs, risks and responsibilities and necessitate alternative governance architectures that exceed the current institutional structures.During the research project, it became clear that the developed alternative strategies fundamentally differed from the current institutional system. Thus, institutional redesign was necessary. This proved to be virtually impossible, especially because none of the involved actors was willing nor capable of undertaking entrepreneurial activities to start such redesign. This observation led us to further investigate into the causes and the consequences of the absent entrepreneurship.","[Duijn, Michael; van Buuren, Arwin] Erasmus Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Sociol, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Duijn, M (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Sociol, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",duijn@fsw.eur.nl,"van Buuren, Arwin/I-6240-2013","van Buuren, Arwin/0000-0002-8504-0495",,,,,53,0,0,1,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1449-4035,1839-3373,,POLICY SOC,Policy Soc.,,2017,36,4,,,,,575,594,,10.1080/14494035.2017.1369615,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14494035.2017.1369615,,,20,Political Science; Public Administration,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Government & Law; Public Administration,FQ9NN,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000418689000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Governing weather and climate services (WCS) for farmers,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Weather and climate services; Governance; Agro-meteorological services; Climate adaptation; Co-creation; Participation,BOUNDARY ORGANIZATIONS; INFORMATION; SCIENCE,"High-quality weather and climate services (WCS) can be critical for communicating knowledge about current and future weather and climate risks for adaptation and disaster risk management in the agricultural sector. This paper investigates the structure and performance of weather and climate services for farmers from a governance perspective. Empirically the paper compares the institutional design and operations of agro-meteorological services in Maharashtra/India and Norway through a 'most different case study' approach. The two cases were selected to represent great diversity in location, scale and institutional design. A governance approach based on semi-direct interviews and policy and institutional analysis was combined with local survey data of farmers' perceptions and use of the services. Despite the fact that the context for the two agromet advisory services was very different from a climate-weather, eco-agriculture and socio-institutional angle, the analysis reveals great similarities in the services structures and critical governance challenges. In both countries the agromet services communicated knowledge that was largely perceived not to be well tailored to farmers' needs for decisions in specific crops- and farm operations, spatially too coarse to address local issues, and, often unreliable or inaccurate in terms of the quality of data. Farmers did, however, respond positively to specific and locally relevant information on e.g., warnings about high rainfall and spread of pests. Observing such similarities across very diverse contexts enhances the generalization potential, precisely because they evolved under very different circumstances. Similar observations find support in the wider WCS literature. Based on the empirical findings, we propose a more deliberate approach to institutional design of WCS in order to enhance governance performance and co-creation of the services at local, district and national scales. It is suggested that greater participation of farmers and agricultural extension agents in the co-creation of these services is a necessary means of improving the services, supported by the WCS literature. However, we insist that greater participation is only likely to materialize if the deficiencies in institutional design and knowledge quality and relevance are addressed to greater extent than done today. The comparison between the two services shows that Norway can learn from India that a more ambitious scope and multiple forms of communication, including the use of social media/WhatsApp groups, can facilitate greater awareness and interest among farmers in multi-purpose agromet services for multi-way communication. India can learn from Norway that a more integrated and decentralized institutional design can strengthen the network attributes of the services, foster co-creation, and improve participation of both poor and large-scale farmers and extension agents.","[Vedeld, Trond; Hofstad, Hege] Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Norwegian Inst Urban & Reg Res NIBR, Postbox 4,St Olavs Plass, N-0130 Oslo, Norway; [Mathur, Mihir] India Habitat Ctr, Energy & Resource Inst TERI, Lodhi Rd, New Delhi 110003, India; [Buker, Patrick] Univ York, Dept Environm & Geog, York Ctr, Stockholm Environm Inst, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Stordal, Frode] Univ Oslo, Sect Meteorol & Oceanog, Gaustadalleen 210349 OSLO,Forskningspk, N-0315 Oslo, Norway; [Mathur, Mihir] DESTA Res LLP, New Delhi, India",Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet); University of York - UK; University of Oslo,"Vedeld, T (corresponding author), Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Norwegian Inst Urban & Reg Res NIBR, Postbox 4,St Olavs Plass, N-0130 Oslo, Norway.",trondv@oslomet.no; hegeh@oslomet.no; mihir09mathur@gmail.com; patrick.bueker@giz.de; frode.stordal@geo.uio.no,,"Vedeld, Trond/0000-0001-9618-9757",Research Council of Norway (RCN) [240018],Research Council of Norway (RCN)(Research Council of Norway),Funded by the Research Council of Norway (RCN) under the project GovClimServices (2015-2018) no. 240018.,,41,8,8,0,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Changes in climate conditions have a direct influence on the external conditions for buildings and, thus, on their energy demand. In this context, computer aided simulation provides handy tools that help in assessing this impact. This paper investigates climate data for future scenarios and the effect on energy demand in office buildings in Chile. This data has been generated in the 9 climatic zones that are representative of the main inhabited areas, for the years 2020, 2050 and 2080. Predictions have been produced for the acknowledged A2 'medium-high' Greenhouse Gases emissions GHG scenario, pursuant the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The effect of climate change on the energy demand for office buildings is optimized by implementing the calculation procedure of ISO-13790:2008, based on iterations of its envelope and form. As a result, this research clarifies how future climate scenarios will affect the energy demand for different types of office buildings in Chile, and how their shape and enclosure can be optimized.

J,"Warner, K",,,,"Warner, Koko",,,Global environmental change and migration: Governance challenges,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Environmentally induced migration; Governance; Complexity; Climate adaptation; Resilience,REFUGEES,"Claims have been made that global environmental change could drive anywhere from 50 to almost 700 million people to migrate by 2050. These claims belie the complexity of the multi-causal relationship between coupled social-ecological systems and human mobility, yet they have fueled the debate about environmentally induced migration. Empirical evidence, notably from a 23 case study scoping study supported by the European Commission, confirms that currently environmental factors are one of many variables driving migration. Fieldwork reveals a multifaceted landscape of patterns and contexts for migration linked to rapid- and slow-onset environmental change today. Migration and displacement are part of a spectrum of possible responses to environmental change. Some forms of environmentally induced migration may be adaptive, while other forms of forced migration and displacement may indicate a failure of the social-ecological system to adapt. This diversity of migration potentials linked to environmental change presents challenges to institutions and policies not designed to cope with the impacts of complex causality, surprises and uncertainty about social-ecological thresholds, and the possibility of environmental and migration patterns recombining into a new patterns. The paper highlights fieldwork on rapid- and slow-onset environmentally induced migration in Mozambique, Vietnam, and Egypt. Current governance frameworks for human mobility are partially equipped to manage new forms of human mobility, but that new complementary modes of governance will be necessary. The paper concludes with challenges for governance of environmentally induced migration under increasing complexity, as well as opportunities to enhance resilience of both migrants and those who remain behind.

Deltas are densely populated and often subject to high risk. Climate-proof planning is, however, not only a new but also a highly complex task that poses problems for existing institutional and administrative structures, which are the product of times in which climate issues were of little importance. This paper assesses the capacity of the historically grown Dutch planning institutions to promote climate-proof planning for flood-prone areas. The Adaptive Capacity Wheel provides the methodological framework. The analysis focuses on two planning projects in the west of the Netherlands: the Zuidplas Polder project at the regional level and the Westergouwe project at the local level. It is shown that the planning institutions involved in these projects enable climate-proof planning, but to a limited extent. They face five institutional weaknesses that may cause risks on the long term. To climate-proof urban developments in flood-prone areas, it is necessary to break through the strong path-dependent development of planning institutions and to build in more flexibility in existing rules and procedures.","[van den Brink, Margo] Univ Groningen, Dept Spatial Planning & Environm, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Meijerink, Sander] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Termeer, Catrien] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands; [Gupta, Joyeeta] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Groningen; Radboud University Nijmegen; Wageningen University & Research; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Termeer, C (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",m.a.van.den.brink@rug.nl; s.meijerink@fm.ru.nl; katrien.termeer@wur.nl; joyeeta.gupta@ivm.vu.nl,"Meijerink, Sander V/D-6490-2012; Gupta, Joyeeta/L-8672-2013; Termeer, Katrien/C-6057-2015","Meijerink, Sander V/0000-0002-4249-6230; van den Brink, Margo/0000-0001-8247-3044; Gupta, Joyeeta/0000-0003-1424-2660",Netherlands BSIK-Programme Climate changes Spatial Planning (CcSP),Netherlands BSIK-Programme Climate changes Spatial Planning (CcSP),"This paper has been written within the project entitled: 'IC12: Institutions for Adaptation: The Capacity and Ability of the Dutch Institutional Framework to Adapt to Climate Change', funded by the Netherlands BSIK-Programme Climate changes Spatial Planning (CcSP).",,62,23,23,4,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

We found that peak metabolic rates were lower in aquatic than terrestrial habitats and increased with body mass, latitude and the optimal temperature.

For both models, a global sensitivity analysis was performed under current temperatures, an increase of 2 and 4 degrees C, in combination with -50 %, -25 %, current, +25 % and +50 % precipitation change, resulting in 15 combinations. The analysis was done for six different sites in Europe located in Germany, France, and the Czech Republic. The two models differ in model formalism; however, results show that the most sensitive parameters of WOSR for both models are associated with drought, both under current climatic conditions, and under changing temperatures and precipitation regimes. The sensitivity analysis shows that the most sensitive parameters for WOSR yield under climate change relate to plant traits affecting the growth of the vegetative phase.","[Pullens, Johannes Wilhelmus Maria; Olesen, Jorgen Eivind] Aarhus Univ, Dept Agroecol, Blichers Alle 20, Tjele 8830, Denmark; [Kersebaum, Kurt Christian] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Boettcher, Ulf; Kage, Henning] Univ Kiel, Inst Crop Sci & Plant Breeding, Hermann Rodewald Str 9, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Kersebaum, Kurt Christian; Olesen, Jorgen Eivind] CAS, Global Change Res Inst, Belidla 986-4b, Brno 60300, Czech Republic",Aarhus University; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); University of Kiel; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Pullens, JWM (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Agroecol, Blichers Alle 20, Tjele 8830, Denmark.",jwmp@agro.au.dk,"Kersebaum, Kurt/A-7558-2010; Olesen, Jørgen E/C-2905-2016; Olesen, Jørgen/Y-2857-2019; Pullens, Johannes/L-2135-2019","Kersebaum, Kurt/0000-0002-3679-8427; Olesen, Jørgen E/0000-0002-6639-1273; Olesen, Jørgen/0000-0002-6639-1273; Pullens, Johannes/0000-0003-4581-6444",EU-FP7; FACCE-JPI; Danish Innovation Foundation; MACSUR project - German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) [2812ERA147]; SustEs project [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000797],EU-FP7(European Commission); FACCE-JPI; Danish Innovation Foundation; MACSUR project - German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL); SustEs project,"This work was part of SYBRACLIM, a project supported by EU-FP7 and FACCE-JPI.

Along with identifying general trends, we examine how demographic and ideological factors, as well as past weather experience, may affect these expectations individuals express. Through our analysis of a state-wide survey of Oklahomans in 2019, we find that Oklahomans, on average, expect a cooler, wetter future than most climate projections suggest. One's future temperature expectations were significantly related to gender, age, political affiliation, and perceptions about recent temperatures. In particular, females, Democrats, Millennials, and those who thought the past 3 years were hotter than average were more likely to expect warmer futures. Meanwhile, precipitation expectations were significantly related to one's recent drought and extreme rainfall experience, age, and race. Our results also suggest that expressed expectations of future temperatures are more likely to be influenced by ideological and demographic variables than expectations of future precipitation.","[Eschliman, Carley M.] Natl Weather Ctr, Res Experiences Undergrad Program, Norman, OK 73072 USA; [Eschliman, Carley M.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Kuster, Emma; Wootten, Adrienne M.] South Cent Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Norman, OK USA; [Ripberger, Joseph] Univ Oklahoma, Natl Inst Risk & Resilience, Norman, OK 73019 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Cornell University; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Eschliman, CM (corresponding author), Natl Weather Ctr, Res Experiences Undergrad Program, Norman, OK 73072 USA.;Eschliman, CM (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",cme73@cornell.edu,,"Wootten, Adrienne/0000-0001-6004-5823; Eschliman, Carley/0000-0003-1522-2303","National Science Foundation [AGS-1560419, OIA-1301789]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research was funded by the National Science Foundation (AGS-1560419; OIA-1301789).,,35,3,3,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Future coastal inundation is mainly influenced by storm surge and rising sea level. The sea level rises projected by the A1FI, A1B and B1 emissions scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are considered. The effects of economic and population growth are accounted for by three urban development scenarios: (a) business as usual, (b) urban consolidation and (c) regional development. The adaptation policy actions investigated include a 'protect' stance (involving the construction of seawalls), an 'accommodate' stance that mandates raising house floors to a certain height (e.g. at heights of 100-year events) and an 'avoid' stance that limits new developments in hazardous areas. Policy stances classified as reactive (i.e. action taken after damage being incurred) and anticipatory (i.e. action taken anticipating what will happen) are developed for asset investment choices. In general, adaptation costs are an order of magnitude lower than benefits gained from avoided damages. The results highlight that adaptation action for coastal inundation has a no-regrets character and provides a strong case for reform to ensure that Australia-wide adaptation opportunities are realised.","[Wang, Chi-Hsiang; Khoo, Yong Bing; Wang, Xiaoming] CSIRO, Land & Water Flagship, POB 56,37 Graham Rd, Highett, Vic 3190, Australia; [Baynes, Tim] CSIRO, Land & Water Flagship, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [McFallan, Stephen; Quezada, George] CSIRO, Land & Water Flagship, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [West, Jim; Herr, Alexander; Beaty, R.

Coastal communities facing socio-economic stress, like densely populated Sundarbans, are the most affected part of the world, exposed to climate change problems and uncertainties. This article explores the successes of a socio-environmental project implemented at Indian Sundarbans targeted towards economic improvement and aims at communicating environmental conservation through organized community participation. Case description: Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and the wealth rank tool (WRT) were used to form a group based organization with 2100 vulnerable families to give them knowledge about capacity building, disaster management, resource conservation and sustainable agriculture practices. Training was conducted with the selected group members on resource conservation, institution building, alternative income generation activities (AIGA) like, Poultry, Small business, Tricycle van, Organic farming and disaster management in a participatory mode. The climate change 'problems-solutions' were communicated to this socio-economically marginalized and ostracized community through participatory educational theater (PET). Discussion and evaluation: WRT revealed that 45 % of the population was under economic stress. Out of 2100 beneficiaries', 1015 beneficiaries' started organic farming, 133 beneficiaries' adopted poultry instead of resource exploitive livelihood and 71 beneficiaries' engaged themselves with small business, which was the success stories of this project. To mitigate disaster, 10-committees were formed and the endemic knowledge about climate change was recorded by participatory method validated through survey by structured questionnaire. As a part of this project 87 ha of naked deforested mudflat was reclaimed with endangered mangroves involving target community members aimed to sequester CO2, control soil erosion and act as a barrier during natural disasters. Conclusion: This case study concluded that participatory method of communication, aiming not only to communicate theoretical knowledge, but also to devise adaptation strategies through conservation of endemic knowledge, popularizing sustainability through Micro Finance Institutions and promoting AIGA along with motivating vulnerable community to restore degraded forest lands, could be a effective solution to practically combat climate change problems.","[Chowdhury, Abhiroop; Maiti, Subodh Kumar] Indian Sch Mines, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Dhanbad 826004, Bihar, India; [Bhattacharyya, Santanu] Tagore Soc Rural Dev, 46B ArabindaSarani, Kolkata 700005, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines) Dhanbad,"Chowdhury, A (corresponding author), Indian Sch Mines, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Dhanbad 826004, Bihar, India.",abhiroop.chowdhury@gmail.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Maiti, Subodh Kumar/J-2031-2019; Chowdhury, Abhiroop/R-3309-2018","Maiti, Subodh Kumar/0000-0001-9850-8408; Chowdhury, Abhiroop/0000-0001-6985-0722","KKS (Karl Kubel Stiftung fur kind und de Familie, Beneheim-Germany); BMZ (Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany) [TSRD-42400]; implementing organization Tagore Society for Rural Development, Kolkata","KKS (Karl Kubel Stiftung fur kind und de Familie, Beneheim-Germany); BMZ (Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany); implementing organization Tagore Society for Rural Development, Kolkata","This project (People's empowerment towards restoring mangrove vegetation and resource conservation) is funded by KKS (Karl Kubel Stiftung fur kind und de Familie, Beneheim-Germany) and BMZ (Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany) for the period of 2012-2015 extendable till 2016 (Grant ID: Partners Agreement TSRD-42400, 2012-2015).

Through media analysis, it examines the ways debate over bushfire protection policy was framed and made culturally meaningful, thereby politically consequential, in the wake of the worst bushfires in modern Australian history, Black Saturday (2009). The fires, in which 173 people died, led to a Royal Commission and fierce debate over the use of prescribed burning to reduce bushfire hazard. Longitudinal analysis of local, state and national mainstream media coverage (2009-2016) reveals blame games that targeted environmentalists and the government, which near-silenced meaningful discussion of the complexity of fire science, impacts of climate change on weather conditions, and calls for adaptation. By exploring the media's constitutive role in crisis response, the paper highlights the legacy and potency of ideological conflict that shapes the media-policy nexus in Australia.","[Anderson, Deb; Chubb, Philip; Djerf-Pierre, Monika] Monash Univ, Sch Media Film & Journalism, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Djerf-Pierre, Monika] Univ Goteborg, Dept Journalism Media & Commun, Gothenburg, Sweden",Monash University; University of Gothenburg,"Anderson, D (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Media Film & Journalism, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",deb.anderson@monash.edu,,"Anderson, Deb/0000-0001-5245-7166; Djerf-Pierre, Monika/0000-0001-7754-0636",Monash University,Monash University(Monash University),This work was supported by Monash University under a Faculty of Arts Research Project Seed Fund grant.,,55,24,24,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1752-4032,1752-4040,,ENVIRON COMMUN,Environ.

Such effects are typically framed as both unpredictable and disruptive, and are thus said to create large new risks to the water sector demanding adaptive responses. This article examines how such responses are mediated by, and also compromised by, two dominant trends in the evolution of water governance institutions: (1) the rise of an integrated paradigm of water resources management, which has encouraged the development of more complex and interconnected water institutions, and (2) the rapidly changing political economy of water financing and investment. Each of these trends carries its own strong presumptions about what constitutes water-related risk and how such risk is properly managed. The article uses the specific example of large dam projects to illustrate how these ongoing trends in water governance shape and complicate the prospect of managing climate-water risks.","[Conca, Ken] Amer Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Conca, K (corresponding author), Amer Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",conca@american.edu,,,,,,,41,8,8,0,4,WATER ALTERNATIVES ASSOC,MONTPELLIER,"VILLA D ASSAS, 457 AVENUE DU PERE SOULAS, MONTPELLIER, 34090, FRANCE",1965-0175,,,WATER ALTERN,Water Altern.,OCT,2015,8,3,,,,,301,316,,,,,,16,Environmental Studies; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,DA3RP,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000367716500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In a period when historical analogues become less meaningful, we need to forge new practices and methods of environmental monitoring and management, including how to categorize, manage, and analyze the deluge of environmental data. In particular, we need practices to detect emerging hazards, changing baselines, and amplified risk. Some current data practices, however, especially the designation and dismissal of outliers, might mislead efforts to better adapt to new environmental conditions. In this article we ask these questions: What are the politics of determining what counts as abnormal and is worthy of exclusion in an era of the ever-changing normal? What do data exclusions, often in the form of outliers, do to our ability to understand and regulate in the Anthropocene? We identify a recursive process of distortion at play where constructing categories of abnormal-normal allows for the exclusion of outliers from data sets, which ultimately produces a false rarity and hides environmental changes. To illustrate this, we draw on a handful of examples in regulatory science and management, including the Exceptional Event Rule of the Clean Air Act, beach erosion models for nourishment projects, and the undetected ozone hole. We conclude with a call for attention to the construction of normal and abnormal events, systems, data, and natures in the Anthropocene.","[Clifford, Katherine R.; Travis, William R.] Univ Colorado, Western Water Assessment, Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; [Travis, William R.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Clifford, KR (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Western Water Assessment, Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80302 USA.",katie.clifford@colorado.edu; william.travis@colorado.edu,,"Travis, William/0000-0002-9197-1317; Clifford, Katherine/0000-0002-1385-8765",Western Water Assessment - U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under Climate Program Office [NA10OAR4310214WWA],Western Water Assessment - U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under Climate Program Office,"Parts of this work was supported by the Western Water Assessment, funded by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under Climate Program Office grant #NA10OAR4310214WWA.",,71,1,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2469-4452,2469-4460,,ANN AM ASSOC GEOGR,Ann.

Buoyant foundation retrofits offer under-resourced communities a viable and affordable adaptation alternative to buy-outs, tear-downs, and displacement by climate change. Amphibious strategies will not solve all challenges related to the increased impacts of climate change on heritage architecture, but offer a resilient option for communities to protect their physical history and cultural identity. This paper will provide an overview of amphibious retrofit construction and its application to the preservation of historic buildings and neighborhoods. It will provide several case study examples, namely, retrofits of heritage buildings in the historically significant African-American community of Princeville, North Carolina; for a low-income neighborhood of freedman's cottages in Charleston, South Carolina; and a creative approach for amphibiating architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's iconic Farnsworth House in Plano, Illinois.

Moreover, these islands face the problem of expensive and unreliable electricity supply. The large number of island communities further magnifies the difficulty of reaching universal sustainable electricity supply. Off-grid electrification technologies promise to tackle this challenge entailing high investments yet also market potential. Currently both aspects - electricity access and climate resilience - are barely linked in electrification planning. Energy planning in a region highly affected by climate change requires integrative planning considering these risks. Here, to enhance integrative planning, we study the status quo of energy access and risk exposure of non-electrified Southeast Asian islands. We identify 1932 islands with a population greater than 21 million having limited access to electricity. Our study reveals three risk-specific island archetypes, which need different technical measures to enhance climate resiliency of future electricity systems. We conclude that future energy planning in Southeast Asia requires climate resilience as an additional planning dimension. The identified cluster groups serve as a blueprint for decision makers to support measures improving energy systems' resilience avoiding expensive re-investments in the future.","[Lammers, Katrin; Bertheau, Paul; Blechinger, Philipp] Reiner Lemoine Inst gGmbH, Berlin, Germany; [Lammers, Katrin] Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Bertheau, Paul] Europa Univ Flensburg, Flensburg, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Lammers, K (corresponding author), Reiner Lemoine Inst gGmbH, Berlin, Germany.;Lammers, K (corresponding author), Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",katrin.lammers@rl-institut.de; philipp.blechinger@rl-institut.de,,"Lammers, Katrin/0000-0001-6953-9993",Heinrich Boll Foundation; Reiner Lemoine Foundation,Heinrich Boll Foundation; Reiner Lemoine Foundation,"K.

The event significantly increased topic knowledge among all participants and, among those with a worldview predisposing them to lower risk perceptions, significantly increased problem identification and concern about impacts. These results suggest small-group deliberation focused on local problem-solving may be an effective tool for reducing the polarizing effects of cultural worldviews on decision-making.

The 2014 IPCC Fifth Assessment Report identified Southeast Asia as the most vulnerable coastal region in the world, and highlighted the potential distribution of impacts and risks of climate change in the region. While climate hazards may differ across geographical regions, the impact of climate extremes on food production will affect marginal farmers, fishers and poor urban consumers disproportionately, as they have limited capacities to adapt to and recover from extreme weather events. Governments and other stakeholders need to respond to climate extremes and incorporate adaptation into national development plans. Unfortunately, there is still limited peer-review publication on the subject matter. This paper presents some findings from research on observed and projected loss and damage inflicted by climate extremes on agricultural crops in Southeast Asia.","[Lassa, Jonatan A.; Goh, Tian] Nanyang Technol Univ, Ctr Nontradit Secur Studies, S Rajaratnam Sch Int Studies, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Lai, Allen Yu-Hung] ESSEC Business Sch, Inst Hlth Econ & Management, 2 One North Gateway, Singapore 138502, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; ESSEC Business School,"Lai, AYH (corresponding author), ESSEC Business Sch, Inst Hlth Econ & Management, 2 One North Gateway, Singapore 138502, Singapore.",jonatan.lassa@gmail.com; allen.lai@essec.edu; istgoh@ntu.edu.sg,"Lassa, Jonatan/D-2205-2017; Lassa, Jonatan/M-6112-2019","Lassa, Jonatan/0000-0002-8432-842X; Lassa, Jonatan/0000-0002-8432-842X; Goh, Tian/0000-0002-8702-4907",,,,,29,12,12,8,72,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

Insurance and home retrofits could reduce household welfare losses due to flood events. Yet even after disasters, households often fail to take risk mitigation actions. This paper presents the first randomized field experiment that tests the effect of information provision on household uptake of flood insurance and home retrofits. A sample of 364 flood-prone households in Bangkok was randomly split into treatment and control groups. The treatment group received practical details on home retrofits and flood insurance as well as social information regarding the insurance purchase decisions of peers. Results indicate that the information intervention increased insurance purchases by about five percentage points, while no effect was detected for home retrofits. This effect is nearly equal to the increase in uptake that the national insurance program in Thailand has achieved through all other means since its establishment in 2012. If scaled up to include all uninsured, flood-prone households in Bangkok, nearly 70,000 additional households could be insured. The results suggest that well-designed information interventions could increase uptake of flood insurance, without additional premium subsidies or mandates.","[Allaire, Maura C.] Columbia Univ, Columbia Water Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Allaire, Maura C.] Nature Conservancy, Albany, NY 12205 USA",Columbia University; Nature Conservancy,"Allaire, MC (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Columbia Water Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Allaire, MC (corresponding author), Nature Conservancy, Albany, NY 12205 USA.",ma3536@columbia.edu,,,National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE-1144081]; NatureNet Science Fellowship,National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NatureNet Science Fellowship,"Financial support is gratefully acknowledged from a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under grant DGE-1144081 and a NatureNet Science Fellowship.

In this study, we tested the performance of commercially available PP components when constructed as lined PP systems with un-throttled discharge to explore basic hydraulic function in a real-life-setting. Four types of PP surface products and three types of sub-base aggregates were tested in six unique combinations, built as side-by-side parking lots into an existing parking area, each stall having a size of 25 m(2) and 0.5 m of depth with individual lining. Based on 12 months of monitoring precipitation and discharge from each stall, total volume reduction ranged from 3% to 37%. Analysis of up to 22 single events, representing return periods of up to two years, revealed marked detention capacities, expressed as median volume reduction of 40%, spanning 27-69% and median lag time of 1:38 h, spanning 0:39-3:16 h, across all stalls. The considerable range in hydraulic properties can be ascribed to both surface and sub-base properties.","[Stovring, Jan; Dam, Torben; Jensen, Marina Bergen] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Stovring, J (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",jls@ign.ku.dk; toda@ign.ku.dk; mbj@ign.ku.dk,"Jensen, Marina Bergen/C-9841-2015; Stovring, Jan/G-6535-2014","Jensen, Marina Bergen/0000-0003-0202-0366; Stovring, Jan/0000-0001-7057-9554; Dam, Torben/0000-0003-4678-7083",NCC; IBF; Midtgaard Granit Betonvarer; Byggros; Norrecco; Stenrand Grusgrav; MJK; Nyrup Plast; Ramboll; Copenhagen Municipality; HOFOR (Greater Copenhagen Utility),NCC; IBF; Midtgaard Granit Betonvarer; Byggros; Norrecco; Stenrand Grusgrav; MJK; Nyrup Plast; Ramboll; Copenhagen Municipality; HOFOR (Greater Copenhagen Utility),"The authors want to thank the following organizations for financial support, technical advice and assistance in test sites construction: NCC, IBF, Midtgaard Granit & Betonvarer, Byggros, Norrecco, Stenrand Grusgrav, MJK, Nyrup Plast, Ramboll, Copenhagen Municipality and HOFOR (Greater Copenhagen Utility).",,28,9,11,0,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAY,2018,10,5,,,,,,,587,10.3390/w10050587,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10050587,,,15,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,GJ3LO,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000435196700053,View Full Record in Web of Science

Paved areas and recipients receiving more stormwater have an enhanced need for treatment before discharge to remove suspended solids, nutrients and xenobiotics. To handle and treat stormwater efficiently, knowledge concerning first flush patterns is crucial. Therefore, we have studied 12 entire rain events and correlated water volume, suspended solids, and dissolved and particulate phosphorus to catchment characteristics and precipitation characteristics. We have mainly studied smaller rain events (average 12.6 mm), as nearly 90% of the events in the studied catchment are <10 mm. We revealed first flush tendencies in 50% of the rain events, concerning both suspended solids and phosphorus. We also found significant correlations between catchment size and discharged masses, and most importantly between precipitation patterns and discharged mass per volume. A long dry period and low amount of rain during the previous event, as well as high rain intensity, gives a high chance of first flush. We conclude that stormwater treatment should focus on the initial part of the event, especially in areas with a lack of space and/or economy to handle and treat the entire event.","[Egemose, Sara; Petersen, Anne B.; Sonderup, Melanie J.; Flindt, Mogens R.] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Biol, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Egemose, S (corresponding author), Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Biol, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",saege@biology.sdu.dk; abpfole@hotmail.com; msp@niras.dk; mrf@biology.sdu.dk,,"Flindt, Mogens R./0000-0003-0227-3304; Egemose, Sara/0000-0001-7356-9095","Danish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Higher Education [11-109519, 5016-00136B]","Danish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Higher Education","The study was supported by two industrial PhD projects granted by the Danish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Higher Education, FI case number 11-109519 and 5016-00136B.",,20,3,3,0,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2020,12,12,,,,,,,5063,10.3390/su12125063,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12125063,,,9,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MS0FN,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000553963000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, we trace the development of this system, describe its interconnections and disjunctures, and demonstrate the invisibility of water infrastructure in LA in multiple ways-through mapping, statistical analysis, and historical texts. Perverse blessings of past water abundance led to a complex, but less than resilient, system with users accustomed to cheap, easily accessible water. We describe the lack of transparency and accountability in the current system, as well as its shortcomings in building needed new infrastructure and instituting new water rate structures.

Birdsell did not explicitly relate the geographic patterning in his data to Australia's climatic variation, instead arguing that the observable differences between groups reflect multiple origins of Australian Aborigines. In this article, bivariate correlation and multivariate analyses demonstrate statistically significant associations between climatic variables and the body build of Australians that are consistent with the theoretical expectations of Bergmann's and Allen's rules. While Australian Aborigines in comparison to Eurasian and New World populations can be generally described as long-headed, linear in build, and characterized by elongated distal limbs, the variation in this morphological pattern across the continent evidently reflects biological adaptation to local Holocene climates.

To better address present climate resilience-building challenges in the current smart world, this contribution presents innovative avenues leading to the development of the << e-GIS Smart, Inclusive, and, Climate-resilient Indigenous Peoples Landscape and Community Clearing-House Mechanism Solution >> which is meant to be used in the mobile-friendly website environment and the e-app environment. This technology policy paper shows that digital GIS, remote sensing products of observation satellites, and smartphone applications products derived from telecommunication satellites can help facilitate Indigenous Peoples' contribution to climate resilience-building within their territories in terms of biodiversity and within their communities in terms of poverty eradication throughout the implementation of the United Nations Indigenous Peoples' Affairs Global Agenda. The methodology used consists, therefore, of a plural technology interface that promises, among many other benefits, to facilitate Indigenous Peoples' participation in decision-making processes. This research reminds us of the importance of state responsibility in these matters. It shows the importance of Indigenous Peoples' participation in the implementation of global instances' agendas through national reporting.

However, the role of such intermediaries in adaptation to sea-level rise, though potentially of vital importance, has been less thoroughly explored. In this commentary, we describe three styles of science intermediation that can connect researchers working on sea-level projections with decision-makers relying on those projections. We illustrate these styles with examples of recent and ongoing contexts for the application of sea-level research, at different spatial scales and political levels ranging from urban development projects to international organizations.

A multilocal experimental design was used: one location with short-day conditions (Guadeloupe), one location with medium-day conditions (late sowing in the south of France) and two locations with long-day conditions (early sowing in both the North and South of France). The photoperiod sensitivity was estimated by the slope of the regression of thermal time from sowing to 50% anthesis on photoperiod. We found highly significant effects of latitude and altitude of the collecting site of the population on photoperiod sensitivity and a significant but small interaction between these two factors. Populations originated from low altitudes and low latitudes are highly sensitive to photoperiod, whereas highland populations never display a high photoperiod sensitivity, whatever the latitude of origin. Grain productivity under long-day conditions was not highly correlated with photoperiod sensitivity. Andean populations were little sensitive to photoperiod and exhibited poor grain production under long-day conditions. In contrast, some populations from the Caribbean such as populations from Cuban Flint and Early Caribbean races exhibited a good grain production although sensitive to photoperiod. The good adaptation of some Caribbean material to temperate conditions is consistent with the hypothesis of the successful introduction of Caribbean germplasm in southern regions of the Old World.","Ctr Montpellier, UMR, DGPC, INRA, Domaine Melgueil, F-34130 Mauguio, France; INRA, UPS, INAPG, Stn Genet Vegetale, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, France; URPV, INRA, Ctr Rech Antilles Guyane, F-97170 Petit Bourg, Guadeloupe, France",INRAE; INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; INRAE,"Gouesnard, B (corresponding author), Ctr Montpellier, UMR, DGPC, INRA, Domaine Melgueil, F-34130 Mauguio, France.",gouesnard@ensam.inra.fr,,"Charcosset, Alain/0000-0001-6125-503X; WELCKER, Claude/0000-0002-8275-1259",,,,,25,37,44,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0925-9864,1573-5109,,GENET RESOUR CROP EV,Genet.

Within these cities, urban informal settlement communities are often some of the most vulnerable to climate change and impacts and urban climate planning needs to explicitly consider the priority needs of these often-marginalized communities if strategies are to be equitable. Hence, inclusive urban community-based adaptation is now a critical component of overall adaptation. In support of this important urban agenda, this paper describes a community profiling method that was developed to elicit key contextual data in support of locally appropriate climate action planning for informal settlements in Honiara, the capital city of Solomon Islands. The paper details the methodology that was developed, and uses a sample dataset to demonstrate the breadth and richness of the constructed community profile and the insights it reveals about community vulnerabilities. The paper argues that the proposed community profiling method offers organizations and practitioners invested in local engagement a practical tool to inform locally driven, climate resilient urban planning and development and can be translated for use in other Global South contexts.","[Ho, Serene] RMIT Univ, Sch Sci Geospatial Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Baptista, Mariana Dias] Univ Sheffield, Dept Urban Studies, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [McEvoy, Darryn] RMIT Univ, Sch Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of Sheffield; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Ho, S (corresponding author), GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",serene.ho2@rmit.edu.au,"McEvoy, Darryn/K-8015-2017","McEvoy, Darryn/0000-0003-4144-4137; Dias Baptista, Mariana/0000-0002-2287-1881",UNFCCC Adaptation Fund,UNFCCC Adaptation Fund,This work was supported by UNFCCC Adaptation Fund.,,56,0,0,5,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

However, federal buyout programs are widely critiqued for being inaccessible and inequitable. To learn whether and how subnational buyout programs overcome these limitations, we examined five leading US state, county, and local buyout programs to see what they teach us about redesigning future federal policies. Our mixed-methods research used interviews and document analysis to develop case studies, juxtaposed subnational strategies against a review of critiques of federal buyouts, and focus group discussions with subnational buyout managers and experts to identify limitations of their programs. We find that subnational programs can be more inclusive and better respond to resident needs as compared to existing federal programs due to their access to dedicated, non-federal funding and their standing institutional status, which allows them to learn and evolve over time. Nevertheless, these programs lack coordination with and control over agencies that permit development and produce affordable housing. This gives buyout programs limited power in shaping the overall equity of who lives in floodplains and who has access to affordable, resilient housing after a buyout. Their experiences suggest federal programs can support managed retreat nationwide by increasing support for institutional and staff capacity at state and county levels, encouraging efforts to bridge institutional silos at subnational levels, and holistically mainstream climate considerations into regional floodplain development, affordable housing production, and flood risk mitigation.","[Shi, Linda] Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, 213 West Sibley Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Fisher, Anjali] King Cty Govt, Seattle, WA USA; [Brenner, Rebecca M.] Cornell Univ, Jeb E Brooks Sch Publ Policy, Ithaca, NY USA; [Greiner-Safi, Amelia] Cornell Univ, Dept Publ & Ecosyst Hlth, Ithaca, NY USA; [Greiner-Safi, Amelia] Cornell Univ, Dept Commun, Ithaca, NY USA; [Shepard, Christine] Nature Conservancy, Gulf Mexico Program, Key West, FL USA; [Vanucchi, Jamie] Cornell Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture, Ithaca, NY USA",Cornell University; Cornell University; Cornell University; Cornell University; Cornell University,"Shi, LD (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, 213 West Sibley Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",lindashi@cornell.edu,,"Shi, Linda/0000-0002-2444-367X; Morgenstern Brenner, Rebecca/0000-0002-2562-2055",Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability; Nature Conservancy,Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability; Nature Conservancy,"This work was supported by the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability and The Nature Conservancy.

There is genuine long-term and large-scale change locked into our coastal systems regardless of the pace of emissions control. There are grave practical realities currently faced by coastal and marine managers and planners that will increase in the coming one to two decades. Recently, the State of Victoria in Australia reformed the coastal and marine governance structures, in part designed to prepare for impacts due to climate change. This provides an opportunity via a case study approach to review the current application of coastal governance to enable adaptation. This paper does so from a privileged vantage point - that of a crucial actor embedded in the legislative and governance structure the Chair of a Ministerial Advisory Council appointed to provide advice to decision-makers regarding coastal and marine planning and management in the jurisdiction. The paper takes a multi-disciplinary and reflexive approach and from a practitioner's perspective the paper tests the robustness of the governance system against three pointed challenges to implementing the system. The three challenges are 1/how to meaningfully collaborate with communities for transformational change; 2/are hard questions about adaptation being asked; and 3/ understanding what levers (e.g., policy, governance, societal) can be pulled to drive adaptation within the available time horizons. Drawing on frameworks from various disciplines, reflexive experience, and analysis of secondary data, this perspectives paper makes three conclusions: 1/that transformational change is needed which requires alignment in the perception of risk by different rights-holders and stakeholders; 2/that collaboration is required with an urgent focus needed to challenge current practices which likely do not enable decision-makers, and finally 3/that leadership is specifically required to tackle the hard questions about coastal adaptation (like to retreat or not). With a governance approach that shares elements (e.g., objectives, links to catchment management, planning tools) with other international jurisdictions in Europe and the Americas, there may be lessons learned from this maturing system that are applicable to other jurisdictions.","[Boxshall, Anthony] Univ Melbourne, Natl Ctr Coasts & Climate, Sch Biol Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Boxshall, A (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Natl Ctr Coasts & Climate, Sch Biol Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",boxshall.a@unimelb.edu.au,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Boxshall, Anthony/0000-0001-6342-4167",,,,,88,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,SEP 1,2022,228,,,,,,,,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106291,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106291,,AUG 2022,13,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Oceanography; Water Resources,6R9IK,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000892609900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Disaster scholars assert that resilience is developed through a set of adaptive capacities across multiple domains, including society, the economy, the built and natural environments, and sociopolitical institutions. These adaptive capacities have been thought to be networked, but little is known about how they are connected. The authors explore how institutional capacity and social capital intersect to influence change adaptation, using a case from the Artic: Longyearbyen in the Svalbard archipelago. Design/methodology/approach The authors use case study methods that integrate original interviews of Longyearbyen residents with news articles and public documents to analyze emergent themes related to institutional capacity, social capital and disaster risk reduction. Findings Analyses reveal that implementation gaps in hazard and disaster programs and policies, coupled with high turnover of staff in key positions, have created accountability issues indicative of low institutional capacity and weak social capital between the public and government. Additionally, high turnover of the population of the community, within the context of the legacy as a mining company town, is accompanied by social divisions and low trust between diverse cultural groups in the community. This lack of social capital provides little support for institutional capacity to effectively mitigate risk posed by climate change. Originality/value This study illuminates institutional capacity building needs directly related to disaster resilience for cases of complex institutional arrangements and developing democracy.","[Tiller, Rachel Gjelsvik] SINTEF Ocean, Trondheim, Norway; [Ross, Ashley D.; Nyman, Elizabeth] Texas A&M Univ, Galveston, TX 77554 USA",SINTEF; Texas A&M University System,"Ross, AD (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Galveston, TX 77554 USA.",ashleydross@tamug.edu,"; Tiller, Rachel Gjelsvik/F-7446-2015","Nyman, Elizabeth/0000-0001-6622-5710; Tiller, Rachel Gjelsvik/0000-0002-2505-9194; Ross, Ashley/0000-0002-8415-3383",Research Council of Norway [257628],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"Data collection was undertaken as part of the REGIMES project, funded by the Research Council of Norway, under grant number 257628.

Limited by the ideology of its structural roots and its selective material approach, climate urbanism facilitates projects that protect some urban populations while simultaneously increasing the vulnerability of others. If allowed to continue on its current trajectory, the dominant mode of climate urbanism threatens to exacerbate a crisis-contingent mode of capitalism that would intensify various forms of inequality and injustice. The future of climate urbanism is not predetermined, however. This short paper explores the volatile origins of climate urbanism and seeks out areas for intervention. It does so with the aim of derailing the current polarizing trajectory of climate urbanism in order to replace it with a mode of climate urbanism that prioritizes a more heterogeneous, post-colonial, and transformative vision.","[Long, Joshua] Southwestern Univ, Environm Studies, 1001 E Univ Dr, Georgetown, TX 78626 USA; [Rice, Jennifer L.] Univ Georgia, Geog, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Long, J (corresponding author), Southwestern Univ, Environm Studies, 1001 E Univ Dr, Georgetown, TX 78626 USA.",jlong@southwestern.edu,,,,,,,48,8,8,5,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0272-3638,1938-2847,,URBAN GEOGR,Urban Geogr.,JUL 3,2021,42,6,,,,,721,727,,10.1080/02723638.2020.1841470,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2020.1841470,,NOV 2020,7,Geography; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography; Urban Studies,WM6IT,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000589097900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

As case study, we also conducted a spatial analysis vulnerability assessment of coastal heritage sites below 20 meters in elevation. Results from the analysis show that of the 1185 known cultural heritage sites below 20 meters in elevation in Puerto Rico, 27 sites are inundated at today's highest high tide, 56 will be inundated by mid-century when assuming a 0.6 m rise in sea-level, and 140 sites will be inundated by end-of-century when assuming a 1.8 m rise in sea-level. Spatial analysis of sites adjacent to the high tide line demonstrate that these values are likely conservative, as there are many sites located within 1 m of the highest high tide line that should also be considered vulnerable. Finally, we present and introductory proposal that addresses the need for vulnerability assessments to aid cultural heritage managers in developing adaptive strategies for climate change impacts to material heritage.

Extreme weather events are producing extensive property damage and loss of life and require new modes of flood governance. However, the climate crisis does not stop at the city limits: peri-urban areas have related but distinct flood challenges due to land use change, regulation, perceptions, and capacity to develop collective responses. The aim of the literature review is to synthesize peri-urban flood governance drivers and responses with a particular emphasis on empirical findings from the past decade. The literature review draws on findings from 26 empirical case studies with respect to how and where research is conducted on peri-urban flood governance, the drivers of peri-urban flooding, and the responses by peri-urban stakeholders to address flood risks. A common governance approach involves autonomous adaptation that results in maladaptation - both of which are critiqued as inadequate to address flood risks. The findings reveal a host of specific peri-urban challenges in addressing flooding but also point towards opportunities for new modes of adaptive governance. The article concludes by reflecting on the promise of developing an adaptive governance approach to peri-urban flooding to acknowledge the social and ecological complexities of climate change while opening up possibilities for emergent modes and innovative approaches of collaborative problem-solving.","[Winter, Amanda K.; Karvonen, Andrew] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Urban Planning & Environm, Teknikringen 10 A, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Winter, AK (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Urban Planning & Environm, Teknikringen 10 A, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",akwinter@kth.se,,,Formas grant [2019-00037],Formas grant,"This work was supported by Formas grant 2019-00037.

For the latter, urban planners apply a precautionary principle, which is normally not grounded in the actual performance of the urban drainage system (UDS). This approach, however, fails during weather extremes with heavy precipitation. This paper presents a new concept for reducing pluvial flood risks in the urban planning process. The novelty of the developed planning support system named Extreme Weather Layer (EWL) is that it creates dynamic interlinkages between land developments, the performance of UDS, and other factors that contribute to flood risk. The EWL is built on the digital twin of the existing UDS and delivers an easy-to-use concept, where the end user can analyze hydraulic modelling results interlinked with climate scenarios using the GIS platform. This allows planning specialists to consider land use and soil types in the urban environment to simulate the response of the storm water system and the catchments to different rainfall events. This proposed approach was piloted in Haapsalu (Estonia) and Soderhamn (Sweden). The resulting planning support system, which performs as a set of layers within municipalities' GIS, allows decision makers to understand and predict the impact of various spatial planning decisions on the pluvial flood risk.","[Truu, Murel; Annus, Ivar; Roosimagi, Janet; Kaendler, Nils; Vassiljev, Anatoli; Kaur, Katrin] Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Ehitajate Tee 5, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Annus, I (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Ehitajate Tee 5, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia.",murel.truu@taltech.ee; ivar.annus@taltech.ee; janet.roosimagi@taltech.ee; nils.kandler@taltech.ee; anatoli.vassiljev@taltech.ee; katrin.kaur@taltech.ee,,"Kaur, Katrin/0000-0002-4111-9302; Truu, Murel/0000-0003-1195-3010",,,,,34,5,5,4,22,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,DEC,2021,13,23,,,,,,,3340,10.3390/w13233340,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13233340,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,XV0RU,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000734661100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, whether securing land rights is important for farmers' adaptation to changing climate or not has not been addressed in the literature, particularly with respect to management decisions. This paper examines the relationship between land tenure types and farmer adaptation through management decisions in response to extreme weather events in Guangdong Province in China. Based on a household survey of rice farmers, our results show that compared to a normal year with minor weather events farmers with contracted land are more likely to implement adaptation measures in response to extreme weather events than those who have rented their land from the collective and from other farmers. The results suggest that farmers' adaptive behaviour in response to extreme weather events is significantly different from their day-to-day adaptation to ongoing changes in climate. Farmers' adaptive capacity is also positively influenced by age, the public provision of information, by the presence of social capital, and by plot quality. The results of this study highlight the importance of properly defined land rights for the likelihood of adaptation, and thereby increasing agricultural productivity and ensuring food security in the context of a changing climate.

We clarify the factors determining the effectiveness of the Estonian health system in assessing and managing the health risks of climate change. Document analyses, expert interviews with key informants from health systems whose responsibilities are relevant to climate change, and analysis of a population-based survey conducted in 2015, indicate that the health effects of climate change have not been mainstreamed into policy. Therefore, many of the potential synergistic effects of combining information on health systems, environment, and vulnerable populations remain unexploited. The limited uptake of the issue of climate change-related health risks may be attributed to the lack of experience with managing extreme weather events; limited understanding of how to incorporate projections of longer-term health risks into policies and plans; unclear divisions of responsibility; and market liberal state approaches. Minority groups and urban dwellers are placing strong pressure on the health system to address climate change-related risks, likely due to their lower levels of perceived control over their physical wellbeing. The results have implications for national, community, and individual resilience in upper-middle income countries in Eastern Europe.","[Orru, Kati] Univ Tartu, Inst Social Sci, Lossi 36, EE-51003 Tartu, Estonia; [Tillmann, Mari] Estonian Police & Border Guard Board, Parnu Mnt 139, EE-15060 Tallinn, Estonia; [Ebi, Kristie L.] Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Orru, Hans] Univ Tartu, Inst Family Med & Publ Hlth, Ravila 19, EE-50411 Tartu, Estonia; [Orru, Hans] Umea Univ, Dept Publ Hlth & Clin Med, S-90187 Umea, Sweden",University of Tartu; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Tartu; Umea University,"Orru, K (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Inst Social Sci, Lossi 36, EE-51003 Tartu, Estonia.",kati.orru@ut.ee; mari.tillmann@politsei.ee; krisebi@uw.edu; hans.orru@ut.ee,"Orru, Kati/HQY-1108-2023; Orru, Hans/B-1324-2019","Orru, Hans/0000-0002-7965-9451",HEALTHDOX project - NORFACE Programme [MSHUH14155]; Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [IUT34-17],"HEALTHDOX project - NORFACE Programme; Estonian Ministry of Education and Research(Ministry of Education and Research, Estonia)",K.O.'s work on the preparation of this article was supported by the HEALTHDOX project (MSHUH14155) financed by NORFACE Programme.

This study utilises a quantitative research design whereby a cross-sectional survey method is used to randomly select 512 households for questionnaire administration through a multistage sampling procedure. Data was analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The study shows that environmental (ss 1 = 0.197, p <= 0.05), institutional (ss 2 = 0.180, p <= 0.05), and socio-economic (ss 3 = 0.529, p <= 0.05) factors have statistically significant positive effects on household flood resilience, while the behavioural (ss 4 = -0.035, p <= 0.05) factor has a negative effect. The highest predictor of households' resilience to flood disaster is the socio-economic factor. The implication is that low socio-economic status indicates a high level of poverty that worsens households' flood resilience. This suggests that the poor do not have the needed economic resources and social nets to prevent, adapt to, and/or transform from the impact of flood disaster.","[Odunsi, Oluwafemi] Olabisi Onabanjo Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Ago Iwoye, Nigeria; [Onanuga, Margaret] Tai Solarin Univ Educ, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Ijagun, Ijebu Ode, Nigeria",,"Onanuga, M (corresponding author), Tai Solarin Univ Educ, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Ijagun, Ijebu Ode, Nigeria.",odunsioluwafemi@gmail.com; nugamaggie@gmail.com,,"Odunsi, Oluwafemi/0000-0002-6127-0835",,,,,94,0,0,0,0,"UNIV FREE STATE, DEPT TOWN & REGIONAL PLANNING",BLOEMFONTEIN,"PO BOX 339, BLOEMFONTEIN, 9300, SOUTH AFRICA",1012-280X,2415-0495,,TOWN REG PLAN,Town Reg.

The intent is to develop an approach that is more practical in terms of data and analysis requirements than current approaches, informed by the literature and experience with probability elicitation and judgmental forecasting. The context involves decisions about managing forest lands that have been severely affected by mountain pine beetles in British Columbia, a pest infestation that is climate-exacerbated. A forest management decision was developed as the basis for the context, objectives, and alternatives for land management actions, to frame and condition the judgments. A wide range of climate forecasts, taken to represent the 1090% levels on cumulative distributions for future climate, were developed to condition judgments. An elicitation instrument was developed, tested, and revised to serve as the basis for eliciting probabilistic three-point distributions regarding the performance of selected alternatives, over a set of relevant objectives, in the short and long term. The elicitations were conducted in a workshop comprising 14 regional forest management specialists. We employed the concept of stochastic dominance to help identify robust alternatives. We used extensive sensitivity analysis to explore the patterns in the judgments, and also considered the preferred alternatives for each individual expert. The results show that two alternatives that are more flexible than the current policies are judged more likely to perform better than the current alternatives on average in terms of stochastic dominance. The results suggest judgmental approaches to robust decision making deserve greater attention and testing.","[McDaniels, Timothy] Univ British Columbia, Sch Community & Reg Planning, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada; [Mills, Tamsin] City Vancouver, Climate Adaptat Planner, Vancouver, BC V6B 2S8, Canada; [Mills, Tamsin; Ohlson, Dan] Compass Resource Management Ltd, Vancouver, BC V6B 2S8, Canada; [Gregory, Robin] Decis Res, Galiano, BC V0N 1P0, Canada",University of British Columbia,"McDaniels, T (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Sch Community & Reg Planning, 415-6333 Mem Rd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",timmcd@exchange.ubc.ca,,,"Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making in the Department of Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University; National Science Foundation [SES-0949170, 0725025]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0949710] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making in the Department of Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This project was supported by the Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making located in the Department of Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University, through a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation (SES-0949170).

Using historic fishery landings, climate records, and fishermen surveys, we document how market squid fishermen respond to high seasonal and interannual climate variability associated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and responses to hypothetical future scenarios of low abundance and range shift. Overall, fishermen have been able to adapt to dramatic shifts in the geographic range of the fishery given their high mobility, with fishermen with larger vessels expressing a willingness to travel greater distances than those with smaller vessels. Nearly half of fishermen stated that they would switch fisheries if market squid decreased dramatically in abundance, although fishermen who were older, had been in the fishery longer, were highly dependent on squid for income, and held only squid and/or coastal pelagic finfish permits were less likely to switch to another fishery in a scenario of lower abundance. While market squid fishermen have exhibited highly adaptive behavior in the face of past climate variability, recent (and likely future) range shifts across state boundaries, as well as closures of other fisheries, constrain fishermen's choices and emphasize the need for flexibility in management systems. Our study highlights the importance of considering connectivity between fisheries and monitoring and anticipating trans-jurisdictional range shifts to facilitate adaptive fishery management.","[Powell, Farrah; Levine, Arielle; Ordonez-Gauger, Lucia] San Diego State Univ, Dept Geog, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Powell, Farrah] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Powell, F (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Geog, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.;Powell, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",fpowell@sdsu.edu,,"Powell, Farrah/0000-0002-0020-042X",National Science Foundation Coastal SEES Collaborative Research Grant [1600149],National Science Foundation Coastal SEES Collaborative Research Grant,"We would like to acknowledge our funding source (National Science Foundation Coastal SEES Collaborative Research Grant, Award #1600149).",,83,2,2,6,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

However, there remains uncertainty about the effectiveness of shoreline protection provided by oyster reefs, which limits their broader application. We draw evidence from studies along the east and gulf coasts of the United States, where much research and implementation of oyster reef restoration has occurred, to better define the existing gaps in our understanding of the use of restored oyster reefs for shoreline protection. We find potential disconnects between ecological and engineering functions of reefs. In response, we outline how engineering and ecological principles are used in the design of oyster reef living shorelines and highlight knowledge gaps where an integration of these disciplines will lead to their more effective application. Synthesis and applications. This work highlights the necessary steps to advance the application of oyster reef living shorelines. Importantly, future research should focus on appropriate designs and conditions needed for these structures to effectively protect our coasts from erosion, while supporting a sustainable oyster population, thereby providing actionable nature-based alternatives for coastal defence to diverse end-users.","[Morris, Rebecca L.; Swearer, Stephen E.] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Natl Ctr Coasts & Climate, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Bilkovic, Donna M.] Coll William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA USA; [Boswell, Maura K.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Norfolk, VA USA; [Bushek, David] Rutgers State Univ, Haskin Shellfish Res Lab, Port Norris, NJ USA; [Cebrian, Just; Goff, Joshua] Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL USA; [Cebrian, Just] Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USA; [Kibler, Kelly M.] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Kibler, Kelly M.] Univ Cent Florida, Natl Ctr Integrated Coastal Res, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [La Peyre, Megan K.] Louisiana State Univ, US Geol Survey, Louisiana Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Sch Renewable Nat Resources,Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Sacks, Paul] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Biol, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Sacks, Paul] Univ Cent Florida, Natl Ctr Integrated Coastal Res, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Moody, Josh] Partnership Delaware Estuary, Wilmington, DE USA; [Sparks, Eric L.; Temple, Nigel A.] Mississippi State Univ, Coastal Res & Extens Ctr, Biloxi, MS USA; [Sparks, Eric L.] Mississippi Alabama Sea Grant Consortium, Ocean Springs, MS USA; [Swearer, Stephen E.] Univ S Alabama, Dept Civil Coastal & Environm Engn, Mobile, AL 36688 USA; [Cebrian, Just] Mississippi State Univ, Northern Gulf Inst, Stennis Space Ctr, MS 39529 USA",University of Melbourne; William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science; Old Dominion University; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Dauphin Island Sea Lab; University of South Alabama; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; Mississippi State University; University of South Alabama; Mississippi State University,"Morris, RL (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Natl Ctr Coasts & Climate, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",rebecca.morris@unimelb.edu.au,"Swearer, Stephen/X-4882-2018; SWEARER, STEPHEN/AAC-1527-2020; Bilkovic, Donna Marie/A-8343-2009; Webb, Bret/AAI-3634-2021; Morris, Rebecca/AAB-3364-2020","Swearer, Stephen/0000-0001-6381-9943; SWEARER, STEPHEN/0000-0001-6381-9943; McClenachan, Giovanna/0000-0002-3076-4795; Temple, Nigel/0000-0003-1907-3894; Webb, Bret/0000-0002-9755-0070; Morris, Rebecca/0000-0003-0455-0811",Early Career Researcher Global Mobility Grant from The University of Melbourne; Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub by the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Programme,Early Career Researcher Global Mobility Grant from The University of Melbourne; Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub by the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Programme,"We thank K.

The analysis relies on the study of risk-relevant policy documents and considers Coastal risk integration (i.e. extent to which coastal hazards and associated impacts are considered) and Adjustability (i.e. potential for the policy documents to be adjusted over time) as proxy outcomes for climate change policy integration more broadly. The results show that there are still important gaps relating to an insufficient incorporation of climate-related coastal hazards into the existing policy documents, and to difficulties in both implementing these documents and making them more climate change-compatible. While recent examples on the ground provide encouraging early signs towards more adjustable local policies, they are to date too time- and/or space-bounded to represent any real shift at the territory level.","[Magnan, Alexandre K.; Anisimov, Ariadna] Sci Po, Inst Sustainable Dev & Int Relat, 27 Rue St Guillaume, F-75007 Paris, France; [Magnan, Alexandre K.; Viriamu, Toanui; Moatty, Annabelle; Duvat, Virginie K.

While technology currently provides the means to predict large-scale bleaching, predicting reef-scale and within-reef patterns in real-time for all reef users is limited. In 2020, heat stress across the Great Barrier Reef underpinned the region's third bleaching event in 5 years. Here we review the heterogeneous emergence of bleaching across Heron Island reef habitats and discuss the oceanographic drivers that underpinned variable bleaching emergence. We do so as a case study to highlight how reef end-user groups who engage with coral reefs in different ways require targeted guidance for how, and when, to alter their use of coral reefs in response to bleaching events. Our case study of coral bleaching emergence demonstrates how within-reef scale nowcasting of coral bleaching could aid the development of accessible and equitable bleaching response strategies on coral reefs.","[Ainsworth, Tracy D.; Lantz, Coulson A.; Bergman, Jessica L.; Page, Charlotte E.] Univ New South Wales, Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Leggat, William; Lantz, Coulson A.; Fordyce, Alexander J.] Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Newcastle, NSW, Australia; [Silliman, Brian R.; Renzi, Juliana J.; Morton, Joseph] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Beaufort, NC USA; [Eakin, C.

This shift has had implications for the public-private divide in adaptive flood risk governance. In an urban context, it means that private actors such as developers and residents come into play, necessitating governance arrangements which cross the public-private divide. The division of responsibilities for water safety between the public and private sectors affects the way legitimacy is gained for these arrangements and raises new legitimacy issues. The paper offers an analysis of public and private responsibilities in adaptive flood risk governance arrangements, as well as of the legitimacy of the arrangements in the light of the public-private divide. A comparative case study is presented for three urban regeneration projects in un-embanked areas in Hamburg, Germany, Helsinki, Finland, and Rotterdam, the Netherlands, where adaptive strategies have been applied. The results show that network arrangements with joint public-private responsibilities use direct forms of participation and deliberation, but that these do not necessarily lead to more legitimate arrangements in the eyes of stakeholders as is often suggested in the literature. Both network and more public hierarchical arrangements can be perceived as quite legitimate under certain conditions.","[Mees, Heleen L. P.; Driessen, Peter P. J.; Runhaar, Hens A.

Applying a shared learning approach in the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN) has helped to create or strengthen networks, build appreciation for complexity and uncertainty among stakeholders, provide a space for deliberating concepts such as vulnerability and resilience, and build knowledge and capacities for stakeholders to engage and represent their own interests. Shared learning approaches face considerable challenges navigating politicized urban environments, in which the nature and value of existing systems - and therefore the value of building resilience - are contested. This article suggests that deliberate, strategic intervention by facilitators may contribute to more transformative change on behalf of equitable, socially just outcomes - and thus cautions against seeing urban climate vulnerability as a technical challenge, or shared learning as a toolkit for building resilience.","[Reed, Sarah Orleans] ISET Vietnam, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Sutarto, Ratri] Mercy Corps Indonesia, ACCCRN, Jakarta, Indonesia",,"Reed, SO (corresponding author), ISET Vietnam, 18,Alley 1-42,Lane 1 Au Co, Hanoi, Vietnam.",sreed@i-s-e-t.org; richard@i-s-e-t.org; vucanhtoan.env@gmail.com; pakamas@tei.or.th; rsutarto@id.mercycorps.org; dilip@i-s-e-t.org,"Friend, Richard/ABB-3929-2021","Friend, Richard/0000-0001-5861-1523",,,,,74,47,47,1,73,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,1746-0301,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

The review confirms that previous calls for an increase in empirical adaptation research have been heeded. Research covers both policy and practice, and also different scales, with a particular focus on agricultural and rural settings. There is significant and growing interest in the determinants of adaptation and adaptive capacity (including the role of barriers and enablers), and a small but growing interest in the role of gender. The overall increase in total publications does not show even geographical or sectoral coverage. Large swathes of sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East/North Africa remain severely under-researched; and the overwhelming majority of papers focus on rural and agricultural issues rather than cities.

However, investments in climate services have not kept pace with the increasing need for evidence-based actions, and the need for trusted relationships between consumers and producers of those services may actually be slowing progress at a time when there is an increasing need to scale up from individual decisions to system-wide adaptation and resilience. In the meantime, recognition of the linkages between adaptation actions and the broader sustainable development agenda require an expansion of the concept of climate services from its historically narrow focus on the use of climate science for impact assessments and adaptation to that required to deliver a broader set of societal benefits based on increasing capacity to manage climate and other risks. A next generation approach is justified by the complexity and inter-relatedness of climate issues, the broad range of societal challenges, the scope of required actions, the rate at which adaptation and resilience challenges are emerging, and the range of data, tools and methods required. An approach based on transformational relationship-and capacity-building, which is capable of drawing on and informing science, service and practice is needed. Working at the science-to-service-to-practice interfaces to enable delivery of services aimed at informing action at scale will require new ways of collecting, analysing and using information and data about the effectiveness of climate actions in particular contexts.","[Jacobs, Katharine L.] Univ Arizona, ENRB2, Ctr Climate Adaptat Sci & Solut, 426N,1064 E Lowell St, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Street, Roger Brian] Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Environm Change Inst, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of Arizona; University of Oxford,"Jacobs, KL (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, ENRB2, Ctr Climate Adaptat Sci & Solut, 426N,1064 E Lowell St, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",jacobsk@arizona.edu; roger.street@ouce.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,42,23,23,1,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8807,,,CLIM SERV,Clim.

Governance of green stormwater implementation is proving to be as important as the techniques themselves. Building on the climate and sustainability governance literature, we argue that effective governance requires planning across city departments, experimentation and a strategy for organisational learning. We employ a case study of Philadelphia, the first city in the United States to attempt an entirely green approach to meeting federal regulations to examine issues of governance that emerged and how they were addressed. The case study draws on interviews with fourteen public and private sector actors involved in implementation, a site visit to observe the installations and to discuss the approach with a key planner, and grey literature. We find that silos can be broken down and that if open communications and a willingness to change practices are present, obstacles cited in the literature can be overcome. The key implication is that the three elements of governance need to be built into the green infrastructure planning process. While the analysis focuses on a US city, the departments involved and the governance needs of green stormwater infrastructure are similar in cities in much of the world.","[Fitzgerald, Joan; Laufer, Joshua] Northeastern Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Urban Affairs, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Northeastern University,"Fitzgerald, J (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Urban Affairs, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",jo.fitzgerald@neu.edu,,,,,,,38,33,34,2,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2017,22,2,,,,,256,268,,10.1080/13549839.2016.1191063,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2016.1191063,,,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,EO3UN,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000396619900008,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, little is known about the gendered dynamics of exposure and response to heat stress, including women's perceived health risks, their adaptation strategies to heat, and their perceptions of climate change. This research project aims to answer the question of whether and how pregnant farmers in The Gambia perceive and act upon occupational heat stress and its health impacts on both themselves and their unborn children, against the backdrop of current and expected climatic changes. MethodIn-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 women who practice subsistence farming and were either pregnant or had delivered within the past month in West Kiang, The Gambia. Participants were selected using purposive sampling. Translated interview transcripts were coded and qualitative thematic content analysis with an intersectional lens was used to arrive at the results. ResultsAll women who participated in the study experience significant heat stress while working outdoors during pregnancy, with symptoms often including headache, dizziness, nausea, and chills. The most common adaptive techniques included resting in the shade while working, completing their work in multiple shorter time increments, taking medicine to reduce symptoms like headache, using water to cool down, and reducing the amount of area they cultivate. Layered identities, experiences, and household power structures related to age, migration, marital situation, socioeconomic status, and supportive social relationships shaped the extent to which women were able to prevent and reduce the effects of heat exposure during their work whilst pregnant. Women who participated in this study demonstrated high awareness of climate change and offered important insights into potential values, priorities, and mechanisms to enable effective adaptation. ConclusionOur findings reveal many intersecting social and economic factors that shape the space within which women can make decisions and take adaptive action to reduce the impact of heat during their pregnancy. To improve the health of pregnant working women exposed to heat, these intersectionalities must be considered when supporting women to adapt their working practices and cope with heat stress.","[Spencer, Shantelle; Samateh, Tida; Allen, Haddijatou; Bonell, Ana] Gambia London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Med Res Council Unit, Banjul, Gambia; [Wabnitz, Katharina] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Inst Med Informat Proc Biometry & Epidemiol IBE, Chair Publ Hlth & Hlth Serv Res, Munich, Germany; [Mayhew, Susannah] Univ London, Fac Publ Hlth & Policy, London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England; [Bonell, Ana] Univ London, Ctr Climate Change & Planetary Hlth, London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of Munich; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Bonell, A (corresponding author), Gambia London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Med Res Council Unit, Banjul, Gambia.;Bonell, A (corresponding author), Univ London, Ctr Climate Change & Planetary Hlth, London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England.",ana.bonell@lshtm.ac.uk,", Susannah/HJP-3632-2023","Mayhew, Susannah/0000-0002-2433-3809; Bonell, Ana/0000-0001-5981-762X",Wellcome Trust Global Health PhD Fellowship [216336/Z/19/Z],Wellcome Trust Global Health PhD Fellowship(Wellcome Trust),Funding This project was funded by a Wellcome Trust Global Health PhD Fellowship awarded to AB (216336/Z/19/Z).,,31,6,6,4,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-2565,,FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH,Front.

This puts pressure on local and regional decision makers to develop strategic frameworks for prioritizing, permitting and funding such projects. However, no systematic evaluation tools exist for the full range of these innovative designs. We build on the literature to develop an evaluation framework that synthesizes two different approaches to categorize these proposals and provide insight for coastal managers and decision makers. We apply this framework to physical projects that address sea level rise in their design around the San Francisco Bay Area, a leading region in sea level rise adaptation. We find that these projects demonstrate a shift toward more habitat-focused strategies, which likely marks the beginning of a larger transformation of the coastal zone. According to our five-part evaluation tool, we also find that the projects' scores have improved over time, indicating that state agency work may be helping communities implement more flexible adaptation initiatives. Despite these positive signs, we also find that none of the projects achieved high marks in all five of the evaluation criteria. This finding indicates that there is a critical need for improvement in physical planning for adaptation to higher sea levels and associated impacts. Most importantly, we find that an evaluation framework such as the one used here can provide critical insights into the likely risks and benefits of proposed adaptation projects and their long-term implications for coastal zones.","[Hirschfeld, Daniella] Utah State Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, 4005 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Hirschfeld, Daniella; Hill, Kristina E.; Plane, Ellen] Univ Calif Berkeley, Coll Environm Design, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Plane, Ellen] San Francisco Estuary Inst, Richmond, CA USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Hirschfeld, D (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, 4005 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",daniella.hirschfeld@usu.edu,,"Plane, Ellen/0000-0002-2439-7052",McQuown Fellowship University of California Berkeley,McQuown Fellowship University of California Berkeley,This work was supported by the McQuown Fellowship University of California Berkeley.,,103,2,2,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0892-0753,1521-0421,,COAST MANAGE,Coast.

To better understand the environmental justice implications of climate disruption and uneven recovery, this article casts a critical light on disaster waste. Drawing on a qualitative case study of a deadly debris flow in California and the dumping of toxic sediment on public beaches, I provide a flows of injustice framing to bridge environmental justice and climate justice concerns across multiple spatial contexts and temporalities. Although it is often assumed that recovery is spatially confined to the site of immediate disruption, residual injustice can arise when hazardous waste is disposed of near poor, working class, and minoritized communities without appropriate remediation measures. The case study illustrates how disaster recovery shifted vulnerability downstream away from wealthy communities, mirroring systems of value that prioritize privileged areas while designating new sacrifice zones. This suggests a need for a relational understanding of disaster recovery that goes beyond conventional landscape binaries that normalize unjust adaptation practices.","[Gray, Summer] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Environm Studies, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [Gray, Summer] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Environm Studies Program, 4312 Bren Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Gray, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Environm Studies Program, 4312 Bren Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",summer_gray@ucsb.edu,,"Gray, Summer/0000-0003-1661-179X",,,,,56,0,0,3,3,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1939-4071,1937-5174,,ENVIRON JUSTICE,Environ.

The performance of the dwellings are also tested for a change in energy use and risk of summertime overheating in future climates in the short (2030s), medium (2050s) and long term (2080s). The findings indicate that to meet the NZE targets, regulated loads need to reduce by about half (over current Building Regulations) with community (rather than building-level) renewables playing a major role. It is also found that the NZE targets, given current regulations, are not particularly difficult to achieve in design with regard to energy efficiency but are highly expectant with regard to renewable energy. Further, summertime overheating is projected to be a risk for net zero energy dwellings by the 2050s. Despite this the regulated energy use of both dwellings is projected to reduce by 11 kWh/m(2)/yr, accompanied by a small increase in renewable generation (2 kWh/m(2)/yr). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Economic optimization is considered an efficient tool to decide on the design level for adaptation. The costs associated with a flooding to the T-year level and the annual capital and operational costs of adapting to this level are described with log-linear relations. The total flooding costs are developed as the expected annual damage of flooding above the T-year level plus the annual capital and operational costs for ensuring no flooding below the T-year level. The value of the return period T that corresponds to the minimum of the sum of these costs will then be the optimal adaptation level. The change in climate, however, is expected to continue in the next century, which calls for expansion of the above model. The change can be expressed in terms of a climate factor (the ratio between the future and the current design level) which is assumed to increase in time. This implies increasing costs of flooding in the future for many places in the world. The optimal adaptation level is found for immediate as well as for delayed adaptation. In these cases, the optimum is determined by considering the net present value of the incurred costs during a sufficiently long time-span. Immediate as well as delayed adaptation is considered.","[Rosbjerg, Dan] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Rosbjerg, D (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, Lyngby, Denmark.",daro@env.dtu.dk,,"Rosbjerg, Dan/0000-0003-2204-8649",,,,,13,9,9,0,22,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

Twelve scenarios were formulated to represent rain and sea level in today's (reference)- and future climate. Future rainfall was computed using regional climate model data together with the Delta Change Method. Sea-related data was represented with two variables, namely an average sea level and storm surges. The average sea level was calculated to reflect seasonal variation using a second-order Fourier analysis whilst raw gauge data was used to capture the storm surges. The two sea variables were then scaled to represent future projections of sea level rise and storm surges in the study area. The performance of the drainage system was simulated with MIKE Urban 1D model and the results were expressed through two indicators, number of flooded nodes and flood frequency. The results of this study reveal a tipping point is likely to be found between years 2075 and 2100, after which storm surges become a major driver for overwhelmed drainage system. It was also found that pluvial floods may become more likely and frequent during winters as time progresses. This has a great implication when deciding on adaptation measures.","[Grip, Isabelle Laster] Ramboll Sweden, Skeppsgatan 5, SE-21111 Malmo, Sweden; [Grip, Isabelle Laster; Haghighatafshar, Salar; Aspegren, Henrik] Lund Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Water & Environm Engn, POB 124, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Aspegren, Henrik] Sweden Water Res AB, Ideon Sci Pk,Scheelevagen 25, SE-22370 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Haghighatafshar, S (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Water & Environm Engn, POB 124, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",Salar.Haghighatafshar@chemeng.lth.se,"Haghighatafshar, Salar/Q-3843-2018; Aspegren, Henrik/Q-1200-2018","Haghighatafshar, Salar/0000-0002-8640-2769; Aspegren, Henrik/0000-0001-5805-1589",Sweden Water Research AB; Swedish Water and Wastewater Association (Svenskt Vatten) via VA-teknik Sodra [SVU/18-130]; DHI Sweden,Sweden Water Research AB; Swedish Water and Wastewater Association (Svenskt Vatten) via VA-teknik Sodra; DHI Sweden,"This research was financially supported by Sweden Water Research AB and the Swedish Water and Wastewater Association (Svenskt Vatten) via VA-teknik Sodra (Project number: SVU/18-130).

However, hazards can restrict normal metro service and plans to develop or improve metro systems set aside some way to cope with these hazards. This paper presents a summary of the potential hazards to underground transportation systems worldwide, identifying a knowledge gap on the understanding of water-related impacts on metro networks. This is due to the frequency and scope of geotechnical and air quality hazards, which exceed in extreme magnitude the extreme precipitation events that can influence underground transportation systems. Thus, we emphasize the importance of studying the water-related hazards in metro systems to fill the gaps in this topic.","[Forero-Ortiz, Edwar; Martinez-Gomariz, Eduardo] CETaqua Water Technol Ctr, Barcelona, Spain; [Forero-Ortiz, Edwar; Martinez-Gomariz, Eduardo] Tech Univ Catalonia, Civil & Environm Engn Dept, Flumen Res Inst, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Forero-Ortiz, E (corresponding author), CETaqua Water Technol Ctr, Barcelona, Spain.;Forero-Ortiz, E (corresponding author), Tech Univ Catalonia, Civil & Environm Engn Dept, Flumen Res Inst, Barcelona, Spain.",eaforero@cetaqua.com,"Forero-Ortiz, Edwar/GSN-1091-2022; Gomariz, Eduardo Martínez/I-1269-2019; Forero Ortiz, Edwar Andres/C-4607-2014","Gomariz, Eduardo Martínez/0000-0002-0189-0725; Forero Ortiz, Edwar Andres/0000-0002-5238-278X",EU H2020 [700174],EU H2020,"The authors thank the RESCCUE project, which is funded by the EU H2020 (Grant Agreement No. 700174), whose support is gratefully acknowledged.",,104,10,11,17,105,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

In the USA, governments have traditionally relocated households using two mechanisms: buyout programs and eminent domain. Although both programs acquire private properties for public ownership and use, buyout programs are defined as voluntary by government entities, whereas eminent domain is compulsory. For decades, Harris County, Texas, has used both voluntary buyouts and eminent domain to relocate households out of flood-prone areas for different uses; buyouts produce open space, whereas eminent domain is used for flood risk reduction projects Although the literature on buyouts continues to grow, especially related to managed retreat, little research considers mandated relocation in response to hazard in the USA despite the increasing potential and calls for mandated relocations due to sea level rise and other climate-induced hazards. To address this gap in the literature, we analyze county records spanning approximately 100 years to examine the geographic patterns related to Harris County's use of eminent domain and buyouts programs to mitigate flood hazards. Integrating these records into a Geographic Information System, this novel study is the first to compare these two programs and consider the implications for future managed retreat.","[Zavar, Elyse] Univ North Texas, Dept Emergency Management & Disaster Sci, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Binder, Sherri Brokopp] BrokoppBinder Res & Consulting, Allentown, PA USA; [Greer, Alex] SUNY Albany, Dept Emergency Management & Homeland Secur, Albany, NY USA; [Breaux, Amber] Texas State Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, San Marcos, TX USA",University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos,"Zavar, E (corresponding author), Univ North Texas, Dept Emergency Management & Disaster Sci, Denton, TX 76203 USA.",elyse.zavar@unt.edu,,"Greer, Alex/0000-0002-5910-1637",Gulf Coast Research Program Early Career Fellowship,Gulf Coast Research Program Early Career Fellowship,This project was partially supported by the Gulf Coast Research Program Early Career Fellowship.,,56,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

Trees in cities have been documented to improve public health in many ways and provide climate regulating ecosystem services via shading, absorbing, and transpiring heat, measurably reducing heat-related illnesses and deaths. Advancing urban forest equity by planting trees in marginalized neighborhoods is acknowledged as a climate health equity strategy. But information is lacking about the efficacy of tree planting programs in advancing urban forest equity and public wellbeing. There is a need for frameworks to address the mismatch between policy goals, governance, resources, and community desires on how to green marginalized neighborhoods for public health improvement-especially in water-scarce environments. Prior studies have used environmental management-based approaches to evaluate planting programs, but few have focused on equity and health outcomes. We adapted a theory-based, multi-dimensional socio-ecological systems (SES) framework regularly used in the public health field to evaluate the Tree Ambassador, or Promotor Forestal, program in Los Angeles, US. The program is modeled after the community health worker model-where frontline health workers are trusted community members. It aims to address urban forest equity and wellbeing by training, supporting, and compensating residents to organize their communities. We use focus groups, surveys, and ethnographic methods to develop our SES model of community-based tree stewardship. The model elucidates how interacting dimensions-from individual to society level-drive urban forest equity and related public health outcomes. We then present an alternative framework, adding temporal and spatial factors to these dimensions. Evaluation results and our SES model highlight drivers aiding or hindering program trainees in organizing communities, including access to properties, perceptions about irrigation responsibilities, and lack of trust in local government. We also find that as trainee experience increases, measures including self- and collective efficacy and trust in their neighbors increase. Findings can inform urban forestry policy, planning, and management actions at the government and non-profit levels that aim to increase tree cover and reduce heat exposure in marginalized communities.","[de Guzman, Edith B.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Escobedo, Francisco J.] US Dept Agr USDA Forest Serv, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, Riverside, CA USA; [O'Leary, Rachel] City Plants, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"de Guzman, EB (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",eb3@ucla.edu,,,"U.S. Forest Service, Region 5's Urban and Community Forestry Program; Los Angeles Center for Urban Natural Resources Sustainability; UC Center for Climate, Health and Equity","U.S. Forest Service, Region 5's Urban and Community Forestry Program; Los Angeles Center for Urban Natural Resources Sustainability; UC Center for Climate, Health and Equity","This project was made possible with support from U.S. Forest Service, Region 5's Urban and Community Forestry Program, the Los Angeles Center for Urban Natural Resources Sustainability, and the UC Center for Climate, Health and Equity.",,74,1,1,1,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9634,,FRONT SUSTAIN CITIES,Front.

In fact, Sitio Pariahan is not the only one. Many parts of Manila Bay have slowly been sinking, causing the populations to be prone to coastal floods. According to the existing studies, coastal floods in Manila Bay areas are caused by climate-induced sea-level rise and land subsidence due to the excessive groundwater extraction and rapid urban development. However, it appears that the policies implemented by the government tend to be infrastructural, for example, dike construction, which could provide immediate protection but do not really solve the problem. This case study, therefore, presents a detailed account of coastal flooding in Manila Bay, particularly on its causes and policy options to address it. More specifically, it introduces the application of social contract to understand how the terms and conditions governing the state-citizens relations in the Philippines affect government's rationale in choosing policy options to solve the coastal flood problem.","[Fauzi, Dimas] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Bukit Timah, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Fauzi, D (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Bukit Timah, Singapore.",dimas.fauzi@u.nus.edu,,"Fauzi, Dimas/0000-0002-2649-4470",,,,,47,0,0,5,9,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,OAKLAND,"155 GRAND AVE, SUITE 400, OAKLAND, CA 94612-3758 USA",2473-9510,,,CASE STUD ENVIRON,Case Stud.

A great amount of research has already been completed considering the urban heat island, with a significant part of them based on the utilization of remote sensing. The results show that in the case of the densely built-up areas of Hungary the maximal intensity of the urban heat island can be experienced in the industrial areas and in the extremely densely built-up zones, while water bodies and surfaces covered by vegetation proved to be the coolest zones under all circumstances. Thus, according to the results only water and green surfaces are capable of effectively reducing the urban heat island. Firstly, urban green surfaces and water bodies must be created to become capable of decreasing the urban heat island to the maximal extent. Secondly, it is possible to maximize the rate of green and water coverage within settlements only with the tools of urban planning. Thus it is essential in the case of urban planning to implement the existing regulation tools to prevent or minimize the further intensifying of the urban heat island.","Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Garden & Open Space Design, H-1118 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Olah, AB (corresponding author), Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Garden & Open Space Design, Villanyi Ut 29-43, H-1118 Budapest, Hungary.",olah.andras.bela@gmail.com,,, [TAMOP-4.2.1/B-09/01/KMR-2010-0005],,This paper was supported by the TAMOP-4.2.1/B-09/01/KMR-2010-0005 project.,,24,27,27,17,94,CORVINUS UNIV BUDAPEST,BUDAPEST,"VILLANYI UT 29/43, BUDAPEST, H-1118, HUNGARY",1589-1623,1785-0037,,APPL ECOL ENV RES,Appl.

There have been several systems developed through the synthesis of biomimetics and ABS to reduce energy demand or improve comfort in buildings. This paper presents the definition, characterisation and a comparative analysis of existing applications in the field of biomimetic adaptive building skins (Bio-ABS). We evaluate current uptake in the field, present an overview of the state-of-the-art and undertake a meta-analysis of fifty-two Bio-ABS applications to determine performance trends, opportunities and challenges. We found that current development in the field of Bio-ABS is limited. 53.8% of all published Bio-ABS remain at a conceptual stage of development, resulting in a gap between theoretical and real-world uptake. In addition, there is little quantitative analysis in terms of environmental or energy performance measurements, with only 44.2% of the projects considering these performance metrics. Of those that do, 78.2% demonstrate either thermal or visual comfort analysis while only five, 21.7%, include energy analysis. A further conclusion drawn is that the majority of Bio-ABS are monofunctional, only controlling a single environmental parameter. Very little attention is paid to multifunctionality, with only 13.4% of the published projects controlling more than one parameter. Multifunctionality in Bio-ABS needs further study to address multiple contradictory functional requirements of buildings regarding energetic and environmental performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the aftermath, New York implemented a home buyout program designed to facilitate the permanent relocation of residents out of areas considered to be at risk for future hazards. While home buyout programs are becoming popular as policy tools for disaster mitigation, little is known about what factors influence homeowners to participate in or reject these programs. This study used mixed methods to assess the relationship between community resilience and the relocation decision in two heavily damaged communities in which the majority of residents made different decisions regarding whether or not to pursue a buyout. The sample was composed of residents from Oakwood Beach and Rockaway Park, both working-class communities in New York City, who participated via a community survey (N = 133) and/or in-depth interviews (N = 28). Results suggested that community resilience moderated the relationship between community of residence and the buyout decision, leading to opposite responses on the buyout decision. Contextual community factors, including the history of natural disasters, local cultural norms, and sense of place, were instrumental in explaining these different responses. Implications for disaster policy are discussed.","[Binder, Sherri Brokopp; Baker, Charlene K.; Barile, John P.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Psychol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Binder, SB (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Psychol, 2530 Dole St,C-400, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",brokopp@hawaii.edu,"Barile, John P./F-9456-2015","Barile, John P./0000-0003-4098-0640",Natural Hazards Center Quick Response Grant Program; National Science Foundation [CMMI1030670],Natural Hazards Center Quick Response Grant Program; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We would like to extend our sincerest thanks to the survivors of Hurricane Sandy who participated in this study, for taking the time to share their grief, pain, and hope with us during an unimaginably difficult period in their lives.

Scarcity of space and impacts of climate change are prominent drivers of land use and adaptation management today. Necessary modifications to present land use management strategies and schemes influence both the structures of coastal communities and the ecosystems involved. Approaches to identify the impacts and account for (i) the linkages between social preferences and needs and (ii) ecosystem services in coastal zones have been largely absent. The presented method focuses on improving the inclusion of ecosystem services in planning processes and clarifies the linkages with social impacts. In this study, fourteen stakeholders in decision-making on land use planning in the region of Krummhorn (northwestern Germany, southern North Sea coastal region) conducted a regional participative and informal process for local planning capable to adapt to climate driven changes. It is argued that scientific and practical implications of this integrated assessment focus on multi-functional options and contribute to more sustainable practices in future land use planning. The method operationalizes the ecosystem service approach and social impact analysis and demonstrates that social demands and provision of ecosystem services are inherently connected.

The article explains the re-modelling of the equality governance tool gender impact assessment in the context of climate change and adaptation policies, programmes and projects on behalf of the German Environment Agency. While the focus of the tool remains on women and men, it operates with an intersectional and non-binary gender+ concept and understanding of sex and gender relations. The main novelties of the tool are its evidence-based educational elements and that it encompasses seven gender dimensions addressing the main areas of life that play critical roles in producing and reproducing gender disparities. This allows for the identification of how climate policies interact with gender relations and can make substantial contributions to gender equality, as well as of areas in which addressing gender issues could render climate policies more effective. Drawing on the case of the GIA tool in Germany, we argue that core insights gained during the tool development and testing can be applied to gender mainstreaming strategies of climate policies and interventions in other jurisdictions, as well as holding potential for adoption in other policy domains.","[Sauer, Arn] German Environm Agcy, Umweltbundesamt UBA, Gender Mainstreaming, Dessau Rosslau, Germany; [Stiess, Immanuel] Inst Social Ecol Res, Res Unit Energy & Climate Protect Everyday Life, Frankfurt, Germany",,"Sauer, A (corresponding author), UBA German Environm Agcy, Umweltbundesamt UBA, German Environm Agcy, Gender Mainstreaming, Worlitzer Pl 1, D-06844 Dessau Rosslau, Germany.",arn.sauer@uba.de,,,German Environment Agency (UBA) [3716 41 1190],German Environment Agency (UBA),"This article is based on the research project 'Interdependent Gender Aspects of Climate Policy' (UBA Texts 30/2020) funded by the German Environment Agency (UBA) under grant no. 3716 41 1190 and contracted to the consortium Wuppertal Institute, Institute for Social-Ecological Research and GenderCC.

In Bihar, farmers plant rice after the first significant rains, and climatic shocks induced by low temperatures and terminal heat stress at the end of the corresponding season can significantly affect rice and wheat yields. The present work evaluates the benefit of using an earlier date for planting rice, following the monsoon onset, in reducing thermal stress on rice-wheat systems. High-resolution gridded crop simulations using the APSIM model were performed to simulate potential yields using the monsoon onset and the farmers' practice as planting dates. The monsoon onset was calculated using an agronomic definition, and farmers' practice dates were estimated using satellite data. The results were analyzed in terms of planting dates, yields, and the incidence of temperature stress on rice and wheat by means of the APSIM yields limiting factors. The results show that the rice planting and harvest dates using the monsoon onset are, in general, 20-30 days earlier, which translates into higher and more stable potential yields, which can be up to 50% higher in wheat and 29% in rice. The incidence of thermal stress can be, on average, 12% lower in rice and 25% in wheat. These results can help design mitigation strategies for the impacts of temperature-induced shock events in the context of the advances in sub-seasonal and seasonal forecasting, targeting climate services for farmers in Bihar.","[Montes, Carlo] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Texcoco 56237, Mexico; [Urfels, Anton] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Kathmandu 44700, Nepal; [Han, Eunjin] USDA, Agr Res Serv, Adapt Cropping Syst Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; [Balwinder-Singh] Dept Primary Ind & Reg Dev, Northam 6401, Australia",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Montes, C (corresponding author), Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Texcoco 56237, Mexico.",c.montes@cgiar.org,,,"CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR Regional Integrated Initiative Transforming Agrifood Systems in South Asia; TAFSSA; CGIAR Foresight and Metrics to Accelerate Inclusive and Sustainable Agrifood System Transformation initiative","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); CGIAR Regional Integrated Initiative Transforming Agrifood Systems in South Asia; TAFSSA; CGIAR Foresight and Metrics to Accelerate Inclusive and Sustainable Agrifood System Transformation initiative","This study was supported by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS; https://ccafs.cgiar.org; accessed on 1 December 2022), by the CGIAR Regional Integrated Initiative Transforming Agrifood Systems in South Asia, or TAFSSA (https://www.cgiar.org/initiative/20-transforming-agrifood-systems-in-south-asia-tafssa/; accessed on 1 December 2022), and by the CGIAR Foresight and Metrics to Accelerate Inclusive and Sustainable Agrifood System Transformation initiative (https://www.cgiar.org/initiative/24-foresight-and-metrics-to-accelerate-inclusive-andsustainable-agrifood-system-transformation/; ac-cessed on 1 December 2022).",,52,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,JAN,2023,14,1,,,,,,,40,10.3390/atmos14010040,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos14010040,,,14,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,8B5AH,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000916934600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we examine whether Californians living in subsidized housing are more vulnerable to extreme heat than those living in unsubsidized housing. We create a tract-level data set combining housing characteristics, downscaled climate projections, and an index of adaptive capacity and sensitivity to heat. We analyze exposure and vulnerability to heat by housing type and location. We find that subsidized housing is disproportionately located in the hottest tracts that simultaneously also have the most sensitive populations and barriers to adaptation (high-high tracts). Whereas 8% of California's housing units are in high-high tracts, these tracts contain 16% of public housing units, 14% of Low-Income Housing Tax Credit units, and 10% of Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers.

Based on a forecast and pre-defined trigger level, a Red Cross Red Crescent project distributed an unconditional cash grant of BDT 5000 (USD 60 equivalent) to 1039 poor households in highly vulnerable, flood-prone communities in the Brahmaputra river basin before an early flood peak. Systems that can deliver forecast-based cash grants are a potential adaptation strategy to deal with changes in extreme events linked to climate change. This paper presents the results of a mixed-methods, quasi-experimental study, based on a post-disaster household survey. The research assesses the effectiveness of the forecast-based cash distribution in helping beneficiaries to take preparatory early actions and reduce the negative impacts of the flood on their health, well-being, assets and livelihoods. The assessment shows that the cash grants contributed to improving households' access to food, a reduction in high-interest debt accrual of vulnerable households, and reduced psychosocial stress during and after the flood period, compared to a control group of similarly vulnerable and flood-affected communities that did not receive the forecast-based cash assistance. The intervention may also have prevented households from being forced to make destitution sales of valuable assets, as indicated by qualitative data collected in July, but we do not see these benefits sustained after a second flood peak in August 2017. There is a need for further research to assess the longer-term effects of forecast-based cash on the socio-economic development and well-being of the most vulnerable.","[Gros, Clemens; Bailey, Meghan; Hassan, Ahmadul; Jaime, Catalina; de Perez, Erin Coughlan] Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Ctr, Anna van Saksenlaan 50, NL-2593 HT The Hague, Netherlands; [Bailey, Meghan] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, 34 Broad St, Oxford OX1 3BD, England; [Schwager, Saroja; de Perez, Erin Coughlan] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Earth Inst, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Zingg, Raymond; Uddin, Muhammad Mamtaz; Shahjahan, Mohammad; Islam, Hasibul] German Red Cross Bangladesh, 684-686 Red Crescent Sarak, Dhaka 1217, Bangladesh; [Lux, Stefanie] German Red Cross, Carstennstr 58, D-12205 Berlin, Germany; [de Perez, Erin Coughlan] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Oxford; Columbia University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Gros, C (corresponding author), Rhinower Str 11, D-10437 Berlin, Germany.",gros@climatecentre.org,,"Jaime, Catalina/0000-0002-1053-8344; Gros, Clemens/0000-0001-6585-753X","German Federal Foreign Office, under the Action Plan of the Federal Foreign Office for humanitarian adaptation to climate change","German Federal Foreign Office, under the Action Plan of the Federal Foreign Office for humanitarian adaptation to climate change","This work was supported by the German Federal Foreign Office, under the Action Plan of the Federal Foreign Office for humanitarian adaptation to climate change.",,34,20,20,1,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

The impact has certainly been very high in Muooni catchment where more than 99% of the natural forest has been cleared. The warming micro-climate is accelerated by extended deforestation, unsustainable irrigation, and water over-abstraction in the catchment by eucalyptus and other exotic trees. The dwindling crop yields add to the farmer's suffering. Farming communities have created various innovative ways of coping with a warming environment to increase their agriculture resiliency. These include, among others, rain water management, reforestation and agro-forestry. To what extent have these practices been disturbed by the increasing temperatures, and decreasing rainfalls and river discharges in Muooni catchment? This study used statistical forecast techniques to unveil the past, current and future variations of the micro-climate in Muooni catchment, and relevant factors determining farmers' vulnerability to drought. Muooni catchment is warming by 0.8 to 1.2 degrees C in a century as a result of a changing micro-climate. These changes are mainly driven by deforestation due to the high urbanization rate and agricultural practices in Muooni catchment. Centennial rainfall is subsequently plummeting at 30 to 50 mm while discharges are decreasing from 0.01 to 0.05 m(3<bold>)s(</bold>-1), with unmet water demands of 30% to 95% and above.

However, values, beliefs, identities, goals, and social networks shape perceptions and actions about climate change. Engagement processes that ignore the socio-cultural context within which stakeholders are embedded may fail to guide adaptive responses. To facilitate dialog around these issues, the Southeast Climate Consortium and the Florida Climate Institute formed a climate learning network consisting of row crop farmers, agricultural extension specialists, researchers, and climate scientists working in the Southeast US. Regional in scope, the learning network engages researchers and practitioners from Alabama, Georgia, and Florida as partners in adaptation science. This paper describes the ongoing interactions, dialog, and experiential learning among the network's diverse participants. We illustrate how participatory tools have been used in a series of workshops to create interactive spaces for knowledge coproduction. For example, historical timelines, climate scenarios, and technology exchanges stimulated discussions about climate-related risk management. We present findings from the workshops related to participants' perspectives on climate change and adaptation. Finally, we discuss lessons learned that may be applicable to other groups involved in climate education, communication, and stakeholder engagement. We suggest that the thoughtful design of stakeholder engagement processes can become a powerful social tool for improving decision support and strengthening adaptive capacity within rural communities.","[Bartels, Wendy-Lin; Diehl, David C.; Royce, Fred S.; Dourte, Daniel R.; Irani, Tracy A.; Fraisse, Clyde W.; Jones, James W.] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Furman, Carrie A.] Univ Georgia, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Ortiz, Brenda V.] Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Zierden, David F.] Florida State Univ, Florida Climate Ctr, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Zierden, David F.] Florida State Univ, Ctr Ocean Atmospher Predict Studies, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Auburn University System; Auburn University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Bartels, WL (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",wendylin@ufl.edu,"Jones, James/AAP-9048-2020","Jones, James/0000-0002-3239-8960; Fraisse, Clyde W./0000-0001-9875-2187","National Commission on Energy Policy (NCEP)-Iconic Agricultural Crops: Climate Change Impacts on Peanut, Cotton, and Corn in Georgia and Florida; National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)-Climate variability to climate change: Extension challenges and opportunities in the Southeast USA; National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)","National Commission on Energy Policy (NCEP)-Iconic Agricultural Crops: Climate Change Impacts on Peanut, Cotton, and Corn in Georgia and Florida; National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)-Climate variability to climate change: Extension challenges and opportunities in the Southeast USA; National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","Special thanks are extended to all row crop producers and county extension agents who have participated in the climate learning network.

Climate models project substantial warming above the global average and high rates of environmental change in polar regions, but local impacts remain uncertain. These rapid alterations will affect biophysical, economic, and sociocultural conditions. This research aims to uncover early climate change indicators through climate model projections and individuals' perceptions by focusing on a sample of 39 municipalities north of the Arctic Circle in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and northwestern Russia. The study employs an exploratory sequential approach by combining representations of climate model projections in a geographic information system (GIS) with qualitative analysis from semi-structured interviews with local officials involved in planning decisions for each municipality. And, second, the study combined perceptions of early climate change indicators and their subsequent challenges and opportunities with regional climate projections. Results indicate an overall geographic 'match' between climate model projections and perceptions, but differences between north-to-south, coast-to-interior, and national perspectives are notable. Some of these differences point to the roles of nationally, regionally, and locally embedded geographies, producing a multitude of lived experiences.

The testing of the model for heat waves and pluvial flooding has been implemented in the urban system of Naples City which has been divided into the physical subsystem and the population subsystem.","[D'Ambrosio, Valeria] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Architettura, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"D'Ambrosio, V (corresponding author), Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Architettura, Naples, Italy.",valeria.dambrosio@unina.it,,,,,,,12,1,1,6,17,FIRENZE UNIV PRESS,FIRENZE,"JOURNALS DIVISION, BORGO ALBIZI, 28, FIRENZE, 50122, ITALY",2239-0243,,,TECHNE,Techne,,2018,15,,,,,,246,256,,10.13128/Techne-22097,http://dx.doi.org/10.13128/Techne-22097,,,11,Architecture,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Architecture,GO8UN,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000440373600032,View Full Record in Web of Science

To address the projected increase in flood risk, a combination of structural and non-structural flood risk mitigation measures is considered as a promising adaptation strategy. Such a combination takes into account that flood defence systems may fail, and prepares for unexpected crisis situations via land-use planning and private damage reduction, e.g. via building precautionary measures, and disaster response. However, knowledge about damage-reducing measures is scarce and often fragmented since based on case studies. For instance, it is believed that private precautionary measures, like shielding with water shutters or building fortification, are especially effective in areas with frequent flood events and low flood water levels. However, some of these measures showed a significant damage-reducing effect also during the extreme flood event in 2002 in Germany. This review analyses potentials of land-use planning and private flood precautionary measures as components of adaptation strategies for global change. Focus is on their implementation, their damage-reducing effects and their potential contribution to address projected changes in flood risk, particularly in developed countries.","[Kreibich, Heidi; Bubeck, Philip] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Hydrol 5 4, Telegrafenberg, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; Adelphi, Berlin, Germany; [Van Vliet, Mathijs] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [De Moel, Hans] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bubeck, Philip] Univ Potsdam, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, Potsdam, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; Wageningen University & Research; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Potsdam,"Kreibich, H (corresponding author), GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Hydrol 5 4, Telegrafenberg, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",kreib@gfz-potsdam.de,"de Moel, Hans/L-1311-2013; Bubeck, Philip/ABA-2750-2020; Kreibich, Heidi/HNR-9624-2023","Kreibich, Heidi/0000-0001-6274-3625; de Moel, Hans/0000-0002-6826-1974; Bubeck, Philip/0000-0001-5163-5290",,,,,156,93,92,2,77,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

While they have growing public and private support, the realizable benefits and unintended consequences of NbCS are not well understood. At regional scales where policy decisions are often made, NbCS benefits are estimated from soil and tree survey data that can miss important carbon sources and sinks within an ecosystem, and do not reveal the biophysical impacts of NbCS for local water and energy cycles. The only direct observations of ecosystem-scale carbon fluxes, for example, by eddy covariance flux towers, have not yet been systematically assessed for what they can tell us about NbCS potentials, and state-of-the-art remote sensing products and land-surface models are not yet being widely used to inform NbCS policymaking or implementation. As a result, there is a critical mismatch between the point- and tree-scale data most often used to assess NbCS benefits and impacts, the ecosystem and landscape scales where NbCS projects are implemented, and the regional to continental scales most relevant to policymaking. Here, we propose a research agenda to confront these gaps using data and tools that have long been used to understand the mechanisms driving ecosystem carbon and energy cycling, but have not yet been widely applied to NbCS. We outline steps for creating robust NbCS assessments at both local to regional scales that are informed by ecosystem-scale observations, and which consider concurrent biophysical impacts, future climate feedbacks, and the need for equitable and inclusive NbCS implementation strategies. We contend that these research goals can largely be accomplished by shifting the scales at which pre-existing tools are applied and blended together, although we also highlight some opportunities for more radical shifts in approach.","[Novick, Kimberly A.; Barnes, Mallory; Cala, Daniela S.] Indiana Univ, ONeill Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Metzger, Stefan] Battelle Mem Inst, Natl Ecol Observ Network, Boulder, CO USA; [Anderegg, William R.

Here we demonstrate the utility of water balance as a tool for understanding natural resource responses to climate by developing case studies focused on stream flow, vegetation production, and wildfire ignition at Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve (GSDNP), U.S.A. The efficacy of water balance to predict these responses stems from the explicit integration of climate with site conditions that modify the effects of climate. This in turn results in estimates of water availability, water use, and water need that are proximal drivers of aquatic and terrestrial natural resource conditions. The water balance model successfully forecasted stream flow (r(2) = 0.69, P < 0.001); determined the critical water needs for maintaining annual vegetation production in different vegetation types spanning a large environmental gradient (r(2) = 0.18-0.71); and predicted proportion of historic wildfire ignitions in forest (r(2) = 0.96-0.99) and non-forest (r(2) = 0.96-0.97) vegetation types. Collectively, these case studies demonstrate practical approaches to translate climate data into assessments of natural resource condition that inform long-term planning and near-term strategic actions needed for conservation of protected areas.

This paper presents a multi-risk approach integrating multiple climate-related hazards and exposure and vulnerability factors across different spatial units and temporal scales. The multi-hazard assessment employs an influence matrix to analyze the relationships among hazards (sea-level rise, coastal erosion, and storm surge) and their disjoint probability. The multi-vulnerability considers the susceptibility of the exposed receptors (wetlands, beaches, and urban areas) to different hazards based on multiple indicators (dunes, shoreline evolution, and urbanization rate). The methodology was applied in the North Adriatic coast, producing a ranking of multi-hazard risks by means of GIS maps and statistics. The results highlight that the higher multi-hazard score (meaning presence of all investigated hazards) is near the coastline while multi-vulnerability is relatively high in the whole case study, especially for beaches, wetlands, protected areas, and river mouths. The overall multi-risk score presents a trend similar to multi-hazard and shows that beaches is the receptor most affected by multiple risks (60% of surface in the higher multi-risk classes). Risk statistics were developed for coastal municipalities and local stakeholders to support the setting of adaptation priorities and coastal zone management plans.","[Gallina, Valentina; Torresan, Silvia; Zabeo, Alex; Critto, Andrea; Marcomini, Antonio] Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Via Torino 155, I-30172 Venice, Italy; [Torresan, Silvia; Critto, Andrea; Marcomini, Antonio] Fdn Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Risk Assessment & Adaptat Strategies Div, Via Liberta 12, I-30175 Venice, Italy; [Glade, Thomas] Univ Vienna, Dept Geog & Reg Res, Univ Str 7, A-1010 Vienna, Austria",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); University of Vienna,"Marcomini, A (corresponding author), Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Via Torino 155, I-30172 Venice, Italy.;Marcomini, A (corresponding author), Fdn Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Risk Assessment & Adaptat Strategies Div, Via Liberta 12, I-30175 Venice, Italy.",valegallina@yahoo.it; silvia.torresan@cmcc.it; alex.zabeo@unive.it; critto@unive.it; thomas.glade@univie.ac.at; marcom@unive.it,"Glade, Thomas/H-6325-2017","Glade, Thomas/0000-0001-9676-4416; TORRESAN, Silvia/0000-0002-9758-7084","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research; Italian Ministry of Environment, Land, and Sea under the GEMINA project","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Italian Ministry of Environment, Land, and Sea under the GEMINA project","The research leading to these results has received funding from the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research and the Italian Ministry of Environment, Land, and Sea under the GEMINA project.",,103,18,19,7,35,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2020,12,9,,,,,,,3697,10.3390/su12093697,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12093697,,,28,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LU0TK,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000537476200195,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of the study is to design and experimentally verify the typology of outdoor areas of restaurants in terms of their thermal comfort factors, based on a case study of Pilsen's city centre. The research carried out in 2017 in the city centre of Pilsen investigated what means are used by restaurants to improve thermal conditions and how the location of an outdoor restaurant in an urban area affects its thermal comfort. There were forty-three outdoor areas of city centre restaurants included in the proposed typology, based upon their location. The relevance of typology was verified using a selected set of fourteen outdoor restaurant areas. They were evaluated according to the availability of means for comfort enhancement and experimental measurements of relevant meteorological elements. Type 1 (Square restaurant) exhibited the highest air and surface temperatures. In contrast, Type 2 (Courtyard restaurant) showed the lowest air and surface temperatures and Type 3 (Park restaurant) showed the highest air humidity. Type 4 (Street canyon restaurant) had similar temperatures to Type 1, and air humidity was closer to Type 2. According to the number of Beergarden Days, the days when the air temperature at 9 p.m. was higher than 20 degrees C, the best conditions for sitting outside throughout the year occur from the second half of June to the end of August. The results of the study can contribute to an improvement in the thermal comfort of customers of outdoor restaurants in cities, especially with regard to the choice of locations of outdoor restaurants and the use of elements that influence thermal comfort.","[Vit, Vaclav; Kopp, Jan] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Geog, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Kopp, J (corresponding author), Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Geog, Plzen, Czech Republic.",kopp@kge.zcu.cz,"Kopp, Jan/ABB-4488-2021","Kopp, Jan/0000-0002-4768-613X",Technology Agency of the Czech Republic [ETA TL01000498],Technology Agency of the Czech Republic,"This research was supported by the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic, Grant ETA TL01000498 Revitalization of city centres and other public spaces in the Czech Republic: Problems, foreign inspiration, possible solutions.",,45,3,3,2,10,CLUJ UNIV PRESS,CLUJ NAPOCA,"STRADA B P HASDEU NR 51, CLUJ NAPOCA, 400371, ROMANIA",2069-3419,2248-2199,,J SETTL SPAT PLAN,J.

It is increasingly clear that green stormwater infrastructure not only controls stormwater volume and timing, but also promotes ecosystem services, which are the benefits that ecosystems provide to humans. Yet there has been little synthesis focused on understanding how green stormwater management affects ecosystem services. The objectives of this paper are to review and synthesize published literature on ecosystem services and green stormwater infrastructure and identify gaps in research and understanding, establishing a foundation for research at the intersection of ecosystems services and green stormwater management. We reviewed 170 publications on stormwater management and ecosystem services, and summarized the state-of-the-science categorized by the four types of ecosystem services. Major findings show that: (1) most research was conducted at the parcel-scale and should expand to larger scales to more closely understand green stormwater infrastructure impacts, (2) nearly a third of papers developed frameworks for implementing green stormwater infrastructure and highlighted barriers, (3) papers discussed ecosystem services, but less than 40% quantified ecosystem services, (4) no geographic trends emerged, indicating interest in applying green stormwater infrastructure across different contexts, (5) studies increasingly integrate engineering, physical science, and social science approaches for holistic understanding, and (6) standardizing green stormwater infrastructure terminology would provide a more cohesive field of study than the diverse and often redundant terminology currently in use. We recommend that future research provide metrics and quantify ecosystem services, integrate disciplines to measure ecosystem services from green stormwater infrastructure, and better incorporate stormwater management into environmental policy.

Furthermore, Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) is hindered by water governance gaps. We have analyzed IWRM in 45 municipalities and regions divided over 27 countries using the improved City BlueprintA (R) Framework (CBF). The CBF incorporates solely performance-oriented indicators that more accurately measure the city's own efforts and performances to improve its IWRM. We have also analyzed the trends and pressures (on which the city's IWRM has a negligible influence). The Trends and Pressure Framework (TPF) creates awareness of the most stressing topics that either hamper or, on the contrary, pose opportunity windows for IWRM. The improved Blue City Index (BCI*) and the Trends and Pressures Index (TPI; the arithmetic mean of all TPF indicators) have been compared with other city descriptors. The BCI* and TPI showed a significant and negative Pearson correlation (r = -0.83). This implies that cities with pressing needs to improve their IWRM also face the highest environmental, financial and/or social limitations. The BCI* and TPI correlate significantly with the ND-GAIN climate readiness index (r = 0.86; r = -0.94), the environmental awareness index (r = 0.85; r = -0.85), the European green city index (r = 0.86; r = -0.85) and various World Bank governance indicators. Based on a hierarchical clustering of the 45 municipalities and regions, 5 different levels of sustainability of urban IWRM could be distinguished, i.e., (1) cities lacking basic water services, (2) wasteful cities, (3) water efficient cities, (4) resource efficient and adaptive cities, and (5) water wise cities. This categorization, as well as the CBF and TPF are heuristic approaches to speed up the transition towards water wise cities.","[Koop, Steven H.

We distinguish between the effects of changes in growing season weather from those due to changes in long-term climate trends and the heterogeneity in these effects across the distribution of crop yields by estimating naive and climate penalty inclusive models using fixed-effect quantile panel models. We observe an absence of adaptation against rising temperatures for rice and wheat. However, we find a statistically significant presence of adaptation for wheat and maize for changes in precipitation, though the magnitude is small. Moreover, we find that the effects are asymmetric, and are larger at the lower tail of productivity distribution and smaller at the upper tail of the distribution. A 1 degrees C increase in temperature lowers rice and wheat productivity by 23% and 9%, respectively at the first quantile, but the damage is only 6% and 5% at the ninth quantile. Heterogeneity in impacts and adaptation estimates over the yield distribution curve and across crops suggests the importance of customizing strategies for adaptation to changing weather and climate conditions across regions, crops, and current productivity levels.","[Kumar, Surender] Univ Delhi, Delhi Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Delhi, India; [Khanna, Madhu] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Delhi School of Economics; University of Delhi; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Khanna, M (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",khanna1@illinois.edu,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

There are various methods that can be used to calculate T-sol by considering sky radiation effects. Climate conditions are vital factors affecting sky temperature (T-sky). In this paper, in order to select an appropriate calculation method to determine long-wave radiation, a theoretical analysis was carried out based on the effect of T-sky on the thermal gain of building envelopes due to long-wave radiation. Typical annual meteorological data were selected to calculate T-sol for 10 meteorological stations covering five building thermal zones in China. The application of the T-sol model was studied using MBE as the measurement standard, and a linear regression equation for the calorific value of the envelope obtained via the T-sky estimation method and the T-sky dynamic calculation method was established. The results show that relative humidity is the key meteorological factor that affects the application of the T-sol model and that the T-sky dynamic calculation should be used to calculate long-wave radiation in regions with low relative humidity. A thermal correction equation for buildings was obtained for use in areas lacking meteorological data and to provide a basis for sustainable building design.","[Chen, Jie; Fan, Yue; Wang, Menghan] Shenzhen Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Fan, Yue] Shenzhen Ctr Human Oriented Environm & Sustainable, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China",Shenzhen University,"Fan, Y (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China.;Fan, Y (corresponding author), Shenzhen Ctr Human Oriented Environm & Sustainable, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China.",yfan@szu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China;  [52178020],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); ,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number no. 52178020.",,20,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2023,15,1,,,,,,,839,10.3390/su15010839,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15010839,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,7Q4QW,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000909378400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study aims to assess how and to what extent a navigation tool on urban heat could support urban climate risk management, and to evaluate the potential of the tool to support everyday adaptation and increase citizen engagement. We explore what functionality and additional information would be required to make the tool useful and relevant for different user groups.

Hence, the relocation of coffee farms to regions at higher altitudes has been suggested in order to assure sustainability and resilience for Ethiopian coffee production. In this paper, we study how sunk establishment costs, uncertain net returns and policy-induced incentives may affect the timing and value of a coffee farm relocation. This is done by developing a real-options model taking into account the relevant drivers of the farmer's decision to relocate. We then present an empirical analysis examining a hypothetical relocation. We show that relocation is a rather attractive opportunity even though the presence of volatile net returns and relatively high establishment costs may induce its postponement. Thus, we determine the optimal amount of subsidy needed in order to foster the relocation process.","[di Corato, Luca] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 873 Fondamenta San Giobbe, I-30121 Venice, Italy; [Ginbo, Tsegaye] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Box 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"di Corato, L (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 873 Fondamenta San Giobbe, I-30121 Venice, Italy.",luca.dicorato@unive.it; tsegaye.ginbo@slu.se,"Gatiso, Tsegaye Ginbo/HMV-2886-2023","Gatiso, Tsegaye Ginbo/0000-0003-2450-6236; Di Corato, Luca/0000-0002-1023-9504",,,,,63,0,0,5,15,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

The relationship between climate change as a direct cause of migration continues to give rise to debates concerning vulnerabilities, while at the same time gendered dimensions of vulnerabilities remain limited to binary approaches. There is limited cross-fertilization between disciplines that go beyond comparison between males and females but interrogate gender in association with climate change and migration. Here, we seek to develop an analytical lens to the nexus between gender, migration and climate change in producing, reproducing and sustaining at risk conditions and vulnerabilities. When gender and mobility are conceptualized as a process, and climate change as a risk modifier, the nexus between them can be better interrogated. Starting by using gender as an organizing principle that structures and stratifies relations entails viewing gender not as a category that distinguishes males and females but as a discursive process of social construction that (re)produces subjectivities and inequalities. Gender is a dynamic process that shapes and (re)produces vulnerabilities and consequently shapes mediation of climate impacts and migration and is also shaped by symbolic processes that go beyond households and communities.","[Lama, Phudoma; Hamza, Mo; Wester, Misse] Lund Univ, Div Risk Management & Societal Safety, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Hamza, M (corresponding author), Fac Engn, Div Risk Management & Societal Safety, POB 118, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",mo.hamza@risk.lth.se,"Hamza, Mo/ABC-1814-2020","Hamza, Mo/0000-0002-1908-1627; Wester, Misse/0000-0002-4671-758X",,,,,113,15,15,5,42,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

However, despite the many potential upsides of adding biochar to amend carbon-depleted soils in sub-Saharan Africa, deployment is largely lacking. This paper explores the socio-economic factors that can explain tendencies to avoid action. Based on a survey of 172 farming households, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions in the Mbeya and Songwe regions of Tanzania, which were targeted for a biochar aid program in 2014, several socio-economic drivers behind the continued use of biochar deployment were identified in this follow-up study. A key deployment driver was the increased crop yields, perceived to be the result of adding biochar to soils, increasing yields from 1 metric ton per hectare to 3 metric tons per hectare. Food security and family income were cited as the main reasons to engage in biochar production and use. Climate change mitigation and increased resilience were other key reasons that motivated adoption. In terms of socio-economic factors, farmers with low education and income, the majority being males aged 40-60 years, contributed to low adoption rates in the study area. Respondents often cited the alternative usage of biochar feedstocks, lack of government involvement or extension services, traditions, and farming customs as the main constraints limiting biochar deployment.","[Rogers, Peter Msumali; Yanda, Pius; Pauline, Noah] Univ Dar Salaam, Inst Resource Assessment, POB 35091, Dar Es Salaam 35091, Tanzania; [Fridahl, Mathias; Hansson, Anders] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Haikola, Simon] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Technol & Social Change, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden",University of Dar es Salaam; Linkoping University; Linkoping University,"Rogers, PM (corresponding author), Univ Dar Salaam, Inst Resource Assessment, POB 35091, Dar Es Salaam 35091, Tanzania.",rogerspeter120@gmail.com; mathias.fridahl@liu.se; pyanda@gmail.com; anders.n.hansson@liu.se; pauline.noah@udsm.ac.tz; simon.haikola@liu.se,,"Hansson, Anders/0000-0002-1156-8748; Fridahl, Mathias/0000-0002-1912-5538; Rogers, Peter/0000-0002-7932-8417; Haikola, Simon/0000-0002-2874-4146",Swedish Research Council [2016-06359]; Formas [2019-01973],Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),FundingThe funding for this research was provided by the Swedish Research Council [grant no. 2016-06359] and Formas [grant no. 2019-01973].,,45,5,5,3,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,JAN,2022,15,1,,,,,,,144,10.3390/en15010144,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15010144,,,19,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,YV6DK,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000752816500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Prototypes were comparatively analyzed for development and optimization in architectural applications. It is challenging to train permanent shapes, to program temporary shapes and to design repetitive material behaviours. Measures to achieve reversible reiterative shape-changing materials are required for practical implementation. For further design-fabrication research on the actual temperature and the material behaviours of designed elements, the SMP with glass transition at 35 degrees C was applied.

A set of evaluative criteria is introduced, which are proposed for assessing joint fact finding processes both procedurally and substantively in terms of the outcomes, considering them to be both arenas for collaborative governance and joint knowledge production efforts. These criteria are applied to a case in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. This case suggests that joint fact-finding can provide value, but also reveals some lessons. For the efforts themselves, these lessons relate to: The practical applicability of the outcomes; the inherently contingent nature of the outcomes when addressing wicked problems; questions of representation from stakeholder groups; and the importance of leadership and good process design. The following observations are made regarding the criteria: While they are typically interdependent, both process and outcomes should be evaluated; and more attention should be paid to the method and metrics of evaluation, while recognizing that there is no single formula or approach that can be applied, given the heterogeneity of the criteria.","[Schenk, Todd] Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Vogel, Ruben A.

However, drought can also be a high impact or extreme event in some cases, such as the exceptional 2002 drought that had deleterious impacts across the Western United States. Studies of long-term climate variability along with climate change projections indicate that the Western United States should expect much more severe and extended drought episodes than experienced over the last century when most modern water law and policies were developed, such as the 1922 Colorado River Compact. This paper will discuss research examining regional socio-natural climate vulnerability and adaptive response capacities to the 2002 drought in the Yampa-White Basins region of Colorado across sectors and will demonstrate how a bottom-up or toad's eye approach to understanding drought is paramount to complement top-down, instrumental data-driven analyses of drought. The results of empirical observations through interviews and participant observation in combination with analysis of drought indicators will be presented. Implications for adaptation research and planning for climate variability and change will be discussed.","Colorado State Univ, North Cent Climate Sci Ctr, Nat Resources Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University,"McNeeley, SM (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, North Cent Climate Sci Ctr, Nat Resources Ecol Lab, NESB A309,1231 East Dr, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",shannon.mcneeley@colostate.edu,,,National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Integrated Science Program; Advanced Study Program; Climate Science and Applications Program; National Science Foundation,National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Integrated Science Program; Advanced Study Program; Climate Science and Applications Program; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The author thanks the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Integrated Science Program, Advanced Study Program, and the Climate Science and Applications Program and their sponsor, the National Science Foundation, for supporting this research.

These challenges are deeply intertwined with global processes, such as climate change and with local events such as natural disasters. The EU's research & innovation (R & I) policy is now seeking to address these challenges from a new perspective, with Nature-Based Solutions, and turn them into innovation opportunities that optimise the synergies between nature, society and the economy. Nature-Based Solutions can be an opportunity for innovation, and are here promoted by both policymakers and practitioners as a cost-effective way of creating a greener, more sustainable, and more competitive economy. Since 2013, the European Commission has devoted particular attention to Nature-Based Solutions through consultations and dialogues that sought to make the concept of these solutions more concrete and to define the concept's place within the spectrum of ecosystem-based approaches. In 2014, the Commission launched an expert group, which conducted further analysis, and made recommendations to help increase the use of Nature Based Solutions and bring nature back into cities. In 2015, a survey was conducted on citizens' views and perceptions of Nature in Cities' to provide further insight for future work. Based on these elements and on results from running EU projects, the Commission has developed an R & I agenda for Nature-Based Solutions and has published targeted calls for proposals for large-scale demonstration projects in this field in 2016 and 2017. Additional R & I actions at EU level that promote systemic Nature-Based Solutions and their benefits to cities and territories are planned with the aim to improve the implementation capacity and evidence base for deploying Nature-Based Solutions and developing corresponding future markets. They are also expected to foster an interdisciplinary R & I and stakeholder community and the exchange of good practices in this field, as well as help shaping and implementing international R & I agendas on Nature-Based Solutions.","[Faivre, Nicolas; Fritz, Marco; Freitas, Tiago; de Boissezon, Birgit; Vandewoestijne, Sofie] European Commiss, Directorate Gen Res & Innovat DG RTD, Directorate Climate Act & Resource Efficiency, Unit Sustainable Management Nat Resources, Ghent, Belgium",,"Faivre, N (corresponding author), European Commiss, Directorate Gen Res & Innovat DG RTD, Directorate Climate Act & Resource Efficiency, Unit Sustainable Management Nat Resources, Ghent, Belgium.",nicolas.faivre@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,34,232,240,55,282,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0013-9351,1096-0953,,ENVIRON RES,Environ.

However, the combined cooling effect of integrated blue and green space remains uncertain. In this study, a combination of modelling and observational analyses uncovered a win-win interaction between coexisting blue and green spaces in terms of urban cooling. That is, the integration of water bodies and green spaces can reinforce the mutual cooling potential and provide greater urban cooling than stand-alone water bodies and green spaces. The results indicated that the known influencing factors such as area, shape and planting structure had no impact on the cooling effect of riverside urban green spaces. Instead, the width of the adjacent river reach and the degree of contact with the reach were significantly positively related to the cooling effect of riverside green spaces. The surface/air temperature of a riverside green space can be 4.2 degrees C/3.7 degrees C lower in the daytime in summer, and 3.1 degrees C/2.7 degrees C lower in spring than a non-riverside green space of similar size. Urban green spaces with water bodies inside could cause about 0.99 degrees C and 1.45 degrees C more deduction of land surface temperature (LST) than simple green spaces of similar size in spring and summer, respectively. There were about 1 degrees C-2.9 degrees C more deductions in the air temperature of a river reach when it is accompanied by green spaces. More specifically, complete coverage with vegetated areas within a 30 m buffer on both riverbanks can result in a 3.1 degrees C and 3.37 degrees C higher LST deduction compared to no vegetation coverage on the riverbank in the daytime in spring and summer, respectively. The results of this study extend the understanding of the cooling effect of urban blue-green spaces and provide implications for sustainable urban planning.","[Zhou, Wen; Cao, Wei; Wu, Tao] Yangzhou Univ, Coll Hort & Landscape Architecture, Yangzhou 225000, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ting] Polytech Univ Turin, Dept Architecture & Design, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Zhang, Ting] Wuxi Taihu Univ, Wuxi 214064, Peoples R China",Yangzhou University; Polytechnic University of Turin,"Zhou, W (corresponding author), Yangzhou Univ, Coll Hort & Landscape Architecture, Yangzhou 225000, Peoples R China.",wenzhou0305@hotmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [32101577]; Scientific Research Foundation for Advanced Talents, Yangzhou University [137012167]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific Research Foundation for Advanced Talents, Yangzhou University","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Number: 32101577; Representative: Wen Zhou) and Scientific Research Foundation for Advanced Talents, Yangzhou University (Grant Number: 137012167; Representative: Wen Zhou).

With evidence amounting about nature-based solutions, there is a need to translate knowledge about nature-based solutions to future policy and planning. In this paper, we analysed fifteen cases of nature-based solutions' experiments across 11 European cities. What makes our case studies stand out is the balanced focus between ecosystem and social benefits in contrast to many published cases on nature-based solutions that have a weighted focus on the climate benefits. From a cross-case comparative analysis we draw seven overarching lessons related to all stages of proof-of-concept and implementation of nature-based solutions in cities: (a) nature-based solutions need to be aesthetically appealing to citizens, (b) nature-based solutions create new green urban commons, (c) experimenting with nature-based solutions requires trust in the local government and in experimentation process itself, (d) co-creation of nature-based solutions requires diversity and learning from social innovation, (e) nature-based solutions require collaborative governance, (f) an inclusive narrative of mission for nature-based solutions can enable integration to many urban agendas and (g) design nature-based solutions so as to learn and replicate them on the long-term. The lessons we draw show that nature-based solutions require multiple disciplines for their design, diversity (of settings) for co-creation and recognition of the place-based transformative potential of nature-based solutions as 'superior' to grey infrastructure. We further discern that urban planners need to have an open approach to collaborative governance of nature-based solutions that allows learning with and about new appealing designs, perceptions and images of nature from different urban actors, allows forming of new institutions for operating and maintaining nature-based solutions to ensure inclusivity, livability and resilience.","[Frantzeskaki, Niki] Erasmus Univ, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Dutch Res Inst Transit, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Frantzeskaki, N (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Dutch Res Inst Transit, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",n.frantzeskaki@drift.eur.nl,"Frantzeskaki, Niki/AAN-1044-2021","Frantzeskaki, Niki/0000-0002-6983-448X",European Union URBACT Secretariat program III,European Union URBACT Secretariat program III,"We are grateful for all the cities of Resilient Europe project who participated in the four years of the project, the stakeholders in all the transition management arenas and learning webinars as well as the citizens of all 11 cities of Resilient Europe who have been contacted throughout the project to participate, debate and consult the project expert and city project teams.

Use of this tool varies across planning practices and adaptation challenges and adjusting the tool to particular practices can foster its adequate use. To gain insight into the use of adaptation pathways, we compared four initiatives (one each in Portugal and the Czech Republic and two in the Netherlands) with regard to design choices made. We found six design choices which need to be considered when adjusting adaptation pathways. Design choices about the geographic scale, inclusion of sectors, the generation and delineation of adaptation options, specification of possible pathways, the related performance metrics and the type of assessment are interdependent, but they are also influenced by contextual aspects. Analysis.of the institutional diversity, planning cultUre and framing shows that the use of adaptation pathways is flexible enough to be adjusted for diverging planning practices. However, the tool is best suited to deliver local adaptation solutions, and adequate use depends on consensus about the adaptation problem, setting objective thresholds and determining uncertainty about future change. We conclude that understanding the customised use of tools for local planning practices is essential for adaptive policy design.","[Zandvoort, Mark; van der Vlist, Maarten J.; van den Brink, Adri] Wageningen Univ, Landscape Architecture Chair Grp, Environm Sci Dept, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Campos, Ines S.; Vizinho, Andre; Penha-Lopes, Gil] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, CE3C, Campo Grande, Portugal; [Lorencova, Eliska Krkoska] Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, Belidla 986-4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [van der Brugge, Rutger; Jeuken, Ad B.

It combines a real options (e.g., options to defer, expand, contract, abandon, switch use, or otherwise alter a capital investment) approach with principles drawn from robust decision-making (RDM). RDM comprises a class of methods that are used to identify investment strategies that perform relatively well, compared to the alternatives, across a wide range of plausible future scenarios. Our proposed framework relies on a simulation model that includes linkages between climate change and system hydrology, combined with sensitivity analyses that explore how economic outcomes of investments in new dams vary with forecasts of changing runoff and other uncertainties. To demonstrate the framework, we consider the case of new multipurpose dams along the Blue Nile in Ethiopia. We model flexibility in design and operating decisionsthe selection, sizing, and sequencing of new dams, and reservoir operating rules. Results show that there is no single investment plan that performs best across a range of plausible future runoff conditions.

Climate change is causing pluvial flooding, according to the newest IPCC report. This mostly affects urban areas in cities due to: (1) limited capacity of existing drainage systems during heavy-intensity rainfall over a short period of time and (2) limited space for ditches in city areas. Permeable pavements are, therefore, sustainable drainage solutions which combine road infrastructure with water infrastructure. Are permeable pavements a preferable sustainable solution? To answer that question, 24 respondents were interviewed. The interview study was based on a semi-structured interview methodology. A lessons-learned experience was gathered, and the following conclusions were contrived: Firstly, official guidelines on how to construct, consult, and maintain permeable pavements are required. Secondly, more contractors should be able to offer the same product. Finally, official guidelines on the relationship between the contractors are required. These three indicators were extracted from the study.","[Muttuvelu, Dansani Vasanthan; Wyke, Simon; Vollertsen, Jes] Aalborg Univ, Div Civil & Environm Engn, Thomas Manns Vej 23, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark; [Muttuvelu, Dansani Vasanthan] WSP Denmark AS, Dept Traff Rd & Harbours, DK-8260 Viby, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Muttuvelu, DV (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Div Civil & Environm Engn, Thomas Manns Vej 23, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark.;Muttuvelu, DV (corresponding author), WSP Denmark AS, Dept Traff Rd & Harbours, DK-8260 Viby, Denmark.",dvm@build.aau.dk,"Wyke, Simon/HHM-5051-2022","Vollertsen, Jes/0000-0003-0738-0547; Wyke, Simon/0000-0002-3592-7207",Innovation Fund Denmark [1044-00063B]; WSP Denmark A/S,Innovation Fund Denmark; WSP Denmark A/S,"This research was funded by the Innovation Fund Denmark, grant number 1044-00063B, and by WSP Denmark A/S as part of an industrial PhD.",,37,0,0,8,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2022,14,19,,,,,,,12432,10.3390/su141912432,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141912432,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,5G6YC,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000867141100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We apply Robust Decision Making (RDM) to water management planning challenges facing the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District (Valley District) and investigate the performance of a machine learning-based representation of two local groundwater basins. To do so, we assess three machine learning methods-Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)-and their ability to simulate the output of a high-resolution MODFLOW model. We find that RF produces the most accurate results, and thus we incorporate the RF version of the MODFLOW model into the study's RDM approach. This constitutes an advancement to the field of decisionmaking under deep uncertainty (DMDU) through a novel application of machine learning that shortens modeling run times and allows for a greater exploration of the uncertainty space, including a broad range of future climate changes and drought conditions. This paper also constitutes an advancement to the field of empirical groundwater modeling by showing that RF is capable of simulating average basin groundwater level changes. Our results also suggest that demand management can significantly reduce vulnerabilities to drought and other climate changes, and we provide recommendations on additional adaptive management options and key signposts to track for the Valley District.","[Miro, Michelle E.; Groves, David; Syme, James; Tanverakul, Stephanie; Catt, David] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA; [Tincher, Bob] San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water Dist, San Bernardino, CA USA",RAND Corporation,"Miro, ME (corresponding author), RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA.",Michelle_Miro@rand.org,,,San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District,San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District,This research was funded by the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District.,,55,5,5,5,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

High-resolution gridded historical climate (GHC) products enable analysis of recent climatic changes at the local/regional scales most relevant for research and decision-making, but these fine-scale climate datasets have several caveats. We analyzed two 4 km GHC products to produce high-resolution temperature trend maps for the US Northeast from 1980 to 2009, and compared outputs between products and with an independent climate record. The two products had similar spatial climatologies for mean temperatures, agreed on temporal variability in regionally averaged trends, and agreed that warming has been greater for minimum versus maximum temperatures. Trend maps were highly heterogeneous, i.e., a patchy landscape of warming, cooling and stability that varied by month, but with local-scale anomalies persistent across months (e.g., cooling 'pockets' within warming zones). In comparing trend maps between GHC products, we found large local-scale disparities at high elevations and along coastlines; and where weather stations were sparse, a single-station disparity in input data resulted in a large zone of trend map disagreement between products. Preliminary cross-validation with an independent climate record indicated substantial and complex errors for both products. Our analysis provided novel landscape-scale insights on climate change in the US Northeast, but raised questions about scale and sources of uncertainty in high-resolution GHC products and differences among the many products available. Given rapid growth in their use, we recommend exercising caution in the analysis and interpretation of high-resolution climate maps.","[Beier, Colin M.] SUNY Syracuse, Dept Forest & Nat Resources Management, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Adirondack Ecol Ctr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Signell, Stephen A.] SUNY, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Adirondack Ecol Ctr, Newcomb, NY USA; [Luttman, Aaron] Clarkson Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Potsdam, NY USA; [DeGaetano, Arthur T.] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, NOAA, NE Reg Climate Ctr, Ithaca, NY USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry; SUNY Maritime College; Clarkson University; Cornell University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Beier, CM (corresponding author), SUNY Syracuse, Dept Forest & Nat Resources Management, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Adirondack Ecol Ctr, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",cbeier@esf.edu,,"Luttman, Aaron/0000-0001-6639-0759","National Aeronautic and Space Administration [NNX09AK16G]; USDA-CSREES; NASA [113033, NNX09AK16G] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",National Aeronautic and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); USDA-CSREES(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"We thank the PRISM group for providing free access to their 4 km products and the University Consortium of Atmospheric Research (UCAR) for providing the Integrated Data Viewer (IDV).

The methods used include field surveys, meteorological measurements, and assessment of the PET (physiological equivalent temperature). In total, 21 locations in Amsterdam (shaded and sunny locations in parks, streets, squares, and near water bodies) were investigated. Measurements show a reduction in PET of 12 to 22 degrees C in spaces shaded by trees and buildings compared to sunlit areas, while water bodies and grass reduce the PET up to 4 degrees C maximum compared to impervious areas. Differences in air temperature between the locations are generally small and it is concluded that shading, water and grass reduce the air temperature by roughly 1 degrees C. The surveys (n=1928) indicate that especially shaded areas are perceived cooler and more comfortable than sunlit locations, whereas urban spaces near water or green spaces (grass) were not perceived as cooler or thermally more comfortable. The results of this study highlight the importance of shading in urban design to reduce heat stress. The paper also discusses the differences between meteorological observations and field surveys for planning and designing cool and comfortable urban spaces. Meteorological measurements provide measurable quantities which are especially useful for setting or meeting target values or guidelines in reducing urban heat in practice.","[Klok, Lisette; Rood, Niek; Kluck, Jeroen; Kleerekoper, Laura] Univ Appl Sci Amsterdam, Weesperzijde 190, NL-1097 DZ Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Klok, L (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci Amsterdam, Weesperzijde 190, NL-1097 DZ Amsterdam, Netherlands.",e.j.klok@hva.nl,,,Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [2014-01-30P],Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This work is part of the research SIA-programme 'Urban climate resilience - Turning climate adaptation into practice' with project number 2014-01-30P, which is (partly) financed by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).

Monitoring and timely detection of relevant changes, and critical transitions or tipping points is crucial to ensure successful and timely implementation and reassessment of the plan. Although efforts have been made to identify signposts to monitor, the question remains how to design a signal monitoring system that detects and anticipates (future) change to support adaptive planning. For example, to support water related infrastructure investments under uncertain climate change. What are good signposts to monitor and how to wisely analyse them to get timely and reliable signals for adaptation? In this paper, we present a framework for designing and using a monitoring plan as part of the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) approach for decision making under uncertainty. We use the following criteria to evaluate signposts and their critical signal values: measurability, timeliness, reliability, convincibility and institutional connectivity.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with locally applied vegetation in the street, i.e. avenue-trees, facade greening, roof greening and all three combined, were performed. The 3D steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations were closed by the realizable k-epsilon turbulence model extended with source and sink terms to represent the effects of vegetation on air flow. By specifying a cooling power term in the energy equation, the transpirational cooling by vegetation was accounted for. The strongest cooling by a single vegetative measure was obtained with the avenue-trees with mean and maximum temperature reductions at pedestrian level of 0.43 degrees C and 1.6 degrees C, respectively. Facade greening resulted in rather small changes with mean and maximum reductions of 0.04 degrees C and 0.3 degrees C, respectively. For roof greening no noticeable reductions inside the canyon were found. In the case of a combination of all vegetative measures, cooling in terms of spatial distribution and intensity overall resembled a linear superposition of those of the vegetative measures solely applied with 0.52 degrees C mean and 2.0 degrees C maximum temperature reduction. Overall, the cooling was restricted to the vicinity of the vegetative measures, i.e. up to a distance of a few meters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The four agro-climatic indices were accumulative temperatures less than T-min (TLB), number of days with temperatures less than T-min (DLB), accumulative temperatures above the T-critical (TAC), and number of days with temperatures above the T-critical (DAC). Chickpea grain yield responded negatively to higher temperatures and decreased precipitation. Spatio-temporal variability of monthly weather variables (precipitation and temperature) particularly in May, June, and July played an important role in crop yield determination in the target area during the study period. It was shown that Maragheh and Mianeh, located in the lower half of the study area, have become more arid than other locations during the last 2 decades. Therefore, any small increase in AI in these two locations during June at flowering, could lead to a considerable increase in crop yield. Further, the spatio-temporal analysis showed that TLB and DLB decreased while TAC and DAC increased over the last 2 decades, which had detrimental effects on chickpea grain yield. The negative impacts of DAC and TAC, however, were much higher than those of TLB and DLB. Overall, the warmer seasons and warmer locations, particularly in the more arid area, had more destructive effects on chickpea yield than colder ones during the study period. The findings of this study can be used to enhance understanding of the climate-crop relationships and can help decision-makers to recognize the areas have hazardous climatic condition for chickpea and to forecast regional yield as well. Finally, this approach could be transferrable to other regions, particularly in the arid and semi-arid regions that are experiencing similar problems, to move towards sustainable development goals.","[Kheiri, Mohammad; Kambouzia, Jafar; Deihimfard, Reza] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Environm Sci Res Inst, Dept Agroecol, Tehran, Iran; [Yaghoubian, Iraj] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Agron, Fac Agr, Tehran, Iran; [Movahhed Moghaddam, Saghi] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Prague, Czech Republic",Shahid Beheshti University; Tarbiat Modares University; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Kambouzia, J (corresponding author), Shahid Beheshti Univ, Environm Sci Res Inst, Dept Agroecol, Tehran, Iran.",J_Kambouzia@sbu.ac.ir,"Kheiri, Mohammad/HCI-7574-2022; Deihimfard, Reza/GZG-2267-2022","Kheiri, Mohammad/0000-0002-9244-0067; Deihimfard, Reza/0000-0001-8251-6315; Movahhed Moghaddam, Saghi/0000-0002-2809-9693; Kambouzia, Jafar/0000-0002-2777-3885",,,,,40,2,2,1,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1735-6814,1735-8043,,INT J PLANT PROD,Int.

Previous studies have examined the theoretical frameworks that have shaped the concept development of resilience. However, little is known about the theoretical approaches adopted by building professionals in their climate change resilience work. A literature review identified climate change resilience across four academic domains: ecology, engineering, disaster risk reduction, and the social sciences. To better understand how resilience is defined in the building sector, we examined eighteen climate change resilience documents developed to provide guidance to building sector professionals in the United States. Our analysis of these documents helps to understand how professionals are framing and possibly incorporating these strategies in their work, though we did not measure the adoption rate of each of the documents. We find that resilience is mostly a discourse on bouncing-back, preserving the status quo, and/or developing emergency responses to major hazards.

This study proposed an adaptive building roof by utilizing the variable transparency char-acteristics of shape-stabilized phase change material. The envelope can regulate solar absorptivity in response to changes in ambient temperature to reduce unexpected heat gain or heat loss. A mathematical model was developed and verified by experiments. On this basis, the impacts of key parameters, including the melting temperature, thickness, extinction coefficient of phase change material, and the reflectivity of reflective film, on the envelope performance were investigated. Finally, the typical daily, seasonal and annual dynamic perfor-mance was compared between the new roof and the common insulation roof in different climate zones. The results show that the optimal melting temperature and thickness of the phase change material are 24 C and 8 mm in Beijing, 24 C and 4 mm in Changsha and Guangzhou, and 21 C and 5 mm in Urumqi. In the four cities, the optimal extinction coefficients of the phase change material in the transparent/opaque state are 10 m(-1) and 250m-1and the optimal reflectivity of reflective film is 0.95. In Beijing, Changsha, Guangzhou, and Urumqi, the cumulative annual loads are 55 kWh/m(2), 42 kWh/m(2), 22 kWh/m(2), and 85 kWh/m(2), respectively. The corre-sponding energy-saving rates are 14.06%, 17.65%, 31.25%, and 9.57%. The new roof has better performance in Cwa and Cfa climate areas. This study provides theoretical guidance for the application and optimization of the new roof in different climatic regions.","[Wang, Pengcheng; Liu, Zhongbing; Zhang, Xiaoyang; Zhang, Hangming; Chen, Xi; Zhang, Ling] Hunan Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China; [Wang, Pengcheng; Liu, Zhongbing; Zhang, Xiaoyang; Zhang, Hangming; Chen, Xi; Zhang, Ling] Hunan Univ, Key Lab Bldg Safety & Energy Efficiency, Minist Educ, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China",Hunan University; Hunan University,"Liu, ZB (corresponding author), Hunan Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China.",zhongbingliu@hnu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [52078198]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [531118010427],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),Acknowledgment The work is sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant NO. 52078198) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant NO. 531118010427) .,,35,0,0,6,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

Here, several indices of the agronomic and physiological quality of 'Orah' mandarin fruit during three consecutive years were studied along with the metabolic traits under different climatic conditions. The average yield was high in the dry-hot valleys. However, the yield and yield efficiency were the lowest in areas with humid-sparse sunlight. The fruit in the dry-hot valleys and south subtropical regions were large and had seed number beyond 15.38, while the fruit in areas with humid-sparse sunlight were reddish and had few seeds. A statistical analysis of the total soluble solids (TSS) within three years showed that the fruit with highest amounts were in the mid subtropical regions (> 14.03%), followed by the dry-hot valleys. The fruit of tropical rainforest areas (titratable acid > 0.67%) were considered to contain the highest percentage of acid. A metabolic analysis showed that the contents of several metabolites, such as malic acid and proline, varied noticeably across different climatic regions. Correlation and factor analyses of the agronomic, physiological and metabolic indices with meteorological parameters revealed that the fruit yield and quality in the dry-hot valleys were superior to those observed in other regions and that temperature, in particular at the degreening and overwintering stages, along with the hours of sunshine significantly resulted in a considerable degree of variation in the indicators of fruit heterogeneity, such as weight, TSS, malic acid and proline.","[He, Yizhong; Li, Wenguang; Zhu, Panpan; Wang, Min; Qiu, Jieya; Ling, Lili; Fu, Xingzheng; Chun, Changpin; Cao, Li; Peng, Liangzhi] Southwest Univ, Citrus Res Inst, Natl Citrus Engn Res Ctr, Chongqing 400712, Peoples R China; [Sun, Haoqian] Southwest Univ, Coll Hort & Forestry, Chongqing 400700, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ruizhi] Southwest Univ, Coll Pharmaceut Sci & Chinese Med, Chongqing 400700, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ping] Guangxi Acad specialty crops, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China",Southwest University - China; Southwest University - China; Southwest University - China,"Peng, LZ (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Citrus Res Inst, Natl Citrus Engn Res Ctr, Chongqing 400712, Peoples R China.",pengliangzhi@cric.cn,,"Wang, Min/0000-0002-4425-8391","National Natural Science Foun-dation of China [31902084, 32172510]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2020YFD1000102, 2017YFD0202006]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [SWU119072, XDJK2019C054]; China Agriculture Research System of MOFand MARA","National Natural Science Foun-dation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); China Agriculture Research System of MOFand MARA(Ministry of Oceans & Fisheries (MOF), Republic of Korea)","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foun-dation of China (Grant no. 31902084 and 32172510) , the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant no. 2020YFD1000102 and 2017YFD0202006) , the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (Grant no.

However, incorporating expanded adaption measures in conventional planning practices remains a major challenge due to institutional barriers. Based on the theories of historical institutionalism in relation to path divergence, this paper aims to understand the factors which determine the fate of innovations and departures from established practice. Using Guangzhou as a case study, the paper traces the history of the city's struggle against flooding from the 1920s onwards, building on documentary analysis, mapping and interviews. The findings highlight a deeply rooted attachment to engineering-based solutions to tackle flood risk. It also indicates that departing from an established path to embed nature-based and non-structural solutions in the planning system is more likely to take place in response to changing socioeconomic needs and strong institutional support for changes, rather than in response to major flooding events. These findings provide lessons for policymakers and urban planners seeking to enact new policies to enhance flood resilience in spatial planning.","[Meng, Meng] South China Univ Technol, Fac Architecture, Dept Urban Planning, Wushan Rd 381, Guangzhou 510641, Peoples R China; [Meng, Meng] State Key Lab Subtrop Bldg Sci, Wushan Rd 381, Guangzhou 510641, Peoples R China; [Dabrowski, Marcin; Stead, Dominic] Delft Univ Technol TU Delft, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Dept Urbanism, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands; [Xiong, Liang] China Agr Univ, Coll Hort, Dept Landscape Architecture, Yuanmingyuan West Rd 2, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Stead, Dominic] Aalto Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Built Environm Spatial Planning & Transporta, Otakaari 4, Espoo 02150, Alto, Finland",South China University of Technology; China Agricultural University; Aalto University,"Meng, M (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Fac Architecture, Dept Urban Planning, Wushan Rd 381, Guangzhou 510641, Peoples R China.;Meng, M (corresponding author), State Key Lab Subtrop Bldg Sci, Wushan Rd 381, Guangzhou 510641, Peoples R China.",mmeng@scut.edu.cn; m.m.dabrowski@tudelft.nl; xiongliang@cau.edu.cn; dominic.stead@aalto.fi,"Stead, Dominic/O-8029-2014","Stead, Dominic/0000-0002-8198-785X; Xiong, Liang/0000-0002-7894-543X",National Outstanding Youth Science Fund Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [52108050]; State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Building Science at South China University of Technology [2022ZB08]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2021M701238],National Outstanding Youth Science Fund Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Building Science at South China University of Technology; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"The first author is co-funded by the National Outstanding Youth Science Fund Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52108050), the State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Building Science at South China University of Technology (2022ZB08), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2021M701238).",,64,4,4,11,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-2751,1873-6084,,CITIES,Cities,JUL,2022,126,,,,,,,,103702,10.1016/j.cities.2022.103702,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2022.103702,,MAY 2022,16,Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Urban Studies,1X6AV,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000807535700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presents a numerical analysis to evaluate the potential of a disruptive system, which is designed to solve the main drawbacks and to convert phase change materials (PCM) passive heating technology into a competitive solution for the building sector. The novel technology moves PCM layer with respect to the insulation layer inside the building component to maximize solar benefits in winter and be able to actively provide space heating. Design variables such as PCM melting point and control schemes were optimized. The results demonstrated that this technology is not only able to limit heat losses towards outdoors but it can provide space heating from stored solar energy when required. The promising numerical results endorse the possibility to build a future experimental prototype to quantify more in detail the benefits of this system.","[de Gracia, Alvaro] Univ Lleida, GREiA Res Grp, INSPIRES Res Ctr, Pere de Cabrera S-N, Lleida 25001, Spain",Universitat de Lleida,"de Gracia, A (corresponding author), Univ Lleida, GREiA Res Grp, INSPIRES Res Ctr, Pere de Cabrera S-N, Lleida 25001, Spain.",,"de Gracia, Alvaro/AAF-3152-2019; de Gracia, Alvaro/R-6199-2018","de Gracia, Alvaro/0000-0002-8208-5487","Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades de Espana [RTI2018-093849-B-C31]; Catalan Government [2017 SGR 1537]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [712949]; Agency for Business Competitiveness of the Government of Catalonia","Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades de Espana(Spanish Government); Catalan Government; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Agency for Business Competitiveness of the Government of Catalonia","This work was partially funded by the Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades de Espana (RTI2018-093849-B-C31).

Drawing on four cases from South and Southeast Asia, we show how megacities' search for additional water supplies or sites to store floodwater repeatedly disadvantage the most vulnerable groups in rural and urban areas. Rather than rehashing urban-rural conflicts, we argue these outcomes demonstrate the continuous reproduction of water insecurity for a class of society that is dispossessed of water and rural livelihoods, excluded from water and land access within the cities they migrate to, and evicted from flood-securitized cities back to the periphery. Water-related injustices confronting the urban poor mirror injustices along the entire water governance spectrum that begins and ends in rural areas. These shared vulnerabilities suggest opportunities for solidarity across urban-rural divides and novel directions for research and coalition building.

These include changes in land use, beginning in the Early Middle Ages, as well as melioration intensifying in the last century. As a result, groundwater recharge and groundwater levels have dropped, compared to the potential natural conditions. In the coming decades, climatic changes will possibly lead to a further reduction in groundwater recharge. A groundwater flow model for the entire Western Pomerania region was established to quantify the current anthropogenic influences and to investigate which climate-related changes can be expected in the future. To prevent future water supply problems and to avoid harm to groundwater-dependent ecosystems, the effectiveness of possible measures to stabilize the groundwater balance were examined. It was shown that a combination of adaptation measures can lead to a significant reduction of the climate-related drawdown of the groundwater tables.","[Hennig, Heiko] Umweltplan GmbH Stralsund, Triebseer Damm 2, D-18437 Stralsund, Germany; [Hilgert, Toralf] HydroGeol Nord Part GmbB, Hagenower Str 73, D-19061 Schwerin, Germany",,"Hennig, H (corresponding author), Umweltplan GmbH Stralsund, Triebseer Damm 2, D-18437 Stralsund, Germany.",hh@umweltplan.de; t.hilgert@h-g-nord.de,,,,,,,32,3,3,1,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1430-483X,1432-1165,,GRUNDWASSER,Grundwasser,MAR,2021,26,1,,,SI,,3,16,,10.1007/s00767-020-00464-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00767-020-00464-w,,JAN 2021,14,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,QR4DF,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000604836500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We show how the Deliberation with Analysis model of public participation, supported by visualizations and followed by post-participant surveys to measure its impact on barriers to adaptive capacity, can be used effectively to overcome barriers to adaptive capacity identified in the literature, specifically in understudied non-agricultural-based, rural, coastal communities in the United States. This study contributes to academic debates on adaptation and rurality by displaying the utility of a method that overcomes these key barriers to adaptive capacity noted in past research, specifically a lack of public awareness, a lack of or difficulty understanding climate information, a lack of leadership, and limited coordination and competing priorities.","[Arnold, Joel L.; Cangelosi, Elena; Beyea, Wayne R.; Shaaban, Amal] Michigan State Univ, Sch Planning Design & Construct, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kim, Suk-Kyung] Yonsei Univ, Interior Architecture & Built Environm, Seoul, South Korea",Michigan State University; Yonsei University,"Arnold, JL (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Sch Planning Design & Construct, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",arnold70@msu.edu; cangelo3@msu.edu; beyea@msu.edu; shaabana@msu.edu; kimskyu@yonsei.ac.kr,,"Cangelosi, Elena/0000-0002-5690-4370; Arnold, Joel/0000-0001-5573-785X",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [EH001124],Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA),This work was supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [cooperative agreement number EH001124].

Intended for policy analysis, it follows a robust decision making (RDM) philosophy of identifying policies that lead to positive outcomes across a wide range of external changes. While the model can benefit from further development, it illustrates the importance for SIDS of incorporating climate change into national planning. Even without climate change, normal variation in export and tourism demand drive divergent trajectories for the economy and external debt.

To cope with these growth dynamics, city authorities are urged to consider alternative planning strategies aiming at mitigating the negative implications of urbanization. In this context, the present contribution investigates the potential of urban densification to mitigate the heat island effects and to improve outdoor thermal conditions. Focusing on a quite densely urbanized district in Vienna, Austria, we carried out a set of simulations of urban microclimate for pre- and post-densification scenarios using the parametric modelling environment Rhinoceros 3D and a set of built-in algorithms in the Rhino's plug-in Grasshopper. The study was conducted for a hot summer period. The results revealed a notable solar shielding effect of newly introduced vertical extensions of existing buildings, promoting temperature decrease and improved thermal conditions within more shaded urban canyons and courtyards. However, a slight warming effect was noted during the night-time due to the higher thermal storage and lower sky view factor.","[Vuckovic, Milena; Loibl, Wolfgang; Toetzer, Tanja; Stollnberger, Romana] AIT Austrian Inst Technol GmbH, Giefinggasse 4, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT),"Vuckovic, M (corresponding author), AIT Austrian Inst Technol GmbH, Giefinggasse 4, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",milena.vuckovic@ait.ac.at,"Vuckovic, Milena/AAY-9184-2020","Vuckovic, Milena/0000-0002-5825-8237; Totzer, Tanja/0000-0001-6140-0655",Austrian Climate Research Program (ACRP),Austrian Climate Research Program (ACRP),"This research was funded within the framework of the Austrian Climate Research Program (ACRP), which provides grant fnds for climate impact research.",,15,8,8,6,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3298,,ENVIRONMENTS,Environments,JUL,2019,6,7,,,,,,,82,10.3390/environments6070082,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/environments6070082,,,12,Environmental Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,IN6AL,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000478758200007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we use the Warming Acidification and Sea Level Projector Earth systems model to calculate large ensembles of global sea-level rise (SLR) and ocean pH projections to 2300 for 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C stabilization scenarios, and a reference unmitigated RCP8.5 scenario. The potential consequences of these projections are then considered for global coastal flooding, small islands, deltas, coastal cities and coastal ecology. Under both stabilization scenarios, global mean ocean pH (and temperature) stabilize within a century. This implies significant ecosystem impacts are mm avoided, but detailed quantification is lacking, reflecting scientific uncertainty. By contrast, SLR is only slowed and continues to 2300 (and beyond). Hence, while coastal impacts due to SLR are reduced significantly by climate stabilization, especially after 21(X), potential impacts continue to grow for centuries. SLR in 2300 under both stabilization scenarios exceeds unmitigated SLR in 2100. Therefore, adaptation remains essential in densely populated and economically important coastal areas under climate stabilization. Given the multiple adaptation steps that this will require, an adaptation pathways approach has merits for coastal areas.

Common applications of long-term climate information are shown to relate to urban planning and infrastructure, as well as flood and coastal management. Analysis of the identified literature highlights five categories of constraints: disconnection between users and producers of climate information, limitations of climate information, financial and technical constraints, political economy and institutional constraints and finally psycho-social constraints. Five categories of enablers to the uptake of long-term climate information in decision-making are also identified: collaboration and bridge work, increased accessibility of climate information, improvement in the underlying science, institutional reform and windows of opportunity for building trust.Policy relevanceOur review suggests that stand-alone interventions aimed at promoting the uptake of climate information into decision-making are unlikely to succeed without genuine and sustained relationships between producers and users. We also highlight that not every decision requires consideration of long-term climate information for successful outcomes to be achieved. This is particularly the case in the context of developing countries, where the immediacy of development challenges means that decision makers often prioritize short-term interventions. Care should therefore be taken to ensure that information is targeted towards investments and planning decisions that are relevant to longer-term timescales.","[Jones, Lindsey] ODI, Climate & Environm Programme, Blackfriars Rd, London, England; [Champalle, Clara] Okapi Environm Consulting Inc, Climate Change Adaptat Programme, Ave Mt Royal Est, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Chesterman, Sabrina] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Populat Hlth, Keppel St, London, England; [Cramer, Laura] CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Old Naivasha Rd, Nairobi, Kenya; [Crane, Todd A.] ILRI, Old Naivasha Rd, Nairobi, Kenya",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; CGIAR; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Jones, L (corresponding author), ODI, Climate & Environm Programme, Blackfriars Rd, London, England.",l.jones@odi.org.uk,"Cramer, Laura/R-6499-2019","Cramer, Laura/0000-0003-1559-3497","Department for International Development, UK","Department for International Development, UK","This work was partially supported by the Department for International Development, UK.",,60,34,34,0,26,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

The nature and extent of climatic aberrations, perceived impact, and adaptation strategies by the farmers reduce the adverse effects of climate change on agriculture. Therefore, a study was conducted to investigate 2160 IFS farmers about their perceptions of climate change, barriers, and the likelihood of adapting to the negative impacts of climate change. The study observed an increasing rainfall trend for humid (4.18 mm/year) and semi-arid (0.35 mm/year) regions, while a decreasing trend was observed in sub-humid (-2.02 mm/year) and arid (-0.20 mm/year) regions over the last 38 years. The annual rise in temperature trends observed in different ACZs varied between 0.011-0.014 degrees C. Nearly 79% of IFS farmers perceived an increase in temperature, decreasing rainfall, variability in the onset of monsoon, heavy terminal rains, mid-season dry spells, and frequent floods due to climate change. The arid, semi-arid, sub-humid, and humid farmers' adapted several measures in different components with an adaption index of 50.2%, 66.6%, 83.3%, and 91.6%, respectively. The majority of the IFS farmers perceived constraints in adopting measures to climate change, such as meta barriers, capacity barriers, and water barriers. Therefore, we infer that educated farmers involved in diversified and profitable farms with small to medium landholdings are concerned more about climate change in undertaking adaptive strategies to reduce the environmental impact of climate change.","[Paramesh, Venkatesh; Kumar, Parveen; Arunachalam, Vadivel; Mayekar, Trivesh; Rajkumar, Racharla Solomon; Manohara, Kallakeri Kannappa] ICAR Cent Coastal Agr Res Inst, Old Goa 403402, Goa, India; [Shamim, Mohammad; Ravisankar, Natesan; Singh, Raghuveer; Prusty, Ashisa K.; Panwar, Azad Singh; Kashyap, Poonam] ICAR Indian Inst Farming Syst Res, Meerut 250110, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Nath, Arun Jyoti] Assam Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Silchar 788011, Assam, India; [Reddy, Viswanatha K.] ICAR Cent Tobacco Res Inst, Rajahmundry 533105, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Pramanik, Malay] Asian Inst Technol, Dept Dev & Sustainabil, Urban Innovat & Sustainabil, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand; [Das, Anup] ICAR Res Complex, Tripura Ctr, Agartala 799210, Tripura, India; [Babu, Subhash] ICAR Indian Agr Res Inst, New Delhi 110012, India",Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Institute of Farming Systems Research; Assam University; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Central Tobacco Research Institute; Asian Institute of Technology; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Agricultural Research Institute,"Kumar, P (corresponding author), ICAR Cent Coastal Agr Res Inst, Old Goa 403402, Goa, India.;Ravisankar, N (corresponding author), ICAR Indian Inst Farming Syst Res, Meerut 250110, Uttar Pradesh, India.",parveen.kumar@icar.gov.in; n.ravisankar@icar.gov.in,"Paramesha, Venkatesh/AAL-6343-2020","Paramesha, Venkatesh/0000-0003-4759-5139; Babu, Subhash/0000-0003-4469-0157; N, Ravisankar/0000-0002-0166-7558; Pramanik, Malay/0000-0002-7085-1236; Reddy K, Viswanatha/0000-0002-2770-7722; Nath, Arun Jyoti/0000-0002-6453-5595; Arunachalam, Vadivel/0000-0001-5728-1526; Kumar, Parveen/0000-0001-9352-8303","Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi, India; ICAR-Indian Institute of Farming System Research, Modipuram, India; ICAR-Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute, Goa, India","Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi, India(Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)); ICAR-Indian Institute of Farming System Research, Modipuram, India; ICAR-Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute, Goa, India","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi, India, ICAR-Indian Institute of Farming System Research, Modipuram, India, and ICAR-Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute, Goa, India, for research activities.",,87,0,0,15,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2022,14,18,,,,,,,11629,10.3390/su141811629,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141811629,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,4R3OB,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000856676400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, biological adaptation solutions are complex, multi-functional and highly responsive. This paper proposes a biomimetic research of the relationship that can be developed between Biology and Architecture in order to propose innovative fa cade design solutions. We focus on plants, because of plants, like buildings, lack of movement and remain subject to a specific location. Nevertheless, plants have adapted to the environment developing special means of interaction with changing external issues. This paper provides a methodology to create a data collection of plant adaptations and a design mapping to guide the transfer from biological principles to architectural resources, as well as two design concept cases, opening new perspectives for new possible technical solutions and showing the potential of plant adaptations to environmental conditions at a specific climate. Further step is the transformation of some design concepts into technical solutions through experiments with new technologies that include multi-material 3D printing or advances in material science.

However, some researchers argue that the future of cities is far from assured. Cities are not only responsible for 70% or more of the world's CO2 emissions, but because of their dense concentration of physical assets and populations, are also more vulnerable than other areas to climate change. This paper attempts to resolve this controversy by first looking at how cities would fare in a world with average global surface temperatures 4 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. It then looks at possible responses, either by mitigation or adaptation, to the threat such increases would entail. Regardless of the mix of adaptation and mitigation cities adopt in response to climate change, the paper argues that peak urbanism will occur over the next few decades. This fall in the urban share of global population will be driven by the rise in biophysical hazards in cities if the response is mainly adaptation, and by the declining attraction of cities (and possibly the rising attraction of rural areas) if serious mitigation is implemented.

Seeds from 21 open-pollinated mother trees in a southern (Tuusula, 60 degrees N) and a northern (Kittila,67 degrees N) Finnish stand were germinated and grown for 4 weeks in a 24-h photoperiod in a greenhouse and then moved to different night length treatments at 18 degrees C for 4 to 6 weeks. Night lengths from 5 to 8.5 It were used for southern origin seedlings and from 1 to 4.5 h for northern origin seedlings. At the end of the treatments, apical bud set was observed and the percentage of seedlings with bud set calculated for each treatment and tree progeny. The critical night lengths (CNC) for 50% bud set were determined separately for seedlings from each mother tree by regression analysis. In both ecotypes, the mean percentage of seedlings with bud set was lowest for the shortest night lengths and increased rapidly as night lengths increased. Mean CNL with its 95% confidence interval for the southern and northern ecotypes was 6.3 +/- 0.2 and 3.1 +/- 0.3 h, respectively. The CNL of the two ecotypes differed significantly in three experiments. Within-ecotype variance of the CNL was significantly higher in the northern ecotype (0.484) than in the southern ecotype (0.150). Significant differences in CNL were detected between individual mother trees of the southern ecotype, but not between mother trees of the northern ecotype.

To analyze the impact of such extreme heatwaves on urban areas, urban climate models are a valuable tool. This study examines the perfor-mance of the urban climate model MUKLIMO_3 in modelling spatial air temperature patterns in the greater urban area of Bern, Switzerland, a city in complex topography, during three distinct extreme heatwaves in 2018 and 2019 over a total of 23 days. The model is validated using low-cost air temperature data from 79 (2018) and 84 (2019) measurement sites. The intercomparison of the three extreme heatwaves shows that during the first extreme heatwave 2019 at lower elevation regions in the outskirts of the city, modelled air temperature was higher than observation, which was likely due to pronounced mesoscale cold air advection. During calm and dry days, the air temperature distribution was modelled realistically over all three extreme heatwaves investigated. During daytime, modelled air temperatures were lower across all evaluation sites and all extreme heatwaves when compared to the measured values, with highest median air temperature differences of-3.7 K to-4.8 K found in the late afternoon. At night, MUKLIMO_3 generally shows a slowed cooling, so that higher air tem-peratures were modelled when compared to measured values, with median air temperature biases of +1.5 K to +2.8 K at midnight. By sunrise, the model biases continuously decreased, so that the lowest air temperatures at 7 a.m. were modelled with a bias of +0.2 K to +0.7 K. Peak biases exceed 7 K both during day and night. In sum, our results show that MUKLIMO_3 allows to realistically model the urban air temperature distributions during the peaks of the heatwaves investigated with the highest day and night air temperatures, which may assist in the development of heat mitigation measures to reduce the impacts of heat extremes and improve public health in cities with complex topography.","[Huerzeler, Andre; Burger, Moritz; Gubler, Moritz; Broennimann, Stefan] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Hsch Str 4, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Huerzeler, Andre; Burger, Moritz; Gubler, Moritz; Broennimann, Stefan] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Hallerstr 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Hollosi, Brigitta] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Geog & Reg Sci, Heinrichstr 36, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Hollosi, Brigitta] Zentralanstalt Meteorol & Geodynam, Hohe Warte 38, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Gubler, Moritz] Inst Lower Secondary Educ, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern; University of Bern; University of Graz,"Bronnimann, S (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Hallerstr 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",stefan.broennimann@giub.unibe.ch,,"Burger, Moritz/0000-0002-9085-8101",,,,,51,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2590-2520,,,CITY ENVIRON INTERAC,City Environ.

Different socioeconomic and racial groups often face unequal exposure to heat as well as increased heat-related sickness, mortality, and energy costs. We provide new insight into thermal inequities by analyzing 20 Southwestern U.S. metropolitan regions at the census block group scale for three temperature scenarios (average summer heat, extreme summer heat, and average summer nighttime heat). We first compared average temperatures for top and bottom decile block groups according to demographic variables. Then we used spatial regression models to investigate the extent to which exposure to heat (measured by land surface temperature) varies according to income and race. Large thermal inequities exist within all the regions studied. On average, the poorest 10% of neighborhoods in an urban region were 2.2 degrees C (4 degrees F) hotter than the wealthiest 10% on both extreme heat days and average summer days. The difference was as high as 3.3-3.7 degrees C (6-7 degrees F) in California metro areas such as Palm Springs and the Inland Empire. A similar pattern held for Latinx neighborhoods. Temperature disparities at night were much smaller (usually similar to 1 degrees F). Disparities for Black neighborhoods were also lower, perhaps because Black populations are small in most of these cities. California urban regions show stronger thermal disparities than those in other Southwestern states, perhaps because inexpensive water has led to more extensive vegetation in affluent neighborhoods. Our findings provide new details about urban thermal inequities and reinforce the need for programs to reduce the disproportionate heat experienced by disadvantaged communities.","[Dialesandro, John; Brazil, Noli; Wheeler, Stephen] Univ Calif Davis, Geog Grad Grp, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Abunnasr, Yaser] Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Landscape Design & Ecosyst Management, Bliss St,POB 11-0236, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon",University of California System; University of California Davis; American University of Beirut,"Dialesandro, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Geog Grad Grp, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jdiales@ucdavis.edu; nbrazil@ucdavis.edu; smwheeler@ucdavis.edu; ya20plus@gmail.com,,"Abunnasr, Yaser/0000-0003-2997-7176; Wheeler, Stephen/0000-0002-5293-3254",,,,,43,22,22,9,26,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Hence, studying the impact of climate change on the efficiency of agricultural production has become crucial in helping major agricultural regions around the world adopt novel technologies to improve the adaptability of agricultural production. The efficiency of agricultural production can also be improved, and global food safety can be ensured at the same time. This paper used data collected from 43 countries around the world from 1992 to 2018. The data envelopment analysis-Malmquist model was used to estimate agricultural productivity with and without the presence of climate factors, and data comparison and analysis were performed among years and regions. The results show that climate factors can overestimate agricultural productivity. On the whole, climate factors have a positive impact on agricultural production in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and a negative impact in other areas. In addition, the impact of climate change on technical progress is greater than the impact on technical efficiency. According to the results, this paper finds that relevant departments should pay attention to the development of agricultural technology under climate change and should carry out suitable management based on geographical location and climate conditions. In summary, the research methods and results of this article provide a reference for the progress of agricultural production under global climate change.","[Guo, Hongpeng; Xia, Yujie; Pan, Chulin] Jilin Univ, Coll Biol & Agr Engn, Jilin, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Jin, Jingshu] Jilin Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Adm, Jilin, Jilin, Peoples R China",Jilin University; Jilin University of Finance & Economics,"Pan, CL (corresponding author), Jilin Univ, Coll Biol & Agr Engn, Jilin, Jilin, Peoples R China.",pancl@jlu.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [11BJY060],National Social Science Foundation of China,This research was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (11BJY060).,,77,2,2,16,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0195-9255,1873-6432,,ENVIRON IMPACT ASSES,Environ.

Despite this, physical climate risk has only sparsely been covered in previous research, particularly in the setting of investing. Investors' tools for managing physical risk are in general rudimentary and many rely on sustainability labels.

Physical climate risk was evaluated by quantitative modelling, incorporating first level of upstream supply chain. The results show a lower physical risk for all three groups of sustainable funds in a five- and ten-year horizon. It cannot be concluded whether the lower risk is a result of consideration in sustainability labelling, or if lower physical risk is correlated with other sustainability qualities. Further research on physical climate risk for investors is needed, not least from a quantitative perspective and on risks related to supply chain.","[Wiklund, Sofia] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Econ, Uppsala, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Wiklund, S (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Econ, Uppsala, Sweden.",sofiawiklund.95@gmail.com,,,,,,,61,0,0,4,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2043-0795,2043-0809,,J SUSTAIN FINANC INV,J.

In short, there is a non-monotonic relationship between social capital and disaster resilience: but what are the reasons for this? We first relate this mixed evidence to the dark side of social capital, including bonding capital that is cemented by ethnic hostility, patronage networks, unresponsive linking capital, and the conservative nature of social capital. We then argue that the scale-dependent, geographic extent, and placed nature of social networks play a critical and oft neglected role in shaping resilience. We turn to discuss the importance of the resources embedded within social networks (financial and human capital), as well as the content of the norms, social memories, and belief systems that are propagated across networks. Network functions - in terms of which goals social networks are directed towards, and the specific resources they bring to bear on them - are then discussed. To conclude we suggest that moving beyond social capital towards a combined focus on the structure, geography and content of social networks offers a promising direction in theorising and analysing resilience.","[MacGillivray, Brian H.] Cardiff Univ, Sustainable Pl Res Inst, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"MacGillivray, BH (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sustainable Pl Res Inst, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",,,"MacGillivray, Brian/0000-0001-9065-4451",NERC [NE/N012240/1]; NERC [NE/N012240/1] Funding Source: UKRI,NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This research was part-funded by NERC grant NE/N012240/1, Resilience to earthquake-induced landslide hazard in China.",,110,39,39,6,41,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

It is unlikely that this approach will be equally successful into the future because the source of conservation will shift from indoor to outdoor use. Outdoor water is climate sensitive, difficult to measure, hard to predict, linked to other components of complex and dynamic urban resource systems, imbued with behavioral and cultural dimensions, and implicated in societal conflicts about climate risk, modern lifestyles, social justice, and future growth. Outdoor water conservation is not a traditional management problem focused on the water sector, assuming a stationary climate, and set aside from public debate. Instead, outdoor water is an adaptation problem, involving complex and uncertain system dynamics, the need for cross-sector coordination, strategies for dealing with climatic uncertainty, and mechanisms for engaging stakeholders with differing goals. This paper makes the case for treating outdoor water as an adaptation problem and offers a six-point strategy for how cities can better prepare their water systems for the uncertainties of climate and societal change.","[Gober, Patricia] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Gober, Patricia; Quay, Ray; Larson, Kelli L.] Arizona State Univ, Decis Ctr Desert City, 126b,21 E 6th St, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Larson, Kelli L.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Gober, P (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.;Gober, P (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Decis Ctr Desert City, 126b,21 E 6th St, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",gober@asu.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-0951366]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1462086, 0951366] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant SES-0951366, Decision Center for a Desert City II: Urban Climate Adaptation.

An adequate evaluation of the resilience of such systems helps to assess food security and the capacity of society to cope with the effects of global warming and the associated increase of climate extremes. Here, we propose and apply a simple indicator of resilience of annual crop production that can be estimated from crop production time series. First, we address the problem of quantifying resilience in a simplified theoretical framework, focusing on annual crops. This results in the proposal of an indicator, measured by the reciprocal of the squared coefficient of variance, which is proportional to the return period of the largest shocks that the crop production system can absorb, and which is consistent with the original ecological definition of resilience. Subsequently, we show the sensitivity of the crop resilience indicator to the level of management of the crop production system, to the frequency of extreme events as well as to simplified socio-economic impacts of the production losses. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of the indicator using historical production data at national and sub-national levels for France. The results show that the value of the resilience indicator steeply increases with crop diversity until six crops are considered, and then levels off. The effect of diversity on production resilience is highest when crops are more diverse (i.e. as reflected in less well correlated production time series). In the case of France, the indicator reaches about 60% of the value that would be expected if all crop production time-series were uncorrelated.","[Zampieri, Matteo; Weissteiner, Christof J.; Grizzetti, Bruna; Toreti, Andrea; van den Berg, Maurits; Dentener, Frank] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Ispra, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Zampieri, M (corresponding author), European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Ispra, Italy.",matteo.zampieri@ec.europa.eu; christof.weissteiner@ec.europa.eu; bruna.grizzetti@ec.europa.eu; andrea.toreti@ec.europa.eu; maurits.vandenberg@ec.europa.eu; frank.dentener@ec.europa.eu,"Kang, Thomas/ABB-1382-2020; Weissteiner, Christof J/G-7470-2012",,MEDGOLD EU-H2020 project [776467],MEDGOLD EU-H2020 project,This work has been supported by the MEDGOLD EU-H2020 project (grant agreement ID: 776467).

Although this type of trophic interaction has been recognised as being important for shaping how vegetation responds to climate, better knowledge about how this process occurs on the landscape scale and over a long time range is necessary. Here, we evaluated the potential roles of herbivores in modulating the response of mountainous Mediterranean vegetation to seasonal and long-term climate oscillations. To understand the relations among climate, plants and animal population, we fitted a Bayesian model to a combination of long-term (1995-2014) climate datasets, satellite greenness maps (NASA Landsat NDVI) and exotic Barbary sheep census data (breeding success and abundance of Ammotragus lervia). We also used the intrinsic mode function and Hilbert spectrum transformations to decompose NDVI time series and to evaluate their periodic oscillations. We found remarkable dissimilarities as to how climate affects the temporal oscillation of vegetation greenness between landscapes both with and without ungulates, albeit their similarities under environmental conditions. Vegetation responses to climate are particularly attenuated in landscapes with ungulates, an effect that depends on ungulate population abundance. In a world where extreme climate events are becoming frequent and intense, our results indicate that ungulates can strongly modulate how grasslands and scrublands respond to climate change. Increasing our knowledge as to how this type of trophic interaction affects vegetation responses to climate variability is of much importance for managing ungulate rewilding strategies.","[Magalhaes Barbosa, Jomar] Estn Biol Donana CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Avda Amer Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain; [Magalhaes Barbosa, Jomar; Pascual-Rico, Roberto; Sanchez-Zapata, Jose A.] Miguel Hernandez Univ, Dept Appl Biol, Alicante 03202, Spain; [Martinez, Sergio Eguia] Mendijob SL, C Rambla 22, Murcia 30120, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Biologica de Donana (EBD); Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche,"Barbosa, JM (corresponding author), Estn Biol Donana CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Avda Amer Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain.;Barbosa, JM (corresponding author), Miguel Hernandez Univ, Dept Appl Biol, Alicante 03202, Spain.",jomarmbarbosa@gmail.com,"Pascual-Rico, Roberto/AAR-5458-2020","Pascual-Rico, Roberto/0000-0002-7340-1230; Barbosa, Jomar Magalhaes/0000-0001-7869-5533","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2015-66966-C2-12-R, RTI2018-099609-B-C21]; Regional Government of Murcia, Spain (CARM); EU/ERDF [CGL2015-66966-C2-12-R, RTI2018-099609-B-C21]","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Regional Government of Murcia, Spain (CARM); EU/ERDF(European Commission)","We are grateful to all the people who participated in the Barbary sheep census.

Still, access to these benefits may display an uneven distribution across the urban fabric, potentially leading to socio-environmental inequalities. Some studies have analyzed the distributional justice implications of street tree spatial patterns, but generally without quantifying the associated ES provision. This research estimated the amount of air purification, runoff mitigation and temperature regulation provided by circa 200,000 street trees in Barcelona, Spain, using the i-Tree Eco tool. Results were aggregated at neighborhood (n = 73) and census tract (n = 1068) levels to detect associations with the distribution of five demographic variables indicating social vulnerability, namely: income, residents from the Global South, residents with low educational attainment, elderly residents, and children. Associations were evaluated using bivariate, multivariate and cluster analyses, including a spatial autoregressive model. Unlike previous studies, we found no evidence of a significant and positive association between the distribution of low income or Global South residents and a lower amount of street tree benefits in Barcelona. Rather, higher ES provision by street trees was associated with certain types of vulnerable populations, especially elderly citizens. Our results also suggest that street trees can play an important redistributive role in relation to the local provision of regulating ES due to the generally uneven and patchy distribution of other urban green infrastructure components such as urban forests, parks or gardens in compact cities such as Barcelona. In the light of these findings, we contend that just green infrastructure planning should carefully consider the distributive implications associated with street tree benefits.","[Baro, Francesc; Calderon-Argelich, Amalia; Langemeyer, Johannes; Connolly, James J.

Maintaining low stand density has the potential to mitigate the negative effects of increasingly severe droughts by minimizing competitive intensity. However, the direct impact of stand density on the growing environment (i.e. soil moisture), and the specific drought metrics that best quantify that environment, are not well explored for any forest ecosystem. We examined the relationship of varying stand density (i.e. basal area) on soil moisture and stand-level growth in a long-term (multi-decadal), ponderosa pine Pinus ponderosa, forest management experiment. We accounted for the influence of stand-level density on moisture availability by measuring and modelling soil moisture using an ecosystem water balance model. To quantify the growing environment, we developed metrics of ecological drought that integrate the influence of moisture availability in the soil with moisture demand by the atmosphere. We paired these results with stand-level dendrochronological data, avoiding the potential bias introduced from individual tree-based assessments, and used critical climate period analysis to identify the timing and duration of these drought metrics that most relate to forest growth. We found that stand-level growth is highly responsive to the combination of high temperature and low soil moisture. Growth in all stands was negatively related to temperature and positively related to moisture availability, although the sensitivity of growth to those conditions varied among stand density treatments. Growth enhancement during cool years is greatest in low density stands. In addition, low density stands displayed substantially higher long-term average growth than higher density stands and maintained higher growth even when temperatures were high. Growth in low density stands also increased more than higher density stands in response to greater long-term moisture availability. Synthesis and applications. We quantified the influence of stand-level density on the environmental conditions that determine tree growth and related forest growth to patterns of moisture supply and demand. Our drought metrics, and analytical approach for quantifying drought impacts on forest growth, are a novel approach for assessing forest vulnerability to drought under climate change. These results provide new perspective on the potential for density management to mitigate drought stress and maintain forest stand growth during and after drought events in water-limited forests.","[Andrews, Caitlin M.; Bradford, John B.] US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [D'Amato, Anthony W.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT USA; [Fraver, Shawn] Univ Maine, Sch Forest Resources, Orono, ME USA; [Palik, Brian] US Forest Serv, USDA, Northern Res Stn, Grand Rapid, MN USA; [Battaglia, Michael A.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Ft Collins, CO USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Vermont; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Andrews, CM (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA.",candrews@usgs.gov,"D'Amato, Anthony/AAV-3245-2021","D'Amato, Anthony/0000-0002-2570-4376; Battaglia, Michael/0000-0002-4260-5804; , Shawn/0000-0003-1614-9072; Andrews, Caitlin/0000-0003-4593-1071",USGS National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center,USGS National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center,USGS National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center,,65,29,29,6,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Bobwhite populations have been declining for several decades across the United States, and predicted global climate change might accelerate the rate of decline. We were interested in whether bobwhite abundance was more responsive to yearly precipitation and temperature, or to annual deviations from long-term mean climate patterns. We used roadside count data collected over a 6 year period (1991-1997) by the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation as a measure of bobwhite abundance. We standardized quail counts among counties by calculating the standard normal deviate for each county. Weather data were obtained from weather stations closest to the roadside-count route. We had 280 training cases and 68 test-validation cases. Two data sets were constructed: one using yearly weather data (actual rainfall and temperature) and the second using annual deviations from long-term mean values. We conducted simulation analyses to determine the nature of the relationship between each dependent variable and the standardized bobwhite counts. A neural network with eight neurons was most efficient for the yearly weather data, accounting for 25% of the variation in the training data. The adjusted sum-of-squares for this model was 2.42. A four-neuron network was selected for the deviation-from-normal data set, accounting for 23% of the variation in the training data. The adjusted sum-of-squares for the deviation model was 1.44, indicating it performed better than the model for yearly weather patterns. Deviation from long-term mean July and August temperatures combined contributed 31.5% to the climate network's predictions, and deviations from mean winter, spring, and summer precipitation combined contributed 42.8% to the network's predictions. As July temperature increased over the long-term mean, the number of bobwhites counted increased over the route mean, but the relationship decelerated at high July temperatures. Predicted increases in bobwhites counted were highest when August temperatures were below the mean and decreased rapidly for all temperatures greater than the mean. Predicted bobwhite counts increased asymptotically as winter rain increased over the long-term mean, but were greatest at mean spring-rainfall amounts and at below average amounts of summer rainfall. We conclude that the absolute changes in yearly weather pattern predicted by some global change models will not have as great an impact on bobwhite abundance as will the magnitude of the deviations of these values from the climate bobwhites are adapted to in this portion of their range.

Each with the odds of a 100-year occurrence suggesting that such extreme events are the region's new normal. City and state policy-makers, in response, are studying how to develop a network of robust, resilient critical infrastructure facilities. These studies, however, typically fail to address interdependencies among critical infrastructures and lack a quantitative tool to investigate the maximum resilience possessed by a given infrastructure facility in the face of climate-change-induced hazards. We propose a multi-stage stochastic mathematical program to maximize network resilience given: i) random arrival of extreme events; ii) the network's inherent capacity to withstand and cope with the aftermath of exogenous shocks; iii) pre-, during-, and post-event strategies available to enhance system operability; and iv) budgeting and technological restrictions facing policy-makers. Our approach allows both qualitative and quantitative paradigms to interact. Our model thus clarifies how to allocate resources proactively and how the network's absorptive, adaptive, and restorative capacities can be coordinated to enhance overall system resilience. Our findings suggest that an integrated planning approach combined with smart allocation of resources across a network's main elements creates a greater degree of resilience while utilizing less costly resilience-enhancing strategies.","[Beheshtian, Arash; Donaghy, Kieran P.] Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, W Sibley Hall,942 Univ Ave, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Beheshtian, Arash] Cornell Univ, Cornell Program Infrastruct Policy, W Sibley Hall,942 Univ Ave, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Geddes, R.

The integration of the NBS concept in urban governance, however, is still emerging and it faces regulatory, political, financial and cognitive barriers. While the literature acknowledges an increase in NBS experimentation in cities and documents new governance approaches for NBS, academic knowledge on transformative learning to advance the potential of NBS is scarce. This article unpacks enabling and constraining factors for transformative learning through interpretative case study analysis of two NBS projects in Malmo, Sweden: BiodiverCity and EcoCity Augustenborg. To map instances of learning and investigate conditions for transformative learning in NBS implementation, this article draws on the concepts of experimenting, governing and learning and uses an analytical framework resting on three pillars: visionary ideas and strategies; stakeholder participation; and institutional arrangements. The article identifies seeds of transformative learning and argues that cross-boundary collaboration, action-oriented knowledge production, reflexive governance and citizen involvement are key enablers for transformative learning, which requires supporting structures, evaluation, continuity and relational capacities to thrive. To advance the implementation of NBS and increase urban sustainability, transformative learning should be acknowledged as a key strategic component of change. This, however, requires transformative learning to be more seriously considered in research and practice related to nature-based urban transformations.","[Wickenberg, Bjorn; Kiss, Bernadett; McCormick, Kes; Palgan, Yuliya Voytenko] Lund Univ, Int Inst Ind Environm Econ IIIEE, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Wickenberg, B (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Int Inst Ind Environm Econ IIIEE, Lund, Sweden.",bjorn.wickenberg@iiiee.lu.se,,,,,,,114,0,0,5,5,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9634,,FRONT SUSTAIN CITIES,Front.

Therefore, two non-air-conditioned museums located in the historical city center of Florence, Italy, are considered as case studies, i.e., Vasari Corridor and La Specola. One year of indoor microclimate data monitored in representative rooms of the museums are analyzed according to the standard for artworks preservation and in terms of historical climate. Results of monitored indoor air temperature and relative humidity show that all monitored rooms are not suitable for the preservation of the exhibits without the installation of an air-conditioning system. However, to minimize the energy consumption, the hygrothermal control can be based on the observed historical climate that characterizes the environments, which presents acceptable preservation ranges much wider that the reference technical standard. In this way, the energy needs for the environmental control necessary to ensure the good conservation of the artworks can be significantly reduced.","[Sciurpi, Fabio; Carletti, Cristina; Cellai, Gianfranco; Piselli, Cristina] Univ Florence, Dept Architecture DIDA, I-50121 Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Sciurpi, F (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Architecture DIDA, I-50121 Florence, Italy.",fabio.sciurpi@unifi.it,,"Piselli, Cristina/0000-0003-1856-3103",Italian funding programme Fondo Sociale Europeo REACT EU-Programma Operativo Nazionale Ricerca e Innovazione European Social Fund REACT EU-National Operational Program for Research and Innovation) [1062],Italian funding programme Fondo Sociale Europeo REACT EU-Programma Operativo Nazionale Ricerca e Innovazione European Social Fund REACT EU-National Operational Program for Research and Innovation),"The authors acknowledge Eike Schmidt and Giuseppe Russo of Gallerie degli Uffizi for their collaboration and availability.

In particular, land use adjustment is closely related to climate change for a coastal megacity. Coastal wetlands on the edge of the megacity represent a vulnerable ecosystem and a key area in terms of the resilient adaptation strategy. However, the interrelationship between the development of these wetlands and the megacity's adaptation practice has not been sufficiently analyzed. From a historical perspective, based on document synthesis and field investigation, we attempt in this study to reveal long-term land use stages and driving factors in association with urban marginal wetlands, with a special reference to eastern Chongming Island, Shanghai. On such a basis, the future adaptation strategy of the megacity is evaluated. The analytical results show that this island has witnessed three periods of time for wetland utilization: traditional land use for salt production, fishery and agriculture before 1950, industrialization with rapid reclamation during 1950-2001, and the land use pattern orientated toward wetland ecosystem protection after 2002. The driving forces include sediment budget on the coast, wetland morphodynamic processes, sea level rise, population growth, and resource management policy changes. Transformation occurred between the wetland utilization stages in response to the changes of these forces. Furthermore, facing future climate change, there are different options of adaptation, e.g., retreatment and adherence. It may not be suitable for coastal cities with a large population to take the first option. It will be suitable for coastal communities to adhere to the location, if solutions to the problems of flooding risk, coastal erosion, and the maintenance of coastal facilities can be found. For eastern Chongming wetlands, as a key experimental area for ecosystem-oriented development in Shanghai, the transformation from the reclamation-oriented utilization toward the protection of wetland ecosystems represents the first step toward the latter option. We suggest that the next steps would be to maintain the ecological niche of the wetlands, to create new approaches to coastal engineering with contributions from the ecosystem, and to provide better ecosystem services.","[Bao, Junlin] Fudan Univ, Inst Chinese Hist Geog, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Bao, Junlin] Fudan Univ, Ctr Hist Geog Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Gao, Shu] East China Normal Univ, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Gao, Shu] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Oceanog Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Fudan University; East China Normal University; Nanjing University,"Bao, JL (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Inst Chinese Hist Geog, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Bao, JL (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Ctr Hist Geog Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",baojunlin@fudan.edu.cn,,"Gao, Shu/0000-0001-7850-9753; Bao, Junlin/0000-0001-6839-6329","National Social Science Fund of China, through the project Climate change and traditional adaptation on Jiangsu-Shanghai coasts [18BZS156]; Scientific Research and Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission [2021-01-07-00-07-E00123]","National Social Science Fund of China, through the project Climate change and traditional adaptation on Jiangsu-Shanghai coasts; Scientific Research and Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission","This work was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China, through the project Climate change and traditional adaptation on Jiangsu-Shanghai coasts (Grant Number: 18BZS156), and the Scientific Research and Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission, through the major project of humanities and social science, entitled Study on the differentiation process and development mechanism of climate change adaptation pattern in historical periods in Shanghai City (Grant Number: 2021-01-07-00-07-E00123).",,88,6,6,12,66,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

The increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere contributes to rising global temperatures and ocean acidification, whereas the accumulation of nutrients in water systems is leading to degradation of water quality and biodiversity. City populations play a major role in carbon dioxide and nutrient emissions as 'end consumers' of resources. The current challenge towards more resource-efficient cities is to transform urban metabolism from linear to cyclical. Discharged nutrients and carbon dioxide can be used as input for algae, which fixate carbon very efficiently into energetic storage compounds as starch or lipids. However, cities often lack the space to implement large-scale algae production. This article evaluates the potential of reusing nutrients and carbon dioxide to produce algae, food and biofuel on water nearby coastal and delta cities. First, nutrients and carbon dioxide discharge is estimated and two scenarios are developed. From the cities nutrient production, the potential algal yield is evaluated and translated into feed, food and oil yields. Two delta cities are chosen as case studies: Rotterdam and Metro Manila. The conclusion of this article is that Floating Production can help cities increasing their resilience in the field of food and energy. Floating Production can also contribute to a solution for global land shortage. The combination of food and energy production with floating urban development provides a climate-proof urban expansion in delta and coastal areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Nutrient enrichment and weed invasion are significant limits to restoration in mesic ecosystems, but in a drying climate, limits could shift towards more fundamental ecosystem functions. We used a state and transition framework to identify landuse-related changes in topsoil biophysical characteristics likely to influence climate resilience in mesic temperate eucalypt woodlands. We compared topsoil condition in little-modified 'reference' states of the native ground-layer (dominated by tall tussock grasses) with four degraded ground-layer states identified in our state and transition framework. We hypothesized that 'nutrient-depleted' states (dominated by short tussock grasses) and 'nutrient-enriched' states (dominated by exotic annuals) would exhibit characteristics reflecting increased and decreased ecosystem vulnerability to a drying climate respectively. Our hypothesis that nutrient-depleted states are more vulnerable to a drying climate was supported by their significantly slower soil-water infiltration rates and significantly lower levels of topsoil carbon, clay, micro-invertebrates, microbial activity and modeled water holding capacity than reference states. However, degradation was less pronounced beneath trees, and our prediction regarding enriched states was supported only for carbon. Topsoil biophysical characteristics associated with different ground-layer states are predictable using a state and transition framework. Climate resilience of nutrient-depleted states appears compromised by topsoil biophysical degradation, indicating increasing need for attention in mesic ecosystems predicted to become drier under climate change.","[Prober, Suzanne M.] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci & Sustainable Agr Flagship, Floreat, WA 6913, Australia; [Stol, Jacqui; Piper, Melissa; Cunningham, Saul A.] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci & Sustainable Agr Flagship, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Gupta, V.

The number and intensity of floods are increasing, challenging current governance approaches. Governments worldwide are looking to diversify their flood risk management and adaptation strategies, among others, by increasing resident involvement in flood risk governance. Such involvement of individuals shifts responsibilities from public to private actors. A clear understanding of the extent and implications of this shift is difficult to reach as theoretical perspectives on the concept of responsibility vary. Similarly, grounds for attributing responsibility for flood preparedness and response differ across countries. This lack of analytical and empirical clarity complicates academic and policy discourses on what it actually means to 'be responsible'. The current article systematises these different approaches to responsibility in flood risk governance. To improve current knowledge on residents' responsibilities in flood risk governance, we present a conceptual framework that distinguishes among four theoretical notions of responsibility: legal responsibility, accountability, perceived responsibility, and moral responsibility. These notions are elucidated with the help of examples of flood risk governance practices in the United States, Germany and the Netherlands. We find that the four notions are closely intertwined. In addition, this article documents divergences between what individuals perceive as their own responsibility in flood risk management and the responsibilities that governments assume. We conclude with a discussion on the tensions between perceived responsibilities and the other three notions. Explicit, transparent and open discussion on these tensions is needed to allow attribution of responsibility in flood risk governance and to reconsider residents' roles in particular.","[Snel, Karin A.

However, little is known about how farmers make decisions shaping crop diversity, and how conservation efforts can be aligned with farmers' goals. This study examines how interacting values, rules and knowledge shape decisions of subsistence farmers in central India. Findings suggest that farmers' values play a central role in shaping crop diversity. Their culinary and health preferences for consuming various self-cultivated crops primarily drive portfolio decisions. Farmers are hesitant to invest in commercial agricultural because of unreliable returns. Furthermore, they prefer to control water availability and land quality as means of coping with environmental change, rather than resorting to crop diversification. Finally, a rich understanding of local crop diversity dynamics questions the ethics of expecting marginal farmers to shoulder the burden of conservation for global gain, suggesting ex-situ strategies are appropriate where in-situ practices are not autonomously selected. Overall, the analysis demonstrates the importance of understanding farmer-level decision-making for wider crop diversity conservation debates.","[Agrawal, Tanvi; Hirons, Mark] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England; [Agrawal, Tanvi; Gathorne-Hardy, Alfred] Univ Oxford, Somerville Coll, Oxford India Ctr Sustainable Dev, Oxford, England; [Agrawal, Tanvi] Ashoka Trust Res Ecol & Environm, Bengaluru 560064, Karnataka, India; [Gathorne-Hardy, Alfred] Univ Edinburgh, Global Acad Agr & Food Secur, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Gathorne-Hardy, Alfred] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh,"Agrawal, T (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England.",tanvi.agrawal@atree.org; mark.hirons@ouce.ox.ak.uk; a.gathorne-hardy@ed.ac.uk,,,,,,,88,2,2,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2666-0490,,,CURR RES ENVIRON SUS,Curr.

Current numerical simulation and optimization algorithms can guide reservoir-river operations for optimal hydropower production, irrigation, nutrient management, and municipal consumption, yet much less is known about optimization of associated ecosystems. This ten-year study demonstrates an ecosystem assessment approach that links the environmental processes to an ecosystem response in order to evaluate the impact of climatic forcing and reservoir operations on the aquatic ecosystems of a coupled headwater reservoir-river system. The approach uses a series of numerical, statistical, and empirical models to explore reservoir operational flexibility aimed at improving the environmental processes that support aquatic ecosystem function. The results illustrate that understanding the seasonal biogeochemical changes in reservoirs is critical for determining environmental flow releases and the ecological trajectory of both the reservoir and river systems. The coupled models show that reservoir management can improve the ecological function of complex aquatic ecosystems under certain climatic conditions. During dry hydrologic years, the high post-irrigation release can increase the downstream primary and macroinvertebrate production by 99% and 45% respectively. However, this flow release would reduce total fish biomass in the reservoir by 16%, providing management tradeoffs to the different ecosystems. Additionally, low post-irrigation flows during the winter season supports water temperature that can maintain ice cover in the downstream river for improved ecosystem function. The ecosystem assessment approach provides operational flexibility for large infrastructure, supports transparent decision-making by management agencies, and facilitates framing of environmental legislation.","[Tranmer, Andrew W.; Tonina, Daniele] Univ Idaho, Ctr Ecohydraul Res, 322 East Front St,Suite 340, Boise, ID 83702 USA; [Weigel, Dana] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Boise, ID 83702 USA; [Marti, Clelia L.] Curtin Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Sustainable Engn Grp, Perth, WA, Australia; [Marti, Clelia L.] Univ Vermont, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Vidergar, Dmitri] US Bur Reclamat, Boise, ID USA; [Benjankar, Rohan] Southern Illinois Univ Edwardsville, Dept Civil Engn, Edwardsville, IL USA; [Goodwin, Peter] Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Imberger, Jorg] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",Idaho; University of Idaho; Idaho; University of Idaho; Curtin University; University of Vermont; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science; University of Maryland College Park; University of Miami,"Tranmer, AW (corresponding author), Univ Idaho, Ctr Ecohydraul Res, 322 East Front St,Suite 340, Boise, ID 83702 USA.",andyt@uidaho.edu,"Goodwin, Peter/AAP-1649-2021; Tonina, Daniele/I-7688-2012","Tonina, Daniele/0000-0002-1866-1013; Tranmer, Andrew/0000-0003-2975-7405; Benjankar, Rohan/0000-0002-6018-8186",United States Forest Service [08-JV-11221659-036]; National Science Foundation [EPS-0814387]; Center for Ecohydraulics Research; University of Idaho Research Office,United States Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Center for Ecohydraulics Research; University of Idaho Research Office,"This research was partially supported by the United States Forest Service grant 08-JV-11221659-036 and the National Science Foundation award EPS-0814387 Track 1: Water Resources in a Changing Climate from the NSF Idaho EPSCoR Program.

Multiple sediment cores taken from each dam indicated the presence of water in over half of sediment cores from 57% of dams. Although there is individual variation, generally dams in the region were therefore capable of accumulating water. Analysis of Landsat satellite images indicated that this did not translate into an average increase in vegetative greening and moisture indices at dam sites compared to controls sites. Observational data on activities at dams indicated variable levels of water use; only 43% of dams had active water harvesting present, and only 39% of dams had current agricultural activities adjacent to the sand dam site. Cross-sectional comparison of data did not indicate consistently higher levels of water harvesting or agricultural use at dams with more water.

Underwaterwriting suggests that the unevenness of scientific knowledge and local soft information, as well as the institutional barriers for the utilization of that information, could result in determinations of risk that may not accurately reflect long-term asset performance or credit loss. These informational asymmetries may result in assignments of risk that reflect a degree of arbitrariness or inaccuracy that may operate to strand assets and shed or increase market share in ways that are inefficient and may otherwise lead to negative public externalities. Consistent with this theory, this article provides evidence that concentrated local lenders are transferring risk in high-risk coastal geographies in the Southeast Atlantic and Gulf Coasts (U.S.) through increased securitization of mortgages. These findings provide an impetus for supporting more robust analysis of climate-risk in light of forthcoming accounting rules that require an upfront accounting of forward-looking credit losses.","[Keenan, Jesse M.] Tulane Univ, Sch Architecture, Richardson Mem Hall,6823 St Charles Ave, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Bradt, Jacob T.] Harvard Univ, Kennedy Sch Govt, 407 Gund Hall,48 Quincy St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Tulane University; Harvard University,"Keenan, JM (corresponding author), Tulane Univ, Sch Architecture, Richardson Mem Hall,6823 St Charles Ave, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",jkeenan@tulane.edu,,"Keenan, Jesse/0000-0003-4058-1682; Bradt, Jacob/0000-0002-6540-5629",,,,,45,18,18,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

However, we have seen extensive cases of defects involving such systems. This paper presents a comprehensive review of Norwegian experiences regarding the durability of ETICS on walls. The presented results are based on building research conducted by SINTEF 61 as well as 30 accelerated climatic laboratory experiments over the last 25 years on similar facade systems. These systems generally perform satisfactorily if thoroughly designed and carefully erected. However, according to the survey, the systems are not very robust. Even minor errors in design techniques and/or craftsmanship can lead to rendering defects. The investigations clearly show that ETICS is particularly vulnerable when exposed to severe driving rain conditions. ETICS provides only a single-stage protection against wind and precipitation and do not dry effectively after being wetted. Hence, the resultant cracks and other rendering weaknesses could be disastrous, enabling moisture to penetrate into the thermal insulation and the wall behind. In areas with heavy driving rain, we recommend facade solutions erected in accordance with the principle of two-stage tightening rather than ETICS.","[Kvande, Tore; Thue, Jan Vincent] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Bakken, Noralf; Bergheim, Einar] SINTEF Bldg & Infrastruct, POB 4760, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); SINTEF,"Kvande, T (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",tore.kvande@ntnu.no; noralf.bakken@sintef.no; einar.bergheim@sintef.no; jan.thue@ntnu.no,,"Kvande, Tore/0000-0003-0522-9974",Research Council of Norway,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),This research is funded by the Research Council of Norway.,,36,30,30,1,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,JUL,2018,8,7,,,,,,,93,10.3390/buildings8070093,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings8070093,,,17,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,GO7BY,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000440212200012,View Full Record in Web of Science

We develop a framework to analyse how actors construct, maintain, challenge, and reconstruct boundaries in their (inter) actions, and we apply the framework to a case analysis of a multifunctional development. The analysis shows that, although integration seems to suggest only boundary crossing, actors also actively defend and reconstruct boundaries. We reflect on how the process of achieving effective integration is not only about overcoming boundaries but also about reconstructing and respecting joint boundary demarcations.

Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are currently developed and outline Peru's mitigation actions and adaptation plans to climate change in various sectors. To support the implementation of adaptation measures in the agricultural sector, information on weather-related risks for crop production and the effectiveness of adaptation options on the local scale are needed. We assess weather influences on starchy maize yields on different scales in Peru based on statistical crop models and a machine learning algorithm. The models explain 91% of yield variability (55% based on the crossvalidation) on the regional scale. On the local scale, weather-related yield variation can be explained in some areas, but to a lower extent. Based on these models, we assess the effectiveness of adaptation measures which increase water availability to protect against negative impacts from dry weather conditions. The results show that a higher water availability of 77mm in the growing season would have regionally different effects, ranging from an increase of 20% to a decrease of 17% in maize yields. This large range underlines the importance of a local assessment of adaptation options. With this example, we illustrate how a statistical approach can support a risk-informed selection of adaptation measures at the local scale as suggested in Peru's NDC implementation plan.","[Laudien, Rahel; Schauberger, Bernhard; Gleixner, Stephanie; Gornott, Christoph] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Laudien, R (corresponding author), Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",laudien@pik-potsdam.de; schauber@pik-potsdam.de; gleixner@pik-potsdam.de; gornott@pik-potsdam.de,"Gornott, Christoph/ABI-8107-2020","Gornott, Christoph/0000-0003-3933-3358","projects AgRATI - Climate-KIC; project EPICC; Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU)","projects AgRATI - Climate-KIC; project EPICC; Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU)","The research was supported by the projects AgRATI, funded by Climate-KIC, and by the project EPICC.

These supply chains are increasingly exposed to the impacts of a changing climate, yet receive little attention relative to the study of the production phase. Too often, business learns from experience if and how their supply chains can withstand and recover from climate shocks with little insight on proactively developing climate resilient supply chains. We use a network-based simulation approach to estimate the resilience of supply chains, particularly to disruption experienced during climate- related extreme events. We consider supply chain examples from three Australian resource industries - fisheries, agriculture and mining - that have experienced climate shocks in recent years. We derive four supply chain indices - evenness, resilience, continuity of supply and climate resilience - to estimate the performance of simple and complex supply chains in each industry. As with ecological systems, we show that complex supply chains with a large number of nodes and links are more resilient to disruption. Critically, all chains, regardless of their complexity, will have diminished resilience as climate disruptions become more frequent. This highlights the importance of considering the broader economic benefits of diversified chains, leading to risk reduction and improved design post-disruption. It also reinforces the importance of a systems approach to risk management in supply chains, particularly in considering adaptation options for addressing direct and indirect impacts on. the chain as well as the global challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.","[Lim-Camacho, Lilly] CSIRO Land & Water, 1 Technol Court, Pullenvale, Qld 4069, Australia; [Plaganyi, Eva E.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia; [Crimp, Steven; Howden, Stuart Mark] CSIRO Agr & Food, Black Mt, ACT 2601, Australia; [Hodgkinson, Jane H.] CSIRO Energy, Pullenvale, Qld 4069, Australia; [Loechel, Barton] CSIRO Land & Water, Dutton Pk, Qld 4102, Australia; [Hobday, Alistair J.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Crimp, Steven; Howden, Stuart Mark] Australian Natl Univ, Climate Change Inst, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Australian National University,"Lim-Camacho, L (corresponding author), CSIRO Land & Water, 1 Technol Court, Pullenvale, Qld 4069, Australia.",lilly.lim-camacho@csiro.au,"Lim-Camacho, Lilly/A-7502-2015; Hobday, Alistair/A-1460-2012; Plaganyi, Eva E/C-5130-2011; Hodgkinson, Jane/GLT-5216-2022; Crimp, Steven J/D-6995-2011; Loechel, Barton/O-3826-2015","Lim-Camacho, Lilly/0000-0002-4897-1186; Hobday, Alistair/0000-0002-3194-8326; Plaganyi, Eva E/0000-0002-4740-4200; Crimp, Steven J/0000-0003-4068-573X; Hodgkinson, Jane/0000-0002-4031-3883; Loechel, Barton/0000-0001-6441-4892",CSIRO Land and Water,CSIRO Land and Water(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),This work was supported by CSIRO Land and Water.,,78,27,28,9,70,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

The term decision support describes a diverse class of resources designed to help manage this complexity and assist decision makers in understanding impacts and evaluating management options. Most climate-related decision support resources implicitly assume that decision making is primarily limited by the quantity and quality of available information. However, a wide variety of evidence suggests that institutional, political, and communication processes are also integral to organizational decision making. Decision support resources designed to address these processes are underrepresented in existing tools. These persistent biases in the design and delivery of decision support may under-mine efforts to move decision support from research to practice. The development of new approaches to decision support that consider a wider range of relevant issues is limited by the lack of information about the characteristics, context, and alternatives associated with climate-related decisions. We propose a new approach called a decision assessment and decision inventory that will provide systematic information describing the relevant attributes of climate-related decisions. This information can be used to improve the design of decision support resources, as well as to prioritize research and development investments. Application of this approach will help provide more effective decision support based on a balanced foundation of analytical tools, environmental data, and relevant information about decisions and decision makers.

These industries may also increase participation by women as compared to wild -caught fisheries that have been traditionally male-dominated. Here we ask whether transitions to shellfish and seaweed (or non-fed) aquaculture increase gender equity in Maine's fisheries, where the lobster fishery has been dominant for three decades. We find that non-fed aquaculture has increased women's participation by more than four times; 23.1 % of shellfish and seaweed aquaculture license holders are female, compared to 4.8 % of lobster license holders. Women's participation is highest (37.8 %) within the fast-growing, but relatively low-value seaweed aquaculture sector and lowest (17.6 %) in higher-value oyster farming. Women hold half of the Limited Purpose Aquaculture licenses (a subclass of licenses intended to simplify the process of entering into aquaculture) for seaweed, suggesting that they function to increase women's participation. Women in these industries attribute differential female participation in non-fed aquaculture as compared to lobster fisheries to fewer gendered institutional barriers, an ability to achieve more independence in marketing and distribution, and more flexible working hours. Exclusionary institutions are still seen as barriers to success in non-fed aquaculture, but female farmers also report that they have created informal leadership roles focused on com-munity building and social responsibility. Together these results suggest that transitions to non-fed aquaculture have the potential to increase gender equity in this sector of seafood production, but further reducing gendered institutions is key to achieving this outcome.","[McClenachan, Loren] Univ Victoria, Dept Hist, Ocean Hist Lab, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada; [McClenachan, Loren] Univ Victoria, Sch Environm Studies, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada; [Moulton, Allie] Colby Coll Environm Studies Program, Waterville, ME 04901 USA; [McClenachan, Loren] 3800 Finnerty Rd, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada",University of Victoria; University of Victoria,"McClenachan, L (corresponding author), 3800 Finnerty Rd, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada.",lorenm@uvic.ca,,,"Environmental Studies Program, Colby College, Maine USA","Environmental Studies Program, Colby College, Maine USA","We are grateful for funding from Environmental Studies Program, Colby College, Maine USA, Lily Wilson for assistance with interviews with female lobster fishers, and Madeline Brodrick for assistance with the media analysis and manuscript preparation.",,40,4,4,4,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

As wide hands are known to lose less heat than narrow hands, and narrow digits are associated with greater dexterity, this study aimed to test whether there was a direct trade-off between dexterity and thermoregulation that shapes hand morphology. MethodsParticipants (25 women, 15 men) carried out the Purdue Pegboard test before and after a 3-min ice-water immersion of the hand. Their hand length, hand width, digit lengths, and digit widths were measured using standard anthropometric methods. ResultsWide first and third digits associated with significantly reduced dexterity after immersion relative to individuals with narrower first and third digits. Second digit width positively correlated with average digit temperature after immersion. Hand length and hand width did not influence dexterity. ConclusionThe current study suggests that digit width influences dexterity in cold conditions, reflecting patterns found at room temperature. Hand and digit morphology may be the product of two significant constraints on the hand: dexterity and thermoregulation. In cold conditions, hand morphology appears to be predominantly constrained by thermal stress, at the expense of dexterity. This may have important implications for interpreting the morphology of extinct and extant hominins.","[Payne, Stephanie; Macintosh, Alison; Stock, Jay] Univ Cambridge, Dept Archaeol, PAVE Res Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EX, Cambs, England; [Stock, Jay] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Anthropol, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada",University of Cambridge; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Payne, S (corresponding author), Dept Archaeol, Phenotyp Adaptabil Variat & Evolut Res Grp, Pembroke St, Cambridge CB2 3EX, England.",sp627@cam.ac.uk,"Stock, Jay/B-6453-2011","Stock, Jay/0000-0003-0147-8631; Murray, Alison/0000-0003-2914-5206; Payne, Stephanie/0000-0002-7173-9262","Trinity Hall Graduate Research Studentship, University of Cambridge","Trinity Hall Graduate Research Studentship, University of Cambridge","Trinity Hall Graduate Research Studentship, University of Cambridge",,73,6,7,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9483,1096-8644,,AM J PHYS ANTHROPOL,Am.

J,"Haverkamp, J",,,,"Haverkamp, Jamie",,,Where's the Love? Recentring Indigenous and Feminist Ethics of Care for Engaged Climate Research,GATEWAYS-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY RESEARCH AND ENGAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Care; Relationality; Knowledge Production; Participatory Action Research; Climate Adaptation; Peru,CONSERVATION; POLITICS,"Across a range of environmental change and crisis-driven research fields, including conservation, climate change and sustainability studies, the rhetoric of participatory and engaged research has become somewhat of a normative and mainstream mantra. Aligning with cautionary tales of participatory approaches, this article suggests that, all too often, 'engaged' research is taken up uncritically and without care, often by pragmatist, post-positivist and neoliberal action-oriented researchers, for whom the radical and relational practice of PAR is paradigmatically (ontologically, epistemologically and/or axiologically) incommensurable. Resisting depoliticised and rationalist interpretations of participatory methodologies, I strive in this article to hold space for the political, relational and ethical dimensions of collaboration and engagement. Drawing on four years of collaborative ethnographic climate research in the Peruvian Andes with campesinos of Quilcayhuanca, I argue that resituating Participatory Action Research (PAR) within a feminist and indigenous ethics of care more fully aligns with the radical participatory praxis for culturally appropriate transformation and the liberation of oppressed groups. Thus, I do not abandon the participatory methodology altogether, rather this article provides a hopeful reworking of the participatory methodology and, specifically, participatory and community-based adaptation (CBA) practices, in terms of a feminist and indigenous praxis of love-care-response. In so doing, I strive to reclaim the more radical feminist and Indigenous elements - the affective, relational and political origins of collaborative knowledge production - and rethink research in the rupture of climate crises, relationally. The ethico-political frictions and tensions inherent in engaged climate scholarship are drawn into sharp relief, and deep reflection on the responsibility researchers take on when asking questions in spaces and times of ecological loss, trauma and grief is offered.","[Haverkamp, Jamie] James Madison Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA",James Madison University,"Haverkamp, J (corresponding author), James Madison Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA.",,,,,,,,48,1,1,2,4,"UNIV TECHNOLOGY, SYDNEY-UTS EPRESS",SYDNEY,"BROADWAY, PO BOX 123, SYDNEY, NSW 2007, AUSTRALIA",1836-3393,,,GATEWAYS,Gateways,DEC,2021,14,2,,,,,,,,10.5130/ijcre.v14i2.7782,http://dx.doi.org/10.5130/ijcre.v14i2.7782,,,15,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics,XX6YW,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000736439300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Escalating extreme weather events increase the number of those directly exposed and adversely impacted by climate change. But do people attribute these negative events to climate change? Such subjective attribution may be a cognitive process whereby the experience of negative climate-change-related events may increase risk perceptions and motivate people to act. Here we surveyed a representative sample of 1846 residents of Florida and Texas, many of whom had been repeatedly exposed to hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, facing the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season. We assessed prior hurricane negative personal experiences, climate-change-related subjective attribution (for hurricanes), risk appraisal (perceived probability and severity of a hurricane threat), hurricane adaptation appraisal (perceived efficacy of adaptation measures and self-efficacy to address the threat of hurricanes), and self-reported hurricane personal household adaptation. Our findings suggest that prior hurricane negative personal experiences and subjective attribution are associated with greater hurricane risk appraisal. Hurricane subjective attribution moderated the relationship between hurricane negative personal experiences and risk appraisal; in turn, negative hurricane personal experiences, hurricane risk appraisal, and adaptation appraisal were positively associated with self-reported hurricane personal adaptation behaviors. Subjective attribution may be associated with elevated perceived risk for specific climate hazards. Communications that help people understand the link between their negative personal experiences (e.g. hurricanes) and climate change may help guide risk perceptions and motivate protective actions, particularly in areas with repeated exposure to threats.","[Wong-Parodi, Gabrielle] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wong-Parodi, Gabrielle] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Garfin, Dana Rose] Univ Calif Irvine, Sue & Bill Gross Sch Nursing, Irvine, CA USA; [Garfin, Dana Rose] Univ Calif Irvine, Program Publ Hlth, Irvine, CA USA",Stanford University; Stanford University; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Wong-Parodi, G (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Wong-Parodi, G (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",gwongpar@stanford.edu,,"Garfin, Dana Rose/0000-0002-0435-9307; Wong-Parodi, Gabrielle/0000-0001-5207-7489","National Science Foundation [BCS-1760764, SES1811883, BCS-1902925, SES-2030139]; National Center for Atmospheric Research - National Science Foundation [M0856145];  [K01 MD013910]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Center for Atmospheric Research - National Science Foundation; ,"This research was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants BCS-1760764, SES1811883, BCS-1902925, and SES-2030139 and the National Center for Atmospheric Research sponsored by the National Science Foundation under Cooperative Agreement No. M0856145.

A biophysical simulation study was undertaken to compare the performance of perennial pastures and annual forage cropping systems under a historical scenario and two possible future climate scenarios for three key dairy locations of south-eastern Australia. Pastures and forage-cropping systems were simulated with the biophysical models DairyMod and APSIM, respectively, for a location with a heavy reliance on irrigation (Dookie, Victoria), a location with a partial reliance on irrigation (Elliott, Tasmania), and a dryland location (Terang, Victoria). The historical climate scenario (baseline scenario) had no augmentation to climate data and an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 380 ppm, whereas the two future climate scenarios had either a 1 degrees C increase in temperatures (with an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 435 ppm) and a concurrent 10% decrease in rainfall, or a 2 degrees C increase in temperatures (with an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 535 ppm) and a concurrent 20% decrease in rainfall. At Dookie, mean annual dry matter yields of the forage-cropping options and the pasture systems increased under both future climate scenarios but more irrigation was required. At Terang, the yield of forage-cropping systems increased whereas the yield of the pasture systems decreased under the future climate scenarios. At Elliott, yields of irrigated pastures and cropping systems increased but there was minimal or a negative impact on yields of dryland pastures and cropping systems under the future climate scenarios. At all three locations, forage production increased in the colder months of the year with a decrease in production during the warmer months. This study indicates that double-cropping and irrigated-pasture systems at all three locations appear resilient to projected changes in climate; however, for irrigated systems this assumes a reliable supply of irrigation water. The systems implications of how a shift in the seasonality of forage supply within these options impacts on the farm system as a whole warrants further investigation.","[Pembleton, K.

However, there is significant variation in such agendas: some may focus on responding to one or two climate hazards, while others develop agendas to respond to a wide range of hazards. What causes this varying range of urban adaptation agendas? The purpose of this study is to assess how geographic, socioeconomic, and institutional features of cities as well as the perception of climate change hazards affect the scope of adaptation agendas. Utilizing regression analyses of a newly constructed database for 58 cities around the world, our findings suggest that the perception of climate change hazards held by decision-makers is a primary determinant of the scope of urban adaptation agendas. Given that each global city faces place-specific hazards from varying extreme climate events, this research provides global-scale adaptation strategies for local, national, and international institutions, suggesting that enhancing awareness as well as mapping urban climate hazards is an initial step for broadening and mainstreaming adaptation agendas.","[Lee, Taedong] Yonsei Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 309-2 Yonhee Bldg Yonsei Ro 50, Seoul, South Korea; [Hughes, Sara] Univ Toronto Mississauga, Dept Polit Sci, Mississauga, ON, Canada",Yonsei University; University of Toronto; University Toronto Mississauga,"Lee, T (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 309-2 Yonhee Bldg Yonsei Ro 50, Seoul, South Korea.",tdlee@yonsei.ac.kr; sara.hughes@utoronto.ca,"Lee, Taedong/AAJ-5234-2020","Lee, Taedong/0000-0002-5671-7938; Hughes, Sara/0000-0002-1282-6235","National Research Foundation of Korea [21B20151413289] Funding Source: Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI), National Science & Technology Information Service (NTIS)",National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),,,60,17,17,1,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

The trials were located on moist upland forest soils at Tuusula (60 degrees 21'N) in southern Finland and at Viitasaari (63 degrees 11'N) in central Finland. The material consisted of 21 stand and single tree origins ranging from latitudes 54 degrees to 63 degrees N. Survival, height, dbh, relative stem taper, stem volume/ha and the proportion of trees with a stem defect (vertical branch or forked stem), were assessed when the trees were 22 years old. Significant differences were detected among the origins regarding all the measured traits in both trials. Southern Finnish origins produced the highest volume per unit area in central Finland, whereas Estonian and north Latvian stand seed origins, as well as the southern Finnish plus tree origins, were the most productive ones in southern Finland. The more southern the origin, the higher was the proportion of trees with a stem defect in both trials. The latitudinal seed transfer distance had a significant but relatively small effect on survival, stem volume/ha and proportion of trees with a stern defect. The proportion of trees with a stein defect increased linearly in relation to the seed transfer distance from the south. The relationship of both survival and stem volume/ha to the seed transfer distance was curvilinear. Volume/ha was increased by transferring seed from ca. 2 degrees of latitude from the south. A longer transfer from the south, as well as transfer from the north, decreased the yield.","[Vihera-Aarnio, Anneli; Velling, Pirkko] Finnish Forest Res Inst, Vantaa Res Unit, FI-01301 Vantaa, Finland",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Vihera-Aarnio, A (corresponding author), Finnish Forest Res Inst, Vantaa Res Unit, POB 18, FI-01301 Vantaa, Finland.",anneli.vihera-aarnio@metla.fi; pirkko.velling@metla.fi,,,Finnish Academy,Finnish Academy(Academy of Finland),"Mr Erkki Kosonen, Mr Veijo Hakamdki, Mr Juhani Mdkinen and Mr Heimo Tynkkynen made the measurements, and the data was put to electronic form by Mrs Tuula Viitanen.

It also aims to identify a methodological approach that allows the socio-technical perspective to be integrated into management decision-making, alongside the more typical economic appraisal methodology. Design/methodology/approach A case study and novel mixed-methodology approach is used, which applies the diffusion of innovations framework, innovation system (IS) framework and system dynamics modelling (SDM) alongside traditional economic modelling and appraisal techniques. This approach is used to assess the adoption potential of solar photovoltaic (PV) and diesel water pumping systems in the wildlife conservation sector and surrounding rural communities in Kenya. The case study approach tests the merits of the mixed-methodology approach. Findings The life-cycle costs of solar PV water pumping systems are lower in nearly all financing and utilisation scenarios; offer additional social, technical and environmental benefits; and the conditions exist for greater adoption. The use of an integrated diffusion of innovations and IS framework generates significant qualitative data that can support management decision-making. The use of SDM techniques aid conceptualisation of the community economic, water and institutional systems into which water pumps may be diffused and provide a starting point for formal SDM simulation. The results suggest that these techniques capture the socio-technical perspective well and, when used alongside traditional project appraisal approaches, produce more complete information with which to support management decision-making. Originality/value This mixed-methodology approach could be used by practitioners to increase the diffusion and adoption of RETs in more complex contexts in late-industrialising countries. The emergent theory built through the case-study approach should be tested further to assess the merits of applying these techniques to support RET management decision-making in other contexts and more broadly.","[Geddes, Nicholas Morgan] Warwick Business Sch, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Geddes, NM (corresponding author), Warwick Business Sch, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",nickmorgangeddes@gmail.com,,,,,,,52,5,5,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-5664,1746-5672,,J MODEL MANAG,J.

Knowledge Elicitation Tools (KnETs) have been used to support a body of existing research on local strategies that build community adaptive capacity and support sustainable forest management under a range of socio-environmental and climatic stressors. The output of this approach is a set of decision rules which complements previous analysis of differentiated vulnerability of forest communities. Improvements to the KnETs methodology, such as new statistical measurements, make it easier to generate inputs for a social simulation model, such as agent attributes and heterogeneity, as well as informing which scenarios to prioritise during model development and testing. The KnETs process served as a vehicle to structure a large volume of empirical data, to identify the most salient drivers of decision-making amongst different actors, to uncover tacit knowledge and to make recommendations about which strategic interventions should be further explored in a social simulation and by local organizations planning interventions. It was notable that there were many common rule drivers for men and women from the same households, though they participated in the game-interviews separately. At the same time, though strategies were common to both poor and better-off farmers, differences lay in the package of strategies chosen - the number and type of strategies as well the drivers factors - and how they were prioritised with respect to each farmer's goal.","[Bharwani, Sukaina; Besa, Monica Coll; Devisscher, Tahia] Stockholm Environm Inst, Oxford Ctr, Oxford OX2 7JT, England; [Taylor, Richard] Stockholm Environm Inst, Oxford OX2 7DL, England; [Fischer, Michael] Univ Kent, Sch Anthropol & Conservat, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England; [Kenfack, Chrislain] Univ Coimbra, P-3000 Coimbra, Portugal",University of Oxford; University of Kent; Universidade de Coimbra,"Bharwani, S (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Oxford Ctr, Florence House,29 Grove St, Oxford OX2 7JT, England.",sukaina.bharwani@sei-international.org; monica.coll.besa@sei-international.org; richard.taylor@sei-international.org; m.d.fischer@kent.ac.uk; tahia.devisscher@sei-international.org; chrislaineric@ces.uc.pt,,"Taylor, Richard/0000-0002-3915-2920",Economic Community of Central African States,Economic Community of Central African States,"The COBAM project was coordinated by CIFOR in Cameroon under an African Development Bank grant to the Economic Community of Central African States for financing the Congo Basin Ecosystems Conservation Support Programme (PACEBCo).

The poor infrastructure and low adaptation capabilities of these nations are the prime concern of current studies. Pakistan is vulnerable to climate-induced hazards including floods, droughts, water shortages, shifts in weather patterns, loss of biodiversity, melting of glaciers, and more in the coming years. For marginal societies dependent on natural resources, adaptation becomes a challenge and the utmost priority. Within the above context, this study was designed to fill the existing research gap concerning public knowledge of climate vulnerabilities and respective adaptation strategies in the northern Hindukush-Himalayan region of Pakistan. Using the stratified sampling technique, 25 union councils (wards) were selected from the nine tehsils (sub-districts) of the study area. Using the quantitative method approach, structured questionnaires were employed to collect data from 396 respondents. The study reveals varying public perceptions about different factors contributing to the causes and impacts of climate change and the sources of information in the three zones of the study area. The primary causes of climate change are deforestation, industrial waste, anthropogenic impurities, natural causes, and the burning of fossil fuels exacerbated by increased population. Changes in temperature, erratic rainfalls, floods, droughts, receding glaciers, and extreme weather events are some of the impacts observed over the past decades. While limiting the indiscriminate use of fossil fuels combined with government-assisted rehabilitation of forests can help combat climate change, the lack of proper education and economic, social, and governance barriers are hindering the local adaptation strategies. In addition, reduce environmental pollution (air, water, soil, etc.) and plantation polluted areas with suitable plants, are the two main actions in combating climate change. This study recommends policy interventions to enhance local adaptation efforts through building capacity, equipping local environmental institutions, discouraging deforestation, and ensuring sustainable use of natural resources.","[Bacha, Muhammad Suleman; Nafees, Muhammad] Univ Peshawar, Dept Environm Sci, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan; [Muhammad, Muhammad] Univ Peshawar, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan; [Muhammad, Muhammad] Govt Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Planning & Dev Dept, Urban Policy & Planning Unit, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan; [Kilic, Zeyneb] Adiyaman Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-02040 Adiyaman, Turkey",University of Peshawar; University of Peshawar; Adiyaman University,"Kilic, Z (corresponding author), Adiyaman Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-02040 Adiyaman, Turkey.",sulemanbachastd@uop.edu.pk; muhammadstd@uop.edu.pk; zkilic@adiyaman.edu.tr; nafees@uop.edu.pk,"Nafees, Mohammad/J-4769-2019","Nafees, Mohammad/0000-0002-8717-8092; Muhammad, Dr./0000-0001-6321-9980; Bacha, Muhammad Suleman/0000-0001-5800-2138",,,,,76,3,3,7,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2021,13,8,,,,,,,4464,10.3390/su13084464,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13084464,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RU7IC,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000645316400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although these frameworks have been applied to multiple case studies, these applications are often idiosyncratic, subject to the interpretation of the researcher, and raise concerns regarding the operational use of frameworks for case-study comparisons. As a result, insights from these studies have not lived up to the aspirations of the frameworks to generate generalizable knowledge. Here, based on several case studies and our experience using various frameworks for analyzing social-ecological systems, we undertake the task of providing a mechanism to systematically qualify interactions among ecological, social, institutional, and built infrastructure systems that impact the governance of shared resources. Specifically, we generate a series of archetypal social-ecological systems and extract from them a verb list to represent key interactions in the Robustness of Coupled Infrastructure Systems Framework. We then extend and refine the list based on three case studies of coastal social-ecological systems. We categorize these verbs and use them to demonstrate governance patterns across the case studies. We find that governance entities predominantly seek control over paths of change directed at lower governance levels rather than acting at their own level. Governance entities shed responsibility to lower governance levels without providing necessary resources. Finally, we find high potential for the cancelation of efforts due to lack of coordination among governance entities. The set of system archetypes and associated verb list is a first step in laying the foundation for a general typology of and a standardized protocol for representing the dynamics of CIS.","[Anderies, John M.; Brady, Ute] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Anderies, John M.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Barreteau, Olivier] Univ Montpellier, Montpellier SupAgro, AgroParisTech, UMR G EAU,Cirad,IRD,IRSTEA, Montpellier, France",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; AgroParisTech; CIRAD; INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier,"Anderies, JM (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.;Anderies, JM (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",m.anderies@asu.edu; olivier.barreteau@irstea.fr; Ute.Brady@asu.edu,,"Anderies, John/0000-0002-0138-8655",MAGIC project (Multi-scale Adaptations to Global changes In Coastlines) under the Belmont Forum [ANR-13-JCLI-0005]; MAGIC project (U.S. National Science Foundation) under the Belmont Forum [ICER-1342933]; G8 International Opportunities Fund (IOF),MAGIC project (Multi-scale Adaptations to Global changes In Coastlines) under the Belmont Forum; MAGIC project (U.S. National Science Foundation) under the Belmont Forum(National Science Foundation (NSF)); G8 International Opportunities Fund (IOF),The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support for this work conducted during the MAGIC project (Multi-scale Adaptations to Global changes In Coastlines: ANR-13-JCLI-0005 and U.S. National Science Foundation ICER-1342933) under the Belmont Forum and G8 International Opportunities Fund (IOF).,,54,10,10,6,32,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

To better plan for future sea level changes in these regions, an interdisciplinary approach to assess the social and environmental impacts of sea level rise and their dynamic feed-backs is important. In this paper, we use a socio-ecological system framework to investigate sea level rise impacts to the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula, a rural, low-lying coastal region in eastern North Carolina. Specifically, we show that 42% of the region could be inundated and property losses of up to US $14 billion could be incurred with 100 cm of sea level rise. We also synthesize the impacts of sea level rise on the region's social-ecological system and present strategies to strengthen the adaptive capacity of the ecosystem, markets and communities. We conclude with a discussion on the differing climate change risk perceptions amongst the stakeholders as well as implications for decision-making. Sea level rise will continue to threaten the functioning of this social-ecological system of rural, low-lying coastal communities. A socio-ecological system framework provides a lens through which the impacts of sea level rise can be evaluated for rural, low-lying coastal communities. The framework presented here necessitates interdisciplinary research and highlights the importance of mutual learning amongst stakeholders in other rural coastal regions.","[Bhattachan, A.; Moody, A.

Since 1990, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has provided funding for more than 40,000 properties. Yet, little is known about the costs of buyout implementation, even though federal funding re-quirements mandate a complex set of activities undertaken by local, state, and federal government staff. This lack of understanding of buyout activity costs hinders development of evidence-based policy recommendations. To address this gap, we surveyed local and state government officials and consultants who have worked on floodplain buyout projects. Our survey results provide the first systematic, activity-level financial documentation of buyout projects in the U.S. Local and state government respondents reported median per-property activity costs of $14,428 and $8,161 (or 9.64% and 6.95% of property purchase costs), respectively. Respondents also reported significant variation in the activities undertaken as part of each project; community engagement strategies were particularly diverse, suggesting some households may not be adequately informed as a result of insufficient funding, time, or technical capacity for these activities. The varied and complex structures of buyout projects, as well as the attendant activity costs, pose barriers to implementation for local governments. Our results suggest both that: a) additional support and flexibility may be needed for critical activities that improve the experience of buyout participants; and b) reducing other activity costs may produce significant savings, which in turn could be used to improve the quality and expand the scope of buyout projects.","[Curran-Groome, William; Hino, Miyuki; BenDor, Todd K.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept City & Reg Planning, New East Bldg,Campus Box 3140, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Salvesen, David] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Environm, 100 Europa Dr,Suite 490, Chapel Hill, NC 27517 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine,"BenDor, TK (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept City & Reg Planning, New East Bldg,Campus Box 3140, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",bendor@unc.edu,,,"North Carolina Policy Collaboratory and through the U.S. National Science Foundation [1427188, 1660450]",North Carolina Policy Collaboratory and through the U.S. National Science Foundation,This paper is based on work graciously supported by the North Carolina Policy Collaboratory and through the U.S. National Science Foundation under Coastal SEES Grant No. 1427188 and Geography and Spatial Sciences Grant No. 1660450.,,36,2,2,2,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,JUL,2022,118,,,,,,,,106128,10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.106128,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.106128,,APR 2022,9,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1I6HG,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000797328500011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Accordingly, citizen participation in each green infrastructure project stage is required, but the type of participation may differ. So far, limited research has been conducted to detangle how participation in green infrastructure projects is operationalised along the different project stages. This article, therefore, presents a comparative case study of nine European green infrastructure projects, in which we aim to determine: (1) how participatory ambitions may differ across green infrastructure project phases; and (2) which instruments are used to realise the participatory ambitions for each phase and whether these instruments differ across stages. The cases demonstrate different participation ambitions and means in the three project phases distinguished in this article (i.e., design, delivery, and maintenance). The design and maintenance stages resulted in high participation ambitions using organisational instruments (e.g., living labs, partnerships with community groups) and market-based instruments (e.g., open calls). In the delivery phase, participation ambitions decreased significantly in our cases, relying on legal instruments (e.g., statutory consultation) and communicative instruments (e.g., community events). Altogether, our exploratory study helps to define participation across the green infrastructure lifecycle: Early stages focus on creating shared commitment that legitimises the green infrastructure, while later stages are also driven by instrumental motives (lowering management costs). Although theory argues for profound participation in the delivery stage as well, our cases show the contrary. Future research can assess this discrepancy.","[Willems, Jannes J.; Molenveld, Astrid; Voorberg, William; Brinkman, Geert] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Behav & Social Studies, Dept Publ Adm & Sociol, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Molenveld, Astrid] Univ Antwerp, Fac Social Sci, Dept Polit Sci, Res Grp Polit & Publ Governance, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",Erasmus University Rotterdam; University of Antwerp,"Willems, JJ (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Behav & Social Studies, Dept Publ Adm & Sociol, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",willems@essb.eur.nl; molenveld@essb.eur.nl; voorberg@essb.eur.nl; brinkman@essb.eur.nl,,"Willems, Jannes/0000-0002-3318-9706",European Interreg Project BEGIN (Blue-Green Infrastructure through Social Innovation),European Interreg Project BEGIN (Blue-Green Infrastructure through Social Innovation),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the input received from city-partners that participated in this research.

While a number of prior studies have trained robust policies using large scenario ensembles, there remains a need to understand how the properties of training scenarios impact policy robustness. Specifically, this study investigates scenario properties including annual runoff, snowpack, and baseline regret-the difference between baseline policy and perfect foresight performance in an individual scenario. Results indicate that policies trained to scenario subsets with high baseline regret outperform those generated with other training sets in both wetter and drier futures, largely by adopting an intra-annual hedging strategy. The approach highlights the potential to improve the efficiency and robustness of policy training by considering both the hydrologic properties and baseline regret of the training ensemble.","[Cohen, Jonathan S.; Herman, Jonathan D.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Zeff, Harrison B.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Cohen, JS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",joncohen@ucdavis.edu,"Herman, Jonathan/M-9079-2017","Herman, Jonathan/0000-0002-4081-3175; Cohen, Jonathan/0000-0001-5516-1379",U.S. National Science Foundation [CBET-1803589]; INFEWS grant [CNS-1639268],U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); INFEWS grant,"This work was partially supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation grant CBET-1803589 and INFEWS grant CNS-1639268.

Humid subtropical regions play an important role in global food security, with crop rotations often including wheat (winter crop) and soybean and maize (summer crops). Over the last 30 years, the humid subtropics in the Northern Hemisphere have experienced a stronger warming trend than in the Southern Hemisphere, and the trend is projected to continue throughout the mid- and end of century. Past rainfall trends range, from increases up to 4% per decade in Southeast China to -3% decadal decline in East Australia; a similar trend is projected in the future. Climate change impact studies suggest that by the middle and end of the century, wheat yields may not change, or they will increase up to 17%. Soybean yields will increase between 3% and 41%, while maize yields will increase by 30% or decline by -40%. These wide-ranging climate change impacts are partly due to the region-specific projections, but also due to different global climate models, climate change scenarios, single-model uncertainties, and cropping system assumptions, making it difficult to make conclusions from these impact studies and develop adaptation strategies. Additionally, most of the crop models used in these studies do not include major common stresses in this environment, such as heat, frost, excess water, pests, and diseases. Standard protocols and impact assessments across the humid subtropical regions are needed to understand climate change impacts and prepare for adaptation strategies.","[Hernandez-Ochoa, Ixchel M.; Asseng, Senthold] Univ Florida, Agr & Biol Engn Dept, Frazier Rogers Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Asseng, S (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Agr & Biol Engn Dept, Frazier Rogers Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",ixchel@ufl.edu; sasseng@ufl.edu,"Asseng, Senthold/Y-6014-2019","Asseng, Senthold/0000-0002-7583-3811",,,,,110,5,5,4,22,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,FEB,2018,8,2,,,,,,,19,10.3390/agronomy8020019,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy8020019,,,17,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,FZ3QV,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000427505900011,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presents multi-objective robust simulation as a viable approach. We investigate its applicability in a case study of the re-design of a polder pumping-station in The Netherlands. The research demonstrates the added value of multi-objective robust simulation in establishing robust design alternatives. The approach generates additional decision relevant insights into the performance of the pumping-station under uncertain future conditions while supplying decision-makers with the information required to make informed trade-offs amongst key design choices.","[Timmermans, Jos; Kwakkel, Jan] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Delft, Netherlands; [van Druten, Emiel; Wauben, Marcel] Witteveen Bos Engn & Consulting, Deventer, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Timmermans, J (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Delft, Netherlands.",j.s.timmermans@tudelft.nl,"Timmermans, Jos/B-1239-2009; Timmermans, Jos/HDN-4906-2022","Timmermans, Jos/0000-0002-2759-7893; Timmermans, Jos/0000-0002-2759-7893",,,,,57,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2378-9689,2378-9697,,SUSTAIN RESIL INFRAS,Sustain.

Their operations are important not only for water supply but also for downstream aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Public agencies operate some of the most important water supply reservoirs in both nations: the federal Bureau of Reclamation in the western USA and the provincial Alberta Environment and Parks in Canada's South Saskatchewan River Basin. This paper examines legal and policy issues affecting potential changes in reservoir operations as an adaptation strategy in the western USA and southern Alberta and considers the two agencies' policies and practices on reviewing dam operations. Although both agencies appear to recognize the potential value of reviewing and revising their reservoir operating plans, neither makes a practice of doing so.

GUI present different typologies and consequently different key components, such as soil cover, tree canopy cover and shape, which determines their capacity to provide cooling. The aim of this study is to propose an approach to estimate the cooling capacity provided by GUI in order to generate useful information for urban planners. The methods are based on the review of the literature to identify the functions of GUI that are involved in providing cooling, and the components of GUI that determine those functions, and then to combine them to provide an overall assessment of the cooling capacity. The approach was used to assess 50 different typologies of GUI, which are result of different combinations of the components that influence the cooling, for three climatic regions. An illustrative case study in the city of Amsterdam show the applicability of the approach. This work provides a contribution in the panorama of Ecosystem Service assessment tools to support the mainstreaming of Ecosystem-based measures (such as the creation of GUI) in the planning practice.

With this in mind, a global online survey was conducted to understand northern agriculture and farmers' perspective on environmental change north of 60 degrees N. In the obtained dataset with 67 valid answers, Alaska and the Canadian territories were dominated by small-scale vegetable, herbs, hay, and flower farms; the Atlantic Islands were dominated by sheep farms; and Fennoscandia was dominated by cereal farming. In Alaska and Canada, farmers had mostly immigrated with hardly any background in farming, while farmers in Fennoscandia and on the Atlantic Islands mostly continued family traditions. Accordingly, the average time since conversion from native land was 28 +/- 28 and 25 +/- 12 years in Alaska and Canada, respectively, but 301 +/- 291 and 255 +/- 155 years on the Atlantic Islands and in Fennoscandia, respectively, revealing that American northern agriculture is expanding. Climate change was observed by 84% of all farmers, of which 67% have already started adapting their farming practices, by introducing new varieties or altering timings. Fourteen farmers reported permafrost on their land, with 50% observing more shallow permafrost on uncultivated land than on cultivated land. Cultivation might thus accelerate permafrost thawing, potentially with associated consequences for biogeochemical cycles and greenhouse gas emissions. About 87% of the surveyed farmers produced for the local market, reducing emissions of food transport. The dynamics of northern land-use change and agriculture with associated environmental changes should be closely monitored. The dataset is available for further investigations.","[Poeplau, Christopher; Schroeder, Julia] Thunen Inst Climate Smart Agr, Bundesallee 68, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany; [Gregorich, Ed] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Cent Expt Farm, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada; [Kurganova, Irina] RAS, Inst Physicochem & Biol Problems Soil Sci, Inst Skaya St 2, Pushchino 142290, Russia",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; Russian Academy of Sciences; Pushchino Scientific Center for Biological Research (PSCBI) of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Physicohemical & Biological Problems of Soil Science,"Poeplau, C (corresponding author), Thunen Inst Climate Smart Agr, Bundesallee 68, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany.",christopher.poeplau@thuenen.de; julia.schroeder@thuenen.de; ed.gregorich@canada.ca; ikurg@mail.ru,,"Gregorich, Edward/0000-0003-3652-2946; Poeplau, Christopher/0000-0003-3108-8810; Schroeder, Julia/0000-0003-3625-104X",German Research Foundation,German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This study was funded by the German Research Foundation in the framework of the project 'Breaking the ice-Consequences of northwards extending agriculture for soil organic matter cycling under a changing climate'.,,51,12,12,2,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,DEC,2019,8,12,,,,,,,190,10.3390/land8120190,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land8120190,,,18,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KA1TZ,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000505583000020,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, we draw upon a recent nationwide survey of 273 public transit agencies in metropolitan regions across the United States to understand the factors that influence their scope of adaptation to anticipated climate risks. We find that a transit agency undertakes more adaptation measures when transit officials perceive greater risks and greater adaptive capacity of the agency, or when it experiences more severe extreme weather events. We also show that local institutional environment, in particular, political ideology, affects the scope of transit adaptation activities. Transit agencies that operate in more politically liberal counties tend to engage in more adaptation actions, while the effect of state-level ideology depends on the level of perceived influence from state governments.","[Miao, Qing] Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Publ Policy, 3242 Eastman Hall,92 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Welch, Eric W.; Zhang, Fengxiu] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Sci Technol & Environm Policy Studies, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Sriraj, P.

Yet scholars disagree whether the Neandertal thorax represents an adaptation to cold climates or elevated activity levels. Given the difficulties of reconstructing overall chest shape from isolated and fragmentary thoracic skeletal elements, it is worthwhile comparing Neandertals and contemporaneous early modern human fossils from the same geographic region to recent modern human skeletons that are known to have enlarged chests. This study compares thoracic skeletal morphology in two Near Eastern Neandertals (Tabun Cl and Shanidar 3) and two early modern humans from the same region (Skhul IV and V) with four samples of recent modern human skeletons from the Andes (n = 347): two coastal groups and two groups from high altitudes. The two highland groups, similar to their living descendants, exhibit morphological evidence of anteroposteriorly deep and mediolaterally wide chests as part of respiratory adaptations to high-altitude hypoxia. I calculated the percentage of deviation of each Neandertal and early modern human fossil from the means of the four recent modem human samples for clavicle and rib lengths and curvatures. Shanidar 3 and Tabun C1 exhibit ribs that are slightly larger and less curved than the Andean samples, indicating slightly larger thoracic skeletons than modem humans who are known to have enlarged chests in response to increased respiratory demands. Skhul IV and V have significantly shorter ribs with greater curvature suggesting especially narrow thoracic skeletons. Comparisons with Andean populations suggest that the enlarged thoraces of Neandertals may reflect high activity levels, although results from this study do not exclude cold adaptation as an explanatory factor.

To better understand this, we interviewed 23 practitioners who work with climate, weather, and hydrological information in East Africa, to gain a qualitative understanding of their work and how they use climate services. We found a complex network of stakeholders within this climate services ecosystem, each with their own foci that dictate their information needs and use cases. We found that information is typically transferred from one stakeholder to another by means of a value chain structure. Thematic analysis provided a deeper understanding of participants' needs and motivations, revealing trust and information suitability as key issues in encouraging uptake. We also found that participants had strong motivations to overcome barriers to improve the livelihoods of end-user communities.

This paper offers a review of climate risk assessments undertaken over the past two decades and outlines research needs and policy options while noting there are no simple solutions given the systemic nature of climate risks. Water resource planning and climate risk assessment need to handle non-stationarity and post-natural Anthropocene conditions.

Because buildings are an important component of the built environment vis-a-vis both energy use and heat resiliency in cities, we explored their climate mitigation and adaptation potential. Specifically, we investigated how design decisions interact with regard to three heat-related factors-namely, energy use/CO2 emissions, passive survivability, and heat rejection to the urban climate. We selected an archetypical building as our test case, created various design permutations, and used whole-building simulations to analyze their performance. Our simulations show that permutations of the building with a smaller carbon footprint also emit less heat to ambient air and had a better passive survivability. However, we also noted potential trade-offs (e.g., where ventilation is inadequate, increasing insulation levels for energy efficiency may hurt passive survivability). Based on our findings, we argue that, at least at a policy level, it is imperative to take advantage of the synergies, and their collective benefits. Moreover, building regulations or incentive programs should look beyond energy as the sole performance metric of interest and consider passive survivability as well as thermal interactions with urban climate.

People in many low- and middle-income countries already suffer from several health challenges, such as malnutrition and a high occurrence of infectious diseases, challenges that will be intensified by climate change and variability. Furthermore, these countries often have health systems with a limited capacity to adapt to and prepare for future climate scenarios. As a result, many of the poorest and most vulnerable countries are likely to bear the brunt of health impacts resulting from climate change and variability. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change identified health as the sector with the greatest potential to reduce the impacts of climate change in many lower- and middle-income countries if adaptation measures are taken. In this paper, we use case studies from a project funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to examine how to design programmes to reduce climate risks in the health sector. The USAID project called the Adaptation, Thought Leadership, and Assessment (ATLAS) Project and it assisted public health institutions in lower- and middle-income countries. Four specific cases are presented: in Mozambique, supporting the National Institute of Health of to launch a climate and health research observatory; in Ethiopia, working with the Ministry of Health to include climate and weather information into malaria early warning systems; in sub-Saharan Africa, improving our understanding of the relationship between temperature and malaria to inform malaria elimination interventions; and working across all project countries (globally) to manage extreme heat to reduce impacts on human health and well-being.

In this study, climate researchers and users compare continental, national and locally tailored climate change services for two case studies in Sweden with clear adaptation needs. The case studies addressed the organising committee of the large ski-racing event, Vasaloppet, for which snow availability is a concern now and in the future, and a small municipality in Sweden (Karlstad) that is prone to flooding. After meetings and online discussions with users, researchers locally tailored a service by reanalysing the data behind the national climate service. We then compared these locally tailored results with available, comparable data from the pan-European and national climate services, including the projected changes and the uncertainties provided by each service. We found that different climate change services provided different indicators, and magnitudes and directions of climate change. Differences across services are unavoidable, and limitations of climate change services are a reality of the nature of projecting an ultimately uncertain future. Therefore, we call for clearer, more explicit communication of what a climate change service provides, and detailed explanations of the limitations of climate services regarding variables, locations, scales, as well as other uncertainties. We also find that value can be added to existing climate change services by tailoring climate service outputs for a specific location or specific user requirements.","[Donnelly, Chantal; Arheimer, Berit] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, SE-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Ernst, Kathleen] Univ Tennessee, Bredesen Ctr Interdisciplinary Res & Grad Educ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Ernst, Kathleen] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, POB 2009, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Ernst, Kathleen] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Environm Sci Div, POB 2009, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA",Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Donnelly, C (corresponding author), Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, SE-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden.",chantal.donnelly@bom.gov.au,,"Arheimer, Berit/0000-0001-8314-0735","Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency; MSB (Hazard Support) [2015-3631]; AQUACLEW; FORMAS; DLR; BMWFW; IFD; U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science, Integrated Assessment Research Program and Biological and Environmental Research Program","Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency; MSB (Hazard Support); AQUACLEW; FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas); DLR(Helmholtz AssociationGerman Aerospace Centre (DLR)); BMWFW; IFD; U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science, Integrated Assessment Research Program and Biological and Environmental Research Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","We would like to acknowledge financial support for the time spent doing analysis, meeting the users and writing the manuscript from research projects funded by: (i) the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, MSB (Hazard Support grant No. 2015-3631), (ii) the project AQUACLEW, which is part of ERA4CS, an ERA-NET initiated by JPI Climate, and funded by FORMAS (SE), DLR (DE), BMWFW (AT), IFD (DK), MINECO (ES), ANR (FR) with co-funding by the European Union (Grant 690462) and (iii) support from the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science, Integrated Assessment Research Program and Biological and Environmental Research Program.

Yet, for such approaches to influence long-term reef conservation and management, decision makers must be ready to consider future change and uncertainty throughout the decision-making process. Using the values-rules-knowledge (VRK) perspective, this study examines the decision-making context on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) at a time when new, and potentially riskier, management interventions, such as reef restoration, were being considered and reflects whether the decision context was suited to the challenges facing the GBR at the time. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders involved in managing and protecting the GBR, as well as participant observation at the Great Barrier Reef Restoration Symposium 2018. Qualitative analysis reveals that the decision context was partially aligned to the emerging situation on the GBR but inhibited by interacting social and political factors. This study provides essential baseline data to measure the decision context for future reef restoration activities.","[Waters, Yolanda L.] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia; [Waters, Yolanda L.] Queensland Univ Technol, Ctr Environm, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia",Australian National University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Waters, YL (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia.;Waters, YL (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Ctr Environm, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",yolandalee.waters@hdr.qut.edu.au,,,,,,,44,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

Development throughout the watershed and climate change contribute to increasing severity of flash flooding events that threaten life and property in the floodplain. As the intensity, duration or frequency of extreme rainfall events continue to increase with climate change, it is imperative to reduce the risk of urban flooding to vulnerable assets. However, as Istanbul is a city famous for its density and lack of open space, finding suitable relocation sites for at-risk structures, while maintaining access to recreational amenities for the surrounding neighborhoods is a daunting task. The decommissioned Ataturk Airport provides a unique opportunity to re-imagine the utility of urban voids in helping cities adapt to increasing flood impacts. While the current airport redevelopment proposal includes the construction of a massive park and new cultural amenities, such a park lacks sufficient connective infrastructure to its surrounding neighborhoods and does little to alleviate the significant environmental challenges of its neighbor, the Ayamama River. In this paper, we explore the use of the decommissioned Ataturk Airport site to relieve development pressure from the Ayamama River by implementing a novel swap strategy for urban voids. The proposed swap strategy design methodology relocates, regenerates, and reconnects decommissioned infrastructures and degraded floodplains simultaneously. As the impacts of climate change become more prominent, this novel urban concept seeks to initiate a conversation amongst planners and designers around the use of decommissioned infrastructure and large-scale urban voids to help relieve pressure from urban floodplains. Meanwhile, it can make room for river restoration projects without decreasing the quality of life of relocated residents or negatively impacting relocated economic activities by identifying redevelopment sites in close proximity.","[Main, Kelly Leilani] MIT, City Planning, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Main, Kelly Leilani] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, Berkeley, CA USA; [Mabsout, Joude; Serra, Olivia] MIT, Architecture Studies Urbanism, Cambridge, MA USA; [Segal, Rafi] MIT, Architecture & Urbanism, Cambridge, MA USA; [Komurcu, Muge] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Main, KL (corresponding author), MIT, City Planning, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",kleilani@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,55,0,0,1,1,HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS,BEIJING,"CHAOYANG DIST, 4, HUIXINDONGJIE, FUSHENG BLDG, BEIJING 100029, PEOPLES R CHINA",2096-336X,2095-5413,,LANDSC ARCHIT FRONT,Landsc.

The TPF summarizes the main social, environmental and financial aspects that may affect urban water management. The CBF provides a clear overview of sustainable urban water management performance and its bottlenecks in municipalities and regions. The GCF comprises nine governance conditions which each consist of three indicators. The GCF provides insight in the most effective improvements to increase the governance capacity to address the identified urban water challenges. Our results show that poor wastewater treatment and long-term drinking water security are Quito's main water challenges that may be jeopardized given the city's rapid urbanization and economic pressure. The GCF analysis reveals that cooperation between stakeholders, implementing capacity and citizens' awareness are the most important conditions for further development to find adequate solutions for Quito's long-term drinking water security. We also suggest that more attention should be drawn to the transparency, accountability and participation principles. The results of Quito show that the City Blueprint Approach can serve as an affordable quick-scan to facilitate cities in their strategic planning to reach their sustainable development goals.","[Schreurs, Eric] Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Spatial Planning, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Koop, Stef; van Leeuwen, Kees] KWR Watercycle Res Inst, Groningenhaven 7,POB 3430, NL-3430 BB Nieuwegein, Netherlands; [Koop, Stef; van Leeuwen, Kees] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev & Innovat, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University; KWR Watercycle Research Institute; Utrecht University,"van Leeuwen, K (corresponding author), KWR Watercycle Res Inst, Groningenhaven 7,POB 3430, NL-3430 BB Nieuwegein, Netherlands.;van Leeuwen, K (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev & Innovat, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",kees.van.leeuwen@kwrwater.nl,"Koop, Steven/J-8116-2019; van Leeuwen, Cornelis J/S-5815-2016","Koop, Steven/0000-0001-9906-3746; van Leeuwen, Cornelis J/0000-0003-1605-4268",European Commission [642354],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"We would like to thank all representatives of EPMAPS, INAMHI, EMGIRS, FONAG, CESA, Consorcio Camaren, Accion Ecologica and all citizen respondents who have agreed to participate in our questionnaires and interviews, along with those who facilitated more contacts for new interviews.

Not all local residents accept forced relocation, and some hold a radical form of rights-based belief that is hostile to government intervention into private arenas. This 'deontological libertarian' belief is related to a sceptical view of climate science. Data from an Australian survey are employed to demonstrate that climate scepticism is associated with the tendency to see private-property rights as a fundamental entitlement irredeemable in the prospect of forced retreat, regardless of compensation. The sceptical view has defensible normative elements constructed upon the framework of inviolable rights also underpinning recognised environmental and development imperatives. Appealing to absolute rights generally may be an effective way to approach the sceptical public. Rights offer a generalisable framework in which sceptics which they can see how their non-sceptical counterparts are similarly situated despite expressing a different policy preference. Although consensus is not guaranteed, communication can proceed more easily by making a common ontological terrain explicit.","Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia",Griffith University,"Lo, AY (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia.",alex.lo@griffith.edu.au,"Lo, Alex/B-7948-2008","Lo, Alex/0000-0002-5953-4176",,,,,50,12,12,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

To explore the conditions required for the effective use of climate forecasts, we conducted a pilot study focused on central-eastern Argentina. Historical records showed higher (lower) average precipitation during warm (cold) ENSO events in November-December. However, variability of the precipitation signal within ENSO phases was high. National-level yields of maize, soybeans and sorghum tended to be higher (lower) during warm (cold) events. A field survey was conducted to identify impediments for forecast adoption and learn how to communicate climate information. Most farmers surveyed know about ENSO, with the 1997-1998 event marking a turning point in their awareness of the phenomenon. Finally, various modeling approaches were used to explore outcomes of alternative management options (changes in crop management and land allocation) tailored to climate scenarios associated with each ENSO phase.

In response, federal, state, and local governments have broadened their flood mitigation strategies to include acquisition and demolition of flood-damaged homes (buyouts). Little work has documented or analyzed the range of strategies for funding buyouts. Federal programs provide the bulk of funding, but these programs are often slow. Also, state and local governments struggle to meet cost-match requirements. We present and analyze a nationwide census of buyout funding programs (n = 34), which draw on five primary funding mechanisms. We find that state and local governments are using a range of traditional and innovative financial mechanisms, including municipal/green bonds, revolving loan funds, local option sales taxes, and stormwater utility fees, as viable tools for funding buyouts. These tools may promote more autonomy from federal government mitigation programs, and ultimately, faster buyout processes.","[Peterson, Kelsey; Apadula, Emily; Salvesen, David; BenDor, Todd K.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Environm, Campus Box 3140, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Hino, Miyuki; BenDor, Todd K.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept City & Reg Planning, Campus Box 3140, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Kihslinger, Rebecca] Environm Law Inst, 1730 M St NW 700, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine,"BenDor, TK (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Environm, Campus Box 3140, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.;BenDor, TK (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept City & Reg Planning, Campus Box 3140, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",kels9090@live.unc.edu; emilyapa@live.unc.edu; dsalv@email.unc.edu; mhino@email.unc.edu; kihslinger@eli.org; bendor@unc.edu,"BenDor, Todd/E-1375-2016","BenDor, Todd/0000-0003-0132-7702",University of North Carolina Policy Collaboratory; U.S. National Science Foundation under Coastal SEES [1427188]; Geography and Spatial Sciences [1660450],University of North Carolina Policy Collaboratory; U.S. National Science Foundation under Coastal SEES; Geography and Spatial Sciences,"This research was funded by the University of North Carolina Policy Collaboratory, as well as by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Coastal SEES Grant No. 1427188 and Geography and Spatial Sciences Grant No. 1660450.",,98,9,9,5,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2020,12,23,,,,,,,10112,10.3390/su122310112,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su122310112,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PD8BG,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000597902900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The growth of the world population will be absorbed by the cities. The necessity of cities adapting to these trends calls for radical changes in urban water management. In this paper, baseline assessments, i.e., City Blueprints, have been carried out for 45 municipalities and regions in 27 countries, mainly in Europe. The assessments showed that cities vary considerably with regard to their water management. This is also captured in the Blue City Index(A (R)) (BCI), the arithmetic mean of 24 indicators comprising the City Blueprint(A (R)). Theoretically, the BCI has a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 10. The actual BCIs in the 45 cities and regions varied from 3.5 (Kilamba Kiaxi in Angola) to 8.5 (Helsingborg in Sweden). The BCI was positively and significantly correlated with the gross domestic product per person, the ambitions of the local authorities regarding water management, the voluntary participation index and governance indicators according to the World Bank (2013). The study also demonstrated a very significant correlation between the BCI and the University of Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index. The impacts of water scarcity and floods in cities are discussed.

At present, little is known about how the Australian public perceives policy options to mitigate sea level rise risks. This paper explores a range of different decision-making criteria used to assess a managed retreat scheme. A metatheoretical social functionalist framework is used to make sense of personal concerns elicited from an online survey asking respondents to consider a managed retreat scheme. The framework proposes that people can act intuitively as scientists, economists, politicians, prosecutors and theologians, when considering a complex topic such as managed retreat policy. The research found that the survey respondents are more likely to consider the topic of managed retreat from multiple functional perspectives than from a single functional perspective. The type of social functionalist frameworks that people used to assess the Conditional Occupancy Rights scheme was found to be influenced by their perceptions of sea level rise risk. The findings have implications for public debates about the long-term risks of sea level rise and for engaging with the community about managed retreat policy options.","[Alexander, Kim S.] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Environm Sci, Inst Land Water & Soc, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia; [Ryan, Anthony; Measham, Thomas G.] CSIRO Climate Adaptat Flagship & Ecosyst Sci, Canberra, ACT 2911, Australia; [Ryan, Anthony; Measham, Thomas G.] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Charles Sturt University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Australian National University,"Alexander, KS (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Environm Sci, Inst Land Water & Soc, POB 789, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia.",kalexander@rlssa.org.au,"Alexander, Kim/J-6069-2012; Measham, Tom/A-5210-2010; Alexander, Kim Suzanne/C-1800-2019","Measham, Tom/0000-0003-4549-5361; Alexander, Kim Suzanne/0000-0002-9015-1683",,,,,70,86,86,2,97,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

Over the last decade, donors and policymakers have coalesced behind a private-sector scaling agenda for Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) in which small-and-medium enterprises, multinational corporations and financial institutions are recognized for their potential to contribute to the effectiveness and efficiency of aid. This agenda has progressively adopted notions of inclusiveness entailing wider socio-economic empowerment for smallholder farmers and sustainability. Whereas proponents of private sector-scaling of CSA seed systems through inclusive business models make linear assumptions surrounding shared value outcomes and impact at scale for farmers and companies alike, we argue that these dynamics are not always straightforward in practice. For instance, the current focus of CSA seed-related investments towards the formalization and commercialization of seed sectors, does not correspond well to the contextual reality of where ESA farmers source the bulk of their seeds-from diverse channels operating under Farmer-Managed Seed Systems. More careful consideration is needed into the conditions under which inclusive business models could be more compatible with local farming contexts in ways that can support equitable and sustainable transitions at scale.","[Shilomboleni, Helena; Recha, John; Radeny, Maren; Osumba, Joab] Int Livestock Res Inst, POB 30709-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Recha, John; Radeny, Maren] Int Livestock Res Inst Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Shilomboleni, H (corresponding author), Int Livestock Res Inst, POB 30709-00100, Nairobi, Kenya.",h.shilomboleni@cgiar.org; J.Recha@cgiar.org; M.Radeny@cgiar.org; J.Osumba@cgiar.org,,,Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DGIS) of the Kingdom of the Netherlands through grant reference Climate Smart Agriculture in East Africa [4000000819]; International Development Association (IDA) [D7540]; CIAT [D7540]; SNV Netherlands Development Organization,Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DGIS) of the Kingdom of the Netherlands through grant reference Climate Smart Agriculture in East Africa; International Development Association (IDA); CIAT; SNV Netherlands Development Organization,This research was funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DGIS) of the Kingdom of the Netherlands through grant reference Climate Smart Agriculture in East Africa; Application no. 4000000819.

Evidence for drought largely derives from the drier, less populated northern Maya Lowlands but does not explain more pronounced and earlier societal disruption in the relatively humid southern Maya Lowlands. Here we apply hydrogen and carbon isotope compositions of plant wax lipids in two lake sediment cores to assess changes in water availability and land use in both the northern and southern Maya lowlands. We show that relatively more intense drying occurred in the southern lowlands than in the northern lowlands during the Terminal Classic period, consistent with earlier and more persistent societal decline in the south. Our results also indicate a period of substantial drying in the southern Maya Lowlands from similar to 200 C.E. to 500 C.E., during the Terminal Preclassic and Early Classic periods. Plant wax carbon isotope records indicate a decline in C-4 plants in both lake catchments during the Early Classic period, interpreted to reflect a shift from extensive agriculture to intensive, water-conservative maize cultivation that was motivated by a drying climate. Our results imply that agricultural adaptations developed in response to earlier droughts were initially successful, but failed under the more severe droughts of the Terminal Classic period.","[Douglas, Peter M.

This makes water management currently a highly dynamic field, in which experiments are made with new forms of policy making. In the current paper, a case study is presented in which different interest groups were invited for developing new water policy. The case was innovative in that stakeholders were invited to identify and frame the most urgent water issues, rather than asking them to reflect on possible solutions developed by the water authority itself.

Based on the evidence from climate change impact studies, in the near future, stormwater management systems, within the built environment, may need to meet performance expectations under climatic conditions different from historical climate. Considering the impacts of climate change on rainfall intensities and stormwater runoff peak flow and volumes, and in turn the effectiveness of mitigation, practices for urban stormwater management are desirable. This paper presents the results of a climate change impact study on urban stormwater runoff in the Bronx River watershed, New York City. Considering the impacts of climate change on watershed runoff, the potential for low-impact development (LID) controls to mitigate the impacts was investigated. Stormwater runoff and LID controls were modeled using the U.S. EPA Storm Water Management Model version 5 (EPA SWMM5). The simulations were driven by historical precipitation modified to represent future projections using a change factor methodology based on precipitation from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Using the change factor method, historical precipitation was perturbed to obtain future data, based on three climate scenarios projecting maximum, mean, and minimum values for rainfall. Results of frequency analysis performed on the simulated peak flow rates, with different recurrence intervals, showed a noticeable increase in the frequency of occurrence of extreme storm events and their peak values, under future extreme climate conditions. An LID control scenario consisting of rainwater harvesting, porous pavement, and bioretention was designed and evaluated using the SWMM model. The results showed that, while average increase in historical annual runoff volume under climate change impacts was approximately 48%, the LID controls could provide an average reduction of 41% in annual runoff volume. Application of the LID controls also reduced peak flow rates by an average of 8 to 13%. LID implementation decreased watershed runoff corresponding to 2-year and 50-year return periods, by 28 and 14%, respectively. In conclusion, retrofits with LID controls may provide not only their inherent benefits (e.g., runoff volume and water quality), but also additional climate impact mitigation benefits for stormwater runoff.

This paper problematises and expands upon these binary categories: examining the complex dimensionality of non-migration as a form of place relations, explored through qualitative study of rural and coastal Bangladeshi communities. Through 60 semi-structured interviews of individuals from four communities in the Kalapara region, the analysis proffers four qualitatively derived and inter-related dimensions of voluntary and involuntary non-migration framed as a form of place relations. These four dimensions concern the following: (1) livelihood opportunities, (2) place obduracy, (3) risk perceptions, and (4) social-structural constraints, with the interplay between these elements explaining diverse non-migratory experiences. In our analysis, 'place obduracy' is introduced as a concept to describe the differential speed of environmental change and socio-cultural adaptation responses to explain non-migratory experiences. Our discussion provides insight into how to best support non-migrant people's adaptive capacity in the face of growing climate emergency.","[Rabbani, M. M.

While there have been many studies exploring the climate change belief and risk perceptions as well as behaviors of both farmers and agricultural farm advisors, there are very few studies that have explored how these perceptions relate to actual climate impacts in agriculture. Here we couple survey data from United States Department of Agriculture farm service employees (n = 6, 514) with historical crop loss data across the United States to explore the relationship of actual climate-related crop losses on farm to farm advisor perceptions of climate change and future farmer needs. Using structural equation modelling we find that among farm advisors that work directly with farms on disaster and crop loss issues, there is a significant positive relationship between crop loss and perceived weather variability changes, while across all farm advisors crop loss is associated with reduced likelihood to believe in anthropogenic climate change. Further, we find that weather variability perceptions are the most consistently and highly correlated with farm advisors' perceptions about the need for farm adaptation and future farmer needs. These results suggest that seeing crop loss may not lead to climate change belief, but may drive weather variability perceptions, which in turn affect farm adaptation perceptions. This lends further evidence to the debate over terminology in climate change communication and outreach, suggesting that weather variability may be the most salient among agricultural advisors.","[Niles, Meredith T.] Univ Vermont, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Niles, Meredith T.] Univ Vermont, Food Syst Program, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Wiener, Sarah] US Forest Serv, USDA, Southeast Climate Hub, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Schattman, Rachel E.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Northeast Climate Hub, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Schattman, Rachel E.] Univ Vermont Extens, Burlington, VT USA; [Roesch-McNally, Gabrielle] US Forest Serv, USDA, Northwest Climate Hub, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Reyes, Julian] USDA ARS, Southwest Climate Hub, Washington, DC 20250 USA",University of Vermont; University of Vermont; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Niles, MT (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.;Niles, MT (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Food Syst Program, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",mtniles@uvm.edu,"Schattman, Rachel/AAX-4080-2020","Schattman, Rachel/0000-0001-7177-3914; Niles, Meredith/0000-0002-8323-1351; Reyes, Julian/0000-0003-4351-2455",USDA Climate Hubs; USDA Southwest Climate Hub; ARS Jornada Experimental Range,USDA Climate Hubs; USDA Southwest Climate Hub; ARS Jornada Experimental Range,"We are grateful to Mary Carey and Rich Iovanna from FSA, Mike Wilson, Daniel Dostie, and Lynn Knight from NRCS for their review and assistance with the survey implementation.

Climate projections confirm that more frequent, intense, and extreme droughts and rainfall events will con-tinue. However, knowledge around how drought and wet events move dynamically through space and time is limited, especially in the southern hemisphere. Australia is the driest inhabited continent, renowned as the land of droughts and flooding rains, but recent climate-driven changes to the severity of wildfires and floods have garnered global at-tention. Here we used S-TRACK, a novel method for spatial drought tracking, to build pathways for past drought and wet events in Australia to examine their spatiotemporal dynamics. Characteristics such as duration, severity, and intensity were obtained from these pathways, and modified Mann-Kendall tests and Sen's slope were used to detect significant trends in characteristics over time. Drought conditions in southern Australia have intensified, particularly in the southwest of Australia and Tasmania, while the north of the country is experiencing longer, more severe, and more intense wet conditions. We also found that the location of drought and wet hotspots has clearly shifted in re-sponse to precipitation changes since the 1970's. Finally, pathways for the most extreme events show peak severity is reached in the middle to late stages of pathways, and that the largest drought and wet areas of a pathway have moved further west in recent times. The findings in this study provide the necessary knowledge to improve prepared-ness for extreme precipitation events as they become more common and to inform predictions for agricultural output or the extent of other climate events such as wildfires and flooding.","Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; Univ Sydney, Sydney Inst Agr, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney; University of Sydney,"Verhoeven, E (corresponding author), Heydon Laurence Bldg A08,Sci Rd, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia.",elise.verhoeven@sydney.edu.au,"Greenville, Aaron/G-9718-2013","Greenville, Aaron/0000-0002-0113-4778",Hermon Slade Foundation [HSF 19103],Hermon Slade Foundation,Funding sources This work was supported by the Hermon Slade Foundation (grant id: HSF 19103) .,,133,2,2,30,34,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

This exploratory research attempts to shed light on how and why firms of varying risk profiles are strategically adapting to these risks - if at all. Through the lens of a qualitative multi-criteria adaptive capacity framework, the results of six case studies are analyzed to identify what influences are shaping the actions and strategies of firms. The article examines the propositions that: (A) firms with observable strategies have undertaken ex post strategies which are principally driven by the firms' financial bottom line; (B) firm strategies attribute little to no influence in their decisions to external or delayed costs and/or impacts relating to social and environmental influences; and, (C) firms with the comparatively most robust adaptive capacities will be those who: (i) are most aware of their vulnerabilities; and (ii) are themselves comparatively more vulnerable to the immediate risks associated with urban flooding. While the evidence largely supports the propositions, the results of this research can help shape the development of intelligence and strategic units within firms as they develop a capacity to adapt to ever changing conditions.","Columbia Univ, Ctr Urban Real Estate, New York, NY 10025 USA",Columbia University,"Keenan, JM (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Ctr Urban Real Estate, 409 Avery Hall,1172 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10025 USA.",jesse.keenan@columbia.edu,,,,,,,52,6,7,0,13,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",2040-2244,,,J WATER CLIM CHANGE,J.

Scientists and managers aim to understand how these changing conditions are influencing fish biomass and spatial distribution in this region, as both are used to inform stock assessments and fisheries management advice. Here, we use a spatio-temporal model for walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) to provide two inputs to its stock assessment model: (a) an alternative model-based biomass index and (b) alternative model-based age compositions. Both inputs were derived from multiple fishery-independent data that span different regions of space and time. We developed an assessment model that utilizes both the standard and model-based inputs from multiple surveys despite inconsistencies in spatial and temporal coverage, and we found that using these data provide an improved spatial and temporal scope of total pollock biomass. Age composition information indicated that pollock density is increasing and moving farther north, particularly for older pollock. We found that including an index of cold pool extent could be used to extrapolate pollock densities in the northern Bering Sea in unsampled years. Stock assessment parameter estimates were similar for standard and model-based input. This study demonstrates that spatio-temporal model-based estimates of a biomass index and age composition can facilitate rapid changes in stock assessment structure in response to climate-driven shifts in spatial distribution. We conclude that assimilating data from regions neighboring standard survey areas, such as the Chukchi Sea and western Bering Sea, would improve understanding and management efforts as fish distributions change under a warming climate.","[O'Leary, Cecilia A.; Kotwicki, Stan] NOAA, Resource Assessment & Conservat Engn Div, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [O'Leary, Cecilia A.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Thorson, James T.] NOAA, Habitat & Ecol Proc Res Program, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Ianelli, James N.] NOAA, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Div, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"O'Leary, CA (corresponding author), NOAA, Resource Assessment & Conservat Engn Div, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",cecilia.oleary@noaa.gov,"Kotwicki, Stan/C-3599-2009; Thorson, James T/O-7937-2014","Thorson, James T/0000-0001-7415-1010",North Pacific Research Board grant [1805],North Pacific Research Board grant,C.

However, there is a clear need for further detail in the regional and sectoral dimensions of impact assessments to design and prioritize adaptation strategies. New developments in regional climate modeling and physical-impact modeling in Europe allow a better exploration of those dimensions. This article quantifies the potential consequences of climate change in Europe in four market impact categories (agriculture, river floods, coastal areas, and tourism) and one nonmarket impact (human health). The methodology integrates a set of coherent, high-resolution climate change projections and physical models into an economic modeling framework. We find that if the climate of the 2080s were to occur today, the annual loss in household welfare in the European Union (EU) resulting from the four market impacts would range between 0.2-1%. If the welfare loss is assumed to be constant over time, climate change may halve the EU's annual welfare growth. Scenarios with warmer temperatures and a higher rise in sea level result in more severe economic damage. However, the results show that there are large variations across European regions. Southern Europe, the British Isles, and Central Europe North appear most sensitive to climate change. Northern Europe, on the other hand, is the only region with net economic benefits, driven mainly by the positive effects on agriculture. Coastal systems, agriculture, and river flooding are the most important of the four market impacts assessed.","[Ciscar, Juan-Carlos; Szabo, Laszlo; Van Regemorter, Denise; Soria, Antonio] Joint Res Ctr, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Seville 41092, Spain; [Iglesias, Ana] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Agr Econ & Social Sci, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Feyen, Luc; Dankers, Rutger] Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21027 Ispra, Italy; [Van Regemorter, Denise] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Amelung, Bas; Moreno, Alvaro] Maastricht Univ, Int Ctr Integrated Assessment & Sustainable Dev, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Amelung, Bas] Wageningen Univ, Environm Syst Anal Grp, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Nicholls, Robert] Univ Southampton, Sch Civil Engn & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Watkiss, Paul] Paul Watkiss Associates, Oxford OX2 7SN, England; [Christensen, Ole B.] Danish Meteorol Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Dankers, Rutger] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Garrote, Luis] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Civil Engn, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Goodess, Clare M.] Univ E Anglia, Climat Res Unit, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Hunt, Alistair] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Richards, Julie] ABP Marine Environm Res Ltd, Southampton S014 2AQ, Hants, England",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS); Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; KU Leuven; Maastricht University; Wageningen University & Research; University of Southampton; Danish Meteorological Institute DMI; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; University of East Anglia; University of Bath,"Ciscar, JC (corresponding author), Joint Res Ctr, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Seville 41092, Spain.",juan-carlos.ciscar@ec.europa.eu,"Amelung, Bas/AAD-4323-2019; Iglesias, Ana/AEN-3261-2022; Nicholls, Robert James/G-3898-2010; Feyen, Luc/ABD-6195-2021; Christensen, Ole B/E-4417-2013; Goodess, Clare/F-6790-2015; Garrote, Luis/B-5925-2013; Nicholls, Robert James/ABD-1481-2020; Amelung, Bas/A-2965-2012","Amelung, Bas/0000-0001-8501-9787; Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109; Garrote, Luis/0000-0001-9087-3638; Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109; Amelung, Bas/0000-0001-8501-9787; Goodess, Clare/0000-0002-7462-4479; Szabo, Laszlo/0000-0003-0328-8049; Dankers, Rutger/0000-0003-2375-5468; Watkiss, Paul/0000-0001-9940-976X",European Commission,European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"We thank C.

An existing aquifer model, water temperature data, and analysis of water administration were used to assess potential benefits of MAR to cold-water fisheries in Idaho's Snake River. This highly-regulated river supports irrigated agriculture worth US $10 billion and recreational trout fisheries worth $100 million. The assessment focused on the Henry's Fork Snake River, which receives groundwater from recharge incidental to irrigation and from MAR operations 8 km from the river, addressing (1) the quantity and timing of MAR-produced streamflow response, (2) the mechanism through which MAR increases streamflow, (3) whether groundwater inputs decrease the local stream temperature, and (4) the legal and administrative hurdles to using MAR for cold-water fisheries conservation in Idaho. The model estimated a long-term 4%-7% increase in summertime streamflow from annual MAR similar to that conducted in 2019. Water temperature observations confirmed that recharge increased streamflow via aquifer discharge rather than reduction in river losses to the aquifer. In addition, groundwater seeps created summer thermal refugia. Measured summer stream temperature at seeps was within the optimal temperature range for brown trout, averaging 14.4 degrees C, whereas ambient stream temperature exceeded 19 degrees C, the stress threshold for brown trout. Implementing MAR for fisheries conservation is challenged by administrative water rules and regulations. Well-developed and trusted water rights and water-transaction systems in Idaho and other western states enable MAR. However, in Idaho, conservation groups are unable to engage directly in water transactions, hampering MAR for fisheries protection.","[Van Kirk, Robert W.; Contor, Bryce A.] Henrys Fork Fdn, POB 550, Ashton, ID 83420 USA; [Morrisett, Christina N.; Null, Sarah E.] Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, 5210 Old Main Hill,NR 210, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Loibman, Ashly S.] Colgate Univ, Environm Studies, 13 Oak Dr, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Colgate University,"Van Kirk, RW (corresponding author), Henrys Fork Fdn, POB 550, Ashton, ID 83420 USA.",rob@henrysfork.org; brycec@henrysfork.org; christina.morrisett@aggiemail.usu.edu; sarah.null@usu.edu; aloibman@colgate.edu,"Null, Sarah/E-4422-2011","Null, Sarah/0000-0001-7451-7908; Morrisett, Christina/0000-0002-0110-2100","U.S. Department of Agriculture [2008-51130-19555]; National Science Foundation [1633756]; Colgate University; Federal Highway Administration; Fremont County Idaho; NIFA [582665, 2008-51130-19555] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Colgate University; Federal Highway Administration; Fremont County Idaho; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),Collection of the 2010 water temperature data was funded by U.S. Department of Agriculture grant 2008-51130-19555 to R.V.K.

Yet, the links between the timing of the warming levels and the corresponding greenhouse gas concentration pathways to reach them remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we compared projected changes of annual mean, extreme high, and extreme low river discharges in Europe at 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C under Representative Concentration Pathways RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 from an ensemble of regional climate model (RCM) simulations. The statistical significance of the difference between the two scenarios for both warming levels was then evaluated. The results show that in the majority of Europe (>95% of the surface area for the annual mean discharge, >98% for high and low extremes), the changes projected in the two pathways were statistically indistinguishable. These results suggest that in studies of changes at global warming levels, the projections of the two pathways can be merged into a single ensemble without major loss of information. With regard to the uncertainty of the unified ensemble, the findings show that the projected changes of annual mean, extreme high, and extreme low river discharge were statistically significant in large portions of Europe.","[Mentaschi, Lorenzo; Alfieri, Lorenzo; Dottori, Francesco; Cammalleri, Carmelo; Bisselink, Berny; Roo, Ad De; Feyen, Luc] European Commiss, JRC, I-21027 Ispra, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Mentaschi, L (corresponding author), European Commiss, JRC, I-21027 Ispra, Italy.",lorenzo.mentaschi@ec.europa.eu; lorenzo.alfieri@ec.europa.eu; francesco.dottori@ec.europa.eu; carmelo.cammalleri@ec.europa.eu; berny.bisselink@ec.europa.eu; ad.de-roo@ec.europa.eu; luc.feyen@ec.europa.eu,"Alfieri, Lorenzo/AAJ-6668-2021; Feyen, Luc/ABD-6195-2021; Mentaschi, Lorenzo/ABD-2814-2020","Mentaschi, Lorenzo/0000-0002-2967-9593; Dottori, Francesco/0000-0002-1388-3303; Cammalleri, Carmelo/0000-0003-4834-7508; Alfieri, Lorenzo/0000-0002-3616-386X",DG CLIMA of the European Commission [340202/2017/763714/SER/CLIMA],DG CLIMA of the European Commission,The research that led to these results received funding from DG CLIMA of the European Commission as part of the project PESETA IV-Climate Impacts and Adaptation in Europe (No 340202/2017/763714/SER/CLIMA.A.3).,,74,8,8,2,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,FEB,2020,8,2,,,,,,,22,10.3390/cli8020022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli8020022,,,15,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,KT6HG,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000519114500011,View Full Record in Web of Science

The day/night temperature in the greenhouse was set at 20/10 degreesC, but lighting was natural and day length varied accordingly. Seedling height was measured twice a week. The interaction term between seed origin and sowing date was significant, but the pattern of height development and timing of growth cessation depended systematically on latitude of seed origin and sowing date. As seed origin became increasingly northern, growth cessation began earlier and resulted in shorter growth periods. Later sowing dates delayed growth cessation but also shortened the growth period. Final seedling height systematically decreased with increasingly northern origins and with later sowings. Linear regression analysis predicted timing of growth cessation, night length at growth cessation, length of growth period and final seedling height with high precision when the latitude of seed origin and sowing time were predictor variables. The timing of height growth cessation was determined by the seed origin, night length and developmental stage of the seedlings.","Finnish Forest Res Inst, Vantaa Res Ctr, FIN-01301 Vantaa, Finland; Finnish Forest Res Inst, FIN-00170 Helsinki, Finland; Finnish Forest Res Inst, Punkaharju Res Stn, FIN-58450 Punkaharju, Finland",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Vihera-Aarnio, A (corresponding author), Finnish Forest Res Inst, Vantaa Res Ctr, POB 18, FIN-01301 Vantaa, Finland.",anneli.vihera-aarnio@metla.fi,,,,,,,44,36,36,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JAN,2005,25,1,,,,,101,108,,10.1093/treephys/25.1.101,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/25.1.101,,,8,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,887WC,15519991,Bronze,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000226335200012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recently, this material inherent property has been proposed to be utilized in a smart way. Employing the bilayer principle, controlled and reversible shape changes in response to changes of relative humidity were demonstrated. Wood naturally inherits a unique combination of material properties specifically suitable for large-scale shape changing parts. While being environmentally responsive, it offers high mechanical stiffness throughout shape-change, ease of machining and working, and sustainable availability in large sizes and quantities. In this study, we demonstrate design principles for achieving a range of shape changing patterns such as uni- and bi-directional surface curvature of wood and wood-hybrid bilayers with both negative (hyper-boloid curvature) and positive Gaussian curvature (spherical curvature). In parallel, we have developed suitable joints to join multiple elements to facilitate upscaling in length and width while maintaining shape-change. The ability to design and control the type and magnitude of curvature for specific sizes, shapes, and aspect ratios open the opportunity for a new class of large-scale weather responsive elements and self-forming building components.

Weather data are used from 115 observing stations for the reference 30-year period 1961-90. The climate index distribution allows for geographically differentiated guidelines on protective measures. Detailed scenarios for climate change for selected locations in Norway are used to provide an indication of the possible future development of decay rates. Climate indices allowing for the quantitative assessment of building enclosure performance may be an important element in the development of adaptation measures to meet the future risks of climate change in different parts of the world. Established quantified relations between climatic impact and material behaviour or building performance can be used as a tool for the evaluation of the need for changes in functional requirements.

Climate change has the potential to intersperse global approaches in alleviating hunger and undernutrition. It is hypothesized that climate shifts bring substantial negative impacts on food production systems, thereby intimidating food security. Vast developments have been made addressing the global climate change, undernourishment, and hunger for the last few decades, partly due to the increase in food productivity through augmented agricultural managements. However, the growing population has increased the demand for food, putting pressure on food systems. Moreover, the potential climate change impacts are still unclear more obviously at the regional scales. Climate change is expected to boost food insecurity challenges in areas already vulnerable to climate change. Human-induced climate change is expected to impact food quality, quantity, and potentiality to dispense it equitably. Global capabilities to ascertain the food security and nutritional reasonableness facing expeditious shifts in biophysical conditions are likely to be the main factors determining the level of global disease incidence. It can be apprehended that all food security components (mainly food access and utilization) likely be under indirect effect via pledged impacts on menage, incomes, and damages to health. The corroboration supports the dire need for huge focused investments in mitigation and adaptation measures to have sustainable, climate-smart, eco-friendly, and climate stress resilient food production systems. In this paper, we discussed the foremost pathways of how climate change impacts our food production systems as well as the social, and economic factors that in the mastery of unbiased food distribution. Likewise, we analyze the research gaps and biases about climate change and food security. Climate change is often responsible for food insecurity issues, not focusing on the fact that food production systems have magnified the climate change process. Provided the critical threats to food security, the focus needs to be shifted to an implementation oriented-agenda to potentially cope with current challenges. Therefore, this review seeks to have a more unprejudiced view and thus interpret the fusion association between climate change and food security by imperatively scrutinizing all factors.","[Farooq, Muhammad Shahbaz; Xu, Yinlong] Chinese Acad Agr Sci CAAS, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Farooq, Muhammad Shahbaz; Uzair, Muhammad; Habib, Madiha; Ramzan Khan, Muhammad] Natl Inst Genom & Adv Biotechnol, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Raza, Ali] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ FAFU, Oil Crops Res Inst, Coll Agr, Fuzhou, Peoples R China; [Yousuf, Muhammad] Pakistan Agr Res Council, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Yang, Seung Hwan] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Yeosu, South Korea","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Oil Crops Research Institute, CAAS; National Agricultural Research Council - Pakistan; Chonnam National University","Farooq, MS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci CAAS, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Farooq, MS (corresponding author), Natl Inst Genom & Adv Biotechnol, Islamabad, Pakistan.;Yang, SH (corresponding author), Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Yeosu, South Korea.",mshahbazfarooq786@gmail.com; ymichigan@jnu.ac.kr,"Raza, Ali/O-4595-2019; Shahbaz Farooq, Muhammad/HNB-7639-2023","Raza, Ali/0000-0002-5120-2791; ",,,,,443,21,21,56,58,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Effective first response is hence becoming an increasingly important part of the management of infrastructure systems. Here, we propose a novel and rational framework for 'consequence forecasting' that enables probabilistic, pre-event decision-making for first responders to effec-tively target resources prior to an extreme weather event and thus reduce the societal conse-quences. Our method is unique in that it minimises model bias by using the same numerical weather prediction model for both fault attribution and fault prediction. Our framework can predict failure rates that are within 50% of the true value for more than 50% of the events considered, some 24 h in advance, therefore demonstrating that it can be an important part of increasing societal climate resilience by reducing reinstatement times.","[Wilkinson, Sean; Dunn, Sarah; Adams, Russell; Fowler, Hayley J.; Otalora, Samuel Gonzalez; Pritchard, David; Chan, Steven C.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Kirchner-Bossi, Nicolas] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Mendes, Joana; Palin, Erika J.] Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England",Newcastle University - UK; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Met Office - UK,"Wilkinson, S (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",sean.wilkinson@ncl.ac.uk,"Adams, Russell/AHA-7144-2022","Mendes, Joana/0000-0003-3139-9846",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/N012992/1]; NERC [NE/N012992/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The authors would like to thank Paul Jewell and Carl Ketley-Lowe of Western Power Distribution for providing detailed fault information, access to their asset database and guidance on the practical aspects of managing the resilience of electricity distribution networks.

Recent studies have increasingly tested these assumptions and provide empirical evidence for the contributions of tree planting programs, as well as their feasibility and limits, for solving or mitigating urban environmental and social issues. We propose that current evidence supports local cooling, stormwater absorption, and health benefits of urban trees for local residents. However, the potential for urban trees to appreciably mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution over a wide array of sites and environmental conditions is limited. Consequently, urban trees appear to be more promising for climate and pollution adaptation strategies than mitigation strategies. In large part, this is due to space constraints limiting the extent of urban tree canopies relative to the current magnitude of emissions. The most promising environmental and health impacts of urban trees are those that can be realized with well-stewarded tree planting and localized design interventions at site to municipal scales. Tree planting at these scales has documented benefits on local climate and health, which can be maximized through targeted site design followed by monitoring, adaptive management, and studies of long-term eco-evolutionary dynamics.","[Pataki, Diane E.] Univ Utah, Sch Biol Sci, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Alberti, Marina] Univ Washington, Dept Urban Design & Planning, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Cadenasso, Mary L.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Felson, Alexander J.] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [McDonnell, Mark J.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Biosci, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Pincetl, Stephanie] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Pouyat, Richard V.] US Forest Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Setala, Heikki] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Ecosyst & Environm Res Programme, Lahti, Finland; [Whitlow, Thomas H.] Cornell Univ, Dept Hort, Ithaca, NY USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; University of Helsinki; Cornell University,"Pataki, DE (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Sch Biol Sci, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",diane.pataki@utah.edu,"Setälä, Heikki M/P-7354-2015","alberti, marina/0000-0002-1920-309X; Setala, Heikki Martti/0000-0002-5230-4001; Pataki, Diane/0000-0001-7209-514X",National Science Foundation [CNH 1924288]; Fulbright Global Scholar program; Academy of Finland [315987]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [315987] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Fulbright Global Scholar program; Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Academy of FinlandFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES)),DP was supported by National Science Foundation grant CNH 1924288 and the Fulbright Global Scholar program.

Specific quantitative and actionable landscape mitigation strategies for different land use and land-cover (LULC) types to cool down cities, have been rarely addressed. In this paper, the absolute threshold of cooling (ToC(abs)) -the specific threshold of a certain influencing factor to ensure the effective cooling of a particular patch type, was proposed and defined for the first time to facilitate the research. The effects of size, shape and neighboring greenspace percentage (NGP) of different types of LULC patches on land surface temperature (LST) were examined and their corresponding ToC(abs) values were determined if existed, in the metropolitan areas of Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin using satellite images. Results demonstrate that larger sized and complex-shaped water bodies and forested areas produce greater cooling effect. The size is irrelevant to the cooling intensity of grass-dominated patches. ToC(abs) of patch size exist and were identified for water bodies (Beijing, 5 ha; Shanghai, 10 ha; and Tianjin, 5 ha) and forested areas (Beijing, 20 ha; Shanghai, 50 ha; and Tianjin, 20 ha). Besides, NGP is negatively correlated with patch LST for all LULC types, indicating that increasing the amount of neighboring vegetation cover can effectively lower the nearby patch LST.

Voluntary buyouts, where governments acquire flood-damaged properties and return the sites to open space, have been the primary form of federally funded retreat in the USA to date. However, little attention has been paid to the cost structure of buyout projects. Using a transaction cost framework, we analyze the costs of activities that comprise floodplain buyouts. Federal data do not distinguish transaction costs, but they do suggest that the cost of purchasing properties often accounts for 80% or less of total project costs. Through a systematic review (n = 1103 publications) and an analysis of government budgets (across n = 859 jurisdiction-years), we find limited sources with relevant cost information, none of which reports transaction costs. The absence of activity-level cost data inhibits more targeted policy reform to support community-driven and efficient buyout programs. Better data collection and reporting can inform more impactful and equitable buyout policy.","[Curran-Groome, William; Haygood, Hallee; Hino, Miyuki; BenDor, Todd K.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept City & Reg Planning, New East Bldg,Campus Box 3140, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Salvesen, David] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Environm, 100 Europa Dr Suite 490, Chapel Hill, NC 27517 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine,"BenDor, TK (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept City & Reg Planning, New East Bldg,Campus Box 3140, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",bendor@unc.edu,"BenDor, Todd/E-1375-2016","BenDor, Todd/0000-0003-0132-7702; Hino, Miyuki/0000-0001-9369-5769",North Carolina Policy Collaboratory; US National Science Foundation under Coastal SEES Grant [1427188]; US National Science Foundation under Geography and Spatial Sciences [1660450],North Carolina Policy Collaboratory; US National Science Foundation under Coastal SEES Grant; US National Science Foundation under Geography and Spatial Sciences,This paper is based on work supported by the North Carolina Policy Collaboratory and through the US National Science Foundation under Coastal SEES Grant No. 1427188 and Geography and Spatial Sciences Grant No. 1660450.

How the GCF's limited funds could be used to leverage additional financial resources has therefore become a key challenge. This study investigates whether the experience of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), especially with co-financing, could offer useful lessons. It analyzes 4,574 projects implemented by the GEF and investigates how leverage has been used to acquire greater international environmental assistance. We find that the co-financing ratio of GEF grants increased from 3.95-7.69 during 1991-2018, and climate change projects show the strongest leverage potential. We also find that the GEF generates different co-financing effects on different receipts, being higher in emerging economies and lower in low-income countries. These lessons are applied to GCF fundraising to determine which of four different funding allocation mechanisms could achieve the maximum co-financing effect. If the GCF follows the GEF leverage ratio, then the co-financing achieved by the proposed Carbon Reduction Contribution Principle (CC) allocation mechanism is the highest, while that of the Adaptation Needs Principle (AN) is the lowest. Although emerging economies are generally richer than other developing countries, excluding emerging economies from the GCF is not a wise option as it not only inhibits co-financing, but also weakens the climate mitigation purpose of the GCF.","[Cui, Lianbiao; Song, Malin] Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Appl Math, Bengbu 233030, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yi] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Lei] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China","Anhui University of Finance & Economics; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Beihang University","Cui, LB (corresponding author), Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Appl Math, Bengbu 233030, Peoples R China.",cuilb1987@126.com,,"Zhu, Lei/0000-0002-7501-4904; Cui, Lianbiao/0000-0002-8693-508X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503001, 71974001, 71934001, 71673265]; Provincial Natural Science Research Project in Anhui Province [KJ2019A0649]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Provincial Natural Science Research Project in Anhui Province,"This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China: [Grant Numbers 71503001, 71974001, 71934001, and 71673265]; Provincial Natural Science Research Project in Anhui Province: [Grant Number KJ2019A0649].",,44,19,19,10,71,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Archaeological data about past climate and environment provide an important source of evidence about the potential challenges humans face and the long-term outcomes of alternative short-term adaptive strategies. Evidence from well-dated archaeological human skeletons and mummified remains speaks directly to patterns of human health over time through changing circumstances. Here, we describe variation in human epidemiological patterns in the context of past rapid climate change (RCC) events and other periods of past environmental change. Case studies confirm that human communities responded to environmental changes in diverse ways depending on historical, sociocultural, and biological contingencies. Certain factors, such as social inequality and disproportionate access to resources in large, complex societies may influence the probability of major sociopolitical disruptions and reorganizations-commonly known as collapse. This survey of Holocene human- environmental relations demonstrates how flexibility, variation, and maintenance of Indigenous knowledge can be mitigating factors in the face of environmental more rapid and of greater magnitude than the RCC events and other environmental changes we discuss here, these constraints of modernity we must address.","[Schug, Gwen Robbins; Watson-Glen, Tatyana] Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Dept Biol, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA; [Buikstra, Jane E.; Baker, Brenda J.; Knudson, Kelly J.; Stojanowski, Christopher M.] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Bioarchaeol Res, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [DeWitte, Sharon N.] Univ South Carolina, Dept Anthropol, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Berger, Elizabeth] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Anthropol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Buzon, Michele R.] Purdue Univ, Dept Anthropol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Davies-Barrett, Anna M.] Univ Leicester, Dept Archaeol & Ancient Hist, Leicester LE1 7RH, England; [Goldstein, Lynne] Michigan State Univ, Dept Anthropol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Grauer, Anne L.] Loyola Univ Chicago, Dept Anthropol, Chicago, IL 60660 USA; [Gregoricka, Lesley A.] Univ S Alabama, Dept Sociol Anthropol & Social Work, Mobile, AL 36688 USA; [Halcrow, Sian E.] Univ Otago, Dept Anat, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand; [Larsen, Clark Spencer; Nystrom, Kenneth C.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Martin, Debra L.; Perry, Megan A.] Univ Nevada, Dept Anthropol, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Nystrom, Kenneth C.; Roberts, Charlotte A.] State Univ New York New Paltz, Dept Anthropol, New Paltz, NY 12401 USA; [Perry, Megan A.; Santos, Ana Luisa] East Carolina Univ, Dept Anthropol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Roberts, Charlotte A.] Univ Durham, Dept Archaeol, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Santos, Ana Luisa; Suby, Jorge A.] Univ Coimbra, Res Ctr Anthropol & Hlth, Ctr Invest Antropol & Saude, Dept Life Sci, P-3000456 Coimbra, Portugal; [Suby, Jorge A.; Temple, Daniel H.] Natl Univ Ctr Buenos Aires Prov, Fac Social Sci, Consejo Nacl Cient Tecn, Dept Archaeol,Bioarchaeol Res Grp,Inst Invest Arqu, RA-7630 Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Temple, Daniel H.; Tung, Tiffiny A.] George Mason Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Tung, Tiffiny A.; Vlok, Melandri] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Anthropol, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Vlok, Melandri; Zakrzewski, Sonia R.] Univ Sydney, Sydney Southeast Asia Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Zakrzewski, Sonia R.] Univ Southampton, Dept Archaeol, Southampton SO17 1BF, England",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of California System; University of California Riverside; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University of Leicester; Michigan State University; Loyola University Chicago; University of South Alabama; University of Otago; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas; State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY New Paltz; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University; Durham University; Universidade de Coimbra; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); George Mason University; Vanderbilt University; University of Sydney; University of Southampton,"Schug, GR (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Dept Biol, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA.",gmrobbin@uncg.edu,"; Roberts, Charlotte Ann/H-2622-2019","Davies-Barrett, Anna/0000-0002-1555-1468; Buikstra, Jane/0000-0003-0206-0165; Robbins Schug, Gwen/0000-0002-3928-9230; Buzon, Michele/0000-0002-1177-0962; Roberts, Charlotte Ann/0000-0002-2259-807X",,,,,90,0,0,8,8,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,1091-6490,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and Representative Concentration Pathways are extended at temporal and spatial scales relevant for the most contributing sectors. Extended socioeconomic and climate scenarios are then used as inputs for spatially and temporally detailed models for population and land use change, and their subsequent impact on nutrient loading is computed. According to the model simulations, several factors of varying influence may either increase or decrease total nutrient loads. In general, societal drivers outweigh the impacts of changing climate. Food demand is the most impactful driver, strongly affecting land use and nutrient loads from agricultural lands in the long run. In order to reach the good environmental status of the Baltic Sea, additional nutrient abatement efforts should focus on phosphorus rather than nitrogen. Agriculture is the most important sector to be addressed under the conditions of gradually increasing precipitation in the region and increasing global demand for food. (C) 2020 The Authors.

However, the ecosystem functions that generate these services, such as biomass carbon (C) uptake, can differ substantially from nearby rural forest. In particular, the scaled effect of canopy spatial configuration on tree growth in cities is uncertain, as is the scope for medium-term policy intervention. This study integrates high spatial resolution data on tree canopy and biomass in the city of Boston, Massachusetts, with local measurements of tree growth rates to estimate the magnitude and distribution of annual biomass C uptake. We further project C uptake, biomass, and canopy cover change to 2040 under alternative policy scenarios affecting the planting and preservation of urban trees. Our analysis shows that 85% of tree canopy area was within 10 m of an edge, indicating essentially open growing conditions. Using growthmodels accounting for canopy edge effects and growth context, Boston's current biomass C uptake may be approximately double (median 10.9GgC yr(-1), 0.5 MgC ha(-1) yr(-1)) the estimates based on rural forest growth, much of it occurring in high-density residential areas. Total annual C uptake to long-term biomass storage was equivalent to <1% of estimated annual fossil CO2 emissions for the city. In built-up areas, reducing mortality in larger trees resulted in the highest predicted increase in canopy cover (+25%) and biomass C stocks (236 GgC) by 2040, while planting trees in available road margins resulted in the greatest predicted annual C uptake (7.1 GgC yr(-1)). This study highlights the importance of accounting for the altered ecosystem structure and function in urban areas in evaluating ecosystem services. Effective municipal climate responses should consider the substantial fraction of total services performed by trees in developed areas, which may produce strong but localized atmospheric C sinks.

The evolution of extreme heat risk in cities depends on the interactions of large-scale climate change with regional dynamics and urban micro-climates as well as the distribution and demographic characteristics of people who live and work within these micro-climate areas. Here we use California as a testbed where we employ a suite of high-resolution (1.5 km) future regional climate simulations coupled with a satellite-driven urban canopy model and a spatially explicit population projection to investigate the interacting effects of climate change, population growth, and urban heat mitigation measures, such as cool roofs, on exposure to extreme heat events. We find that climate change and population growth reinforce with one another to drive substantial increases in future exposure to heat extremes, which are poised to become more frequent, longer, and more intense. Exposure to events analogous to historic high-mortality extreme heat waves increases by 3.5-6 folds. Widespread implementation of cool roofs can offset a substantial fraction (51%-100%) of the increased heat exposure and associated building energy demand owing to climate change in urbanized regions.","[Vahmani, P.; Jones, Andrew D.; Patricola, Christina M.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Vahmani, P (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",pvahmani@lbl.gov,"Jones, Andrew/AHH-1227-2022; Patricola, Christina M/L-9902-2016; Vahmani, Pouya/I-4471-2016; Jones, Andrew D/M-4363-2013","Jones, Andrew/0000-0002-1913-7870; Patricola, Christina M/0000-0002-3387-0307; Vahmani, Pouya/0000-0003-2519-6671; Jones, Andrew D/0000-0002-1913-7870","US Department of Energy, Office of Science; Regional and Global Modeling Analysis, Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program; Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Office of Science of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","US Department of Energy, Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Regional and Global Modeling Analysis, Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program; Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science of the US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","The authors would like to thank Mac and Leslie McQuown for their generous support of this research.

Emerging research suggests that living shorelines may be a viable approach to conserving coastal habitats (marshes, beaches, shallows, seagrasses) along eroding shorelines. Living shorelines typically involve the use of coastal habitats, such as wetlands, that have a natural capacity to stabilize the shore, restore or conserve habitat, and maintain coastal processes. They provide stability while still being dynamic components of the ecosystem, but due to their dynamic nature, careful designs and some maintenance will be required if habitat conservation is a goal. Living shorelines may represent a singular opportunity for habitat conservation in urban and developing estuaries because of their value to society as a shoreline protection approach and resilience to sea level rise. However, enhanced public acceptance and coordination among regulatory and advisory authorities will be essential to expand their use. To fully understand their significance as habitat conservation strategies, systematic and standardized monitoring at both regional and national scales is vital to evaluate the evolution, persistence, and maximum achievable functionality (e.g., ecosystem service provision) of living shoreline habitats.","[Bilkovic, Donna Marie; Mitchell, Molly; Mason, Pam; Duhring, Karen] Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, POB 1346, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA",William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science,"Bilkovic, DM (corresponding author), Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, POB 1346, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.",donnab@vims.edu,"Mason, Pamela/AAK-8377-2021; Bilkovic, Donna Marie/A-8343-2009","Mason, Pamela/0000-0002-5840-2729; Mitchell, Molly/0000-0003-4210-285X",,,,,64,74,75,4,125,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0892-0753,1521-0421,,COAST MANAGE,Coast.

To mitigate floods, pluvial risk maps with climate change scenarios have been developed to help major urban areas adapt to a changing climate. In some cases, subnational governments have played a key role to develop these maps. However, governance research about the role of subnational governments in geospatial data development in urban water transitions has received little attention. To address this gap, this research applies the Governance Assessment Tool as an evaluative framework to increase our understanding of the governance factors that support the development of pluvial flood risk maps at the subnational level. For this research, we selected the region of Flanders in Belgium. This region is considered among the frontrunners when it comes to the creation of a pluvial flood risk map with climate change scenarios. Data have been collected through in-depth interviews with steering committee actors involved in the development process of the map. The research identified that the current governance context is supportive of the creation of the flood risk map. The government of Flanders plays a key role in this process. The most supportive qualities of the governance context are those related to the degree of fragmentation (extent and coherence), while the less supportive ones are those related to the quest for control (flexibility and intensity). Under this governance context, government actors play the primary role. The Flemish government led the maps' creation process and it was supported by the lower governmental levels. As the provincial government was an important actor to increase local participation, collaboration with private and non-governmental actors in the steering committee was more limited. The financial resources were also limited and the process required a continuous development of trust. Yet, the Flemish Environmental Agency, with the use of technology, was able to increase such trust during the process.","[Flores, Cesar Casiano; Crompvoets, Joep] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Publ Governance Inst, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Flores, CC (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Publ Governance Inst, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",cesar.casiano@kuleuven.be; joep.crompvoets@kuleuven.be,"Casiano Flores, Cesar/L-3217-2017","Casiano Flores, Cesar/0000-0003-4707-6988; Crompvoets, Joep/0000-0003-1077-597X",KU Leuven Postdoctoral Mandate [PDM/18/051],KU Leuven Postdoctoral Mandate,KU Leuven Postdoctoral Mandate PDM/18/051.,,81,6,6,3,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2220-9964,,ISPRS INT J GEO-INF,ISPRS Int.

The concept aims at breaking the main technical barriers that PCM have been dealing with in its application as passive cooling system: (i) solidification process of PCM is limited and (ii) peak cooling load is delayed but mainly discharged indoors. The concept relies on the ability of the system to modify the position of the PCM layer inside the building envelope with respect to the insulation layer. A proof of concept evaluation based on a numerical tool demonstrates the cooling load reduction potential of this technology when implemented in different construction systems. PCM peak melting temperature as well as the daily activations of the system were optimized using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The numerical results indicate that the dynamic system facilitates dramatically the solidification process of PCM, allowing the system to be designed with lower PCM peak melting temperatures. The potential of the system to charge PCM which solidifies at temperatures lower than indoor set point, allows the technology to be used not only as a thermal barrier but as a cooling supplier system.","[de Gracia, Alvaro] Univ Lleida, INSPIRES Res Ctr, GREiA Res Grp, Pere Cabrera S-N, Lleida 25001, Spain; [de Gracia, Alvaro] Univ Perugia, CIRIAF Interuniv Res Ctr, Via G Duranti 67, I-06125 Perugia, Italy",Universitat de Lleida; University of Perugia,"de Gracia, A (corresponding author), Univ Lleida, INSPIRES Res Ctr, GREiA Res Grp, Pere Cabrera S-N, Lleida 25001, Spain.;de Gracia, A (corresponding author), Univ Perugia, CIRIAF Interuniv Res Ctr, Via G Duranti 67, I-06125 Perugia, Italy.",alvaro.degracia@udl.cat,"de Gracia, Alvaro/AAF-3152-2019; de Gracia, Alvaro/R-6199-2018","de Gracia, Alvaro/0000-0002-8208-5487",European Union [712949]; Agency for Business Competitiveness of the Government of Catalonia,European Union(European Commission); Agency for Business Competitiveness of the Government of Catalonia,The authors at the University of Lleida would like to thank the Catalan Government for the quality accreditation given to their research group (2017 SGR 1537).

Here we examine the benefits of ecologically adjusted dam regulations to conserve biodiversity under climate change in floodplain habitats, including meadows and riparian mixed forests. The natural flood regime in snow-dominated regions has changed significantly during the last decades, in line with the projections for climate change. The ecosystems of temporary flooded forests show high biodiversity but are dependent on river high flows with long duration. These events are rare in the new climate scenario, but on the other hand, snow-fed rivers are also affected by hydropower dams and regulations. In this study we explored the potential of using reservoir regulation to artificially induce flood events; water management would then be a method to conserve biodiversity in forest habitats and adapt management to climate change. We made detailed calculations in lower Dalalven River, central Sweden, using observed time-series of river flow and dynamic scenario modeling for highly valuable Natura 2000 habitats. Here we show that long-term flooding is less frequent since extensive hydropower was introduced during the 1920s, and moreover, since the 1990's the spring floods are low due to low snow storage and short winter seasons. Sustainable management of 50% of the riparian forest requires flooding by 25 continuous days of 800 m(3) s(-1). We found that artificial floods using new ecological regulation regime of upstream hydropower reservoirs would help, but not be enough, to achieve this goal. The new regulation routines would correspond to a loss of 50-200 GWh in hydropower production for each artificial flood. Sustainable ecosystems in the study site do not request flooding every year, but some every fifth year. For practical implementation, the County Board is currently driving the process locally and we discuss the relevant social features, such as legal and funding aspects, of this adaptive management of water and forests. A smaller part of the forest could probably be rescued and costs could potentially be lowered by using only the most snow rich years and seasonal forecasting of river flow for optimal timing of water release from dams to induce flooding.","[Arheimer, Berit; Hjerdt, Niclas; Lindstrom, Goran] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Norrkoping, Sweden",Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute,"Arheimer, B (corresponding author), Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Norrkoping, Sweden.",Berit.Arheimer@smhi.se,,"Arheimer, Berit/0000-0001-8314-0735",,,,,34,4,4,1,14,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

The discourse on adaptation options is mainly technocratic with a focus on modern irrigation systems not accessible to the majority of grape producers. Thus, this research aims at shedding light and providing information for the design of inclusive adaptation strategies by identifying, with a socio-cognitive model, feasible adaptation options according to grape producers' perceptions and the related implementation barriers. Grape producers' water scarcity and adaptation appraisal were explored through qualitative interviews in the Northern Oasis (Mendoza) to better understand how producers' intentions are shaped through perceptual and socio-cognitive processes. To do so, a socio-cognitive model on grape producers' adaptation to water scarcity (GPAWS) was developed based on two similar models. The analysis reveals that, as overall grape producers share a similar concern with the risk of water scarcity, their different adaptive behaviours tend to be mostly derived from their differences in adaptation appraisal. Moreover, producers' adaptation intentions are mainly reactive and limited to answer short term, immediate risks. Most of the grape producers perceive feasibility and plan the implementation of reasonable efficiency measures. However, multiple barriers consequently limit the implementation of such adaptation options perceived as feasible by the producers. The results of this research can support government actors, agriculture research institutes, but also the cooperatives of producers seeking to encourage farmers' adaptation, by identifying which adaptation options could be implemented according to the type of producers and their adaptation appraisal, but also why certain feasible measures are not being implemented.","[Monnet, Marc; Vignola, Raffaele] Wageningen Univ, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Vignola, Raffaele] Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Aliotta, Yoana] Asociac Vinateros Mendoza, RA-5570 Mendoza, Argentina",Wageningen University & Research; University of Vermont,"Monnet, M (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",marc.monnet@wur.nl,,"vignola, raffaele/0000-0003-3483-5076",Foundation Hans Wilsdorf,Foundation Hans Wilsdorf,This research received financial support by the Foundation Hans Wilsdorf to cover the main author's travel expenses.,,49,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,NOV,2022,12,11,,,,,,,2868,10.3390/agronomy12112868,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12112868,,,17,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,8V5YJ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000930705700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, modeling and simulating the thermal response of VGSs remains a research topic. This paper introduces a novel inverse modeling approach for modeling the thermal response of VGSs on building envelopes. The modeling approach considers the VGSs as a homogeneous layer with apparent thermo-physical properties. The approach optimizes the apparent thermophysical properties by calibrating the inverse model using data generated by a detailed thermal response model of VGS or experimental data. It is shown that the predicted temperature of VGS deviates by less than +/- 1.3 degrees C, while the heat flux on the inner side of the building envelope deviates by less than +/- 0.3 W/m(2) compared to the measured values.","[Suklje, Tomaz; Arkar, Ciril; Medved, Saso] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Mech Engn, Lab Sustainable Technol Bldg, Askerceva 6, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Hamdy, Mohamed] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Hensen, Jan L.

With climate change, extreme heat events will become more frequent and intense. However, little is known about public awareness of heat warnings or behaviors during hot weather. Awareness of heat warnings, prevention behaviors, and air conditioning (AC) prevalence and use in New York City were assessed using quantitative and qualitative methods. A random sample telephone survey was conducted in September 2011 among 719 adults and follow-up focus groups were held in winter 2012 among seniors and potential senior caregivers. During summer 2011, 79 % of adults heard or saw a heat warning. Of the 24 % who were seniors or in fair or poor health, 34 % did not own AC or never/rarely used it on hot days. Of this subgroup, 30 % were unaware of warnings, and 49 % stay home during hot weather. Reasons for not using AC during hot weather include disliking AC (29 %), not feeling hot (19 %), and a preference for fans (18 %). Seniors in the focus groups did not perceive themselves to be at risk, and often did not identify AC as an important health protection strategy. While heat warnings are received by most New Yorkers, AC cost, risk perception problems, and a preference for staying home leave many at risk during heat waves. Improving AC access and risk communications will help better protect the most vulnerable during heat waves.","[Lane, Kathryn; Wheeler, Katherine; Charles-Guzman, Kizzy; Ahmed, Munerah; Graber, Nathan; Clark, Nancy; Matte, Thomas] New York City Dept Hlth & Mental Hyg, Div Environm Hlth, New York, NY 10013 USA; [Blum, Micheline] CUNY, Baruch Coll, Sch Publ Affairs, Baruch Coll Survey Res, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Gregory, Katherine] New York City Dept Hlth & Mental Hyg, Div External Affairs, New York, NY USA",New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY); New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene,"Lane, K (corresponding author), New York City Dept Hlth & Mental Hyg, Div Environm Hlth, New York, NY 10013 USA.",klane1@health.nyc.gov,,,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [1UE1EH000757-01]; City of New York tax levy funds,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA); City of New York tax levy funds,This work was supported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) grant #1UE1EH000757-01 and by City of New York tax levy funds.,,32,48,48,5,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1099-3460,1468-2869,,J URBAN HEALTH,J.

Considerable research attention has been devoted to understanding the ecological effects of alpine glacier and snowfield recession. However, much less attention has been given to identifying climate refugia in mountain ecosystems where present-day environmental conditions will be maintained, at least in the near-term, as other habitats change. Around the world, montane communities of microbes, animals, and plants live on, adjacent to, and downstream of rock glaciers and related cold rocky landforms (CRL). These geomorphological features have been overlooked in the ecological literature despite being extremely common in mountain ranges worldwide with a propensity to support cold and stable habitats for aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity. CRLs are less responsive to atmospheric warming than alpine glaciers and snowfields due to the insulating nature and thermal inertia of their debris cover paired with their internal ventilation patterns. Thus, CRLs are likely to remain on the landscape after adjacent glaciers and snowfields have melted, thereby providing longer-term cold habitat for biodiversity living on and downstream of them. Here, we show that CRLs will likely act as key climate refugia for terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity in mountain ecosystems, offer guidelines for incorporating CRLs into conservation practices, and identify areas for future research.","[Brighenti, Stefano] Free Univ Bozen, Fac Sci & Technol, Bolzano, Italy; [Hotaling, Scott] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Finn, Debra S.] Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, Springfield, MO USA; [Fountain, Andrew G.] Portland State Univ, Dept Geol, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Hayashi, Masaki] Univ Calgary, Dept Geosci, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Herbst, David] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Sierra Nevada Aquat Res Lab, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Herbst, David] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Saros, Jasmine E.] Univ Maine, Sch Biol & Ecol, Climate Change Inst, Orono, ME USA; [Tronstad, Lusha M.] Univ Wyoming, Wyoming Nat Divers Database, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Millar, Constance I.] USDA Forest Serv, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, Albany, CA USA",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; Washington State University; Missouri State University; Portland State University; University of Calgary; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Wyoming; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Hotaling, S (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",Scott.Hotaling@wsu.edu,"Hayashi, Masaki/E-2600-2012","Hayashi, Masaki/0000-0003-4890-3113; Hotaling, Scott/0000-0002-5965-0986",NSF [OPP-1906015]; U.S. Forest Service,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service),"NSF, Grant/Award Number: OPP-1906015; U.S. Forest Service",,100,25,25,13,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Yet effective action is still lacking. Dominant policy approaches have failed to generate action at anywhere near the rate, scale or depth needed to avoid potentially catastrophic futures. This is despite 30 years of climate negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and wide-ranging actions at national, transnational and sub-national levels. Practitioners and scholars are, thus, increasingly arguing that also the root causes of the problem must be addressed - the mindset (or paradigm) out of which the climate emergency has arisen. Against this background, we investigate decision-makers' views of the need for a different mindset and inner qualities that can support negotiating and activating climate action, along with factors that could enable such a mindset shift. Data were collected during participatory workshops run at the 25th UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP25) in 2019, and comprise surveys, as well as social media communication and semi-structured interviews with COP attendees. Our results underline vast agreement among participants regarding the need for a mindset shift that can support new ways of communication and collaboration, based on more relational modes of knowing, being and acting. They also suggest the emergence of such a mindset shift across sectors and contexts, but not yet at the collective and systems levels. Finally, they highlight the importance of transformative skills and the need for experimental, safe spaces. The latter are seen as a visible manifestation and enabler that can support agency for change through shared self-reflection, experience and practice. We present a transformative skills framework, and conclude with further research needs and policy recommendations.","[Wamsler, Christine] Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden; [Schapke, Niko] Chalmers Univ Technol, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Fraude, Carolin; Stasiak, Dorota; Bruhn, Thomas; Lawrence, Mark] Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies IASS, Potsdam, Germany; [Schroeder, Heike] Univ East Anglia, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Schroeder, Heike] Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Mundaca, Luis] Int Inst Ind Environm Econ IIIEE, Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Chalmers University of Technology; University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia,"Wamsler, C (corresponding author), Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden.",christine.wamsler@lucsus.lu.se; schapke@chalmers.se; Carolin.Fraude@iass-potsdam.de; Dorota.Stasiak@iass-potsdam.de; thomas.bruhn@iass-potsdam.de; Mark.Lawrence@iass-potsdam.de; H.Schroeder@uea.ac.uk; luis.mundaca@iiiee.lu.se,,"Stasiak, Dorota/0000-0003-4690-8658; Lawrence, Mark/0000-0002-2178-4903; Schroeder, Heike/0000-0003-2342-2030; Bruhn, Thomas/0000-0002-5940-462X; Fraude, Carolin/0000-0003-4529-8907; Schapke, Niko/0000-0003-2232-1430","German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF); State of Brandenburg Ministry for Science, Research and Culture (MWFK); Swedish Research Council Formas [2019-00390, 2019-01969]; Chalmers Energy Area of Advance","German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); State of Brandenburg Ministry for Science, Research and Culture (MWFK); Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Chalmers Energy Area of Advance","The work of the IASS is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) and the State of Brandenburg Ministry for Science, Research and Culture (MWFK).

Those with better adaptation strategies (such as air conditioning) suffer less. This paper combines China's daily mean temperature data with comprehensive national survey data at the household level and estimates the relationship between high-temperature exposure and adaptation behavior of urban dwellers. We find that the usage of air conditioning and electric fans by urban households in China increases with their summer high-temperature exposures. The rise in the number of days with extreme heat (mean temperature exceeding 80 degrees F) induces the purchase and use of air conditioning. High-temperature adaptability varied across households-the rich are more likely to increase air conditioning usage to cope with the high-temperature discomfort; while the poor are less likely to afford such a market product for adaptation, they suffer more from high-temperature exposure. Such a variation in the affordability and usage of market products to adapt to climate risks will exacerbate the climate-induced inequality.","[Deng, Hui; Yip, Wingshan] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Weizeng] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Siqi] MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Sustainable Urbanizat Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Zheng, Siqi] MIT, Ctr Real Estate, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Tsinghua University; Central University of Finance & Economics; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Sun, WZ (corresponding author), Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",hdeng1213@163.com; sunweizeng@gmail.com; yeys19@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; sqzheng@mit.edu,"Yip, Wingshan/GRY-4096-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71625004, 71903210]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2017A030313446]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province),"We thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71625004, 71903210) and the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (No. 2017A030313446) for the support.",,34,2,2,16,49,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

However, predicting changes in ecosystem service value from restoration or management is challenging because environmental systems are highly complex and uncertain. Furthermore, benefits are diverse and accrue over various timescales. We developed a generalizable mathematical coastal management model to compare restoration expenditures to ecosystem service benefits and apply it to McInnis Marsh, Marin County, California, USA. We find that benefits of restoration outweigh costs for a wide range of assumptions. For instance, costs of restoration range from 8-30% of the increase in ecosystem service value over 50 years depending on discount rate. Flood protection is the dominant monetized service for most payback periods and discount rates, but other services (e.g., recreation) dominate on shorter timescales (> 50% of total value for payback periods <= 4 years). We find that the range of total ecosystem service value is narrower than overall variability reported in the literature, supporting the use of mechanistic methods in decision-making around coastal resiliency. However, the magnitude and relative importance of ecosystem services are sensitive to payback period, discount rate and risk tolerance, demonstrating the importance of probabilistic decision analysis. This work provides a modular, transferrable tool to that can also inform coastal resiliency investments elsewhere.","[Calder, Ryan S.

However, there is a lack of recommendations of optimal NbS and appropriate typologies fitting to different contexts and urban design. The analytical frameworks for NbS implementation and impact evaluation, that integrate NbS into local policy frameworks, socio-economic transition pathways, and spatial planning, remain fragmented. In this article, the NbS concept and its related terminologies are first discussed. Second, the types of NbS implemented in Europe are reviewed and their benefits over time are explored, prior to categorizing them and highlighting the key methods, criteria, and indicators to identify and assess the NbS's impacts, co-benefits, and trade-offs. The latter involved a review of the websites of 52 projects and some relevant publications funded by EU Research and Innovation programs and other relevant publications. The results show that there is a shared understanding that the NbS concept encompasses benefits of restoration and rehabilitation of ecosystems, carbon neutrality, improved environmental quality, health and well-being, and evidence for such benefits. This study also shows that most NbS-related projects and activities in Europe use hybrid approaches, with NbS typically developed, tested, or implemented to target specific types of environmental-social-economic challenges. The results of this study indicate that NbS as a holistic concept would be beneficial in the context of climate action and sustainable solutions to enhance ecosystem resilience and adaptive capacity within cities. As such, this article provides a snapshot of the role of NbS in urban sustainability development, a guide to the state-of-the-art, and key messages and recommendations of this rapidly emerging and evolving field.","[Liu, Hai-Ying] NILU Norwegian Inst Air Res, Dept Environm Impacts & Sustainabil, POB 100, N-2027 Kjeller, Norway; [Jay, Marion] Adelphi Res gGmbH, Alt Moabit 91, D-10559 Berlin, Germany; [Chen, Xianwen] NINA Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Oslo Dept, Sognsveien 68, N-0855 Oslo, Norway; [Chen, Xianwen] Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Inland Sch Business & Social Sci, Dept Business Adm, POB 400, N-2418 Elverum, Norway",Norwegian Institute for Air Research; Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences,"Liu, HY (corresponding author), NILU Norwegian Inst Air Res, Dept Environm Impacts & Sustainabil, POB 100, N-2027 Kjeller, Norway.",hyl@nilu.no; jay@adelphi.de; xianwen.chen@gmail.com,"Liu, Hai-Ying/P-5557-2014","Liu, Hai-Ying/0000-0001-8667-3465; Marion, Jay/0000-0003-1653-5096; Chen, Xianwen/0000-0001-9262-2568","NILU-Norwegian Institute for Air Research; NILU-NIVA SIS project on urban sustainable development; EEA ETC/CME task on urban environmental sustainability; ETC/ATNI task on urban environmental sustainability; NILU internal project on nature-based solutions for improving environmental quality, health, and well-being","NILU-Norwegian Institute for Air Research(Bioforsk); NILU-NIVA SIS project on urban sustainable development; EEA ETC/CME task on urban environmental sustainability; ETC/ATNI task on urban environmental sustainability; NILU internal project on nature-based solutions for improving environmental quality, health, and well-being","Open-access publication was funded by NILU-Norwegian Institute for Air Research.

However, cover crop adoption rates are increasing slowly and cover less than 5% of U.S. croplands. In contrast, several Indiana counties in the southern Wabash River Basin have cover crops on more than 20 % of farmland. This qualitative study draws on 33 semi-structured interviews with farmers to understand whether climate risks are driving the above-average rates of adoption in this area. Our purposive sample of farmers was guided by whether they farmed flood-prone areas along the White and Wabash Rivers, thus making them especially sensitive to increasing flood risks from climate change. We found that while climate risks, particularly intensifying rainfall events, were a factor in some cases, most adoption was a longstanding effort to control wind-erosion on hilly areas with sandy soils. We also found that farmers experienced challenges with adoption following successful establishment of cover crops tied to climate-driven ecosystem responses. Greater spring precipitation delayed cash crop planting because of moisture retention and intensified pest pressures from increased habitat has caused replanting of cash crop seeds. Responses indicate that climate risks have mixed effects that may either discourage or encourage cover crop adoption depending on whether future outreach and policy interventions can help farmers overcome the adoption challenges they encounter.","[Yoder, Landon; Farmer, James] Indiana Univ, ONeill Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Houser, Matthew; Sullivan, Abigail] Indiana Univ, Environm Resilience Inst, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Bruce, Analena] Univ New Hampshire, Coll Life Sci & Agr, Durham, NH 03824 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Yoder, L (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, ONeill Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",yoderl@indiana.edu,,"Sullivan, Abigail/0000-0002-2746-859X","Indiana University Grand Challenge Initiative, Prepared for Environmental Change","Indiana University Grand Challenge Initiative, Prepared for Environmental Change","This research was supported by the Indiana University Grand Challenge Initiative, Prepared for Environmental Change.

Extreme event attribution (EEA) enables us to quantify the influence of anthropogenic climate change (ACC) on a given event in a way that can be tailored to stakeholder needs, thereby enhancing the potential utility of studying past events. Here we set out a framework for systematically recording key details of high-impact events on a national scale (using the UK and Puerto Rico as examples), combining recent advances in event attribution with the risk framework. These `inventories' inherently provide useful information depending on a user's interest. For example, as a compilation of the impacts of ACC, we find that in the UK since 2000, at least 1500 excess deaths are directly attributable to human-induced climate change, while in Puerto Rico the increased intensity of Hurricane Maria alone led to the deaths of up to 3670 people. We also explore how inventories form a foundation for further analysis, learning from past events. This involves identifying the most damaging hazards and crucially also vulnerabilities and exposure characteristics over time. To build a risk assessment for heat-related mortality in the UK we focus on a vulnerable group, elderly urban populations, and project changes in the hazard and exposure within the same framework. Without improved preparedness, the risk to this group is likely to increase by similar to 50% by 2028 and similar to 150% by 2043. In addition, the framework allows the exploration of the likelihood of otherwise unprecedented events, or 'Black Swans'. Finally, not only does it aid disaster preparedness and adaptation at local and national scales, such inventories also provide a new source of evidence for global stocktakes on adaptation and loss and damage such as mandated by the Paris Climate Agreement.","[Clarke, Ben J.; Jones, Richard G.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England; [Otto, Friederike E.

This article, therefore, applied a systematic literature review methodology to examine the current climate-water governance archetype, including key areas, major elements, critical gaps, and potential strategy in Pakistan. This study found that key climate-water governance areas in Pakistan are: river basin and watershed management, agriculture and irrigation management, urban and domestic water issues, floods, droughts and disaster management, groundwater management, and transboundary management. Moreover, it is revealed that the major governance elements are political commitment and leadership, policy formulation and regulation, institutional capacity and coordination, stakeholder engagement, and resource management, technology, and infrastructure development. The article also discusses how Pakistan has not effectively employed most of the identified governance elements to tackle its climate-water problems, lacking mostly in political, policy, institutional, coordination, and infrastructure aspects.

To restrict urban expansion in the outskirts, a common strategy is to densify existing neighbourhoods. Densification implies the increase of water impervious area which increases the vulnerability to flooding during extreme precipitation events. Sustainable urban drainage systems are considered as a strategy to handle stormwater runoff locally and thus relieve the sewage system. This study investigates the combined quantitative hydrological impact of densification and sustainable stormwater management measures in a residential neighbourhood in Munich, Germany. The living-lab approach pursues the application of nature-based solutions in a real planning case to achieve positive climate effects while densifying the neighbourhood. The study is based on single event simulations of three return periods with the physically based software PCSWMM. The events are implemented for both current and climate change precipitation intensities of the RCP 8.5 projection for 2040-2069. Three scenarios are implemented: a status quo, a business as usual scenario (additional buildings without compensation measures) and a best-case scenario (one additional floor with green roofs disconnected from the sewers in combination with rain gardens and porous pavements on the land parcels). The comparison between the different scenarios focuses on three main aspects of the water balance, namely, infiltration, runoff and storage. The results show that measures for sustainable stormwater management are crucial elements to cope with an increasing number of heavy precipitation events due to climate change. The best-case scenario significantly outperforms the other two concerning water infiltration, surface runoff and storage. Most notably is the impact of climate change projection rainfall intensities for 2040-2069. The outcomes for these intensities clearly show the positive impact of sustainable water-sensitive design. The results demonstrate that it is in fact possible to enhance the water balance and gain new living space simultaneously if a sustainable urban planning strategy is implemented that includes future-oriented stormwater management.","[Rosenberger, Lea; Leandro, Jorge] Tech Univ Munich TUM, Dept Civil Geo & Environm Engn, Chair Hydrol & River Basin Management, Munich, Germany; [Pauleit, Stephan; Erlwein, Sabrina] Tech Univ Munich TUM, Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Chair Strateg Landscape Planning & Management, Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich,"Rosenberger, L (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich TUM, Dept Civil Geo & Environm Engn, Chair Hydrol & River Basin Management, Munich, Germany.",lea.rosenberger@tum.de,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,CHI,CHI,"The authors thank the Municipal Drainage Authority of Munich (Munchner Stadtentw asserung) and the Bavarian Agency for Digitisation, High-Speed Internet and Surveying (Landesamt fur Digitalisierung, Breitband und Vermessung) for providing input data and CHI for sponsoring the PCSWMM educational software license.

However, few studies have quantitatively investigated the effects of a range of CSA practices on crop yield, soil carbon, and nitrogen pools. This study adds to this limited body of work by synthesizing such studies and evaluates the effect of individual and combinations of widely implemented CSA practices in Africa-green manure (GM), conservation tillage (no-tillage, reduced tillage), and crop residue retention (CR)-on food crop yield, soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration, and soil total nitrogen (TN). Materials and methods This study conducted a meta-analysis of results reported in 60 peer-reviewed articles to examine the effects of CSA management (GM, CR, and conservation tillage) on crop yield, SOC concentration, and soil TN in Africa. Results and discussion The implementation of CSA practices significantly increased crop yield and SOC concentrations (mean effect 9.2% and 14.7%, respectively), although no significant change was evident in soil TN. In terms of yield increase, GM was the most effective practice, increasing yield by 63.5%, followed by CR (5.8%). Conservation tillage and CR increased SOC by 16.4% and 13%, respectively, but no significant difference was observed with GM. Further analysis suggested that integrating CSA practices (conservation tillage and GM; conservation tillage and CR) had a more pronounced effect on both SOC concentration and yield under lower nitrogen fertilizer levels. Conclusion Our meta-analysis showed that CSA management resulted in higher yields and SOC concentrations, thus suggesting the importance of CSA practices in enhancing food production and climate mitigation in Africa. It also highlights the potential of the integration of CSA practices to improve SOC and TN pools and consequently crop productivity.","[Kichamu-Wachira, Edith; Xu, Zhihong; Biggs, Duan; Omidvar, Negar] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Environm Futures Res Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Reardon-Smith, Kathryn] Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Appl Climate Sci, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [Wachira, Geoffrey] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; University of Southern Queensland; University of Queensland,"Kichamu-Wachira, E (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Environm Futures Res Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",edith.kichamu@griffithuni.edu.au,"Xu, Zhihong/B-3223-2009","Xu, Zhihong/0000-0002-6768-0720",Griffith University Postgraduate Research Scholarship; Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship,"Griffith University Postgraduate Research Scholarship(Griffith University); Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science)",We would like to acknowledge the authors of the publications used in this meta-analysis.

As such, the assessment of outdoor perception and comfort during heatwaves has become an important ingredient of successful urban adaptation strategies. However, systematic assessment of long-term thermal perception across a large number of places and large populations of people is difficult. In this study, we consider an approach to the assessment of long-term thermal perception that combines features of currently used approaches (i.e., use of rating scales of thermal perception, use of surveys, and the use of photographs representing places) and we provide some preliminary validation of this approach. Specifically, across three studies conducted in two Czech cities, we show that long-term thermal perceptions for a large sample of 1,856 urban places can be elicited in a large sample of city residents (total N = 1,812) using rating scales in off-site surveys complemented with visual representations of the target locations. In Studies 1 and 2, we partially validate this approach by showing that such long-term thermal perceptions can be traced back to average surface temperature, sky-view factor, and the presence of blue and green infrastructure, all factors that the literature relates to thermal perception. Moreover, we show evidence that observers can reliably glean these properties from the visual representation of places. In Study 3, we provide additional evidence of the predictive validity of such long-term thermal perceptions by showing that they predict place-related activities (waiting and walking) and the place preference of other people more than one year later. Thus, this approach to the measurement of long-term thermal perception related to heatwaves can be a useful addition to currently used approaches.","[Urban, Jan; Pikl, Miroslav; Zemek, Frantisek; Novotny, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, Brno, Czech Republic; [Zemek, Frantisek] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Dept Landscape Management, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Urban, J (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, Brno, Czech Republic.",urban.j@czechglobe.cz,"Urban, Jan/Q-1484-2016","Urban, Jan/0000-0003-3754-459X","Technology Agency of the Czech Republic [TL02000322]; Thermal comfort in urban areas: human perception, physics based reality, role of greenery; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of Czech Republic [LM2018123]","Technology Agency of the Czech Republic; Thermal comfort in urban areas: human perception, physics based reality, role of greenery; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","We would like to thank the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic (project Thermal comfort in urban areas: human perception, physics based reality, role of greenery, grant no.

Climate change is not the least of these concerns. The complexity of these issues is such that data and information management form an important means of making the right decisions. Nowadays, however, the sheer quantity of data is overwhelming; large quantities of data demand means of representation that are comprehensible and effective. The above dilemma poses questions as to how one incorporates unknown climatologic parameters, such as urban heat, in future urban planning processes, and how one ensures the proposals are specific enough to actually adapt cities to climate change and flexible enough to ensure the proposed measures are combinable and compatible with other urban planning priorities. Conventional urban planning processes and mapping strategies are not adapted to this new environmental, technological and social context. In order come up with more appropriate urban planning strategies, in its first section this paper analyzes the role of the urban planner, reviews the wide variety of parameters that are starting to be integrated into the urban planners practice, and considers the parameters (mainly land surface temperature, albedo, vegetation, and imperviousness) and tools needed for the assessment of the UHI (satellite imagery and GIS).

Central to the success of the Plan, commenced in 2012, is the implementation of an Environmentally Sustainable Level of Take (ESLT) and a Sustainable Diversion Limit (SDL) on the volume of water that can be taken for consumptive use. Under the enabling legislation, the Water Act (2007), the ESLT and SDL must be set by the best available science. In 2009, the volume of water to maintain wetlands and rivers of the Basin was estimated at 3000-7600 GL per year. Since then, there has been a steady step-down in this volume to 2075 GL year due to repeated policy adjustments, including supply measures projects, building of infrastructure to obtain the same environmental outcomes with less water. Since implementation of the Plan, return of water to the environment is falling far short of targets. The gap between the volume required to maintain wetlands and rivers and what is available is increasing with climate change and other risks, but the Plan makes no direct allowance for climate change. We present policy options that address the need to adapt to less water and re-frame the decision context from contestation between water for irrigation versus the environment. Options include best use of water for adaptation and structural adjustment packages for irrigation communities integrated with environmental triage of those wetlands likely to transition to dryland ecosystems under climate change.","[Colloff, Matthew J.; Pittock, Jamie] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"Colloff, MJ (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",Matthew.Colloff@anu.edu.au; jamie.pittock@anu.edu.au,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Colloff, Matthew/B-7398-2009; Pittock, Jamie/N-1541-2018","Colloff, Matthew/0000-0002-3765-0627; Pittock, Jamie/0000-0001-6293-996X",,,,,78,8,8,1,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JAN,2022,14,2,,,,,,,208,10.3390/w14020208,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14020208,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,YS3IN,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000750574100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Traditional hard or grey engineering solutions are proving both expensive and inflexible in the face of a rapidly changing coastal environment. Hybrid solutions that incorporate natural, nature-based, structural, and non-structural features may better achieve a broad set of goals such as ecological enhancement, long-term adaptation, and social benefits, but broad consideration and uptake of these approaches has been slow. One barrier to the widespread implementation of hybrid solutions is the lack of a relatively quick but holistic evaluation framework that places these broader environmental and societal goals on equal footing with the more traditional goal of exposure reduction. To respond to this need, the Adaptive Gradients Framework was developed and pilot-tested as a qualitative, flexible, and collaborative process guide for organizations to understand, evaluate, and potentially select more diverse kinds of infrastructural responses. These responses would ideally include natural, nature-based, and regulatory/cultural approaches, as well as hybrid designs combining multiple approaches. It enables rapid expert review of project designs based on eight metrics called gradients, which include exposure reduction, cost efficiency, institutional capacity, ecological enhancement, adaptation over time, greenhouse gas reduction, participatory process, and social benefits. The framework was conceptualized and developed in three phases: relevant factors and barriers were collected from practitioners and experts by survey; these factors were ranked by importance and used to develop the initial framework; several case studies were iteratively evaluated using this technique; and the framework was finalized for implementation. The article presents the framework and a pilot test of its application, along with resources that would enable wider application of the framework by practitioners and theorists.","[Hamin, Elisabeth M.; Dilthey, Max Roman; Ryan, Robert L.; Buxton, Jane A.; Marin, Marielos Arlen; Fricke, Rebecca] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Landscape Architecture & Reg Planning, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Abunnasr, Yaser] Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Landscape Design & Ecosyst Management, POB 11-0236, Beirut, Lebanon; [Judge, Pamela K.] Roger Williams Univ, Sch Engn Comp & Construct Management, Bristol, RI 02809 USA; [Kenney, Melissa A.; Sutton-Grier, Ariana E.] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Kenney, Melissa A.; Sutton-Grier, Ariana E.] Univ Maryland, Cooperat Inst Climate & Satellites Maryland, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Kirshen, Paul] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Environm, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Sheahan, Thomas C.] Northeastern Univ, Coll Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [DeGroot, Don J.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [McAdoo, Brain G.] Yale NUS Coll, Environm Studies, Singapore 138610, Singapore; [Nurse, Leonard] Univ West Indies Cave Hill, Ctr Resources Management & Environm Studies, BB-11000 Cave Hill, Barbados; [Albright, Elizabeth A.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; American University of Beirut; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; Northeastern University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Yale NUS College; University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Cave Hill Campus; Duke University,"Hamin, EM (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Landscape Architecture & Reg Planning, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",emhamin@umass.edu; ya20@aub.edu.lb; mdilthey@gmail.com; pjudge@rwu.edu; kenney@umd.edu; paul.kirshen@umb.edu; tsheahan@northeastern.edu; degroot@umass.edu; rlryan@umass.edu; brian.mcadoo@yale-nus.edu.sg; leonard.nurse@cavehill.uwi.edu; jane.a.buxton@gmail.com; ariana.suttongrier@gmail.com; elizabeth.albright@duke.edu; marielosmari@umass.edu; rfricke@umass.edu,"Kenney, Melissa A/H-6426-2014; Kenney, Melissa A/AAI-4736-2021","Kenney, Melissa A/0000-0002-2121-8135; Kenney, Melissa A/0000-0002-2121-8135; Sutton-Grier, Ariana/0000-0002-1242-7728; Abunnasr, Yaser/0000-0003-2997-7176; Judge, Pamela/0000-0002-8443-7829","NSF Research Collaboration Network (RCN): Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability (SEES), Project title: Sustainable Adaptive Gradients in the Coastal Environment (SAGE): Reconceptualizing the Role of Infrastructure in Resilience [ICER-1338767]; USDA Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station Grant [MAS00458]","NSF Research Collaboration Network (RCN): Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability (SEES), Project title: Sustainable Adaptive Gradients in the Coastal Environment (SAGE): Reconceptualizing the Role of Infrastructure in Resilience; USDA Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station Grant","This project is supported by the NSF Research Collaboration Network (RCN): Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability (SEES), Project title: Sustainable Adaptive Gradients in the Coastal Environment (SAGE): Reconceptualizing the Role of Infrastructure in Resilience Award Number: ICER-1338767 and USDA Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station Grant MAS00458.

In Switzerland, residential cooling has so far only a small impact on the national energy demand, but climate change and a larger uptake of cooling devices are expected to lead to future increases. This requires novel approaches for sustainable cooling solutions suitable for implementation at a national scale. Here, we explore the potential of night ventilation and window shading to reduce the buildings cooling demand in a changing climate. A physical bottom-up approach is used to simulate residential space cooling demand and to identify the passive cooling potential whilst considering a detailed representation of the Swiss building stock, featuring building age, construction properties, regional climate, urban layout and occupant behaviour. A supervised building type classification approach is applied to enable up-scaling to the national level. Results show that in 2050, the residential Swiss building stock will require a national cooling demand of around 10.2 TWh for a Representative Concentration Pathway scenario 4.5. Under such future climatic conditions, we simulated a potential to reduce the total cooling demand by 84%, with both passive cooling solutions combined. Individually, window shading could reduce cooling demands by 71% and night ventilation by 38%.

This case study evaluates how drills inform institutional responses to slow-onset disasters. It spotlights Guatemala, a country where drought has severe impacts on livelihoods and the food security of small farmers. By implementing part of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food's institutional response plan for drought, it explores how drills can help to detect issues in emergency response and to foster an institutional focus on improvements in preparedness. The results reveal that drills alone do not trigger institutional improvements if unsupported by a wider strategy that seeks to enhance capacities and protocols.

Quantitative assessments of vulnerability are rare because available frameworks are complex and lack guidance for dealing with data limitations and integrating across scales and disciplines. This paper describes a semi-quantitative method for assessing vulnerability to climate change that integrates socio-ecological factors to address management objectives and support decision making. The method applies a framework first adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and uses a structured 10-step process. The scores for each framework element are normalized and multiplied to produce a vulnerability score and then the assessed components are ranked from high to low vulnerability. Sensitivity analyses determine which indicators most influence the analysis and the resultant decision-making process so data quality for these indicators can be reviewed to increase robustness. Prioritisation of components for conservation considers other economic, social and cultural values with vulnerability rankings to target actions that reduce vulnerability to climate change by decreasing exposure or sensitivity and/or increasing adaptive capacity. This framework provides practical decision-support and has been applied to marine ecosystems and fisheries, with two case applications provided as examples: (1) food security in Pacific Island nations under climate-driven fish declines, and (2) fisheries in the Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia. The step-wise process outlined here is broadly applicable and can be undertaken with minimal resources using existing data, thereby having great potential to inform adaptive natural resource management in diverse locations.","[Johnson, Johanna E.] C2O Coasts Climate Oceans, Cairns 4870, Australia; [Johnson, Johanna E.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Cairns 4870, Australia; [Welch, David J.] C2O Fisheries, Cairns 4870, Australia; [Welch, David J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Maynard, Jeffrey A.] SymbioSeas & Marine Appl Res Ctr, Wilmington, NC 28411 USA; [Maynard, Jeffrey A.] CRIOBE, CNRS,EPHE, USR 3278, Lab dExcellence,CORAIL, Papetoai, Moorea, France; [Bell, Johann D.] Secretariat Pacific Community, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Pecl, Gretta] Univ Tasmania, Fisheries & Aquaculture Ctr, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Pecl, Gretta] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Robins, Julie] Agri Sci Queensland, Dept Agr & Fisheries, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Saunders, Thor] Northern Terr Dept Primary Ind & Fisheries, Darwin, NT 0800, Australia; [Bell, Johann D.] Univ Wollongong, Australian Natl Ctr Ocean Resources & Secur, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",James Cook University; James Cook University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania; Queensland Department of Agriculture & Fisheries; University of Wollongong,"Johnson, JE (corresponding author), C2O Coasts Climate Oceans, Cairns 4870, Australia.;Johnson, JE (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Cairns 4870, Australia.",johanna.johnson@jcu.edu.au; d.welch@c2o.net.au; maynardmarine@gmail.com; b.johann9@gmail.com; Gretta.Pecl@utas.edu.au; Julie.Robins@daf.qld.gov.au; thor.saunders@nt.gov.au,"Johnson, Johanna/Y-6099-2019; Pecl, Gretta/D-7267-2011","Johnson, Johanna/0000-0003-0539-5542; Pecl, Gretta/0000-0003-0192-4339; Bell, Johann/0000-0003-2152-536X; Maynard, Dr Jeffrey/0000-0002-6444-6373",Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority; Secretariat of the Pacific Community; Australian AID; Australian Fisheries Management Authority; Protected Zone Joint Authority; Australian Government's Fisheries Research and Development Corporation [2013/0014]; Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency; European Research Commission Marie Curie Actions Fellowship; ARC Future Fellowship,Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority; Secretariat of the Pacific Community; Australian AID(CGIAR); Australian Fisheries Management Authority; Protected Zone Joint Authority; Australian Government's Fisheries Research and Development Corporation(Fisheries R&D Corp); Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency; European Research Commission Marie Curie Actions Fellowship; ARC Future Fellowship(Australian Research Council),"Funding for this study and the case applications was provided by these institutions and programs: Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Secretariat of the Pacific Community, Australian AID, Australian Fisheries Management Authority and Protected Zone Joint Authority, Australian Government's Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (grant 2013/0014) and Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency.

Urban design guidance of a water network with a thermal environment as the starting point is a design control path that takes into account geographical features, climatic conditions and urban construction under complex constraints. Based on the current block division and development intensity, this study of the thermal environment of Xiantao adopts the methods of multiple linear regression and wind-thermal environment simulation. The results show that regional agglomeration shows the spatial distribution of the urban thermal environment in the water network area. The distribution of hot sensitive areas is closely related to the pattern of clusters. The business district, high-density urban area, basic energy facility area and transportation hub are the thermal environment areas. The experimental results show that residential and industrial land, proportion of water area, average elevation and urban development intensity are the main factors influencing the thermal environment of the water network, and the strengths of their effects are in the order of development intensity > water area proportion > industrial land proportion > residential land proportion > average elevation. The urban thermal environment of the dynamic construction area can be inferred. The improvement of urban wind and thermal environment quality is implemented in the urban space level by guiding the construction intensity, ventilation, greening and water, and paving and shading of the thermal environment control area. The exploration of the thermal environment improvement method in the urban design of a water network region provides the guidance for similar cities seeking to cope with climate change.

Water resilience or, inversely, vulnerability depends on design specifications of the storm and inundation, against which water infrastructure and environmental assets are planned and operated. These design attributes are commonly derived from statistical modeling of historical measurements. Here we argue for the need to carefully examine the approach and associated design vulnerability in coastal areas because of the future hydroclimatic changes and large variability at local coastal watersheds. This study first shows significant spatiotemporal variations of design storm in the Chesapeake Bay of the eastern U.S. Atlantic coast, where the low-frequency high-intensity precipitations vary differently to the tropical cyclones and local orographic effects. Average and gust wind speed exhibited much greater spatial but far less temporal variability than the precipitation. It is noteworthy that these local variabilities are not fully described by the regional gridded precipitation used in CMIP5 climate downscaling and by NOAA' s regional design guide Atlas-14. Up to 46.4% error in the gridded precipitation for the calibration period 1950-1999 is further exacerbated in the future design values by the ensemble of 132 CMIP5 projections. The total model projection error (delta(M)) up to -61.8% primarily comes from the precipitation regionalization (delta(1)), climate downscaling (delta(2)), and a fraction from empirical data modeling (delta(E)). Thus, a post-bias correction technique is necessary. The bias-corrected design wind speed for 10-yr to 30-yr storms has small changes <20% by the year 2100, but contains large spatial variations even for stations of close proximity. Bias-corrected design precipitations are characteristic of large spatial variability and a notable increase of 2-5 year precipitation in the future along western shores of the Lower and Middle Chesapeake Bay. All these accounts point to the potential vulnerability of water infrastructure and water program in coastal areas, when the hydrological design basis using regional values fails to account for significant spatiotemporal precipitation variations in local coastal watersheds.","[Liang, Marissa S.] US EPA, ORD CPHEA, ORISE Postdoctoral Participants, 26W Martin Luther King Dr, Cincinnati, OH 45268 USA; [Julius, Susan] US EPA, ORD CPHEA, 1200 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20460 USA; [Dong, Zhifei] Aptim Inc, Coastal Ports & Marine Div, 2481 NW Boca Raton Blvd, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Neal, Jill; Yang, Y.

Currently in the United States port resilience planning falls primarily on port operators. Engaging a wider range of stakeholders in long-term seaport functioning may reduce risks from disruptive and potentially irreversible impacts of climate change. This study uses empirical data gathered through two case studies of highly exposed U.S. ports, Gulfport (MS) and Providence (RI), to identify strategies that port planners and external stakeholders consider feasible for enhancing their port's resilience.

Communicating these uncertainties is important for decision making on robust adaptation strategies, but proves to be a challenge for scientists particularly because of the complexity of uncertainties that are part of natural variability and of human induced climate change. The aim of this paper is to assess the role of a simulation game, as intermediate, to the communication of climate change uncertainties to water managers. In three workshops with water managers, the simulation game 'Sustainable Delta' was played to test the influence of the game on their understanding of climate change uncertainty using ex ante and ex post surveys. In each workshop an experimental- and control group were given different assignments to measure the influence of the game. The results show that although the differences between groups were not statistically significant, a change in their understanding of uncertainties was observed. The paper concludes that the learning effect of the game is inconclusive, but that the game does fosters a broader understanding of the concept climate change uncertainty. In doing so, simulation games are a promising approach to support the communication of climate change uncertainties meaningfully and support the process of adaptation to an uncertain future.

New types of defects are being observed in air cavities in well-designed and well-built wooden facades and roofs. More knowledge is required on the microclimatic conditions in air cavities and roofs, and their implications for organic growth and biological deterioration. The present study collects and presents sensor data from three buildings in Norway. Collected air temperature, air humidity, and wood moisture data are compared to mould growth criteria found in scientific literature, building physics software, and national and international standards. The data shows great differences in air cavity microclimates between the case buildings and between different sensor positions within the instrumented air cavities. Air cavity temperatures are found to be lower than exterior temperatures for a substantial portion of the time. For tall buildings, the vertical positioning of a sensor influences the data more than the orientation of the facade. All three buildings feature monitoring positions with both acceptable and critically high levels of moisture to indicate mould risk. There is great variation in the estimated risk of mould growth according to the different criteria.

Climate change will further exacerbate this situation over the coming decades unless effective interventions are implemented. Evaluating the efficacy of alternative interventions in a complex system experiencing major cumulative impacts can only be achieved through a systems modelling approach. We have evaluated combinations of interventions using a coral reef meta-community model. The model consisted of a dynamic network of 3753 reefs supporting communities of corals and CoTS connected through ocean larval dispersal, and exposed to changing regimes of tropical cyclones, flood plumes, marine heatwaves and ocean acidification. Interventions included reducing flood plume impacts, expanding control of CoTS populations, stabilizing coral rubble, managing solar radiation and introducing heat-tolerant coral strains. Without intervention, all climate scenarios resulted in precipitous declines in GBR coral cover over the next 50 years. The most effective strategies in delaying decline were combinations that protected coral from both predation (CoTS control) and thermal stress (solar radiation management) deployed at large scale. Successful implementation could expand opportunities for climate action, natural adaptation and socioeconomic adjustment by at least one to two decades.","[Condie, Scott A.; Baird, Mark E.; Gorton, Rebecca; Hobday, Alistair J.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Condie, Scott A.; Hobday, Alistair J.; Plaganyi, Eva E.] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Anthony, Kenneth R.

The research has focussed on conceptualising and measuring the current capacity of cattle producers to adopt new strategies so as to better adapt to the impacts of climate change. The capacity to adapt is defined as comprising four essential elements: (i) managing risk and uncertainty, (ii) possessing strategic skill sets such as planning, experimenting, refining and learning, (iii) psychological and financial buffers, and (iv) an interest in change. However, there appears to be a lack of sufficient capacity currently existing within the industry to meet the challenges of the future: only 16% of producers are regarded to be sufficiently adaptive. Research also highlights that adaptive capacity can be enhanced, and here we highlight those factors that are known to influence adaptive capacity either positively or negatively. Producers with strong networks and trust in informal and formal connections, a strong locus of control, larger properties, a focus on profitability, and use technology, are more likely to persist within the industry through time. We propose that investing in the capacity of producers to better cope and adapt to change is a most logical approach to ensuring both the sustainability of the industry and of the rangelands. A range of strategies are proposed that may enhance adaptive capacity.","[Marshall, Nadine A.] James Cook Univ, CSIRO, Land & Water, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); James Cook University,"Marshall, NA (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, CSIRO, Land & Water, ATSIP Bldg, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",nadine.marshall@csiro.au,"Marshall, Nadine/D-9339-2011","Marshall, Nadine/0000-0003-4463-3558",,,,,48,13,13,0,13,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1036-9872,1834-7541,,RANGELAND J,Rangeland J.,,2015,37,6,,,SI,,617,622,,10.1071/RJ15054,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RJ15054,,,6,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CZ4UZ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000367099600009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Exterior vapour-permeable thermal insulation is used in countries with cold climates to enable outward drying. However, its effect is not well documented when combined with a dimpled membrane. A laboratory experiment was performed to investigate the outward drying of concrete walls and to generate data for the validation of hygrothermal simulations. Two wall segments with vapour-permeable insulation and exterior dimpled membranes were compared with a segment having a dimpled membrane positioned between the concrete and exterior insulation. The segments were subjected to a steady warm interior and a cold exterior climate in a climate simulator. Weight change, precipitated condensation, and temperature data were monitored for six months. Although the weights varied nonuniformly at the start, they decreased uniformly during the last four months; they exhibited the same rate and variations of weight change. No precipitated condensation occurred in the air gaps, although the moisture content of the concrete was high and the driving potential for diffusion (temperature gradient) was large. Results indicate that the concrete's ability to transfer moisture to the drying surface limits outward drying. Hence, the vapour permeability of the insulation and the membrane position were less influential. The moisture transfer properties of concrete currently used in basements should be investigated to better predict the long-term moisture performance of products and solutions for basements.","[Asphaug, Silje; Hjermann, Ingrid; Kvande, Tore] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Time, Berit] SINTEF Community, Dept Architecture Mat & Struct, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Asphaug, S (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",silje.asphaug@sintef.no,,"Kvande, Tore/0000-0003-0522-9974; Asphaug, Silje Kathrin/0000-0001-7014-3064",Research Council of Norway; Centre for Research-based Innovation 'Klima 2050' [237859],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Centre for Research-based Innovation 'Klima 2050',"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Research Council of Norway and several partners through the Centre for Research-based Innovation `Klima 2050' (Grant No 237859) (see www.klima2050.no).We would like to extend special thanks to Ole Aunronning, Egil Rognvik, Oystein Holmberg, Odne Oksavik, Simon Alexander Hagen, Frode Dalsaune, and Jonny Tverdal for their help and support with the laboratory work, to CAD operator Remy Eik for drawing Fig. 1, to Erlend Andenaes for writing assistance, and to Fukt & Dreneringsteknikk AS for providing thermal insulation to the permeable wall.",,41,1,1,5,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

Collaborative decision making and adaptive management (CAM) have been promoted as methods to reconcile competing societal demands and respond to complex ecosystem dynamics. We detail the experiences of land managers and stakeholders in using CAM at Las Cienegas National Conservation Area (LCNCA), a highly valued site under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The CAM process at Las Cienegas is marked by strong stakeholder engagement, with four core elements: (1) shared watershed goals with measurable resource objectives; (2) relevant and reliable scientific information; (3) mechanisms to incorporate new information into decision making; and (4) shared learning to improve both the process and management actions. The combination of stakeholder engagement and adaptive management has led to agreement on contentious issues, more innovative solutions, and more effective land management. However, the region is now experiencing rapid changes outside managers' control, including climate change, human population growth, and reduced federal budgets, with large but unpredictable impacts on natural resources. Although the CAM experience provides a strong foundation for making the difficult and contentious management decisions that such changes are likely to require, neither collaboration nor adaptive management provides a sufficient structure for addressing the externalities that drive uncontrollable and unpredictable change. As a result, LCNCA is exploring two specific modifications to CAM that may better address emerging challenges, including: (1) creating nested resource objectives to distinguish between those objectives that may be crucial to maintaining ecological resilience from those that may hinder a flexible response to climate change, and (2) incorporating scenario planning into CAM to explore how climate change may interact with other drivers and alter options for the future, to identify robust management actions, and to prioritize ecological monitoring efforts. The experiences at LCNCA demonstrate how collaboration and adaptive management can be used to improve social and environmental outcomes and, with modifications, may help address the full range of complexity and change that threatens to overwhelm even the best efforts to sustain public lands.","[Caves, Jeremy K.] Stanford Univ, Dept Environm Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bodner, Gitanjali S.] Nature Conservancy, Tucson, AZ USA; [Simms, Karen] Univ Arizona, Bur Land Management, Tucson Field Off, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Fisher, Larry A.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Robertson, Tahnee] Southwest Decis Resources, Tucson, AZ USA",Stanford University; Nature Conservancy; University of Arizona; University of Arizona,"Caves, JK (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Environm Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,"Rugenstein, Jeremy Caves/I-4743-2015","Rugenstein, Jeremy Caves/0000-0003-4123-3305",Nature Conservancy; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship; Bureau of Land Management; U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution,Nature Conservancy; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Bureau of Land Management; U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution,"This project is an outgrowth of 20 years of hand-wringing, stumbling, celebration, and joy.

Cattle producers regularly contend with climate variability, but the consequences of this variability are less well understood than for cropping systems. A retrospective analysis of US Department of Agriculture AgCensus data was conducted to assess the extent to which climate variability (1978-2017) has affected the spatial and temporal distribution of beef cow numbers throughout the Great Plains. Cow numbers were remarkably stable, declining only 3.1% between 1978 and 2017. However, beef production increased 30% during this period, in response to a steady increase in live animal slaughter weight. Cownumbers decreased during droughts in the late 1980s and the early 2010s but recovered before the subsequent 5-yr census. Cow numbers decreased 5.1%, 8.8%, and 4.0% in the Northern, Central, and Southern Plains, respectively, between the 1982 and 1987 censuses, even though annual precipitation only decreased in the Northern Plains. The reduction in cow numbers during the 2010s drought, which is assumed to portend future extreme droughts, was greatest in the Southern Plains (- 17.6%) followed by the Central (- 11%) and Northern Plains (- 4.9%), compared with the 2007 census. The relative increase in beef cow numbers in the Northern Plains may represent an emerging signal of climate variability on rangeland beef production. This may be a consequence of weaker correlations between cow numbers and mean annual precipitation and temperature established by lower mean annual temperatures in the Northern Plains. This retrospective analysis indicates that continued climatewarming and drying will adversely affect rangeland beef production, it identifies a large knowledge gap between climate variability and sustainable rangeland beef production, and it provides a reference to begin assessing the vulnerability of rangeland beef cattle production in future climates.

However, we still lack a clear understanding of the quantitative contribution rate and underlying mechanism of typical urban landscapes to urban heat dynamics, especially in seasonal and diurnal patterns. Here we used a thermal infrared camera and portable meteorological instruments to examine the sensible heat flux (SHF) changes of five typical urban landscapes in Beijing based on surface temperature and concurrent microclimate conditions. Diurnal and seasonal variations of SHF were quantified by comparing changes in forenoon and afternoon in different seasons. Results showed that (1) walls and roads act as heat-source, while forests and water act as heat-sink in all seasons; however, grassland served as heat-sink in summer and spring-autumn, but it becomes a heat-source in winter. (2) The seasonal variation of sensible heat flux of the wall is the greatest, followed by water, while that of trees is the smallest. Besides, the highest sensible heat flux and the maximum variation among typical urban landscapes occur between noon and 2:00 pm. (3) The numerical contribution rate of typical landscapes to sensible heat flux varies with daytime (forenoon and afternoon) and seasonal changes, and these ratios can be used as parameters to adjust the numerical models to obtain more reliable results in surface-energy-flux-related studies. The results of this study can provide a reference for explaining controversial findings based on remote-sensing data, and provide insights into revealing the sensible heat flux mechanism of typical urban landscapes and cooling energy conservation in cities.","[Yu, Zhaowu; Chen, Tingting; Sun, Ranhao; Xie, Wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Yu, Zhaowu; Yang, Gaoyuan; Vejre, Henrik] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Sci, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Yu, Zhaowu] Shanghai Key Lab Urban Ecol Proc & Ecorestorat, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Tingting] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci, Hefei 230022, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES); University of Copenhagen; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Sun, RH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.;Yu, ZW (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Urban Ecol Landscape Ecol & Climate Adapt Plannin, Copenhagen, Denmark.",zhyu@ign.ku.dk; rhsun@rcees.ac.cn,", Zhaowu/E-8032-2016; Xie, Wei/GSE-2765-2022; Gaoyuan, Yang/HKO-4087-2023; sun, ranhao/AAM-6837-2021; Vejre, Henrik/P-7142-2014",", Zhaowu/0000-0003-4576-4541; Xie, Wei/0000-0001-9787-6057; sun, ranhao/0000-0003-2396-5131; Yang, Gaoyuan/0000-0001-9735-6529; Vejre, Henrik/0000-0002-6820-0389",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41922007]; State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology of China [SKLURE2019-2-6]; Shanghai Key Lab for Urban Ecological Processes and Eco-Restoration [SHUES2019A01]; WEL Visiting Fellowship Program,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology of China; Shanghai Key Lab for Urban Ecological Processes and Eco-Restoration; WEL Visiting Fellowship Program,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 41922007); Open Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology of China (grant no.

The study demonstrates furthermore that the vulnerability of people and buildings to the urban heat island effect is a local condition in which the energy efficiency of buildings, quality of life and demographic factors should all be considered in an approach that is sensitive to place. Practical application: The typological maps will allow local authorities to prioritise adaptive actions in urban planning in response to the urban heat island, an emerging climate-related challenge that has a significant impact on the comfort and health of its citizens and on the (future) energy use required for cooling buildings. Raising the albedo in those areas of the city that are dominated by impervious surface cover seems an effective adaptation strategy, suitable to a city such as Amsterdam that no longer builds on green field sites but only builds as possible within the envelope of the existing city. Improving the quality of life in neighbourhoods and the energy efficiency/climate proofing of the building stock could also be prioritised in the identified neighbourhoods.","[van der Hoeven, Frank; Wandl, Alexander] Delft Univ Technol, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"van der Hoeven, F (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands.",f.d.vanderhoeven@tudelft.nl,"van der Hoeven, Franklin D./C-7228-2011; Wandl, Alexander/S-1374-2019","van der Hoeven, Franklin D./0000-0001-9308-0828; Wandl, Alexander/0000-0003-1163-0529",city of Amsterdam (DienstRuimtelijkeOrdening),city of Amsterdam (DienstRuimtelijkeOrdening),Financial support was provided by the city of Amsterdam (DienstRuimtelijkeOrdening).,,18,28,29,4,58,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0143-6244,1477-0849,,BUILD SERV ENG RES T,Build Serv.

Using a multi-method approach, we provide insights on both basic and specialised climate information utilised by a range of public and private sector tourism decision-makers in the most tourismdependent region in the world - the Caribbean. We also examined whether existing climate information meets tourism destination planning, marketing and operational decision-making needs and how the tourism industry could more effectively and efficiently integrate climate information to enhance sector performance. Results from research with 47 Caribbean hoteliers and tourism policy-makers show that short-term destination and source market weather information are widely consulted, but the use of historical climate information and longer-term climate forecasts is comparatively lower. There are few tailored climate information products and services, and uptake of the few that exist is low. Current climate information inadequately fulfills decision-makers' needs due to a number of challenges, including a short history of engagement between the climate and tourism communities, along with a partial understanding of the needs and preferences of tourism stakeholders. Evidence suggests that a new generation of specialised climate information products can enhance climate risk management amongst tourism suppliers. Further research and relationship building will be needed to support the coproduction and uptake of tailored climate information for the Caribbean tourism sector. Tourism-dependent Small Island Developing States in other regions interested in pursuing climate services for tourism can learn from the experience and approach used in the Caribbean.","[Mahon, Roche; Petrie, Jodi-Ann; Trotman, Adrian; Van Meerbeeck, Cedric J.] Caribbean Inst Meteorol & Hydrol, Husbands, St James, Barbados; [Eyzaguirre, Jimena; Burrowes, Ravidya] ESSA Technol Ltd, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Matthews, Lindsay] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Ctr Ctr Climate Serv, Gatineau, PQ, Canada; [Charles, Amanda] Caribbean Tourism Org, St Michael, Barbados",Environment & Climate Change Canada,"Mahon, R (corresponding author), Caribbean Inst Meteorol & Hydrol, Husbands, St James, Barbados.",rmahon@cimh.edu.bb,,,United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) Programme for Building Regional Climate Capacity in the Caribbean (BRCCC Programme) [AID-538-10-14-00001]; Caribbean Tourism Organization (CTO) under the African Caribbean Pacific-European Union-Caribbean Development Bank-Natural Disaster Risk Management in CARIFORUM Countries programme (NDRM) [GA 177/REG],United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) Programme for Building Regional Climate Capacity in the Caribbean (BRCCC Programme)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Caribbean Tourism Organization (CTO) under the African Caribbean Pacific-European Union-Caribbean Development Bank-Natural Disaster Risk Management in CARIFORUM Countries programme (NDRM),"This research was funded by the United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) Programme for Building Regional Climate Capacity in the Caribbean (BRCCC Programme) (USAID, Grant ID: AID-538-10-14-00001) with the generous support of the American people.

Currently available unit cost estimates have a limited empirical basis. This article presents new information on the unit costs of adapting coastal defences for three specific case studies in low-lying delta regions: The Netherlands, New Orleans, and Vietnam. Typical measures include dikes, flood walls, storm surge barriers, and nourishment. These unit cost estimates are significantly higher than earlier estimates that are still the main source of costs for global vulnerability assessments. Factors affecting these unit costs include local economic factors (material and labour costs), design choices related to the alignment of the system, and the types of measures for implementation of the system in an urban or rural environment. On the basis of an example for a Dutch sea dike, it is shown that the material quantities and associated costs are expected to rise linearly, in the case of depth-limited wave breaking, for the range of sea-level rise rates that are expected in the coming century. However, other factors, such as increasing costs for implementation of wider coastal defences in an urban environment and future changes in material and labour costs, could contribute to a nonlinear increase of the costs. Further collection and analysis of project information for coastal defence projects in other regions is recommended to strengthen the empirical basis of the cost estimates that are used for regional and global assessments.","[Jonkman, Sebastiaan N.; Kanning, Wim; van Ledden, Mathijs] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Sect Hydraul Engn, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands; [Hillen, Marten M.; van Ledden, Mathijs] Royal HaskoningDHV, Business Line Rivers Deltas & Coasts, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Nicholls, Robert J.] Univ Southampton, Sch Civil Engn & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; Deltares, NL-2629 HD Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; University of Southampton; Deltares,"Jonkman, SN (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Sect Hydraul Engn, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands.",s.n.jonkman@tudelft.nl,"Nicholls, Robert James/G-3898-2010; Nicholls, Robert James/ABD-1481-2020","Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109; Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109; Jonkman, Sebastiaan/0000-0003-0162-8281","U.K. Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC)/Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra) through the AVOID programme; National Science Foundation (NSF) under EFGRI [0836047]","U.K. Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC)/Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra) through the AVOID programme; National Science Foundation (NSF) under EFGRI(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was funded by the U.K. Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC)/Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra) through the AVOID programme on avoiding dangerous climate change.

Traditionally, UHI studies are based on satellite observations, which are limited in their spatial resolution. Little is known about how the biophysical contributions are composed at micro-scale (some meters) and how they interact. Here we suggest an entropy concept for the heat storage cycle, reducing the complexity of the system and improving the understanding of resulting hysteresis. The entropy framework was applied to different surface types based on micrometeorological simulations (3 m x 3 m horizontal resolution) that are validated by an airborne thermal scan. In addition to the effects of reduced convection and evapotranspiration we found that heat storage can make a very dominant UHI contribution locally proceeding in entropy loops, where steep slopes and maximally symmetrically closed loop areas are optimal for achieving a balance between heat storage and release. The characteristics of the entropy cycles help suggest new and optimised strategies to attenuate urban heat episodes and we present a stepwise procedure (workflow) for the application of this method.","[Hertel, Daniel; Schlink, Uwe] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Urban & Environm Sociol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Hertel, D (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Urban & Environm Sociol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",daniel.hertel@ufz.de,,,Helmholtz-Climate-Initiative; Helmholtz Associations Initiative and Networking Fund,Helmholtz-Climate-Initiative; Helmholtz Associations Initiative and Networking Fund,D.H. is funded by the Helmholtz-Climate-Initiative.

The evaluation is frequently based on setpoint temperatures and hours of operation. However, these fixed parameters are not suitable for social housing simulation as their performance tends to be in free running, excluding extremely cold or warm conditions. Therefore, a more successful assessment for the efficiency of these buildings is the users' capability to live within adaptive comfort ranges without air conditioning systems. The aim of this research is to analyze new Chilean standards for sustainable social housing in the context of climate change using the adaptive comfort approach addressed in EN 15251:2007. Using EnergyPlus simulation software, 16 parametric series are analyzed for current conditions and validated against on-site measurements. Meanwhile, a prediction for the climate in 2050 has also been taken into account. The case study is the most widespread low cost dwelling model. The study demonstrates that the period of time within thermal comfort conditions varies substantially if analysis is done using the adaptive comfort standard or the Sustainable Construction Code (CCS) for Chilean housing. Considering climate change, the percentage of time fluctuates from -19.00% to 24.30%. Concluding that the adaptive comfort model has a greater capacity to positively assess indoor temperatures for social housing in Central-Southern Chile. This research also establishes that it is possible to provide homes where standards are improved within comfort conditions without using artificial means, 99.67% of the time currently and 88.89% in the future.","[Rubio-Bellido, Carlos] Univ Seville, Higher Tech Sch Bldg Engn, Dept Bldg Construct 2, Seville, Spain; [Perez-Fargallo, Alexis; Pulido-Arcas, Jesus A.] Univ Bio Bio, Fac Architecture Construct & Design, Dept Bldg Sci, Concepcion, Chile; [Trebilcock, Maureen] Univ Bio Bio, Fac Architecture Construct & Design, Dept Architectural Theory & Design, Concepcion, Chile",University of Sevilla; Universidad del Bio-Bio; Universidad del Bio-Bio,"Rubio-Bellido, C (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Higher Tech Sch Bldg Engn, Dept Bldg Construct 2, Seville, Spain.",carlosrubio@us.es,"Rubio-Bellido, Carlos/K-1861-2014; Pérez, Alexis/K-1975-2014; Arcas, Jesús Alberto Pulido/AAY-3362-2021; Trebilcock, Maureen E/C-7148-2011; Pulido Arcas, Jesús Alberto/T-2129-2017","Rubio-Bellido, Carlos/0000-0001-6719-8793; Pérez, Alexis/0000-0001-7071-7523; Arcas, Jesús Alberto Pulido/0000-0002-7956-2203; Trebilcock, Maureen E/0000-0002-1984-0259; Pulido Arcas, Jesús Alberto/0000-0002-7956-2203",FONDECYT - Chilean National Commission for Research in Science and Technology [3160806],FONDECYT - Chilean National Commission for Research in Science and Technology,The authors belong to the Sustainable Architecture and Construction Research Group (GACS) at the University of the Bio-Bio and would like to acknowledge that this paper is part of the FONDECYT research project 3160806 Study of the feasible energy improvement standard for social housing in fuel poverty by means of post occupational adaptive comfort assessment and its progressive implementation funded by the Chilean National Commission for Research in Science and Technology.,,40,22,22,0,28,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"B605D, XUE YAN BUILDING, BEIJING, 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",1996-3599,1996-8744,,BUILD SIMUL-CHINA,Build.

Karst.) and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) in greenhouses with 20 degreesC day and 10 degreesC night temperatures. Different combinations of photoperiod and stage of development were created by repeating sowing five times with 2 week intervals during the summer. During the experiment light conditions were natural but the daily temperature sum accumulation was regulated to be constant. Eight origins of spruce and seven origins of birch from different latitudes (60-67degreesN) in Finland were used. In the first growing season both Norway spruce and silver birch seedlings from the first sowings required a longer time for growth cessation than seedlings from the later sowings. However, because the seedlings from the first sowings ceased their growth on an earlier calendar date, the night length at the time of growth cessation was shorter for the seedlings from the first sowings. The results suggest. that the variation in the timing of growth cessation of Norway spruce and silver birch seedlings during the first growing season was explained jointly by night length and stage of development. Seedlings from northern origins stopped their growth with shorter night length than those from southern origins. The effects of latitude and average temperature sum of the original growing site on the critical night length of growth cessation in the first growing season were stronger in Norway spruce than in silver birch. In the second growing season the sowing time did not affect the timing of the formation of the terminal buds, but slightly affected the timing of height growth cessation of Norway spruce and silver birch seedlings.

This paper details the findings from an international review of state-of-the-art knowledge concerning climate risks, and adaptation responses, for ports and their supply chains. Evidence from both academic and gray literature indicates that there has already been major damage and disruption to ports across the world from climate-related hazards and that such impacts are projected to increase in the years and decades to come. Findings indicate that while a substantial-and growing-body of scientific evidence on coastal risks and potential adaptation options is acting as a stimulus for port authorities to explicitly consider the risks for their assets and operations, only a notable few have actually made the next step toward implementing adaptation strategies. This paper concludes by putting forward constructive recommendations for the sector and suggestions for research to address remaining knowledge gaps. It emphasizes a call for collaboration between the research and practice communities, as well as the need to engage a broad range of stakeholders in the adaptation planning process.

With high levels of saltwater intrusion into coastal lands, innovative brackish water aquaculture (BWA) including integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) are crucial adaptation options to the expanding marine waters. This article examines how poor Bangladeshi coastal residents view BWA, and what is needed to make BWA a viable and sustainable livelihood for the coastal poor. In sites that are affected by major salinity intrusion, we used a semi-structured questionnaire to interview 120 households. We examine three questions: (1) What kind of aquaculture is currently being undertaken in brackish/saline/coastal waters? (2) Do poor coastal residents see BWA (and, by implication the hitherto fairly unknown IMTA) as a viable and sustainable livelihood? (3) What is needed to make BWA a feasible and promising livelihood in Bangladesh?

Their knowledge on ecosystem-based aquaculture was scarce and their views of aquaculture were related mainly to previous experiences with shrimp monoculture and its polarizing socio-economic effects.

This organism possesses a reversible leaf opening and closing mechanism that responds to water and salt stress (hydronastic movement). We adopted a problem-based biomimetic methodology in three stages: (i) two observation studies; (ii) how to abstract and develop a parametric model to simulate the leaf movement; and (iii) experiments with bimetal, a smart material that curls up when heated. We added creases to the bimetal active layer in analogy to the position of bulliform cells. These cells determine the leaf-closing pattern. The experiments demonstrated that creases influence and can change the direction of the bimetal natural movement. Thus, it is possible to replicate the Ammophila arenaria leaf-rolling mechanism in response to temperature variation and solar radiation in the bimetal. In future works, we will be able to propose responsive facade solutions based on these results.","[Brito de Andrade, Tarciana Araujo; Dinis Cabral Beirao, Jose Nuno] Univ Lisbon, Fac Arquitetura, Ctr Invest Arquitetura Urbanismo & Design CIAUD, P-1349063 Lisbon, Portugal; [Vieira de Arruda, Amilton Jose] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Programa Posgrad Design PPGDesign, BR-290 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Cruz, Cristina] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Dept Plant Biol, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco; Universidade de Lisboa,"de Andrade, TAB (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Arquitetura, Ctr Invest Arquitetura Urbanismo & Design CIAUD, P-1349063 Lisbon, Portugal.",andrade.tarci@gmail.com; jnb@fa.ulisboa.pt; amilton.arruda@ufpe.br; ccruz@fc.ul.pt,"; Beirao, Jose/H-3649-2016","Cruz, Cristina/0000-0003-3100-463X; Beirao, Jose/0000-0003-4743-6082",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [SFRH/BD/144910/2019]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/144910/2019] Funding Source: FCT,Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia,"This work was supported by the Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT), SFRH/BD/144910/2019.",,38,2,2,2,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4360,,POLYMERS-BASEL,Polymers,AUG,2021,13,15,,,,,,,2554,10.3390/polym13152554,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/polym13152554,,,17,Polymer Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Polymer Science,TW1KU,34372158,"Green Accepted, Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000682169100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Internal climate variability, for example, is an inherent uncertainty in the climate system that is undersampled by the multimodel ensembles used in most climate impacts research. Because of this, decision makers are left with the question of whether the range of climate projections across models is due to structural model choices, thus requiring more scientific investment to constrain, or instead is a set of equally plausible outcomes consistent with the same warming world. Similarly, many questions faced by scientists require a clear separation of model uncertainty and that arising from internal variability. With this as motivation and the renewed attention to large ensembles given planning for Phase 7 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP7), we illustrate the scientific and policy value of the attribution and quantification of uncertainty from initial condition large ensembles, particularly when analyzed in conjunction with multimodel ensembles. We focus on how large ensembles can support regional-scale robust adaptation decision-making in ways multimodel ensembles alone cannot. We also acknowledge several recently identified problems associated with large ensembles, namely, that they are (1) resource intensive, (2) redundant, and (3) biased. Despite these challenges, we show, using examples from hydroclimate, how large ensembles provide unique information for the scientific and policy communities and can be analyzed appropriately for regional-scale climate impacts research to help inform risk management in a warming world. Plain Language Summary Estimating uncertainties in projections of climate change poses challenges but is crucial to focusing scientific and policy efforts. Initial condition large ensembles (the same model run many times with the same set of assumptions) has revealed that irreducible uncertainty arising from natural variations in the climate system-called internal variability-can be larger and more persistent than expected when compared to the set of models typically used in climate impacts assessments. Because of this, some argue that the large magnitude of internal variability presents a challenge to effective adaptations in response to climate change. Here we show using examples from water management that characterizing internal variability, even if it is large and irreducible, is the means to more effective decision-making, pointing to the importance of initial condition large ensembles in this effort. We also discuss the criticisms of large ensembles: that they are costly, redundant, and biased. We show that despite these challenges, large ensembles provide unique information that is consistent with the insights from decision science about how to position effective decisions under conditions of deep uncertainty.","[Mankin, Justin S.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Geog, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Mankin, Justin S.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY 10964 USA; [Lehner, Flavio] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Lehner, Flavio] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Coats, Sloan] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Coats, Sloan] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Earth Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [McKinnon, Karen A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Stat, Los Angeles, CA USA; [McKinnon, Karen A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA USA",Dartmouth College; Columbia University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Mankin, JS (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Geog, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.;Mankin, JS (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY 10964 USA.",mankin@dartmouth.edu,"; Mankin, Justin/N-2979-2017","McKinnon, Karen/0000-0003-3314-8442; Mankin, Justin/0000-0003-2520-4555; Lehner, Flavio/0000-0003-4632-9701",Swiss NSF [PZ00P2_174128]; NSF Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences [AGS-0856145]; Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) component of the Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program of the U.S.Department of Energy's Office of Biological & Environmental Research (BER) via NSF [IA 1844590],Swiss NSF(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); NSF Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences; Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) component of the Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program of the U.S.Department of Energy's Office of Biological & Environmental Research (BER) via NSF,"We thank two anonymous reviewers, Noah Diffenbaugh, and Fran Moore for helpful discussions, as well as the participants of the U.S. CLIVAR Large Ensemble Workshop held at NCAR in July 2019.

With 7000 kilometers of coastline, the vast Himalayan glaciers, and nearly 70 million hectares of forests, India is especially vulnerable to warmer temperatures, erratic precipitation, higher seas, and swifter storms. Then there are India's cities, where all of these trends threaten public health and safety on a grand scale-portending heat waves, drought, thicker smog, coastal storms, and blown-out sewers. Yet, my travels on the subcontinent revealed glints of hope, cities thrown on the ropes by climate change, but effectively fighting back. One is Surat-India's bustling, no-nonsense city, near the Arabian Sea. There I spoke with city officials, business leaders, and public health experts. I perused the aeration basins of a water treatment plant, climbed the floodgates of a major river embankment, and threaded my way through a township built to replace a flood-prone slum. I even toured a diamond-polishing facility that turns out to be very relevant to this climate story. In sum, Surat is making impressive progress that other cities in the developing world can surely learn from. While the city seems poised for prosperity, its fortune depends on its ability to improve flood control, protect public health, and expand access to safe housing. Success in Surat requires disaster justice. Before entering the city, we will first examine the threat posed by climate change in the Global South and its relationship to disaster, along the way sorting out a series of justice-oriented concerns related to climate, disaster, and the environment. Because disaster justice emphasizes the role of unequal vulnerabilities among social groups, we will next consider the relationship between such social vulnerabilities and the concept of justice. We will see what other cities in the world might learn from India's Diamond Capital.","[Verchick, Robert R. M.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Verchick, Robert R.

Natural resource managers face the complex task of conserving these important resources under unprecedented conditions and expanding uncertainty. As once familiar ecological conditions disappear, traditional management approaches that assume the future will reflect the past are becoming increasingly untenable. In the present article, we place adaptive management within the resist-accept-direct (RAD) framework to assist informed risk taking for transforming ecosystems. This approach empowers managers to use familiar techniques associated with adaptive management in the unfamiliar territory of ecosystem transformation. By providing a common lexicon, it gives decision makers agency to revisit objectives, consider new system trajectories, and discuss RAD strategies in relation to current system state and direction of change. Operationalizing RAD adaptive management requires periodic review and update of management actions and objectives; monitoring, experimentation, and pilot studies; and bet hedging to better identify and tolerate associated risks.","[Lynch, Abigail J.] US Geol Survey USGS, Natl Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Reston, VA 20192 USA; [Thompson, Laura M.] USGS Natl Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Knoxville, TN USA; [Thompson, Laura M.] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN USA; [Morton, John M.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv USFWS, Anchorage, AK USA; [Morton, John M.] Alaska Wild Alliance, Anchorage, AK USA; [Beever, Erik A.] USGS Northern Rocky Mt Sci Ctr, Bozeman, MT USA; [Beever, Erik A.] Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT USA; [Clifford, Michael] Nature Conservancy, Las Vegas, NV USA; [Limpinsel, Douglas] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Anchorage, AK USA; [Magness, Dawn R.] USFWS Kenai Natl Wildlife Refuge, Soldotna, AK USA; [Melvin, Tracy A.] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Newman, Robert A.] Univ North Dakota, Biol Dept, Grand Forks, ND USA; [Porath, Mark T.] USFWS Ecol Serv Nebraska Field Off, Wood River, NE USA; [Rahel, Frank J.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Rahel, Frank J.] Univ Wyoming, Program Ecol, Laramie, WY USA; [Reynolds, Joel H.] US Natl Pk Serv NPS Climate Change Response Progr, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Schuurman, Gregor W.] NPS Climate Change Response Program, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Sethi, Suresh A.] Cornell Univ, USGS New York Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, New York, NY USA; [Wilkening, Jennifer L.] USFWS Nat Resource Program Ctr, Branch Air & Water Resources, Ft Collins, CO USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Michigan State University; University of North Dakota Grand Forks; University of Wyoming; University of Wyoming; Cornell University,"Lynch, AJ (corresponding author), US Geol Survey USGS, Natl Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Reston, VA 20192 USA.",ajlynch@usgs.gov,"Lynch, Abigail J./H-5059-2019; Thompson, Laura/GSD-7827-2022","Lynch, Abigail J./0000-0001-8449-8392; Wilkening, Jennifer/0000-0001-8748-4578",,,,,94,18,18,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0006-3568,1525-3244,,BIOSCIENCE,Bioscience,JAN,2022,72,1,,,,,45,56,,10.1093/biosci/biab091,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biab091,,NOV 2021,12,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,YH9JF,,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000743475000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

To understand the countermeasures applied in local farmhouses to mitigate the effect of wind attacks, features of historical housing and land lot layouts from the Meiji Era (1868-1912) were studied and interviews with local villagers and craftsmen were conducted. It was found that a significant majority of houses were built along the wind direction, with a closed front facade. Contrariwise, subsidiary structures, such as storage buildings and retirement houses, were placed perpendicularly to the wind direction, forming wind fences to protect the front yards, which served as agricultural workspaces. The features of spatial composition have been explained by local craftsmen as technical countermeasures; according to them, farmhouses were built on an incline of about 3-5 cm into the wind direction to mitigate deformation of timber structure. The study suggests that spatial composition of vernacular farmhouses and building techniques could offer effective strategies for sustainable rural planning and be employed to enhance the wind resistance of modern timber constructions, especially for regions prone to powerful prevailing winds worldwide.","[Wang, Jingying; Ochiai, Chiho] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Kyoto, Japan",Kyoto University,"Wang, JY (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Room 461,Gen Res Bldg 3, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",wangjingying22@gmail.com,,,Research Institute for Humanity and Nature [14200103],Research Institute for Humanity and Nature,This work was supported by the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature [No. 14200103] -Research and Social Implementation of Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction as Climate Change Adaptation in Shrinking Societies.,,36,0,0,1,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1346-7581,1347-2852,,J ASIAN ARCHIT BUILD,J.

Specifically, we analyze area burned and fire frequency in the IMW over time, how fires in urban or rural settings influence local economies and whether fire trends and economic impacts influence managers' perspectives and adaptive decision-making. Our analyses showed some increasing fire trends at multiple levels. Using a non-parametric event study model, we evaluated the effects of fire events in rural and urban areas on county-level private industry employment, finding short- and long-term positive effects of fire on employment at several scales and some short-term negative effects for specific sectors. Through interviewing 20 fire managers, we found that most recognize increasing fire trends and that there are both positive and negative economic effects of fire.

This study examines 175 municipal plans from the 50 most populous cities in the United States to understand which aspects of urban heat are included or not in city plans and what factors explain inclusion. We find that a majority of plans mention heat, but few include strategies to address it and even fewer cite sources of information. The term 'extreme heat event' (EHE) is significantly more likely to be paired with institutional actions as a part of hazard planning, while 'urban heat island' (UHI) is more likely to be paired with green and grey infrastructure interventions as a part of general planning. Disparity and thermal comfort framings are not significantly related to any solutions and are used least. Plan type, followed by environmental networks (e.g. C40, Urban Sustainability Directors Network, Rockefeller 100 Resilient Cities), explain variation in plan content; social and environmental context do not. Findings point to the emergence of two independent heat governance systems, EHE and UHI, and several gaps in heat planning: integration, specificity, solutions, disparity, economy, and thermal comfort.","[Turner, V.

One solution to these challenges is to create an extra blue water retention layer underneath the green layer. Blue-green roofs allow more stormwater to be stored, and the reservoir can act as a water source for the green layer throughout capillary rises. An automated valve regulates the water level of the system. It can be opened to drain water when extreme precipitation is expected. Therefore, the water buffer capacity of the system during extreme rainfall events can be maximised by integrating precipitation forecasts as triggers for the operation of the valve. However, the added value of this forecast-based operation is yet unknown. Accordingly, in this study, we design and evaluate a hydrological blue-green roof model that utilises precipitation forecasts. We test its performance to capture (extreme) precipitation and to increase evapotranspiration and evaporative cooling under a variety of precipitation forecast-based decision rules. We show that blue-green roofs can capture between 70 % and 97 % of extreme precipitation (>20 mm/h) when set to anticipate ensemble precipitation forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). This capture ratio is considerably higher than that of a conventional green roof without extra water retention (12 %) or that of a blue-green roof that does not use forecast information (i.e., valve always closed; 59 %). Moreover, blue-green roofs allow for high evapotranspiration rates relative to potential evapotranspiration on hot summer days (around 70 %), which is higher than from conventional green roofs (30 %). This serves to underscore the higher capacity of blue-green roofs to reduce heat stress. Using the city of Amsterdam as a case study, we show the high upscaling potential of the concept: on average, potentially suitable flat roofs cover 13.3 % of the total area of the catchments that are susceptible to pluvial flood risk. If the 90th percentile of the ECMWF forecast is used, an 84 % rainfall capture ratio can translate into capturing 11 % of rainfall in flood-prone urban catchments in Amsterdam.","[Busker, Tim; de Moel, Hans; Haer, Toon; Schmeits, Maurice; van den Hurk, Bart; Myers, Kira; Aerts, Jeroen] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Schmeits, Maurice] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, NL-3731 GA De Bilt, Netherlands; [van den Hurk, Bart; Aerts, Jeroen] Deltares, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands; [Cirkel, Dirk Gijsbert] KWR Water Res Inst, NL-3433 PE Nieuwegein, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Deltares,"Busker, T (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",tim.busker@vu.nl,"van den Hurk, Bart/ABI-1654-2020","van den Hurk, Bart/0000-0003-3726-7086; Schmeits, Maurice/0000-0002-0433-0774; Busker, T.S./0000-0001-7860-9762; de Moel, Hans/0000-0002-6826-1974; Haer, Toon/0000-0001-6172-2793",RESILIO; European Regional Development Fund through the Urban Innovative Actions Initiative,RESILIO; European Regional Development Fund through the Urban Innovative Actions Initiative,"This work is based on data from ECMWF and TIGGE, retrieved using the Meteorological Archival and Retrieval System (MARS).

Environmental impacts depend on the dimensions, design and proportions of the system in relation to the size of the surface water, as well as the characteristics of the water system (currents, tidal effects) and climatic conditions. There is often no time (and budget) for thorough research into these effects on ecology and water quality. A few studies have addressed the potential impacts of floating solar panels, but often rely on models without validation with in situ data. In this work, water quality sensors continuously monitored key water quality parameters at two different locations: (i) underneath a floating solar park; (ii) at a reference location positioned in open water. An underwater drone was used to obtain vertical profiles of water quality and to collect underwater images. The results showed little differences in the measured key water quality parameters below the solar panels. The temperature at the upper layers of water was lower under the solar panels, and there were less detected temperature fluctuations. A biofouling layer on the floating structure was visible in the underwater images a few months after the construction of the park.","[de Lima, Rui L. Pedroso; C.

However, the possibility of alternative visions of development is seldom contemplated. Instead, adaptation research usually assumes monolithic claims about development constructed from the status quo of global capitalism. This paper outlines a critical approach to adaptation and explores the interplay between visions of development, governance structures, and strategies to cope with hurricanes in the Mexican Caribbean, a region at the 'front line' of both globalization and climatic extreme phenomena. Critical adaptation formulates the experiencing of hazards as essentially political and tied to contingent development paths, which may eventually become hegemonic. Over a hundred semi-structured and open interviews were held in Cancun, Mahahual, Playa del Carmen, and Tulum including academics, businesspeople, bureaucrats, journalists, non-governmental organizations and tourism workers in order to characterize development visions in the Mexican Caribbean. Findings show a prevalent hegemonic vision supporting mass tourism growth which encourages hurricane coping strategies based on effective evacuation and attracting investments for rapid economic recovery. The actual implementation of this vision increases social inequalities, degrades ecosystems, and amplifies overall exposure to extreme events. Mass tourism is enforced by undemocratic governance structures sustained by a coalition of government and tourism corporations (a government-capital bloc in Gramsci's sense). Some weak signs of counter-hegemony were identified in Playa del Carmen, Tulum and Mahahual. These isolated episodes of resistance might have triggered alternative coping strategies despite having little effect in altering the overall course of development. Further critical research is needed to unveil the socio-political foundations of development visions and their influence on capacities to cope with climatic extreme events. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Where this information is not presently used it is difficult to evaluate the impact it might have. In order to justify disseminating the information to marginal groups it is important that the potential impact of the forecast is explored so that the negative and positive effects are at least partially appreciated before use of the information is widely promoted. We use an agent-based social simulation model, based on empirical evidence from field work in Lesotho, to assess the impact of using seasonal forecasts among smallholder farmers. The impact of using the forecast depends on the agents' initial household characteristics, what options they choose in responding to the forecast and the trust they place in the forecast (which in turn depends on their ability to learn and to follow their neighbours). Interaction of climate, crop productivity and social factors determines how much household-agents benefit or lose, evaluated in terms of crop yields and likelihood of exhausting food storage. Adoption of the forecast has the potential to decrease starvation among marginal household-agents but poor forecasts may do more harm than good. This work suggests that if forecasts are not correct more than 60-70% of the time, then they are unlikely to benefit poor farmers. Poor forecasts, or forecasts that fail badly, when they do fail, lead to longer adoption timescales for forecast use. Further investigation into the impact of the forecast at the village level is encouraged before dissemination is actively pursued without appreciating potential impacts. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We assess the effects of three agricultural adaptation strategies to climate change in terms of potential blue water savings. We then evaluate to what extent these savings can reduce unsustainable blue WF. We find that cereal production increases under climate change in both irrigated and rainfed croplands (by 2.6-3.1 and 1.4-2.3 million t yr(-1), respectively) due to increased yields (6.6%-78.7%). Simultaneously, the unit WF (m(3) t(-1)) tends to decrease in most scenarios. However, the annual consumptive water use increases in both irrigated and rainfed croplands (by 0.3-1.8 and 0.5-1.7 billion m(3) yr(-1), respectively). This is most noticeable in the arid regions, where consumptive water use increases by roughly 70% under climate change. Off-season cultivation is the most effective adaptation strategy to alleviate additional pressure on blue water resources with blue water savings of 14-15 billion m(3) yr(-1). The second most effective is WF benchmarking, which results in blue water savings of 1.1-3.5 billion m(3) yr(-1). The early planting strategy is less effective but still leads to blue water savings of 1.7-1.9 billion m(3) yr(-1). In the same order of effectiveness, these three strategies can reduce blue water scarcity and unsustainable blue water use in Iran under current conditions. However, we find that these strategies do not mitigate water scarcity in all provinces per se, nor all months of the year.","[Karandish, Fatemeh] Univ Zabol, Water Engn Dept, Zabol, Iran; [Karandish, Fatemeh; Schyns, Joep F.] Univ Twente, Fac Engn Technol, Multidisciplinary Water Management, Enschede, Netherlands; [Nouri, Hamideh] Univ Gottingen, Div Agron, Gottingen, Germany",University of Twente; University of Gottingen,"Karandish, F (corresponding author), Univ Zabol, Water Engn Dept, Zabol, Iran.;Karandish, F (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Fac Engn Technol, Multidisciplinary Water Management, Enschede, Netherlands.",f.karandish@uoz.ac.ir,,,European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (Earth@lternatives project) [834716],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (Earth@lternatives project)(European Research Council (ERC)),"F.

This growing risk is particularly acute in Asian coastal mega-cities, many of which have yet to develop adequate adaptation policies to address plausible impacts of climate change. In this analysis, we review how Hong Kong and Singapore, two of the most affluent coastal cities in East Asia, have initiated many flood mitigation strategies policies that have allowed them to reduce the impacts flooding. These strategies, once relying largely on building flood control structures, have now evolved to include holistic flood risk management approaches that include socio-economic factors. Arguably these two success stories provide inspiration for other coastal Asian cities. However, as climate change and uncontrolled development are likely to increase urban flooding in the future, general improvements could be made to improve knowledge transfer: e.g., develop means to work across policy silos and strike compromises between conflicting sectoral responsibilities, and develop long-term integrated strategies using planning tools and practices to address growing risk. While knowledge transfer cannot be direct because of different geographical settings, socio-economic situations, and political situations, we encourage governments to look beyond engineering-based flood control structures as to develop flood governance programs.

This creates an opportunity to deal with recent challenges of urban development. However, questions remain on how to assess and manage these services as well as to transfer the opportunities which present themselves into planning procedures. Since urban planning is mainly about land use decisions, approaches are required that describe and evaluate ESS in relation to the typologies and procedures of urban planners. ESS depend on the structural parameters of urban green spaces. In order to facilitate the analysis and evaluation of these parameters, a method has been sought to enable the detailed identification of ESS on the basis of urban vegetation structures. The so-called urban vegetation structure type (UVST) approach is based on the mapping of urban biotope types as well as an analysis of terrestrial and aerial photographs. It enables the identification and description of all areas within a city characterized by vegetation according to type, size, structural characterization as well as density, structure and building type. The analysis of vegetation structures and the determination of patterns of greenery were realized for the map of the urban biotope types of the City of Dresden, Germany. This led to the identification of 57 UVSTs, distinguished in terms of the level of soil-sealing, structure and type of building as well as the structure and amount of vegetation. By applying these UVSTs, average values for the amount of green space, the green volume and the proportion of sealed surface for the entire city as well as for urban districts can be determined. This provides a solid basis upon which to investigate diverse ESS and assess the ecological quality of urban structures. Climate change models predict that average temperatures are to rise. As densely built-up urban areas are particularly affected by such warming effects, planners need to take account of climate data in urban planning processes. An analysis of micro-climatic effects is offered by this paper as an example for the application of the introduced approach, particularly aimed at illustrating the differences between various urban vegetation structures concerning their micro-climatic effects. Selected results of climate modelling are presented, confirming clear differences in the micro-climatic effects of several UVSTs, both at city and urban-district level. The UVST approach is also appropriate for case studies concerning the micro-climatic impact of changes in land use at the urban-district level. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Though the magnitude and trajectory of climate change are becoming clearer, our understanding of how these changes reshape terrestrial life zones-distinct biogeographic units characterized by biotemperature, precipitation, and aridity representing broad-scale ecosystem types-is limited. To address this gap, we used high-resolution historical climatologies and climate projections to determine the global distribution of historical (1901-1920), contemporary (1979-2013), and future (2061-2080) life zones. Comparing the historical and contemporary distributions shows that changes from one life zone to another during the 20th century impacted 27 million km(2) (18.3% of land), with consequences for social and ecological systems. Such changes took place in all biomes, most notably in Boreal Forests, Temperate Coniferous Forests, and Tropical Coniferous Forests. Comparing the contemporary and future life zone distributions shows the pace of life zone changes accelerating rapidly in the 21st century. By 2070, such changes would impact an additional 62 million km(2) (42.6% of land) under business-as-usual (RCP8.5) emissions scenarios. Accelerated rates of change are observed in hundreds of ecoregions across all biomes except Tropical Coniferous Forests. While only 30 ecoregions (3.5%) had over half of their areas change to a different life zone during the 20th century, by 2070 this number is projected to climb to 111 ecoregions (13.1%) under RCP4.5 and 281 ecoregions (33.2%) under RCP8.5. We identified weak correlations between life zone change and threatened vertebrate richness, levels of vertebrate endemism, cropland extent, and human population densities within ecoregions, illustrating the ubiquitous risks of life zone changes to diverse social-ecological systems. The accelerated pace of life zone changes will increasingly challenge adaptive conservation and sustainable development strategies that incorrectly assume current ecological patterns and livelihood provisioning systems will persist.","[Elsen, Paul R.; Grantham, Hedley S.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Global Conservat Program, Bronx, NY 10460 USA; [Elsen, Paul R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI USA; [Saxon, Earl C.; Ward, Michelle; Williams, Brooke A.; Perez-Hammerle, Katharina-Victoria; Reside, April E.; Watson, James E.

Among these stresses, drought is one of the main factors limiting crop productivity and its impact is likely to increase under current scenarios of global climate change. We sought to determine to what extent wild common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) exhibited adaptation to drought stress, whether this potential adaptation is dependent on the climatic conditions of the location of origin of individual populations, and to what extent domesticated common bean reflects potential drought adaptation. Methods An extensive and diverse set of wild beans from across Mesoamerica, along with a set of reference Mesoamerican domesticated cultivars, were evaluated for root and shoot traits related to drought adaptation. A water deficit experiment was conducted by growing each genotype in a long transparent tube in greenhouse conditions so that root growth, in addition to shoot growth, could be monitored. Results Phenotypic and landscape genomic analyses, based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms, suggested that beans originating from central and north-west Mexico and Oaxaca, in the driest parts of their distribution, produced more biomass and were deeper-rooted. Nevertheless, deeper rooting was correlated with less root biomass production relative to total biomass. Compared with wild types, domesticated types showed a stronger reduction and delay in growth and development in response to drought stress. Specific genomic regions were associated with root depth, biomass productivity and drought response, some of which showed signals of selection and were previously related to productivity and drought tolerance. Conclusions The drought tolerance of wild beans consists in its stronger ability, compared with domesticated types, to continue growth in spite of water-limited conditions. This study is the first to relate bean response to drought to environment of origin for a diverse selection of wild beans. It provides information that needs to be corroborated in crosses between wild and domesticated beans to make it applicable to breeding programmes.","[Berny-Mier y Teran, Jorge C.; Konzen, Eneas R.; Medina, Viviana; Palkovic, Antonia; Ariani, Andrea; Gilbert, Matthew E.; Gepts, P.] Univ Calif Davis, Sect Crop & Ecosyst Sci, Dept Plant Sci, Mail Stop 1,1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Konzen, Eneas R.; Tsai, Siu M.] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Energia Nucl Agr CENA, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Konzen, Eneas R.] Univ Estado Santa Catarina, Ctr Ciencias Agrovet, Lages, SC, Brazil; [Ariani, Andrea] Bayer CropSci NV, Innovat Ctr, Technol Pk 38, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium",University of California System; University of California Davis; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina; Bayer AG; Bayer CropScience,"Gepts, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Sect Crop & Ecosyst Sci, Dept Plant Sci, Mail Stop 1,1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",plgepts@ucdavis.edu,"Konzen, Eneas R/J-4474-2016; Tsai, Siu Mui/C-2793-2012; Konzen, Enéas Ricardo/AAR-4489-2021; Gepts, Paul/O-8229-2019","Konzen, Eneas R/0000-0001-5176-7410; Tsai, Siu Mui/0000-0002-3733-6312; Konzen, Enéas Ricardo/0000-0001-5176-7410; Gepts, Paul/0000-0002-1056-4665; Berny Mier y Teran, Jorge C./0000-0003-3709-9131; Ariani, Andrea/0000-0002-3356-5329","Henry Jastro Graduate Research Award from the Plant Sciences Department at UC Davis; Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) Competitive Grant from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2013-67013-21224]; NIFA [577414, 2013-67013-21224] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",Henry Jastro Graduate Research Award from the Plant Sciences Department at UC Davis; Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) Competitive Grant from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),We would like to thank Steve Silva and Andrew Hutchinson for assistance in the greenhouse facility and Jose Polania for suggestions on the screening methods.

Engineering solutions (e.g. seawalls and breakwaters) in response to protecting coastal communities and associated infrastructure are increasingly becoming economically and ecologically unsustainable. This has led to recommendations to create or restore natural habitats, such as sand dunes, saltmarsh, mangroves, seagrass and kelp beds, and coral and shellfish reefs, to provide coastal protection in place of (or to complement) artificial structures. Coastal managers are frequently faced with the problem of an eroding coastline, which requires a decision on what mitigation options are most appropriate to implement. A barrier to uptake of nature-based coastal defence is stringent evaluation of the effectiveness in comparison to artificial protection structures. Here, we assess the current evidence for the efficacy of nature-based vs. artificial coastal protection and discuss future research needs. Future projects should evaluate habitats created or restored for coastal defence for cost-effectiveness in comparison to an artificial structure under the same environmental conditions. Cost-benefit analyses should take into consideration all ecosystem services provided by nature-based or artificial structures in addition to coastal protection. Interdisciplinary research among scientists, coastal managers and engineers is required to facilitate the experimental trials needed to test the value of these shoreline protection schemes, in order to support their use as alternatives to artificial structures. This research needs to happen now as our rapidly changing climate requires new and innovative solutions to reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities to an increasingly uncertain future.","[Morris, Rebecca L.; Swearer, Stephen E.] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Natl Ctr Coasts & Climate, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Konlechner, Teresa M.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Natl Ctr Coasts & Climate, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Ghisalberti, Marco] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Morris, RL (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Natl Ctr Coasts & Climate, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",rebecca.morris@unimelb.edu.au,"Ghisalberti, Marco/C-6202-2008; SWEARER, STEPHEN/AAC-1527-2020; Swearer, Stephen/X-4882-2018; Morris, Rebecca/AAB-3364-2020","Ghisalberti, Marco/0000-0002-6690-8922; SWEARER, STEPHEN/0000-0001-6381-9943; Swearer, Stephen/0000-0001-6381-9943; Morris, Rebecca/0000-0003-0455-0811","National Environmental Science Program, Australian Government; Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub by the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Programme","National Environmental Science Program, Australian Government; Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub by the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Programme","National Environmental Science Program, Australian Government; The National Centre for Coasts and Climate is funded through The Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub by the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Programme",,135,174,177,40,424,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The aim of this paper is to determine water, energy and greenhouse gas emission savings from resource-efficient household stock using empirical water end-use data and detailed stock specifications for homes in Queensland, Australia. Hot water system type is considered with comparisons made between intervention scenarios with and without inclusion of a low energy heating system. The results confirm the significant impact that coal-fired electricity water heating has on total household energy consumption. Further, it appears that substantial savings can be achieved by substituting water (e.g. high star rating appliances) and energy (e.g. solar hot water system) efficient appliances in the home. The findings also suggest that retrofitting cheaper resource-efficient technologies are still an effective means of reducing both water and energy consumption, regardless of hot water system type.

When making climate sensitive decisions, policy makers and adaptation planners would benefit from information on local scales and for user-specific quantiles (e. g. the hottest/coldest 5% of days) and thresholds (e. g. days above 28 degrees C), not just mean changes. Here, we translate observations of weather into observations of climate change, providing maps of the changing shape of climatic temperature distributions across Europe since 1950. The provision of such information from observations is valuable to support decisions designed to be robust in today's climate, while also providing data against which climate forecasting methods can be judged and interpreted. The general statement that the hottest summer days are warming faster than the coolest is made decision relevant by exposing how the regions of greatest warming are quantile and threshold dependent. In a band from Northern France to Denmark, where the response is greatest, the hottest days in the temperature distribution have seen changes of at least 2 degrees C, over four times the global mean change over the same period. In winter the coldest nights are warming fastest, particularly in Scandinavia.","[Stainforth, David A.] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Stainforth, David A.; Watkins, Nicholas W.] London Sch Econ, Ctr Anal Timeseries, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Stainforth, David A.; Chapman, Sandra C.; Watkins, Nicholas W.] Univ Warwick, Dept Phys, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Chapman, Sandra C.] Univ Tromso, Dept Math & Stat, NO-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Watkins, Nicholas W.] British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [Stainforth, David A.] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Warwick; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC British Antarctic Survey; University of Oxford,"Stainforth, DA (corresponding author), London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",d.a.stainforth@lse.ac.uk,"Watkins, Nick/GPX-7439-2022; Watkins, Nicholas Wynn/C-5140-2008; Chapman, Sandra/C-2216-2008","Watkins, Nick/0000-0003-4484-6588; Watkins, Nicholas Wynn/0000-0003-4484-6588; Chapman, Sandra/0000-0003-0053-1584","Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment; Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; ESRC; Munich Re; UK STFC; EPSRC; NERC; BAS as part of the British Antarctic Survey Polar Science for Planet Earth Programme; UK NERC; EPSRC [EP/D062837/1, EP/H02395X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [bas0100026, NE/G015392/1] Funding Source: UKRI; STFC [ST/F00205X/1, ST/I000720/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/D062837/1, EP/H02395X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G015392/1, bas0100026] Funding Source: researchfish; Science and Technology Facilities Council [ST/F00205X/1, ST/I000720/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment; Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Munich Re; UK STFC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); BAS as part of the British Antarctic Survey Polar Science for Planet Earth Programme; UK NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); STFC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Science and Technology Facilities Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC)),"We acknowledge the E-OBS dataset from the EU-FP6 project ENSEMBLES (http://ensembles-eu.metoffice.com) and the data providers in the EC&D project (http://eca.knmi.nl).

However, we still lack appropriate methods to describe it, especially considering the interaction between UHIs and the role of connectivity (network). Specifically, previous studies paid much attention to the raster and vector perspective-based on standard landscape configuration metrics that only provide an overall statistic over the entire study area without further indicating locations where different types of pattern and fragmentation occur. Therefore, by reverse thinking, here we attempt to propose a new method from the graph perspective which integrates morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA)-which is used to characterize binary patterns with emphasis on connections between their parts as measured at varying analysis scales, and habitat availability indices to evaluate and mitigate regional surface UHI. We selected the Pearl River Delta Metropolitan Region (PRDR), one of the most rapidly urbanized regions in the world as the case study (1995-2015). The results of the case study showed: (1) the core (UHI) type accounts for the vast majority of the MSPA model, with the relative land surface temperature (LST) rises, the proportion of the core type will increase, and it could influence the edge (UHI) type significantly; (2) the branch, bridge, and islet (UHI) types have similar results to the lower temperature (4 < Relative LST <= 6) area and account for the majority, indicating that these types are more susceptible to their surrounding environment; (3) the importance and extreme importance area (node) from 1995 to 2015 have increased significantly and mainly distributed in the urbanized areas, which means cooling measures need to be implemented in these areas in order of priority. Shifting the research logic of UHI evaluation and mitigation from patch to network, we hold the point that the method (reverse thinking) has significant theoretical and practical implications for mitigating regional UHI and urban climate-resilience.","[Yu, Zhaowu] Fudan Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Songhu Rd 2005, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jinguang; Yang, Gaoyuan] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Fac Sci, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Schlaberg, Juliana] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Environm Sci, D-01062 Dresden, Germany",Fudan University; University of Copenhagen; Technische Universitat Dresden,"Yu, ZW (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Songhu Rd 2005, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China.",zhaowu_yu@fudan.edu.cn; jizh@ign.ku.dk; gy@ign.ku.dk; juliana.schlaberg@mallbox.tu-dresden.de,"Gaoyuan, Yang/HKO-4087-2023; , Zhaowu/E-8032-2016",", Zhaowu/0000-0003-4576-4541; Yang, Gaoyuan/0000-0001-9735-6529; Zhang, Jinguang/0000-0003-4696-5652",Open Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology of China [SKLURE2019-2-6],Open Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology of China,This research was funded by the Open Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology of China (grant no.

Research to better understand the impacts of, and response to, climate shocks is critical to improve the resilience and well-being of affected people and places. This paper builds on the findings of a focus collection on this topic to provide a concluding and forward-looking perspective on the future of social-ecological research on climate resilience. Drawing on an expert workshop to identify research gaps, we distinguish 20 priorities for future research on climate resilience. These span four key themes: Systems and Scales, Governance and Knowledge, Climate Resilience and Development, and Sectoral Concerns. Given the need and urgency for evidence-based policies to address the climate crisis, the analysis considers the importance of understanding how findings on social-ecological resilience are used in policy, rather than solely focusing on how it is generated. Many of the priorities emphasise the governance systems within which climate research is produced, understood and used. We further reflect on the state of current evidence generation processes, emphasising that the involvement of a wider range of voices in the design, implementation and dissemination of climate resilience research is critical to developing the efficient and fair interventions it is meant to support.","[Beauchamp, Emilie] Int Inst Environm & Dev, 80-86 Grays Inn Rd, London WC1X 8NH, England; [Beauchamp, Emilie; Milner-Gulland, E.

Managers will have to decide which dykes to reinforce, which to realign or remove, and where to restore wetlands. These decisions will have important impacts on the ecosystem services provided by different landscapes and the beneficiaries who use them. Cultural ecosystem services (CES) are non-material benefits that play a significant role in human-nature relationships. Previous research in the region has indicated strong local dykeland attachments and CES but provided little insight about tidal wetland uses and values. Using the Kings County region as a study area, we identify CES provided by the area through text analysis of Instagram data and map the CES using the SolVES model combined with environmental data. Revealed differences in CES delivery from agricultural dykelands and tidal wetlands provide spatial insight for coastal planning. The results show that agricultural dykelands have a higher supply capacity for cultural heritage/diversity, education and knowledge systems and social relations and relational values; tidal wetlands have a higher supply capacity for sense of place and terroir. For aesthetics, inspiration and art, and recreation and tourism, the two landscapes are comparable in delivery. In the small proportion of the two landscapes where CES are modelled as being present they often overlap, demonstrating multifunctionality, with an average of 1.4 services provided by a given area of agricultural dykelands and 2.6 services by tidal wetlands.","[Zhao, Qiqi] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Qiqi; Chen, Yan; Wells, Emily; Margeson, Keahna; Sherren, Kate] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Studies, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Chen, Yan; Gone, Keshava Pallavi] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Informat, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Gone, Keshava Pallavi] Dalhousie Univ, Fac Comp Sci, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Margeson, Keahna] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Planning, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Zhao, Qiqi] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Oceanog Sci, 163 Xianlin Ave, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University; Dalhousie University; Dalhousie University; Dalhousie University; Dalhousie University; Nanjing University,"Zhao, QQ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Oceanog Sci, 163 Xianlin Ave, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",dg1927048@smail.nju.edu.cn,,,"China Scholarship Council (CSC) [202106190085]; program B for Outstanding PhD candidate of Nanjing University [202202B030]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada through Insight Grant [435-2018-1018, 2018-2022]; NS Research and Innovation Graduate Scholarship; SSHRC Canada Graduate Scholarship-Masters and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada Strategic Partnership Grant for Networks ResNet [OCN-110-7]; Ocean Graduate Excellence Network; Ocean Frontiers Institute; National Research Council [435-2021-0221]; SSHRC Insight Grant;  [CRSNG NETGP 523374-18]",China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); program B for Outstanding PhD candidate of Nanjing University; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada through Insight Grant; NS Research and Innovation Graduate Scholarship; SSHRC Canada Graduate Scholarship-Masters and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada Strategic Partnership Grant for Networks ResNet(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Ocean Graduate Excellence Network; Ocean Frontiers Institute; National Research Council; SSHRC Insight Grant; ,"QZ is funded by China Scholarship Council (CSC) No.202106190085.

The main goal is to attenuate the maximum indoor temperature during summer and/or heat waves. The system, which is modular, consists of a certain mass of encaged phase change material (PCM) that stays indoors during the daytime and is transported to the outdoors (e.g., a balcony) during the night to discharge the heat accumulated during the daytime. Both natural convection and forced convection variants were considered. The results showed that, in the configurations and for the reference room and weather considered, the adopting 4 modules of the device can lead to reductions in the maximum room air temperature close to 3 degrees C, with natural convection. Adopting a fan to impose forced convection at the surfaces of the device can lead to temperature attenuations in excess of 4 degrees C, as it ensures full solid-liquid commuting and therefore optimal use of the PCM thermal storage capability.","[Leal, Vitor; Teixeira, Raul] Univ Porto, Fac Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,"Leal, V (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Fac Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal.",vleal@fe.up.pt; raul.santosteixeira@gmail.com,"Leal, Vitor/AAF-5403-2021","Leal, Vitor/0000-0001-8396-2907",,,,,28,1,1,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,NOV,2020,13,22,,,,,,,5982,10.3390/en13225982,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en13225982,,,15,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,OZ1OD,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000594703100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nature-based solutions (NBS) like vegetated roofs and city trees can contribute effectively to climate resilience and future proof urban water management. However, large scale implementation is limited due to a lack of knowledge among professionals on how to capture, store, and reuse water on-site. In this paper we advocate a classification into no-tech, low-tech, and high-tech green, thereby supporting urban designers to better utilize the ability of these green elements to effectively manage water flows in different urban settings. Here, no tech green is considered traditional urban green, handling (rain) water like nature would. Low-tech green (e.g., extensive Sedum roofs) are suitable for dense urban settings with limited demand for water management and ecosystem services. More developed high-tech green solutions have vegetation performing even beyond natural capacities, offering full water management control options and enable city planners, architects and landscape designers to enhance urban resilience and circularity without claiming valuable urban space. We elaborate our tech NBS approach for city trees and vegetated roofs thereby demonstrating the classification's added value for sustainable urban design. We conclude that specifying the demanded no/low/high -tech level of green infrastructure in urban design plans will help to yield the most of ecosystem services using appropriate levels of available technology.","[Snep, Robbert P.

The debate on HCSA is limited to Brazilian literature but as a technological and a bottom-up governance experience, researches on the topic could add some insights to international debate on living with drought. The present paper adopts an historical perspective on HCSA before discussing the main HCSA's rainwater-harvesting methods found in two case studies in the SAB as a local appropriate and advanced technological package for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Qualitative analysis of 32 semi-structured interviews with key local stakeholders, 29 unstructured interviews with family farmers, and surveys in 499 family farms are used. The results show that regardless the highly adaptive potential, the technologies are adopted in differ rates among them and in between case studies chosen, influenced by non-technological factors and interacting the broader public policies context.

In addition, we demonstrate the usability of the proposed framework by using it to assess and compare the effectiveness of two resilience-building strategies: (1) permeable pavement transformation and (2) land vulnerability reduction.

Socially vulnerable populations disproportionately inhabit hazard-prone areas, are more sensitive to significant impacts, and have less capacity to cope with socio-natural disasters. One approach to address the challenges of increasing urban hazard risk is to connect hazard scientists and disaster risk reduction practitioners through multi-hazard risk assessments. Based on research and practice in Austin, Texas, USA, this paper presents a methodology for a multi-hazard risk assessment that combines exposure to multiple natural hazards (flood, wildfire, and extreme heat) and social vulnerability. Our approach generated normalized quantitative indicators and geospatial maps that identify neighborhoods where relatively high hazard exposure and sensitivity converge to create risk reduction priority areas. The multi-hazard risk assessment connected researchers across traditional silos and the maps catalyzed academics-city staff-community group communication and collaboration. In addition to presenting the methodology and results of the multi-hazard risk assessment, we reflect on how the process and the maps operated as boundary objects giving rise the co-production beteween hazard scientists and disaster risk reduction practitioners. We suggest the intersection of co-production and multi-risk assessments We report on the multi-hazard assessment methodology and the implications for urban community resilience coproduction.","[Bixler, R.

Using quantitative and qualitative methods, we analyzed the publications to identify patterns and primary research themes related to the Gullah Geechee community's resilience. Findings revealed that Gullah Geechee's cultural heritage is vulnerable to climatic and societal changes, but can also be a source for enhancing community resilience and promoting more sustainable community-led heritage and tourism developments. A framework is proposed for building community resilience in the context of minority and/or marginalized communities (e.g., Gullah Geechee). This study highlights the urgent need to not only better understand and incorporate a community's economic dimensions and losses in various decision- and policy-making processes but also their cultural and social dimensions and losses.

However, tools that have the ability to implement adaptation solutions in the actual urban planning and design practice seem to be missing. We developed and tested the Adaptation Planning Support'Toolbox (APST) to fill this gap. This toolbox supports local policymakers, planners, designers and practitioners in defining the program of demands, in setting adaptation targets, in selecting from more than 60 blue, green and grey adaptation measures and with informed co-creation of conceptual adaptation plans. The APST provides quantitative, evidence-based performance information on (cost)effectiveness of adaptation measures regarding climate resilience and co-benefits. The APST can be used design workshops, to feed dialogues among stakeholders on where and how which ecosystem-based adaptation measures can be applied. Applications of the AST in various settings and context in cities on different continents have illustrated the added value of the toolbox in bringing policy and practice together with help of science. With more and more cities worldwide that will make the step from policymaking to actual adaptation-inclusive urban (re)development practice we foresee a growing demand for such tools.

Complexity, contingency and uncertainty combine to impede the growth of such systemic understandings. In this paper we suggest that the collaborative development of conceptual models can help a group to identify potential leverage points for effective adaptation. We describe a three-step procedure that leads from the development of a high-level system template, through the selection of a problem space that contains one or more of the group's adaptive challenges, to a specific conceptual model of a sub-system of importance to the group. This procedure is illustrated by a case study of urban dwellers' maladaptive dependence on private motor vehicles. We conclude that a system dynamics approach, revolving around the collaborative construction of a set of conceptual models, can help communities to improve their adaptive capacity, and so better meet the challenge of maintaining, and even improving, urban health in the face of climate change.","[Proust, Katrina; Dixon, Jane] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Newell, Barry] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Engn, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Brown, Helen] Curtin Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Capon, Anthony] Univ Canberra, Fac Hlth, Discipline Publ Hlth, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Burton, Anthony] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Med, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Mu, Lisa] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Publ Hlth & Prevent Med Residency Program, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Zarafu, Monica] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia",Australian National University; Australian National University; Curtin University; University of Canberra; Western Sydney University; University of British Columbia; University of Technology Sydney,"Proust, K (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",Katrina.Proust@anu.edu.au; barry.newell@anu.edu.au; h.brown@curtin.edu.au; tony.capon@canberra.edu.au; chris.browne@anu.edu.au; 17111788@student.uws.edu.au; jane.dixon@anu.edu.au; lisajjmu@gmail.com; monica.e.zarafu@student.uts.edu.au,,"Dixon, Jane/0000-0003-4658-4307; Brown, Helen/0000-0001-9873-5969; Browne, Chris/0000-0001-9230-8827; Capon, Anthony/0000-0003-0354-6810",Climate and Health Cluster; CSIRO Flagship Collaboration Fund,Climate and Health Cluster; CSIRO Flagship Collaboration Fund(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),"This research was supported by the Climate and Health Cluster which is funded by the CSIRO Flagship Collaboration Fund.

Managed realignment can be seen as a nature-based flood defence system that combines flood protection by the realigned dike (artificial) and restored saltmarshes (nature-based). So far, research on coastal managed realignment is primarily directed to saltmarsh restoration on formerly reclaimed land. This study focuses on the realigned dikes. The aim of this research is to characterize realigned dikes and to indicate the characteristics that offer opportunities for nature-based flood protection. We categorized 90 European coastal managed realignment projects into two realigned dike groups: (1) Newly built landward dikes and (2) Existing landward dikes of former multiple dike systems. The second group has two subcategories: (2a) Former hinterland dikes and (2b) Realignments within summer polders. For each group we present the realigned dike characteristics of a representative case study. We consider that the use of existing landward dikes or local construction material make realignment more sustainable. From a nature-based flood protection perspective, the presence of an artificial dike is ambiguous. Our results show that targeted and expected saltmarsh restoration at managed realignment does not necessarily result in a greener realigned dike design that suits for combined flood protection with restored saltmarshes. We recommend coastal managers to explicitly take combined flood protection into account in the realigned dike design and steer the topography of the realignment site to facilitate naturebased flood protection and promote surface elevation increase seaward of the realigned dike in response to sea level rise. This makes managed realignment a nature-based flood defence zone for now and for the future.","[van den Hoven, Kim; Kroeze, Carolien; van Loon-Steensma, Jantsje M.] Wageningen Univ, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"van den Hoven, K (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",kim.vandenhoven@wur.nl,,"van Loon-Steensma, Jantsje M./0000-0002-6181-7829; van den Hoven, Kim/0000-0001-9046-1385",Dutch Research Council (NWO) [17589],Dutch Research Council (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),This publication is part of the project The Hedwige-Prosper Polder as a future-oriented experiment in managed realignment: integrating saltmarshes in water safety (with project number 17589) of the research programme 'Living Labs in the Dutch Delta' which is (partly) financed by the Dutch Research Council (NWO).,,124,1,1,5,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,MAY 1,2022,222,,,,,,,,106116,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106116,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106116,,MAR 2022,14,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Oceanography; Water Resources,1C7IF,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000793287500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This warming has underpinned the rapid expansion of the UK viticulture sector and its current focus on growing grape varieties for sparkling wine. Near-term (2021-2040) climate change may condition opportunities for further variety and/or wine style changes. Using the latest high -resolution (5 km) ensemble (x 12) of downscaled climate change models for the UK (UK Climate Projections; UKCP18) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, we calculate near-term trends and variability in bioclimatic indices (BCIs). We simulate the projected repetition of the UK's highest yielding season-2018-and use an analogue approach to model the 1999-2018 mean growing season temperatures from Pinot noir producing areas of Champagne (France), Burgundy (France) and Baden (Germany) over the UK during 2021-2040. We also project, across the UK for the 2021-2040 period, BCI values of recent high-quality vintage years from Champagne and Burgundy. GST are projected to increase from a 1999-2018 spatial range of 13.0 (minimum threshold)-15.7 degrees C to a future (2021-2040) range of 13.0-17.0 degrees C, and Growing Degree Days (GDD) from 850 (minimum threshold)-1267 to 850-1515. Growing season precipitation (GSP) is projected to decline in some UK viticulture areas but is not modelled as a limiting viticulture factor. High inter-annual weather variability is simulated to remain a feature of the UK viticulture climate and early season frost risk is likely to occur earlier. Large areas of the UK are projected to have > 50 % of years within the bioclimatic ranges experienced during the 2018 growing season, indicating potential higher yields in the future. The 1999-2018 mean Champagne, Burgundy and Baden GST and GDD are projected for much of England and some areas in the far south and south-east of Wales during 2021- 2040, with significant areas projected to have > 25 % of years within the BCI ranges of top Champagne vintages. These results indicate greater potential for Pinot noir for sparkling wines and shifting suitability to still red wine production.

Despite a growing number of examples of such plans and toolkits that outline the process for undertaking these planning efforts, many cities are still struggling to know where to start. Furthermore, meta-analyses of existing climate action plans show that many suffer from similar limitations including lack of scientific input, failure to consider strategies across multiple sectors within local government, limited public involvement, narrow focus on mitigation, and lack of detail regarding implementation and monitoring. This paper describes our process for developing the Anchorage Climate Action Plan and our experience fusing a three-way partnership between the municipal government, a local university, and the broader Anchorage, Alaska community. We describe the nuts and bolts of our funding, leadership structure, and technical working sessions and reflect on the key structural, political, and social elements that catalysed plan development, adoption, and implementation. Our experience suggests that public support from municipal leaders, commitment from local experts, a dedicated steering committee, a diverse set of stakeholders, and a good working relationship with the local government officials (e.g. Assembly members or City Council) are critical to creating a successful framework for climate mitigation and adaptation planning in a community. Collaborative planning with a local university that prioritises community-engagement can support the development of a robust planning document that integrates local scientific expertise and is representative of the community it is meant to serve.","[Hahn, Micah B.] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Inst Circumpolar Hlth Studies, 3211 Providence Dr,BOC3 270, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Kemp, Catherine] Municipal Anchorage, Anchorage, AK USA; [Ward-Waller, Chelsea] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Anchorage, AK USA; [Donovan, Shannon] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Anchorage, AK USA; [Schmidt, Jennifer I.] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Inst Social & Econ Res, Anchorage, AK USA; [Bauer, Stephanie] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Philosophy, Anchorage, AK USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage,"Hahn, MB (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Anchorage, Inst Circumpolar Hlth Studies, 3211 Providence Dr,BOC3 270, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",mbhahn@alaska.edu,,,University of Alaska Faculty Initiative Fund; University of Alaska Anchorage Center for Community Engagement and Learning Resilient Cities grant; Jack and Martha Roderick Sustainability Fund,University of Alaska Faculty Initiative Fund; University of Alaska Anchorage Center for Community Engagement and Learning Resilient Cities grant; Jack and Martha Roderick Sustainability Fund,This work was supported by the University of Alaska Faculty Initiative Fund; the University of Alaska Anchorage Center for Community Engagement and Learning Resilient Cities grant; and the Jack and Martha Roderick Sustainability Fund.,,37,2,2,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,SEP 1,2020,25,9,,,,,648,665,,10.1080/13549839.2020.1811655,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2020.1811655,,AUG 2020,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,NW3XT,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000564121600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To mitigate heat exposure and protect sensitive populations, urban planners are increasingly using heat vulnerability indices (HVIs) to identify high priority areas for intervention and investment. Relative HVI scores help identify which areas are at greatest risk of heat-related morbidity and mortality. Public health researchers are also increasingly using observation-driven exposure-response functions to estimate heat-related mortality. In this paper, we estimate the number and spatial distribution of heat-related deaths in Dallas in 2011 employing an exposure-response function and then assess the performance of different HVI techniques in assigning vulnerability to zones of high heat mortally. Our approach estimates that 112 Dallas residents died from heat-related causes in the summer of 2011 and finds wide variability in the performance of different HVI techniques in assessing heat vulnerability by district. The HVI is found to retain more useful information mapped as separate components of vulnerability than as a single composite score. While the exposure-response function is preferred, the methods can be used in conjunction to assess appropriate heat management strategies.","[Mallen, Evan; Stone, Brian; Lanza, Kevin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch City & Reg Planning, 245 Fourth St NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Mallen, E (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch City & Reg Planning, 245 Fourth St NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",esmallen@gatech.edu; stone@gatech.edu; lanza.kevin@gatech.edu,"Lanza, Kevin/ABD-8011-2020","Lanza, Kevin/0000-0002-5259-6745","Texas Trees Foundation, Dallas, TX, United States of America","Texas Trees Foundation, Dallas, TX, United States of America","This work was supported in part by the Texas Trees Foundation, Dallas, TX, United States of America.",,36,30,30,13,54,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,DEC,2019,30,,,,,,,,100528,10.1016/j.uclim.2019.100528,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2019.100528,,,11,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,JK1WA,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000494636600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The continuous exploration of advanced multifunctional electrodes is of great significance to achieve balance between superior capacity and complex service environment adaptability. Notably, it still remains a great challenge to realize high capacity under extreme complex stress and climate environments. Herein, coralline-like (Ni, Co, Mn) Se nanoarrays were synthesized on highly-conductive 3D-printed wave-structure carbon-rich periodic lattices as multitasking free-standing, binder and current collector-free electrodes towards editable ultrahigh-capacity, complex-stress and all-climate energy storage. As expected, the as-prepared wave-structure electrodes exhibit a combination of editable ultrahigh capacitive performance (5.6-7.8 F cm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2)), superb mechanical resistance (up to 260 MPa) and wide climate compliance (temperature: from -20 to 85 degrees C; humidity: from 20 to 85% RH). More impressively, such a multipurpose device also demonstrates a record-high areal energy density of 260 mu Wh cm(-2), and an ultralong lifespan even under extreme conditions of 85 degrees C & 85% RH & 3 MPa.

The inherently probabilistic nature of these forecasts can be problematic when deciding whether to act or not. Cost-loss analysis has previously been employed to support forecast based decision-making such as Forecast-based Financing (FbF), providing insight to when an FbF system has 'potential economic value' relative to a no-forecast alternative. One well-known limitation of cost-loss analysis is the difficulty of estimating losses (which vary with hazard magnitude and extent, and with the dynamics of population vulnerability and exposure). A less-explored limitation is ignorance of the temporal dynamics (sequencing) of costs and losses. That is, even if the potential economic value of a forecast system is high, the stochastic nature of the atmosphere and the probabilistic nature of forecasts could conspire over the first few forecasts to increase the expense of using the system over the no-forecast alternative. Thus, for a forecast-based action system to demonstrate value, it often needs to be used over a prolonged length of time. However, knowing exactly how long it must be used to guarantee value is unquantified. This presents difficulties to institutions mandated to protect those at risk, who must justify the use of limited funds to act in advance of a potential, but not definite disaster, whilst planning multi-year strategies. Here we show how to determine the period over which decision makers must use forecasts in order to be confident of achieving 'value' over a no-forecast alternative. Results show that in the context of seasonal forecasting it is plausible that more than a decade may pass before a FbF system will have some certainty of showing value, and that if a particular user requires an almost-certain guarantee that using a forecast will be better than a no-forecast strategy, they must hold out until a near-perfect forecast system is available. The implication: there is potential value in seasonal forecasts, but to exploit it one must be prepared to play the long game.","[MacLeod, David] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Kniveton, Dominic R.] Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Todd, Martin C.] Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Bristol; University of Sussex; University of Sussex,"Kniveton, DR (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",david.macleod@bristol.ac.uk; d.r.kniveton@sussex.ac.uk; m.todd@sussex.ac.uk,,,"Science for Humanitarian Emergencies and Resilience (SHEAR) [NE/P000673/1, NE/P000568/1, NE/P000428/1]; U.K. Natural Environment Research Council; Economic and Social Research Council; U.K. Department for International Development; European Union [869550]",Science for Humanitarian Emergencies and Resilience (SHEAR); U.K. Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); U.K. Department for International Development; European Union(European Commission),"This research was supported by the Science for Humanitarian Emergencies and Resilience (SHEAR) consortium project Towards Forecast-based Preparedness Action (ForPAc, www.forpac.org) , Grants NE/P000673/1, NE/P000568/1, and NE/P000428/1.

However, these goals cannot be achieved unless money is mobilised to finance climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts across the world. In response, various manifestations of green bonds have appeared in the market and these are considered as a bridge to the achievement of the SDGs - this is because climate mitigation and adaptation are integral to successful implementation of the SDGs. Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model, Fama-French Three Factor, Carhart Four Factor and Fama-French Five Factor pricing models, our study provides empirical evidence that the announcement of green bonds issuance lead to positively abnormal return on stocks. We divided our dataset into two parts. The first part of the dataset is from 01/01/2013 to 30/06/2018 and later part analyses the period from 01/07/2018 to 30/06/2022.

Minimising energy demands and emissions requires an understanding of theenvironmental value of historic housing in addition to their heritage value. This, to support their own conservation and contributing to passive contemporary architecture strategies. The global potential for mainstreaming retrofit measures is then expanded beyond a restricted heritage sector together with up-scaling localised construction methods and practices. This research revisits traditional solutions and behavioural patterns in Yazd (Iran), Roros (Norway), Santiago-de-Compostela (Spain), and Paramaribo (Suriname). In hot extremes (Yazd), high mass materials in concert with carefully arranged openings and windcatchers have provided low-energy housing. Whereas, wood construction, whether in the cold (Roros) or tropical zones (Paramaribo), relies heavily on material quality, architectural features, and layout. Temperate areas (Santiago-de-Compostela), adapted to seasonal variations for centuries, can share their dynamic qualities.

We find that LST, MRT, and ST follow different diurnal trends masked by RS-LST. We also find that three-dimensional urban design is a better predictor of MRT than two-dimensional land cover and albedo - a known determinant of RS-LST. Shade is a better predictor of both simulated LST and MRT than RS-LST. We conclude that RS-LST is not adequate for guiding heat mitigation at hyper-local scales in cities.","[Turner, V.

Due to the significant cloud cover issue in tropical regions, the identification of oil palm from other crops using only optical satellites is difficult. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), this study aims to evaluate the best combination of open-source optical and microwave satellite data in oil palm mapping by utilizing the C-band Sentinel-1, L-band PALSAR-2, Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and topographic images, with the Muda River Basin (MRB) as the test site. The results show that the land use land cover maps generated from the combined images have accuracies from 95 to 97%; the best combination goes to Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 for the overall classification. Meanwhile, the best combination for oil palm classification is C5 (PALSAR-2 + Landsat 8), with the highest producer accuracy (96%) and consumer accuracy (100%) values. The combination of C-band radar images can improve the classification accuracy of oil palm, but compared with the combination of L-band images, the oil palm area was underestimated. The oil palm area had increased from 2015 to 2020, ranging from 10% to 60% across all combinations. This shows that the selection of optimal images is important for oil palm mapping.","[Zeng, Ju; Tan, Mou Leong; Tew, Yi Lin; Samat, Narimah] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Humanities, GeoInformat Unit, Geog Sect, George Town 11800, Malaysia; [Zeng, Ju; Wang, Tao] Yuxi Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Land Engn, Yuxi 653100, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Fei] Xinjiang Univ, Coll Geog & Remote Sensing Sci, Urumqi 830017, Peoples R China; [Tangang, Fredolin] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Earth Sci & Environm, Bangi 43600, Malaysia; [Yusop, Zulkifli] Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Ctr Environm Sustainabil & Water Secur IPASA, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia; Yuxi Normal University; Xinjiang University; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Tan, ML (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Humanities, GeoInformat Unit, Geog Sect, George Town 11800, Malaysia.",mouleong@usm.my,"Tan, Mou Leong/N-4678-2017; Samat, Narimah/A-9579-2011","Tan, Mou Leong/0000-0003-3939-0336; Samat, Narimah/0000-0002-7540-0717; Tangang, Fredolin/0000-0002-4919-1800","Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia [LRGS/1/2020/UKM-USM/01/6/2, LRGS/1/2020/UKM/01/6]; Special Basic Cooperative Research Programs of Yunnan Provincial Undergraduate Universities' Association [202001BA07001-109]","Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia(Ministry of Education, Malaysia); Special Basic Cooperative Research Programs of Yunnan Provincial Undergraduate Universities' Association","This study was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under the longterm research grant scheme project 2, grant number LRGS/1/2020/UKM-USM/01/6/2, which is under the program of LRGS/1/2020/UKM/01/6.

With changing climates and an aging population, effective adaptive strategies to address public health and environmental justice issues associated with extreme heat will be increasingly important. One effective adaptive strategy for reducing heat-related mortality is increasing tree cover. Designing such a strategy requires decision-support tools that provide spatial and temporal information about impacts. We apply such a tool to estimate spatially and temporally explicit reductions in temperature and mortality associated with a 10% increase in tree cover in 10 U. S. cities with varying climatic, demographic, and land cover conditions. Two heat metrics were applied to represent tree impacts on moderately and extremely hot days (relative to historical conditions). Increasing tree cover by 10% reduced estimated heat-related mortality in cities significantly, with total impacts generally greatest in the most populated cities. Mortality reductions vary widely across cities, ranging from approximately 50 fewer deaths in Salt Lake City to about 3800 fewer deaths in New York City. This variation is due to differences in demographics, land cover, and local climatic conditions. In terms of per capita estimated impacts, hotter and drier cities experience higher percentage reductions in mortality due to increased tree cover across the season. Phoenix potentially benefits the most from increased tree cover, with an estimated 22% reduction in mortality from baseline levels. In cooler cities such as Minneapolis, trees can reduce mortality significantly on days that are extremely hot relative to historical conditions and therefore help mitigate impacts during heat wave conditions. Recent studies project highest increases in heat-related mortality in the cooler cities, so our findings have important implications for adaptation planning. Our estimated spatial and temporal distributions of mortality reductions for each city provide crucial information needed for promoting environmental justice and equity. More broadly, the methods and model can be applied by both urban planners and the public health community for designing targeted, effective policies to reduce heat-related mortality. Additionally, land use managers can use this information to optimize tree plantings. Public stakeholders can also use these impact estimates for advocacy.","[Sinha, Paramita; Lim, Brian] RTI Int, 3040 E Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Coville, Robert C.; Hirabayashi, Satoshi] SUNY ESF, US Forest Serv, USDA, Davey Tree Expert Co,Davey Inst, 5 Moon Lib, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Endreny, Theodore A.] SUNY ESF, Dept Environm Resources Engn, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Nowak, David J.] SUNY ESF, US Forest Serv, USDA, 5 Moon Lib, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA",Research Triangle Institute; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Sinha, P (corresponding author), RTI Int, 3040 E Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",psinha@rti.org,"Endreny, Theodore/H-4743-2019","Endreny, Theodore/0000-0002-1891-261X; Coville, Robert/0000-0002-6895-2564; sinha, paramita/0000-0001-5667-9428; Hirabayashi, Satoshi/0000-0003-4259-2748; Lim, Brian/0000-0003-1664-1462",,,,,58,5,5,5,23,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Thus, economic consider-ations inhibit the progress towards a more energy-efficient housing stock and often account for direct utility savings. A widely discussed solution is to look beyond energy costs and consider other impacts of energy-saving strategies that affect their financial attractiveness. In this paper, we examine the case of a public housing project in Phoenix, AZ, using several tools to calculate different economic, environmental, and health metrics associated with the three levels of energy efficiency. Our results show that while the payback calculated from direct energy costs may not be attractive, we should consider other savings. We demonstrate that avoided health and climate costs could total around 40% of the direct utility savings. In addition, we quantify how energy-saving strategies can cool the neighborhood, make buildings more resilient to heat, improve indoor air quality, and reduce the transmission of airborne disease. These benefits could be translated to avoid costs in the future. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

This change may affect the operation of water utilities in arid and semi-arid parts of the globe. The Mediterranean region is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on water resources. In this paper, we reflect on the challenges that the water utility sector may experience during the upcoming decades to continue providing its essential service under the new climate scenario. Our reasoning is based on the lessons learned during the co-creation of a climate service with the water utility company of Valencia (Spain) within the framework of the EU ERA4CS project INNOVA. The joint vision of climate, water management researchers and water utility operators resulted in a multi-scale framework for evaluating the vulnerability of the water utility to climate change. The modelling framework couples water quantity and quality and their interaction in a chain of models. The proposed framework forced all parties to consider the issue of the temporal and spatial scales, and the importance of choosing and defining the boundaries of the problem. The analytical framework has three distinct elements: (1) a combination of climate projections; (2) hydrological and water resource management model of the river basin system; (3) reservoir management and water quality model. Two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 were considered in two timeframes for the analysis: the short term (2020-2040) and the medium term (2041-2069). The results show a significant reduction in water availability combined with an increased frequency and intensity of phytoplankton blooms and anoxia episodes. These changes result in the deterioration of the reservoir trophic state, shifting from ultraoligotrophic-oligotrophic (control period) to oligotrophic-mesotrophic (RCP 8.5). The example shows how the combination of models on different scales and the involvement of experts in the co-creation process can result in a customized climate service that provides valuable information to water utility operators that can be used to reduce the system's vulnerability to climate change.","[Rubio-Martin, Adria; Llario, Ferran; Garcia-Prats, Alberto; Macian-Sorribes, Hector; Pulido-Velazquez, Manuel] Univ Politecn Valencia UPV, Res Inst Water & Environm Engn IIAMA, Cami Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Macian, Javier] Empresa Mixta Valenciana Aguas S A Global Omnium S, Gran via Marques Turia 19, Valencia 46005, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Rubio-Martin, A (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia UPV, Res Inst Water & Environm Engn IIAMA, Cami Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",adrumar@upv.es,,,"INNOVA; ADAPTAMED; SAPIDES; WATER4CAST; European Research Area for Climate Services Consortium (ER4CS); Agencia Estatal de Investigacion of the Spanish government [GA: 690462, PCIN-2017-066]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of Spain [RTI2018-101483-B-I00]; EU FEDER funds; Agencia Valenciana de la Innovacio (AVI) [INNEST/2021/276]; Generalitat Valenciana through the Conselleria de Innovacion, Universidades, Ciencia y Sociedad Digital [PROMETEO/2021/074]","INNOVA; ADAPTAMED; SAPIDES; WATER4CAST; European Research Area for Climate Services Consortium (ER4CS); Agencia Estatal de Investigacion of the Spanish government; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of Spain(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); EU FEDER funds(European Commission); Agencia Valenciana de la Innovacio (AVI); Generalitat Valenciana through the Conselleria de Innovacion, Universidades, Ciencia y Sociedad Digital","This research was supported by the INNOVA, ADAPTAMED, SAPIDES, and WATER4CAST projects.

In this subsystem, states are differentiated by their ambitions to de-carbonize their economies. These ambitions proceed from national policies and the nationally determined contributions (NDC) submitted by states in accordance with the Paris Agreement. Based on states' climate ambitions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) produce multiple reports ranking states and evaluating their contributions. The main parameter of state differentiation by climate ambition is the expected year of achieving carbon neutrality. In 2019-20, the UK and the European Union (EU) promoted this parameter with the Green Deal, and eventually other metrics were overshadowed. The previously used climate parameters and rankings based on them were contradictory and depended heavily on the chosen methodology. Apart from being untrustworthy, they put some western countries in unfavourable positions. N. Luhmann's new systems theory identifying carbon neutrality is taken as the main code of the climate communication subsystem that differentiates the climate subsystem of world politics from other functional subsystems. In this review article, how the emerging code of carbon neutrality is used by states and international organizations to form a new hierarchy in international relations is examined. Various constructivist and normative theories. from Foucault's post.structuralism to the historicism and normativity of the English School, are applied in order to capture the possible implications of the political use of carbon neutrality for international relations.

In this paper, three forms of adaptive management are identified, 'scientific' forms focused on collation of scientific data in response to management experiments, but more recent developments adding processes of collaboration as well as emphasising the need for reflexivity, that is, conscious processes of opening up debates to different perspectives and values. While reflexive adaptive management has been increasingly discussed in theory, there is a lack of examples of what its application means in practice. As a response, this paper examines an 'Adaptive Planning Process' (APP), seeking to apply reflexive adaptive management as a means to improve climate resilience in the UK water sector. The APP's three inter linked workshops - Aspiration, Scenario and Roadmapping - were co-developed and trialled in a water utility. By describing and justifying the choices made in the development of the APP, the paper aims to reveal some of the challenges that arise when trying to design processes that achieve reflexive adaptation. The paper concludes that, if applied to planning for climate change, reflexive adaptation has the potential to explore multiple value positions, highlight different potential futures and acknowledge (and hence, partly address) power differentials, and therefore to offer the possibility of real change. On the basis of the trial, we argue that through tapping the depth and breadth of internal knowledge the APP process created the potential for decision making to be joined up across different parts of the utility, and hence offering new strategies and routes for addressing uncertainties and delivering more resilient water services.","[Westling, E.

The high-dike system in the upper Mekong delta that has enabled intensive rice cultivation represents a prime example of these potential negative feedbacks. The lack of seasonal flooding and the associated depletion of nutrients is expected to affect farmer income as productivity declines and more fertiliser is required. Therefore, emphasis has shifted towards more sustainable, flood-based agricul-ture, however farmer uptake has its challenges. Based on a compilation of different household surveys we first analyse rice farmers' ability and willingness to transition and subsequently study the economic sustainability of intensive rice-based livelihoods. A Motivation and Ability (MOTA) survey reveals that two-thirds of the surveyed rice farmers are reluctant to change to flood-based farming systems, as they consider rice cultivation to be economically viable in the near future. They also mention financial and technical ability as key constraints. Subsequently, we analyse yield and fertiliser developments for a large sample of farming households under different dike systems between 2008 and 2015. This shows that income from rice farming grew steadily under high-dike systems as productivity growth compensated for higher input requirements. This growth is partly dampened by the slightly higher negative impacts of potential flood damage in high-dike areas, compared low-dike areas. A counterintuitive effect that is related to the fact that high dikes remain prone to dike overtopping or breaching in the flooding season, resulting in potentially higher damage than low-dike areas that are able to crop flood-based alternatives. The observed growth in income is a likely explanation for the reluctance to change in the studied period. Our analysis also shows that rice income growth is unequally distributed in high-dike areas, with lower incomes being associated with new high-dike systems and slower growth of incomes of smallholder rice farmers compared to large-scale farms. This makes smallholder rice farmers in high-dike areas especially vulnerable to changing conditions, and thus a priority target group for policy makers promoting flood-based alternatives. Recent commune level yield data show that the past productivity growth has stalled, increasing the prospects for alternative flood-based agriculture. This transition can be facilitated, by enhancing the eco-nomic viability of flood-based crops and, particularly for smallholder farmers, by improving their financial and technical capabilities through supportive policies.","[van Aalst, M.

While there have been numerous studies on urban heat, society's understanding of it is still insufficient, hindering its mitigation and adaptation. This paper aims to investigate people's vulnerability to, and perception, awareness and knowledge of, urban heat. A questionnaire survey was conducted with 562 re-spondents in the hot and humid city of Chongqing, China in the summer of 2020. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test and logistic regression. Results indicated that urban heat is generally understood as having a moderate severity, while there is limited knowledge of heat-related risks. The perceived heat-related psychological impacts are more severe than physiological impacts. There is limited awareness and knowledge of heat-impact reduction methods. Nevertheless, people's awareness, perception and knowledge of urban heat increase once they suffer heat-induced impacts, indicating exposure/ experience-driven awareness and knowledge. Moreover, climate injustice among different groups (e.g. gender, age, education, income, health) of people related to heat challenges was identified. People's perception, vulnerability, awareness and knowledge increased with age, but interestingly decreased with increasing edu-cation level and improved health conditions. Economic factor was not critical to heat-related responses. Men could be more vulnerable to physiological symptoms and daily functioning than women. The results of this study provide an understanding of urban heat perception and adaptive knowledge, enabling practitioners and policy makers to formulate effective urban heat mitigation and adaptation policies and regulations.","[He, Bao-Jie; Dong, Xin; Xiong, Ke; Feng, Chi] Chongqing Univ, Ctr Climate Resilient & Low Carbon Cities, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China; [He, Bao-Jie] Chongqing Univ, Liyang Smart City Res Inst, Jiangsu 213300, Peoples R China; [He, Bao-Jie; Feng, Chi] Chongqing Univ, Key Lab New Technol Construction Cities Mt Area, Minist Educ, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China; [He, Bao-Jie; Qi, Qianlong] South China Univ Technol, State Key Lab Subtrop Bldg Sci, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [He, Bao-Jie] Univ New South Wales, Sch Built Environm, Sydney 2052, Australia; [Zhao, Dongxue] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Darko, Amos] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hung Hom, Hong Kong 7398530, Peoples R China; [Sharifi, Ayyoob] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Hiroshima 7398530, Japan; [Sharifi, Ayyoob] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Adv Sci & Engn, Hiroshima 7398530, Japan; [Sharifi, Ayyoob] Hiroshima Univ, Network Educ & Res Peace & Sustainabil NERPS, Hiroshima 7398530, Japan; [Pathak, Minal] Ahmedabad Univ, Global Ctr Environm & Energy, Ahmadabad 380009, Gujarat, India; [Pathak, Minal] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, Weeks Bldg,16-18 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NE, England",Chongqing University; Chongqing University; Chongqing University; South China University of Technology; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hiroshima University; Hiroshima University; Hiroshima University; Ahmedabad University; Imperial College London,"He, BJ (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Ctr Climate Resilient & Low Carbon Cities, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China.;He, BJ (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Liyang Smart City Res Inst, Jiangsu 213300, Peoples R China.;He, BJ (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Key Lab New Technol Construction Cities Mt Area, Minist Educ, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China.;He, BJ (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, State Key Lab Subtrop Bldg Sci, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;He, BJ (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Built Environm, Sydney 2052, Australia.",baojie.unsw@gmail.com,"He, Bao-jie/ABC-5621-2020; Darko, Amos/C-4721-2018; He, Baojie/J-4430-2019; Sharifi, Ayyoob/M-7584-2013","He, Bao-jie/0000-0002-8841-0711; Darko, Amos/0000-0002-7978-6039; He, Baojie/0000-0002-8841-0711; Sharifi, Ayyoob/0000-0002-8983-8613; Pathak, Minal/0000-0002-9474-0485","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2021CDJQY-004]; State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Building Science, South China University of Technology [2022ZA01]","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Building Science, South China University of Technology","Project NO. 2021CDJQY-004 supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.

Assessing the vulnerability of regional crop production systems to such an altered climate in the future is essential for implementing appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies for sustainable agriculture. We investigated the possible impacts of climate change (CC) projected by multiple global climate models (GCMs) on rainfed and irrigated corn (Zea mays L., a C4 plant) in the Lower Mississippi Delta region (LMD), USA. The CSM-CROPGRO-Maize v4.6 module in the RZWQM2 model (hereafter referred to as the corn model) was previously calibrated and validated for modeling corn at Stoneville, Mississippi, a representative location in the LMD was used. The CC scenarios considered in this study were ensembles of climate projections of multiple GCMs (97 ensemble members) that participated in the Climate Model Inter-comparison and Improvement Program 5. These CC scenarios were bias-corrected and spatially downscaled (BCSD) at the location for the years 2050 and 2080. Four representative GHG concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 drove these CC scenarios. Under both irrigated and rainfed conditions, corn yield responses to enhanced CO2 were weak; thus, yield declined significantly in response to the enhanced air temperatures under all the RCP scenarios in both 2050 and 2080. The yield declines across RCPs ranged between 10 and 62% under irrigated conditions, and between 9 and 60% under rainfed conditions, mainly due to increased frequency of extreme temperatures and reduced crop durations. Water use efficiency declined between 22 and 150% under irrigated, and 8 and 54% under rainfed management. As an adaptation measure, planting corn up to 9 weeks earlier in the season, in general, failed to boost yields from increased crop duration and reduction in upper extreme air temperatures, as incidences of lower extreme temperatures also increased alarmingly. Development of cultivars that are more heat tolerant and produce higher yields under extreme temperatures would be required to combat corn yield decline in the region from climate change.","[Anapalli, Saseendran S.; Pinnamaneni, Srinivasa R.; Fisher, Daniel K.] USDA ARS, Sustainable Water Management Res Unit, POB 350, Stoneville, MS 38776 USA; [Reddy, Krishna N.] USDA ARS, Crop Prod Syst Res Unit, POB 350, Stoneville, MS 38776 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Anapalli, SS (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Sustainable Water Management Res Unit, POB 350, Stoneville, MS 38776 USA.",Saseendran.Anapalli@usda.gov,"Srinivasa Rao, Prof. P/ABG-1688-2021","Srinivasa Rao, Prof. P/0000-0003-1379-4906; anapalli, saseendran/0000-0002-1401-2964",,,,,46,1,1,3,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Through a critical review of existing debates and perspectives on NBS, this paper questions their uptake and points at the frequent embeddedness of NBS in speculative and elite-based development paths in both urban and rural areas.

Here we apply a climate change test to a framework for estimating the amount of agricultural conservation practices needed to achieve desired fish conservation outcomes for four watersheds in the Saginaw Bay region of Michigan, USA. We developed three climate scenarios from global climate model outputs (high emissions scenario, 2080s timeframe) to provide insight on potential impacts of a climate driver that represents a key uncertainty for this management system, the amount and timing of spring and summer precipitation. These scenarios were used as inputs to agricultural watershed models, which produced water quality outputs that we compared to thresholds in fish biodiversity metrics at the subwatershed scale. Our results suggest that impacts of climate change on evaporation rates and other aspects of hydrology will shift the relative importance of key stressors for fish (i.e., sediment loadings vs. nutrient concentrations) across these different watersheds, highlighting the need to design resilient implementation plans and policies. Overall, we found that changes in climate are likely to increase the need for agricultural conservation practices, but that increasing the implementation rate above current levels will likely remain a good investment under current and future climate conditions.

J,"Quang, NM",,,,"Quang, N. M.",,,A method for measuring women climate vulnerability: a case study in Vietnam's Mekong Delta,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Women climate vulnerability; Climate risk assessment; Mekong Delta; Gender inequality; Women adaptive capacity; Climate adaptation,GENDER; IMPACTS; WATER,"Purpose Across societies, gendered climate response decisions remain top-down and have limited progress because the influenced risk dynamics and their interrelations are not adequately understood. This study aims to address this gap by proposing an interdisciplinary innovative method, called women climate vulnerability (WCV) index, for measuring and comparing a diverse range of risks that threaten to undermine the adaptive capacity and resilience of rural women. Design/methodology/approach This paper builds on the literature to identify 12 risk categories across physical, economic and political sectors that affect rural women. These categories and attendant 51 risk indicators form the WCV index. A case study in Ben Tre Province (Vietnam) was used to demonstrate the application of the WCV methodology to rural contexts. The authors combined empirical, survey and secondary data from different sources to form data on the indicators. Structured expert judgment was used to address data gaps. Empirical and expert data were combined using a few weighting steps and a comprehensive coding system was developed to ensure objective evaluation. Findings The WCV assessment results reveal a reasonably worrisome picture of women's vulnerability in Ben Tre as top highest-likelihood and deepest-impact risks predominate in physical and economic risk sectors. Stability, human security and governance categories have lowest scores, demonstrating a fairly politically favourable condition in the province. The medium risk scores captured in land and infrastructure categories reveal promising determinants of the adaptation of women in this rural province. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the WCV index in collecting bottom-up data, evaluating a wide variety of risks that rural women face and pinpointing priority areas that need to be addressed. Originality/value The WCV is systematic, customisable and localised. It combines field research and empirical data through structured expert judgment, thus enables researchers to fill data gaps and to do evidence-based assessment about diverse risk vulnerabilities.

Mitigation has been referred to as the number one preparedness strategy. However, in view of the increased uncertainty and economic hardship worldwide that prevents governments spending and the quick pace of arrival of the anticipated adverse effects from climate change, growing attention is placed now on adaptation in the form of preventive actions that will enhance intra- and cross-sectorial resilience in all sectors of the economy. This paper focuses on the transport sector - a key economic sector of today's society and aims to examine the issues and prospects related to the adaptation of this sector in order to face the future climate change related events. In other words what will be the main issues, constraints, and policy guidelines that will help reduce the vulnerability of today's transport systems against actual or expected extreme weather events (EWE) and other natural hazards (NH) that will result from the changing climate in the planet.","[Giannopoulos, George A.] Ctr Res & Technol Hellas, Hellenic Inst Transport, Thermi, Greece",Centre for Research & Technology Hellas,"Giannopoulos, GA (corresponding author), Ctr Res & Technol Hellas, Hellenic Inst Transport, Thermi, Greece.",ggian@certh.gr,"Giannopoulos, George A./E-8233-2015","Giannopoulos, George A./0000-0002-9461-7866",,,,,11,2,2,2,13,INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD,GENEVA,"WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG, 29 ROUTE DE PRE-BOIS, CASE POSTALE 856, CH-1215 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND",1758-2083,1758-2091,,INT J GLOBAL WARM,Int.

While the environmental and biological ecosystem services provided by ecosystem-based adaptation measures such as beach nourishment and/or seagrass plantations are being acknowledged and analysed, less attention has been paid to the social or cultural dimensions of these services. This paper builds upon the emerging body of research that explores cultural ecosystem services in coastal areas and how they are perceived by the people who live, work and recreate in these areas. The aim of the paper is to take stock of and understand public and stakeholder perceptions of the cultural ecosystem services that may accrue through eelgrass Zostera marina restoration in tandem with beach nourishment in southern Sweden. The empirical research is based on an on-line open-ended questionnaire in the coastal municipalities of Bastad, Trelleborg, Ystad and Kristianstad. The results demonstrate that virtually all respondents had noticed a change in the coastline in recent years, mainly that the coastline had retreated. While beach nourishment measures were recognized among respondents to counter the shoreline erosion, there was very little understanding of the role that eelgrass plantations can play in creating biodiversity and benefits for society. Still, most acknowledged the importance of making room for water and biodiversity at the coast stating how the coastline was valued for primarily health and spiritual reasons. This knowledge will help local, regional and national decision-makers and regulatory authorities to make evidence-based choices for coastal protection, by complementing the analysis of environmental and physical ecosystem-services with cultural and socio-economic considerations. Nature-based solutions such as eelgrass reintroduction or beach nourishment should be tailored to the values, perspectives and perceptions of the local communities to help ensure their continued contribution to biodiversity.","[Van Well, Lisa] Swedish Geotech Inst, Linkoping, Sweden; [Isayeva, Anelya; Olsson, Pal Axel] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden; [Hollander, Johan] World Maritime Univ, Sasakawa Global Ocean Inst, Malmo, Sweden",Lund University,"Van Well, L (corresponding author), Swedish Geotech Inst, Linkoping, Sweden.",lisa.vanwell@sgi.se,,"Van Well, Lisa/0000-0002-2066-5099; Hollander, Johan/0000-0002-4207-2956",FORMAS [2016-20135]; Nippon Foundation of Japan,FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas); Nippon Foundation of Japan,This research was funded by FORMAS (grant no. 201800640).

Research into the use of experiments to innovate is increasing, but the role of experimentation in policy change has yet to be specifically addressed in the context of climate governance. My aim is to improve understanding by examining how entrepreneurs, key agents of change, might use experiments to advance their climate innovations. Policy entrepreneurs can benefit in several ways from using experiments, including assessing public response to new ideas and learning. I address the question: What role can experiments play in an entrepreneur's change strategies? To answer this, a set of 18 policy experiments from Dutch water management was analyzed to understand how the policy experiments functioned as 4 different policy change strategies. The results revealed that organizers use experiments to evaluate their preformed ideas, to soften local communities to the idea of experimentation, to build broad but centrally controlled coalitions, and to link with influential political actors and national programs to maintain visibility and relevance. These insights formed a list of suggestions that the experiment organizers identified as key to the change strategies. Based on this, a number of recommendations about design choices were made for entrepreneurs who want to experiment. Analyzing experiments as change strategies contributes a novel perspective on how policy experiments function as venues for invention and provides useful suggestions on how experiments can be designed to improve their influence over policy-making processes.","[McFadgen, Belinda K.] Vrije Univ, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"McFadgen, BK (corresponding author), Vrije Univ, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,,,Dutch Knowledge for Climate program,Dutch Knowledge for Climate program,"Thank you to the Dutch Knowledge for Climate program, which funded this research.",,51,6,6,1,17,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

This research sought to document major events of range expansion that led to this distribution and associated environmental changes. Through the use of genotyping-by-sequencing (similar to 20,000 SNPs) and geographic information systems applied to a sample of 246 accessions of wild Phaseolus vulgaris, including 157 genotypes of the Mesoamerican, 77 of the southern Andean, and 12 of the Northern Peru-Ecuador gene pools, we identified five geographically distinct subpopulations. Three of these subpopulations belong to the Mesoamerican gene pool (Northern and Central Mexico, Oaxaca, and Southern Mexico, Central America and northern South America) and one each to the Northern Peru-Ecuador (PhI) and the southern Andean gene pools. The five subpopulations were distributed in different floristic provinces of the Neotropical seasonally dry forest and showed distinct distributions for temperature and rainfall resulting in decreased local potential evapotranspiration (PhI and southern Andes groups) compared with the two Mexican groups. Three of these subpopulations represent long-distance dispersal events from Mesoamerica into Northern Peru-Ecuador, southern Andes, and Central America and Colombia, in chronological order. Of particular note is that the dispersal to Northern Peru-Ecuador markedly predates the dispersal to the southern Andes (similar to 400 vs. similar to 100 ky), consistent with the ancestral nature of the phaseolin seed protein and chloroplast sequences observed in the PhI group. Seed dispersal in common bean can be, therefore, described at different spatial and temporal scales, from localized, annual seed shattering to longaEuroEdistance, evolutionarily rare migration.","[Ariani, Andrea; Mier y Teran, Jorge Carlos Berny; Gepts, Paul] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Sect Crop & Ecosyst Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Gepts, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Sect Crop & Ecosyst Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",plgepts@ucdavis.edu,"Gepts, Paul/O-8229-2019","Gepts, Paul/0000-0002-1056-4665; Berny Mier y Teran, Jorge C./0000-0003-3709-9131; Ariani, Andrea/0000-0002-3356-5329","NIH S10 Instrumentation Grant [S10RR029668, S10RR027303]; Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) Competitive Grant from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2013-67013-21224]; NIFA [577414, 2013-67013-21224] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",NIH S10 Instrumentation Grant; Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) Competitive Grant from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"This work used the Vincent J.

The objective of this study was to identify maize (Zea mays L) cultivar parameters that maintain yield under projected climate for late in the 21st century under full and deficit irrigation in a semi-arid region. The Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) was calibrated with four years of maize data from northeastern Colorado, USA, under various irrigation conditions and was then used to simulate climate change effects on maize production with current management practices. Results showed that projected climate change decreased yield by 21% and biomass by 7% late in the 21st century (2070-2091) under full irrigation, compared to yield in the current climate (1992-2013). Under deficit irrigation, the corresponding reductions were 14% and 3%, respectively. Using the cultivar parameters calibrated with RZWQM2 for southern Colorado condition did not show yield decrease under future climate, but it simulated much lower yield under current climate in northeastern Colorado. A cultivar from the DSSAT (Decision Support Systems for Agrotechnology Transfer) crop database (GL 482) produced similar yield to experimental data under current climate and increased yield by 4% at full irrigation under future climate in northeastern Colorado. Using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), we also identified 70 cultivars with longer maturity duration (between silking and physiological maturity) and higher grain filling rate for mitigating climate change effects on maize production. These two identified traits can guide plant breeders in developing cultivars for the future. Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Ma, L.; Ahuja, L.

New spatially explicit approaches that identify highly exposed and vulnerable areas are needed to inform current urban planning practices to cope with heat hazards. This study proposes an extreme heat stress risk index for Dublin city across multiple decades (2020s-2050s) and for two representative concentration pathways (RCPs). In order to consider the interactions between greenhouse gas emissions and urban expansion, a climate-based urban land cover classification and a simple climate model have been combined to compute air temperature values accounting for urban heat island effect. This allowed the derivation of an improved hazard indicator in terms of extreme heat stress which, when integrated with information on current levels of vulnerability (i.e., socioeconomic factors assessed using principal component analysis (PCA), provides a heat hazard risk index for Dublin city at a fine spatial scale. Between the 2020s and 2050s, urban areas considered at highest risk are expected to increase by about 70% and 96% under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 respectively. For the 2050s, enhanced levels of heat risk under the RCP 8.5 scenario are particularly visible in the core city centre and in the northern and western suburbs.

Today, countries of origin, transit, and destination have reached a juncture. The UNFCCC Paris Agreement adds value to decisions these countries face by helping them explore possible scenarios for impacts that include large movements of people that could be associated with a rise in global average temperatures between 1.5 and 2 A degrees C above pre-industrial levels. Climate policy and mainstream migration and refugee policy are developing recommendations by the end of 2018 that, together, will provide new contours for governing human mobility in the twenty-first century. This paper compares work on human mobility under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and how climate change features in the initial drafts of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM) and the Global Compact on Refugees (GCR). The international community can choose not to include such future considerations, missing opportunities to avert risks of involuntary movements of people as climate change impacts intensify. Alternatively, the international community can help countries to preempt risks arising from governance gaps and climate impacts, incorporate climate and mobility considerations in planning, and establish contingency arrangements for large-scale movements of people. A measure of efficacy in coordinating responses to large-scale movements of people will be the degree to which both state and non-state actors take up the recommendations of the Task Force on Displacement, how the Global Compact for Migration is negotiated, and the degree to which states utilize the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework as climate and other dynamics unfold in future years.","[Warner, Koko] UNFCCC, Climate Change Secretariat, Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",,"Warner, K (corresponding author), UNFCCC, Climate Change Secretariat, Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",kwarner@unfccc.int,,,,,,,56,8,8,2,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0199-0039,1573-7810,,POPUL ENVIRON,Popul.

However, in the past two decades production has declined and has largely been attributed to plant pathogens, including plant-parasitic nematodes. To assess the understanding and awareness that banana farmers have of nematodes, a survey was conducted. The incidence, abundance and distribution of nematodes in relation to altitude were determined for different banana types on 180 farms and the pathogenicity of Pratylenchus goodeyi, originating from three different altitudinal locations, was compared on two banana cultivars. Just 2.3% of farmers were aware of nematode damage and symptoms, none of whom applied any management measures. The highest abundance of nematodes was recorded at an altitude range of 1601-2000 m a.s.l., with Pratylenchus, Meloidogyne and Helicotylenchus being the predominant genera. Across all altitudinal locations, cooking banana had higher densities of nematodes than dessert bananas. In pots, P. goodeyi populations from Embu (1300 m a.s.l.) appeared more aggressive and with higher levels of multiplication than the population from Oyugis (1100 m a.s.l.). Cooking banana ('Ng'ombe') was more susceptible than dessert banana ('Sukari Ndizi'). Nematode damage is more prominent in areas at higher altitude and on cooking banana cultivars. The findings provide key information in guiding informed and suitable management decision thresholds in relation to potential climate change.","[Nyang'au, Douglas; Nchore, Shem; Mwangi, Maina] Kenyatta Univ, Dept Agr Sci & Technol, POB 43844-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Nyang'au, Douglas; Atandi, Janet; Cortada, Laura; Coyne, Danny] Int Inst Trop Agr IITA East Africa, Icipe Campus,POB 30772-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Cortada, Laura; Coyne, Danny] Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Nematol Res Unit, Campus Ledeganck,Ledeganckstr 35, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Kenyatta University; International Centre of Insect Physiology & Ecology (ICIPE); Ghent University,"Coyne, D (corresponding author), Int Inst Trop Agr IITA East Africa, Icipe Campus,POB 30772-00100, Nairobi, Kenya.;Coyne, D (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Nematol Res Unit, Campus Ledeganck,Ledeganckstr 35, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",d.coyne@cgiar.org,,,CGIAR Fund; 'GCE Phase II: Neuropeptide Nematicides' project [OPP1130274]; European Union project: Microbial Uptakes for Sustainable management of major banana pests and diseases [727624],CGIAR Fund(CGIAR); 'GCE Phase II: Neuropeptide Nematicides' project; European Union project: Microbial Uptakes for Sustainable management of major banana pests and diseases,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial sup-port from the donors who supported this work through their contributions to the CGIAR Fund (https:// www.cgiar.org/funders/) and in particular to the CGIAR Research Program for Roots, Tubers and Bananas (CRP-RTB) , and also the 'GCE Phase II: Neuropeptide Nemati-cides' project opportunity ID: OPP1130274, led by Queens University, Belfast, and by the European Union project: Microbial Uptakes for Sustainable management of major banana pests and diseases, Grant Agreement 727624.",,55,2,2,4,9,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1388-5545,,,NEMATOLOGY,Nematology,FEB,2022,24,2,,,,,137,147,,10.1163/15685411-bja10119,http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685411-bja10119,,,11,Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,YR3FM,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000749880300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

To address coastal inundation risk for impact studies, integrated approaches accounting for flood hazard modelling, exposure and vulnerability of human and environmental systems are crucial. In this study, we model the impacts of sea level rise on coastal inundation depth for County Dublin, the most extensively urbanized area in Ireland, for the current period and for 2100 under two Representative Concentration Pathways RCP 4.5 and 8.5. A risk-centred approach has been considered by linking the information on coastal flood-prone areas to the exposure of the urban environment, in terms of potential future land cover changes, and to the socioeconomic vulnerability of the population. The results suggest significant challenges for Dublin city and the surrounding coastal areas, with an increase of around 26% and 67% in the number of administrative units considered at very high risk by the end of the century under a RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. This study aims to contribute to existing coastal inundation research undertaken for Ireland by (i) providing a first-level screening of flooding hazards in the study area, (ii) demonstrating how land cover changes and socioeconomic vulnerability can contribute to the level of experienced risk and (iii) informing local authorities and at-risk communities so as to support them in the development of plans for adaptation and resilience.","[Paranunzio, Roberta] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate CNR ISAC, I-10133 Turin, Italy; [Guerrini, Marco] Univ Coll Cork, MaREI Ctr, Environm Res Inst, Haulbowline Rd, Cork P43 C573, Ireland; [Dwyer, Edward] Randbee Consultants, Calle Carreteria 67 4 E, Malaga 29001, Spain; [Alexander, Paul J.] Cent Stat Off CSO, Census Geog, Dublin D11, Ireland; [O'Dwyer, Barry] KPMG Ireland, St Stephens Green, Dublin D02, Ireland",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); University College Cork,"Paranunzio, R (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate CNR ISAC, I-10133 Turin, Italy.",r.paranunzio@isac.cnr.it,"Paranunzio, Roberta/N-2647-2019","Paranunzio, Roberta/0000-0002-2270-7467","Large Urban Area Adaptation (Urb-ADAPT) project in the EPA Research Programme 2014-2020 - Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment [2015-CCRP-MS.25]","Large Urban Area Adaptation (Urb-ADAPT) project in the EPA Research Programme 2014-2020 - Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","This research received financial support of the Large Urban Area Adaptation (Urb-ADAPT) project (2015-CCRP-MS.25) in the EPA Research Programme 2014-2020, which is a Government of Ireland initiative funded by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, administered by the Environmental Protection Agency.",,99,0,0,8,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1312,,J MAR SCI ENG,J.

First, changes in these drivers, for example in food and energy prices, make improving interventions in drylands more urgent because of their potential impacts. Second, these changes introduce new knowledge gaps regarding both the potential impacts on social-ecological dryland systems and the design of options to take advantage of opportunities. This paper identifies the most salient research needs in DLDD in drylands brought on by global drivers. The question was addressed through an iterative stakeholder consultative forum. First, relevant global scale drivers were identified through a literature review and preliminary consultation. Next, stakeholders and experts were further consulted to identify research priorities given rise to by these drivers. Identified research priorities were as follows: (i) assessing impacts of rising prices on DLDD in mixed market and subsistence production contexts; (ii) assessing options and limits of agricultural modernisation on fragile lands; (iii) developing methods for assessing land-use trade-offs and mapping productive lands; (iv) modelling and participatory methods for monitoring and evaluating soil carbon sequestration; (v) developing policy frameworks to regulate impacts of investment on the environment and local livelihoods; (vi) participatory modelling for regional and local adaptation planning; and (vii) valuation of non-market land degradation outcomes including biodiversity loss. Concluding, we call for a forward-looking interdisciplinary drylands research agenda with an increased emphasis on governance to address these priorities.

The system combines geographic information systems and business intelligence software, and it is based on the original Pluvial Flood Risk Assessment tool. The location intelligence system effectively identifies the spatial and temporal distribution of pluvial flood risks, allows to preliminarily evaluate the total run-off from roads, and helps localise potential places for new water management infrastructure.

This is done by coupling the Simple Urban Radiation Model (SURM), which computes the mean radiant temperature ( <mml:semantics> T m r t </mml:semantics> ), with a newly developed multi-class multi-mode traffic model. Simulation results with parameters chosen for the city of Hamburg for a hot summer day show that commuters are potentially most exposed to heat stress in the early afternoon when <mml:semantics> T m r t </mml:semantics> has its maximum. Varying the morphology with respect to street width and building height shows that a more compact city configuration reduces <mml:semantics> T m r t </mml:semantics> and therefore the exposure to heat stress. The impact resulting from changes in the city structure on traffic is simulated to determine the time spent outside during the commute. While the time in traffic jams increases for compact cities, the total commuting time decreases due to shorter distances between home and work place. Concerning adaptation measures, it is shown that increases in the albedo of the urban surfaces lead to an increase in daytime heat stress. Dramatic increases in heat stress exposure are found when both, wall and street albedo, are increased.","[Hoffmann, Peter; Heitmann, Stefan; Gasser, Ingenuin] Univ Hamburg, Dept Math, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Fischereit, Jana; Schluenzen, K.

The manifestations of this are still to be seen. This paper argues that successful dissemination and adoption of the forecast requires an in-depth profile of the characteristics and needs of user groups. The case study of a mountainous village in southern Lesotho is used to highlight the decisions which one group of marginal users-smallholder farmers-might make in response to the forecast. A participatory role-play exercise explores what information households presently receive and how new climate forecast information could be integrated into seasonal decision making. Results show that there are a number of low-input options available to these farmers for responding to the forecast. Adoption, however, is going to require repeated exposure to the forecast in conjunction with forecast development that is suited to users' needs. The case study is linked back to the larger scale by suggesting paths that seasonal climate forecast development could take if it is to contribute to improving livelihood sustainability among marginal groups.","Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; Stockholm Environm Inst Oxford, Oxford OX1 1QT, England",University of Cape Town,"Ziervogel, G (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst Oxford, Oxford OX1 1QT, England.",gina@egs.uct.ac.za,"Ziervogel, Gina/AAG-2945-2019","Ziervogel, Gina/0000-0003-4219-6809",,,,,68,89,92,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0016-7398,1475-4959,,GEOGR J,Geogr.

We live in a world where environmental data is increasingly being amassed and models are generating finer scale and increasingly dense numbers of outputs, resulting in the production of high level scientific information on climate and ocean. However, the knowledge generated is often inaccessible, incomprehensible and misunderstood by society. Given that society has access to many levels of information through various forms of media, how do we better share this knowledge, and improve understanding of how society is impacting their immediate and remote surroundings and what behavioral changes are needed for reducing those impacts? In this paper, we assess the level of environmental and ocean awareness among young learners. We argue that, despite the wide range of environmental data available and a common use of a broad range of media, this group is not aware of or interested in climate related issues. This paper highlights the challenges in bringing researchers, data managers and educators together to provide consistent, up-to-date messages that can appeal to and can be understood by modern societies. It also highlights insufficiencies in environmental school education, including those concerning the uncertainty concept, which is a fundamental part of any scientific process. In identifying these challenges, we propose a pathway for improving societal knowledge on climate and ocean changes that takes advantage of the technological abilities for environmental data collection, storage and processing, global and regional research, as well as good practices in ocean literacy and climate and ocean education.","[Zielinski, Tymon; Gregorczyk, Klaudia; Kijewski, Tomasz; Oleszczuk, Barbara; Pakszys, Paulina; Piechowska, Ewa; Piwowarczyk, Joanna; Wichorowski, Marcin] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Sopot, Poland; [Bolzacchini, Ezio; Ferrero, Luca] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, GEMMA & POLARIS Res Ctr, Milan, Italy; [Evans, Karen] CSIRO, Canberra, NSW, Australia; [Kotynska-Zielinska, Izabela] Today We Have, Sopot, Poland; [Mrowiec, Patrycja; Sobieszczanski, Jan] Storware, Warsaw, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences; University of Milano-Bicocca; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Zielinski, T (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Sopot, Poland.;Mrowiec, P (corresponding author), Storware, Warsaw, Poland.",tymon@iopan.pl; p.mrowiec@storware.eu,"; Pakszys, Paulina/V-5150-2017","Piwowarczyk, Joanna/0000-0001-6864-5073; Kijewski, Tomasz/0000-0002-3643-9483; Zielinski, Tymon/0000-0003-4712-8899; Pakszys, Paulina/0000-0001-6098-8215; Kotynska-Zielinska, Izabela/0000-0002-7099-8692",,,,,47,3,3,1,10,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

SALs receive limited attention in international climate research and policies; thus, the institutional relationship between governance, policy, and implementation continues to suffer from inconsistencies across governance levels. This research carried out an analysis combining mixed-research methods to collect, record, and analyze data and information regarding institutional and organizational strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, and local level policy implementation challenges and scope to assess the effectiveness of Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and implementation of adaptation policies at State and local levels in SALs. The inefficiencies observed in the DRM/CCA adaptation processes are concentrated in areas of high governance of state and municipal governments and stem from local communities' reduced organizational and technical capacity. It results in the negligent application of measures and resources to address climate risks. Therefore, this paper contributes to the increasing understanding of the institutional framework's role in the facilitation of local adaptation, revealing what seems to be working well, what is not, how things could improve in Brazilian SALs.","[Ferreira Costa, Carlos Germano] Minist Sci Technol Innovat & Commun, Interminist Commiss Global Climate Change, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",,"Costa, CGF (corresponding author), Minist Sci Technol Innovat & Commun, Interminist Commiss Global Climate Change, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",carloscostainspira@gmail.com,"Costa, Carlos Germano Ferreira/M-6964-2015","Costa, Carlos Germano Ferreira/0000-0003-0280-7281",,,,,54,0,0,3,7,"UNIV FEDERAL PARANA, EDITORA",PARANA,"RUA JOAO NEGRAO 280, CURITIBA, PARANA, 80060-200, BRAZIL",1518-952X,2176-9109,,DESENVOLV MEIO AMBIE,Desenvolv.

However, it remains challenging to translate such long-term visions into clear transition pathways. We draw upon a landscape-based design approach to local spatial planning to foster a transition to a well-functioning landscape, resilient to various external pressures. Inspired by a national visioning exercise for the Netherlands in 2120, two local case studies at municipal level in the Netherlands are analysed, aiming to identify in what ways the setup of a regional landscape-based design study using future visions can optimise the spatial planning process. Therefore, this comparative case study analysed the cases on the landscape-based approach, the design process, and the future visions formulated. The comparison shows that fostering abiotic differences safeguards sustainable and resilient landscapes; moreover, co-creation relying on representative local actors appears fundamental for shared solutions, while a landscape-based approach guarantees transitions to adaptive and biodiverse landscapes. We conclude that a shared long-term future landscape vision is a crucial source of inspiration to solve today's spatial planning problems. The constellation of the stakeholder group involved and the methodological setup of a visioning process are determinative for the way a long-term vision is suited to informing spatial planning for a sustainable future.","[Voskamp, Ilse; Timmermans, Wim; Roosenschoon, Onno; Kranendonk, Remco; van Rooij, Sabine; van Hattum, Tim; Sterk, Marjolein] Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Wageningen Environm Res, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Pedroli, Bas] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen Univ & Res, Land Use Planning Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Pedroli, B (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Wageningen Univ & Res, Land Use Planning Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",bas.pedroli@wur.nl,"; Pedroli, Bas/E-1352-2016","Roosenschoon, Onno/0000-0003-2502-7229; van Rooij, Sabine/0000-0001-5436-4780; Pedroli, Bas/0000-0003-3450-447X",,,,,45,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,JAN,2023,12,1,,,,,,,38,10.3390/land12010038,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land12010038,,,15,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,7Y8GR,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000915111000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This tonnage includes a 40% market share for processing for the home market (150,000-190,000t) and frozen fruit for both the home market and export (70,000-90,000 t) and makes China the world's third largest strawberry producer after the US and Europe. Strawberry cultivation in China is characterised by family smallholders with an averaged acreage of ca. 2,000 m(2) and salaries of 2 euros/person/day for hired labour resulting in ca. 500 euros/1,000 m(2) gross return. The major growing regions are the provinces Hebei (near Baoding), Shandong, Liaoning with an acreage of ca. 10,000 ha each. Strawberry plants and varieties are imported, but new Chinese varieties such as 'Chun Xing', 'Xing Du 1 and 2', 'Xuemi' and 'Chun Xu' are increasingly grown. The Chinese varieties are characterised by their sweet flavour with low acidity, a pre-requisite for the Asian market, and good taste and are adapted to the respective growing climate. A portion of the strawberry harvest is used for processing due to insufficient external fruit quality such as size, shape and colour by European standard. Strawberry research in China is spread between 9 institutions and universities throughout the country. Strawberries were regarded as exclusive desert and luxury for the upper class during the ten years of the cultural revolution between 1966-1976 under Mao Zedong. Today, fresh strawberries are sold in street markets or supermarkets. Import of strawberry fruit is prohibited, except for Hongkong, which imports 2,200 t from China and the US. China's export of 76,000 t in 2005, equivalent to a 9-10% export rate, was shipped to Japan (11,000 t) and Germany (8,700 t) with dumping prices below 50 cent/kg.","Int Obstbauberater, F-33000 Bordeaux, France",,"Roudeillac, P (corresponding author), Int Obstbauberater, 22 Rue Rolland, F-33000 Bordeaux, France.",philippe.roudeillac@numericable.fr,,,,,,,2,1,1,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0014-0309,,,ERWERBS-OBSTBAU,Erwerbs-Obstbau,JUN,2007,49,2,,,,,57,63,,10.1007/s10341-007-0034-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10341-007-0034-z,,,7,Horticulture,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,280ZS,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000254466300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The analysis and transfer of the research is carried out by using the research by design methodology. For this purpose, the interdisciplinary design process is divided into three phases (pre-design, design, post-design) and described in detail.

The study identifies that: many municipalities have received new knowledge; cross-sectoral organisational structures for water and flood risk issues at the local level are being formed or strengthened; and the flood risk issue has been elevated up the political agenda. There are also however clear signs that a number of other fundamental issues are not being adequately addressed in the complex institutional setting that results from the directive's implementation. These issues are undoubtedly obstructing the development of a more integrated and participatory flood risk management system. Of key importance here are questions relating to how roles and mandates are communicated and adopted, the lack of coordination between the Floods Directive and the Water Framework Directive, and the inadequate involvement of the municipal level and other stakeholders. Practical recommendations on how to redirect development towards more positive outcomes in these areas are thus formulated.","[Hedelin, Beatrice] Karlstad Univ, Ctr Climate & Safety, Dept Environm & Life Sci, SE-65188 Karlstad, Sweden",Karlstad University,"Hedelin, B (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Ctr Climate & Safety, Dept Environm & Life Sci, SE-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.",beatrice.hedelin@kau.se,"Hedelin, Beatrice/H-2667-2012",,Stiftelsen Lansforsakringsbolagens Forskningsfond (research fund of the Lansforsakringar insurance company in Sweden),Stiftelsen Lansforsakringsbolagens Forskningsfond (research fund of the Lansforsakringar insurance company in Sweden),"This study is part of the research programme, reduced climate risks in future building and housing, financed by Stiftelsen Lansforsakringsbolagens Forskningsfond (research fund of the Lansforsakringar insurance company in Sweden).",,17,3,3,1,18,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",1366-7017,,,WATER POLICY,Water Policy,APR,2017,19,2,,,,,286,303,,10.2166/wp.2016.092,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wp.2016.092,,,18,Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Water Resources,EV5NZ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000401815400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

To prevent damage and expensive repairs, ageing tests are used in durability assessments. The NT Build 495 describes an artificial ageing procedure to address building material and component resistance to ultraviolet (UV) light, heat, water, and frost using a climate simulator. The test has been used for decades to investigate exterior surface materials and facade products but has only recently been adopted for multi-layered systems. This study investigates moisture accumulation in a facade system for retrofitting based on concrete and thermal insulation. Hygrothermal simulations of the facade system subjected to ageing were conducted. Moisture accumulation was considered theoretically for the current test procedure and compared to a modified setup in which the interior climate was controlled at 21 degrees C. Physical measurements were performed in the climate simulator to determine the boundary conditions. Results showed that moisture accumulation in the thermal insulation was largely affected by the type of concrete, that applying a water-repellent surface treatment reduced moisture accumulation, and that the current setup resulted in less moisture accumulation compared to the modified setup. The latter implicates accelerated degradation with the modified setup.","[Asphaug, Silje Kathrin; Kvande, Tore] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Asphaug, Silje Kathrin; Time, Berit] SINTEF Community, Dept Architecture Mat & Struct, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Asphaug, SK (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.;Asphaug, SK (corresponding author), SINTEF Community, Dept Architecture Mat & Struct, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway.",silje.asphaug@sintef.no; berit.time@sintef.no; tore.kvande@ntnu.no,,"Kvande, Tore/0000-0003-0522-9974; Asphaug, Silje Kathrin/0000-0001-7014-3064; Time, Berit/0000-0002-3506-6494",,,,,28,5,5,1,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,DEC,2021,11,12,,,,,,,568,10.3390/buildings11120568,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings11120568,,,20,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,YF8HX,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000742043300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This system is able to move a phase change material layer with respect to the insulation layer inside the building component. With this ability, the system can increase solar benefits in winter and take profit from night free cooling in summer. During the heating season, the system places the phase change material facing outdoors during sunny hours to melt it, and it moves the phase change material back facing indoors to provide space heating when desired. In the cooling season, the phase change material is moved to the outer face of insulation at night time to enhance its solidification process, and it is moved back to face indoors during cooling peak hours. An appropriate control system, referring to the schedule of operation and placement of phase change material layer with respect to the insulation (when phase change material is facing outdoors or indoors) is critical to achieve savings and avoid malfunctioning of the system. In this work, we have developed and numerically compared two different control algorithms based on weather forecast data for space heating and cooling applications. Experimentation has been done under four different climate conditions: Athens, Madrid, Strasbourg, and Helsinki. One of the control algorithms, based on local search (Tabu), provided the set of activations of the dynamic system for a 24 h period. The other algorithm is based on model predictive control with an horizon of 2.5 and 5 h. Results proved the feasibility of the two smart control methods, as well as their capacity to improve the energy benefits of the dynamic phase change material system in days with suitable weather conditions. Moreover, the two control algorithms successfully avoided activating the system in days with non-appropriate weather conditions.","[de Gracia, Alvaro; Tarragona, Joan; Crespo, Alicia; Fernandez, Cesar] Univ Lleida, INSPIRES Res Ctr, GREiA Res Grp, Pere Cabrera S-N, Lleida 25001, Spain; [Tarragona, Joan] CIRIAF Interuniv Res Ctr Pollut & Environm Mauro, Via G Duranti 63, I-06125 Perugia, Italy",Universitat de Lleida,"de Gracia, A (corresponding author), Univ Lleida, INSPIRES Res Ctr, GREiA Res Grp, Pere Cabrera S-N, Lleida 25001, Spain.",alvaro.degracia@udl.cat,"de Gracia, Alvaro/AAF-3152-2019; Tarragona, Joan/AAD-6121-2021","Tarragona, Joan/0000-0001-6776-4273; de Gracia, Alvaro/0000-0002-8208-5487; Crespo Gutierrez, Alicia/0000-0003-4616-0221","Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades de Espana [RTI2018-093849-B-C31, TIN2015-71799-C2-2-P]; Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI) [RED2018-102431-T]; Government of Catalonia [2017 SGR 1537]; ICREA","Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades de Espana(Spanish Government); Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI); Government of Catalonia(Generalitat de Catalunya); ICREA(ICREA)","This work was partially funded by the Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades de Espana (RTI2018-093849-B-C31 and TIN2015-71799-C2-2-P) and the Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI) (RED2018-102431-T).

Accelerating hazard threats to growing coastal communities compounds this problem, creating demand for more armoring. We examine whether designation by the U.S. Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) - enacted to disincentivize urban development on hazardous coastal barriers - is associated with lower propensities to armor shorelines. In designated areas, CBRA removes access to federally-subsidized flood insurance, infrastructure subsidies, and disaster assistance. Using logistic regression modeling, we examine armoring at the parcel scale across the State of Florida (USA), controlling for CBRA designation, land use, and local population density.

While the rights of Indigenous peoples are recognized internationally, these are not translated into adaptation responses. Using insights from theories of environmental justice in the case of Uganda's Batwa community, we assess how justice-related factors impact their adaptive capacities and whether these are incorporated in the design and implementation of adaptation responses. Our findings reveal a multi-dimensional range of systemic injustices experienced by Batwa, resulting from their continued social-economic, cultural and political marginalization. Additionally, a variety of projects are happening locally in relation to 'adaptation' but not labelled as such, suggesting how Batwa's vulnerability is rooted in wider aspects of livelihoods and development. Most projects tend to focus on distribution of material benefits, while less attention is paid to the more intricate issues of compensation, political discrimination and uneven participation. This depoliticized and compartmentalized approach suggests a slow and incomplete way of operationalizing justice. Hence, we call for sincere efforts to address recognition, rights, and disproportionate levels of disadvantage for Indigenous communities, including their constitutional recognition, financial redress and participation in decision-making.","[Satyal, Poshendra; Byskov, Morten Fibieger; Hyams, Keith] Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Satyal, Poshendra] BirdLife Int, Policy Team, Cambridge, England",University of Warwick; BirdLife International,"Satyal, P (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry, W Midlands, England.;Satyal, P (corresponding author), BirdLife Int, Policy Team, Cambridge, England.",poshendrasatyal@gmail.com,,,British Academy's Tackling UK's International Challenges Programme [IC2_100139],British Academy's Tackling UK's International Challenges Programme,This study was part of the Remedying Injustice in Indigenous Climate Adaptation Planning project in the Department of Politics and International Studies at the University of Warwick.

It stands to reason that this rise in awareness has an impact on the connection between clean energy prices and oil and technology stock prices. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by fitting an exogenous smooth transition regression model to the cycle of clean energy with oil and technology stock prices as exogenous regime driving variables before and after the Paris Agreement. After controlling for carbon price, market volatility, and policy uncertainty, we find that oil price has a stronger asymmetric persistence on the cycle of clean energy assets pre-Paris Agreement. In the period post Paris Agreement, however, the roles are reversed. Technology stock prices are the best regime drivers for clean energy assets with strong nonlinear asymmetric persistence, and the impact of oil price is completely absent. The superiority of technology stock prices over oil price in driving the cyclical behavior of clean energy assets supports our argument that the Paris Agreement and other recent climate-related events are contributing to the decoupling of the clean energy sector from traditional energy markets. Our findings are particularly important for climate mitigation and adaptation policies.","[Fahmy, Hany] Royal Rd Univ, Sch Business, Victoria, BC, Canada",,"Fahmy, H (corresponding author), Royal Rd Univ, Sch Business, Victoria, BC, Canada.",hany.fahmy@royalroads.ca,,"Fahmy, Hany/0000-0002-1221-1724",Royal Roads University [IGR21-07],Royal Roads University,"I would like to thank the Editor-in-chief, Prof. R.

Developing adaption and management strategies to ensure early stage and long-term tree-and root growth requires thorough knowledge about root zone soil-water dynamics at young urban street-tree sites. Therefore, we established a soil water potential (SWP) monitoring at 17 young urban street-tree sites in the city of Hamburg, Germany. Over four years (2016-2019) we measured and quantified critical soil water availability in the root ball, planting pit, and surrounding urban soil using a threshold value (SWP <-1200 hPa) and assessed the tree sites sensitivity towards meteorological variables, tree-and site characteristics using a data driven random forest model. During 2018 and 2019, average critical soil water availability in the root ball and planting pit occurred between three to five months per year, and the trees were exposed to pro-longed periods of critical soil-water availability for two consecutive years. After planting, critical soil water availability increasingly shifted year wise from the root ball into the entire planting pit as a consequence of root development and increasing water demand of the trees. Considering less usable water within the surrounding sandy soils, soil water in the planting pit may be depleted earlier and more rapidly with tree aging. The random forest model successfully predicted critical soil water availability and identified tree age as an important pre-dictor. Long-term (10-day) rainfall was the most important variable predicting the occurrence of critical soil water availability, suggesting a further extension of periods with critical soil water availability as rainy summer days are projected to decrease with climate change. Additionally we identified soil temperature as a more important predictor than air temperature as it reflects site specific characteristics affecting water-an energy balance. This study underlines the urgency to adapt the growing conditions of young urban street-trees in terms of sufficient water storage, and provides an approach for future application in tree site soil water management, to maintain their vitality under urbanization pressure and climate change.","[Schuett, Alexander; Becker, Joscha N.; Groengroeft, Alexander; Schaaf-Titel, Selina; Eschenbach, Annette] Univ Hamburg, Inst Soil Sci, CEN, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Schuett, A (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Soil Sci, CEN, Hamburg, Germany.",Alexander.Schuett@uni-hamburg.de,"Becker, Joscha N./HHS-0056-2022","Becker, Joscha N./0000-0002-3210-3632","Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Germany [03DAS153A]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany`s Excellence Strategy [EXC 2037 'CLICCS, 390683824]","Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Germany; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany`s Excellence Strategy(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This work was funded by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Germany, within the project Bodensubstrat und Baumartenwahl fur klimaangepasste Stadtbaumpflanzungen (BoBaSt) (funding code: 03DAS153A), and by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany`s Excellence Strategy -EXC 2037 'CLICCS -Climate, Climatic Change, and Society' -Project Number: 390683824, contribution to the Center for Earth System Research and Sustainability (CEN) of Universitat Hamburg.",,87,1,1,9,10,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1618-8667,1610-8167,,URBAN FOR URBAN GREE,Urban For.

They contain almost all global agricultural production, a major part of global tourism, and minor shares of industry and other services than tourism. Their generated value is more dependent on climate and extreme weather events than what is the case with urban value chains. Concepts of disaster vulnerability and disaster resilience to rural value chains are presented and followed by a system view on global rural value according to four income groups of countries. A different meaning of disasters becomes perceivable for each income group. We come up with four cases of successful in some aspects controversial alterations of global rural value chains: palm oil value chain in ASEAN, the sixth industry in Japan, rural tourism in Asia, and winter tourism in Austria and analyze the impacts of natural disasters in case studies. The business disturbances are manifold, complex, and not entirely adverse. The value at risk in a given location widely depends on the susceptibility of people and environment to a natural disaster, the costs to repair, and possibilities to innovate. Along with economic growth, disasters accelerate transformations in rural value chains and the strive to become more global while contracting in their local extensions.","[Breiling, Meinhard] Tech Univ Wien, TTL, Vienna, Austria",Technische Universitat Wien,"Breiling, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Wien, TTL, Vienna, Austria.",meinhard.breiling@tuwien.ac.at,,"Breiling, Meinhard/0000-0001-8354-2363",,,,,57,1,1,5,9,SPRINGER INDIA,NEW DELHI,"7TH FLOOR, VIJAYA BUILDING, 17, BARAKHAMBA ROAD, NEW DELHI, 110 001, INDIA",0972-5792,2199-6873,,J SOCIAL EC DEV,J.

Despite the existence of very high-resolution remote sensing technology for nearly two decades, comprehensive assessment of coral reef habitats at national to regional spatial scales and at very high spatial resolution is still scarce. Here, we develop benthic habitat maps at a sub-national scale by analyzing large multispectral QuickBird imagery dataset covering similar to 686 km(2) of the main shallow coral fringing reef along the southern border with Tanzania (4.68 degrees S, 39.18 degrees E) to the reef end at Malindi, Kenya (3.2 degrees S, 40.1 degrees E). Mapping was conducted with a user approach constrained by ground-truth data, with detailed transect lines from the shore to the fore reef. First, maps were used to evaluate the present management system's effectiveness at representing habitat diversity. Then, we developed three spatial prioritization scenarios based on differing objectives: (i) minimize lost fishing opportunity; (ii) redistribute fisheries away from currently overfished reefs; and (iii) minimize resource use conflicts. We further constrained the priority area in each prioritization selection scenario based on optionally protecting the least or the most climate exposed locations using a model of exposure to climate stress. We discovered that spatial priorities were very different based on the different objectives and on whether the aim was to protect the least or most climate-exposed habitats. Our analyses provide a spatially explicit foundation for large-scale conservation and management strategies that can account for ecosystem service benefits.","[Maina, Joseph M.; Jones, Kendall R.] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Maina, Joseph M.; McClanahan, Tim R.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Marine Programs, Bronx, NY 10460 USA; [Maina, Joseph M.; Watson, James E.

This paper outlines the evaluation of a developed web-based information system to support CBA, referred to as a Mountain Community Adaptive System (MCAS). The web-based user interface visualizes collated data from data providers, integrating it with near real-time climate and weather datasets. The interface provides more up-to-date information than was previously available on the environment, particularly on land and climate. MCAS, a cloud-based Land Information System (LIS), was developed using an Agile-inspired approach offering system creation based on bare minimum system requirements and iterative development. The system was tested against Fit-For-Purpose Land Administration (FFP LA) criteria to assess the effectiveness in a case from Nepal. The results illustrate that an MCAS-style system can provide useful information such as land use status, adaptation options, near real-time rainfall and temperature details, amongst others, to enable services that can enhance CBA activities. The information can facilitate improved CBA planning and implementation at the mountain community level. Despite the mentioned benefits of MCAS, ensuring system access was identified as a key limitation: smartphones and mobile technologies still remain prohibitively expensive for members of mountain communities, and underlying information communication technology (ICT) infrastructures remain under-developed in the assessed mountain communities. The results of the evaluation further suggest that the land-related aspects of climate change should be added to CBA initiatives. Similarly, existing LIS could have functionalities extended to include climate-related variables that impact on land use, tenure, and development.","[Khezri, Adish; Zevenbergen, Jaap] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Bennett, Rohan] Swinburne Univ Technol, Swinburne Business Sch, POB 218, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia",University of Twente; Swinburne University of Technology,"Khezri, A (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",a.khezri@utwente.nl; rohanbennett@swin.edu.au; j.a.zevenbergen@utwente.nl,"Bennett, Rohan/P-7289-2019; Bennett, Rohan/K-5086-2013","Bennett, Rohan/0000-0002-1200-2068; Khezri, Adish/0000-0003-1229-9356","Erasmus Mundus Action 2 Project SALAM, International Scholarship of the European Commission","Erasmus Mundus Action 2 Project SALAM, International Scholarship of the European Commission","This research was funded by Erasmus Mundus Action 2 Project SALAM, International Scholarship of the European Commission.",,47,5,5,0,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2220-9964,,ISPRS INT J GEO-INF,ISPRS Int.

Urban challenges such as air pollution, noise and heat can be moderated by urban green space (UGS), simultaneously providing multiple other services. However, available methods to quantify ES cannot typically deal with the high spatial and thematic resolution land cover data that are needed to better understand ES supply in the urban context. This study derives methods to quantify and map a bundle of six ES as supplied by UGS, using land cover data with high spatial and thematic resolution, and applies these to the city of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Land cover data comprise eight classes of UGS. Methods are derived from an evidence base on the importance of UGS types for the supply of each of the six ES that was built using literature review. The evidence base reveals that UGS types differ in their contribution to various ES, although the strength of the evidence varies. However, existing indicators for urban ES often do not discriminate between UGS types. To derive UGS-specific indicators, we combined methods and evidence from different research contexts (ES, non-ES, urban, non-urban). Rotterdam shows high spatial variation in the amount of UGS present, and accounting for this in ES supply reveals that ES bundles depend on UGS composition and configuration. While the contribution of UGS types to ES supply differed markedly with UGS type and ES considered, we demonstrate that synergies rather than trade-offs exist among the ES analysed.Synthesis and applications. Our findings underline the importance of a careful design of urban green space (UGS) in city planning for ecosystem services (ES) provision. Based on the latest insights on how different UGS provide ES, the methods presented in this study enable a more detailed quantification and mapping of the supply of ES in cities, allowing assessments of current supply of key urban ES and alternative urban designs. Such knowledge is indispensable in the quest for designing healthier and climate-resilient cities.

Such knowledge is indispensable in the quest for designing healthier and climate-resilient cities.","[Derkzen, Marthe L.; van Teeffelen, Astrid J.

In many countries, National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) are charged with providing climate services to diverse audiences. Climate services are important to foster adaptation to climate risks and in reducing vulnerability in developing world contexts. However, the production and delivery of user-oriented climate services place new burdens on NMHSs and require new skillsets, partnerships, and infrastructure. In this paper, we assess the capabilities of 22 NMHSs in Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to understand whether and how NMHSs are fit for the purpose of providing climate services. Our assessment is framed around the five core pillars of the World Meteorological Organizations Global Framework for Climate Services. We find that the NMHSs face key capacity gaps in the technical production, translation, transfer, and facilitation of the use of climate information. Some of these gaps have historical roots and relate to the overarching legal, political, and institutional settings in which NMHSs were established and currently operate. Others relate to an increased emphasis on users in ways that contrast with traditional NMHSs' engagement with stakeholders. These results suggest that investments that support the co-production of climate information while also addressing prevailing legal, political, and institutional disconnects and human resource constraints can strengthen the provision of climate services in Caribbean SIDS.","[Mahon, Roche; Cox, Shelly-Ann; Petrie, Jodi-Ann; Trotman, Adrian; Van Meerbeeck, Cedric J.; Scott, Wazita; Farrell, David] Caribbean Inst Meteorol & Hydrol, Husbands, St James, Barbados; [Greene, Christina; Gerlak, Andrea K.; Liverman, Diana] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ USA; [Guido, Zack] Univ Arizona, Inst Environm, Tucson, AZ USA; [Guido, Zack] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ USA; [Gerlak, Andrea K.] Univ Arizona, Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ USA; [Cox, Shelly-Ann] Univ West Indies, Ctr Resource Management & Environm Studies CERMES, Wanstead, Barbados; [Scott, Wazita] Scuola Univ Super IUSS Pavia, Pavia, Italy",University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Cave Hill Campus; IUSS PAVIA,"Mahon, R (corresponding author), Caribbean Inst Meteorol & Hydrol CIMH, POB 130, Husbands, St James, Barbados.",rmahon@cimh.edu.bb; cgreene@ema.arizona.edu; zguido@email.arizona.edu; agerlak@email.arizona.edu; jpetrie@cimh.edu.bb; atrotman@cimh.edu.bb; liverman@email.arizona.edu; cmeerbeeck@cimh.edu.bb; wazita.scott@iusspavia.it; dfarrell@cimh.edu.bb,,"Greene, Christina/0000-0003-3767-0932; Mahon, Roche/0000-0001-9621-7033; Guido, Zack/0000-0002-4817-606X",United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) Programme for Building Regional Climate Capacity in the Caribbean (BRCCC Programme); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [NA130AR4310184]; USAID under the International Research and Applications Project (IRAP),United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) Programme for Building Regional Climate Capacity in the Caribbean (BRCCC Programme)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); USAID under the International Research and Applications Project (IRAP),"The authors would like to thank the Caribbean NMHSs for their participation in this study.

Today's inhabitants of Santorini have largely abandoned the traditional cisterns that were used to sustain the island's pre-modern civilizations in favor of water obtained from desalinization, ship deliveries, and well withdrawals. In June 2016, Cornell University researchers worked with the Water and Sewage Authority of Thera (DEYATH) to assess the viability of improving sustainability and water efficiency by restoring traditional rainwater harvesting and storage cisterns. The team surveyed five cisterns, held meetings with water authority staff and mayoral leadership, conducted interviews with local tourism stakeholders, and coordinated with Global Water Partnership-Mediterranean. One conclusion was that cisterns could be rehabilitated as decentralized storage reservoirs and integrated into the island's centralized water systems, or alternatively, serve as educational and cultural spaces used to communicate the importance of water to residents and tourists.

Over more than two decades, Australia's water reforms have explicitly aimed to promote ecological sustainability and economic efficiency, attempting to balance pro-market, micro-economic reforms with broader social and sustainability goals. Despite the formality of Australia's intergovernmental agreements, water reforms have been expensive and heavily contested, experiencing many implementation challenges. However, water market reforms have generally been regarded as successful, enabling the reallocation of water for environmental and extractive uses, contributing to flexibility and adaptive capacity. Recognising that discursive contestation is central to policy development, the paper documents the way the reform processes have attempted to broker compromises between three competing policy paradigms-national development, economic rationalism and environmentalism. These inherent tensions resulted in prolonged contests for influence over policy directions long after formal statements of policy intent by Governments. Given that climate change is driving the need for water governance reforms, the paper looks to what lessons can be learnt about the redesigns of meta-governance arrangements, including through structured commitments to independent audits and evaluations that can provide the feedback needed for adaptive governance and policy learning.","[Alexandra, Jason] Alexandra & Associates, 16 Homestead Rd Eltham, Melbourne, Vic 3095, Australia; [Alexandra, Jason] RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Alexandra, J (corresponding author), Alexandra & Associates, 16 Homestead Rd Eltham, Melbourne, Vic 3095, Australia.;Alexandra, J (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",jasonandmargalexandra@gmail.com,,,,,,,70,30,30,0,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,FEB,2018,10,2,,,,,,,113,10.3390/w10020113,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10020113,,,18,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,FY4ES,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000426775500023,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study uses a stochastic cyclone modelling approach to evaluate the likelihoods of storm tides, the combination of storm surges and astronomical tides, for Samoa. Cyclones that occurred in the vicinity of Samoa from 1969 to 2009 are used to build a stochastic tropical cyclone data set, and an analytic cyclone model and hydrodynamic model are used to model storm tides under average, La Nia and El Nio cyclone and sea level conditions for present climate conditions as well as cyclone and sea level conditions relevant for 2055, and storm tide return periods are estimated. We find that extreme storm tides exhibit relatively modest variation around the coastline of Samoa owing to the uniform width of the shelf surrounding the coastlines of two main islands of Savai'i and Upolu. The frequency of cyclones and hence storm tides during El Nio conditions is similar to the frequency for all seasons, but is considerably lower in La Nia conditions. For the future, tropical cyclones are assumed to undergo decreased frequency and increased intensity. This is found to lower the storm tide height for return periods < 100 years and increase it for return periods greater than about 200 years. Sea level rise is shown to have a larger influence on storm tides than future changes to tropical cyclones. Considering the aggregated probabilities of storm tides occurring at the national scale, we find that the likelihood of a storm tide occurring that locally exceeds a 1-in-100-year level (i.e. an event with a 1 % annual exceedance probability) has a 6 % probability of occurring somewhere along the entire coastline of Samoa. Such information may be useful for those involved in coastal management and disaster response for which there may be a need to consider the overall likelihood that a nation may have to respond to such a disaster.","[McInnes, Kathleen L.; Hoeke, Ron K.; O'Grady, Julian G.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, CAWCR Ctr Australian Weather & Climate Res, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia; [Walsh, Kevin J.

Extreme heat, extended freeze, excessive precipitation, and/or prolong drought impacts neighborhoods disproportionately across heterogenous urban geographies. Underserved, underrepresented, and marginalized communities are more likely to bear the burden of increased exposure to adverse climate impacts while simultaneously facing power asymmetries in access to the policy and knowledge production process. Knowledge co-production is one framework that seeks to address this convergence of disproportionate climate impact exposure and disenfranchised communities. Co-production is increasingly used in sustainability and resilience research to ask questions and develop solutions with, by, and for those communities that are most impacted. By weaving research, planning, evaluation, and policy in an iterative cycle, knowledge and action can be more closely coupled. However, the practice of co-production often lacks reflexivity in ways that can transform the science and policy of urban resilience to address equity more directly. With this, we ask what kind of co-production mechanism encourage academic and non-academic partners to reflect and scrutinize their underlying assumptions, existing institutional arrangements, and practices? How can these efforts identify and acknowledge the contradictions of co-production to reduce climate impacts in vulnerable communities? This paper presents a framework for reflexive co-production and assesses three modes of co-production for urban resilience in Austin, Texas, USA. These include a multi-hazard risk mapping initiative, a resident-driven community indicator system for adaptive capacity, and a neighborhood household preparedness guide. We establish a set of functional and transformational criteria from which to evaluate co-production and assess each initiative across the criteria. We conclude with some recommendations that can advance reflexive co-production for urban resilience.","[Bixler, R.

Without rainfall during summer, residents and land managers commonly turn to streams and adjacent shallow aquifers to meet domestic, irrigation, and recreational water needs, often depleting the water necessary to support stream biota. The potential for adverse ecological impacts within this coupled natural-human system has led to interest in restoring summer base flow (especially for federally protected steelhead and coho salmon, which depend on flow through the summer dry season for juvenile survival) through methods such as reducing dry-season water abstractions. Characterizing constraints and opportunities has proven useful for planning streamflow restoration in Mediterranean-climate coastal California. Biophysical parameters such as ample rainfall and very low summer discharge are critical considerations, but institutional parameters are equally important: regional management practices and state laws can inhibit streamflow restoration, and implementation is dependent on interrelationships among residents, agency staff, and other stakeholders (which we term the egosystem) within each watershed. Additionally, while watershed-scale spatial analysis and field-based evaluations provided a solid foundation for exploring streamflow restoration needs, adaptation based on information from local stakeholders was often essential for prioritizing projects and understanding whether projects will have their intended benefits.","[Deitch, Matthew J.] Univ Florida, Soil & Water Sci Dept, IFAS West Florida Res & Educ Ctr, Milton, FL 32583 USA; [Dolman, Brock] Occidental Arts & Ecol Ctr WATER Inst, Occidental, CA 95465 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Deitch, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Soil & Water Sci Dept, IFAS West Florida Res & Educ Ctr, Milton, FL 32583 USA.",mdeitch@ufl.edu; brock@oaec.org,,"Deitch, Matthew/0000-0002-9716-8007","California State Coastal Conservancy; National Fish and Wildlife Foundation through its Russian River Coho Salmon Keystone Initiative [19137, 26020, 30513, 36529, 41344]",California State Coastal Conservancy; National Fish and Wildlife Foundation through its Russian River Coho Salmon Keystone Initiative,"We are grateful for financial support from the California State Coastal Conservancy, and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation through its Russian River Coho Salmon Keystone Initiative (Grants #19137, #26020, #30513, #36529, and #41344); and in particular, Michael Bowen, Jim Sedell, Claire Thorp, Mike Chrisman, and David Lawrence, for their support of these projects.

Since 2010, the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) has been publishing annual Global Landscape of Climate Finance reports. According to these reports, US$3660 billion has been spent on global climate change projects over the period 2011-2018. Fifty-five percent of this expenditure has gone to wind and solar energy. According to world energy reports, the contribution of wind and solar to world energy consumption has increased from 0.5% to 3% over this period. Meanwhile, coal, oil, and gas continue to supply 85% of the world's energy consumption, with hydroelectricity and nuclear providing most of the remainder. With this in mind, we consider the potential engineering challenges and environmental and socioeconomic impacts of the main energy sources (old and new). We find that the literature raises many concerns about the engineering feasibility as well as environmental impacts of wind and solar. However, none of the current or proposed energy sources is a panacea. Rather, each technology has pros and cons, and policy-makers should be aware of the cons as well as the pros when making energy policy decisions. We urge policy-makers to identify which priorities are most important to them, and which priorities they are prepared to compromise on.","[OhAiseadha, Coilin] Dr Steevens Hosp, Dept Publ Hlth, Hlth Serv Execut, Dublin D08 W2A8 8, Ireland; [Quinn, Gerre] Ulster Univ, Ctr Mol Biosci, Coleraine BT5 21SA, Londonderry, North Ireland; [Connolly, Ronan; Soon, Willie] Ctr Environm Res & Earth Sci CERES, Salem, MA 01970 USA",Ulster University,"OhAiseadha, C (corresponding author), Dr Steevens Hosp, Dept Publ Hlth, Hlth Serv Execut, Dublin D08 W2A8 8, Ireland.",coilin.ohaiseadha@hse.ie; g.quinn@ulster.ac.uk; ronan@ceres-science.com; michael@ceres-science.com; willie@ceres-science.com,"Connolly, Ronan/ABC-8677-2020","Connolly, Ronan/0000-0001-5843-3544; Quinn, Gerry/0000-0003-0023-2621; OhAiseadha, Coilin/0000-0003-4243-1493",Center for Environmental Research and Earth Sciences (CERES),Center for Environmental Research and Earth Sciences (CERES),"C.O., G.Q., and M.C. received no external funding for works on this paper.

This paper describes how inundation modelling was used to engage local stakeholders about climate change and adaptation, for a town (Yarmouth) on the UK south coast. This included a participatory visualisation exercise using three extreme sea level scenarios, informed by a recent flood event. Further analysis, informed by the repeated floods during the 2013/14 storm surge season, placed these scenarios in a broader perspective across a range of events. Results indicate that coastal flooding may become a significant issue during this century due to sea-level rise, unless there is adaptation. These methods engaged the interest of the community, and this paper presents practical considerations for future studies. A similar approach could be applied widely at the community level and form an important component of coastal flood management, including planning responses to sea-level rise. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To reduce the impacts of such acute climate-change hazards and safeguard development, national decision-makers require evidence on where and how hazards affect SDG achievement to better inform adaptation. Here, we develop a systems methodology that spatially models the impacts of climate-change hazards across a nation's entire built and natural environment assets and its interdependent influences on the SDG targets to inform national adaptation. We apply our methodology in Saint Lucia through a participatory approach with decision-makers across 18 government ministries, academia, and the private sector. Results reveal that acute climate-change hazards can affect half of Saint Lucia's assets across 22 sectors, which can influence 89% of all SDG targets. Application of our methodology provided evidence on where and how to prioritise adaptation, thereby helping to add spatial granularity to 52 measures under Saint Lucia's National Adaptation Plan (NAP) as well as specificity on how limited capacity for cross-sectoral coordination can be directed to safeguard SDG targets. Adaptation does not necessarily imply investing in physical asset protection: results show the need to protect critical natural environments which provide important adaptation services to the built environment. As more nations develop and revise their NAPs and Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement, strategic planning across sectors - as demonstrated in Saint Lucia - will be critical to facilitate adaptation that safeguards SDG achievement.","[Fuldauer, Lena, I; Thacker, Scott; Hall, Jim W.] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Thacker, Scott] UN Off Project Serv UNOPS, Marmorvej 51, DK-2050 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Oxford,"Fuldauer, LI (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",lena.fuldauer@eci.ox.ac.uk,,"Fuldauer, Lena I./0000-0002-2113-3334","UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/N017064/1, EP/N509711/1]; United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS)",UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS),"This research was conducted at the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford and was supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council by grants EP/N017064/1 and EP/N509711/1 as well as the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS).

Using a suite of low-tech and low-cost techniques, small-scale MAR increases the infiltration of surface water runoff to replenish groundwater and deliver a suite of societal and ecosystem benefits. While the technique is hydrologically promising, populations may not act, implementation may not be permitted, interventions may not be effective for the population in question, or unexpected consequences (paradoxes) may result. For small-scale MAR to effectively reduce the experience of drought, it is imperative to unravel how such interventions play out within the complexity of the sociohydrological system in which they are implemented. Building on previous conceptualizations of the sociohydrological system, we apply the lens of political ecology to conceptualize the interplay between biophysical, climate, and social systems. Additionally, we explore considerations, feedbacks, and potential paradoxes in the uptake, implementation, and effectiveness of small-scale MAR interventions. We show that within the parameters of climate trends, small-scale MAR may serve to increase the functionality of ecosystems and reduce the impact of climate extremes, while protecting livelihoods and supporting society. In a positive feedback loop, small-scale MAR may both reduce the likelihood of experiencing drought while simultaneously increasing the ability and likelihood of the population to cope with or further avoid drought. Paradoxes and negative feedback processes, however, must be avoided. Specific factors, and how such factors interplay, will be different in each context where small-scale MAR is implemented. Conceptualizing the sociohydrological system in which small-scale MAR is implemented, including explicitly accounting for climate trends and using a power-sensitive approach, allows us to avoid overestimating or oversimplifying small-scale MAR as a solution, while supporting practical and effective implementation.","[Basel, Britt] Ecothropic, Cimarron, CO 81220 USA; [Basel, Britt] Ecothrop Mexico AC, San Cristobal De Las Casa, Mexico; [Basel, Britt; Hoogesteger, Jaime; Hellegers, Petra] Wageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Water Resources Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Basel, B (corresponding author), Ecothropic, Cimarron, CO 81220 USA.;Basel, B (corresponding author), Ecothrop Mexico AC, San Cristobal De Las Casa, Mexico.;Basel, B (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Water Resources Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",brittbasel@ecothropic.com,,,,,,,95,0,0,2,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9375,,FRONT WATER,Front.

The reasons for this increase and range expansion remain largely unknown due to the complexity of the transmission pathways and underlying disease drivers. In a first, we use advanced artificial intelligence to disentangle the contribution of eco-climatic drivers to WNV-outbreaks across Europe using decade long (2010-2019) data at high spatial resolution. Methods We use a high-performance machine learning classifier, XGBoost (eXtreme gradient boosting) combined with state-of-the-art XAI (eXplainable artificial intelligence) methodology to describe the predictive ability and contribution of different drivers of the emergence and transmission of WNV-outbreaks in Europe, respectively. Findings Our model, trained on 2010-2017 data achieved an AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) score of 0.97 and 0.93 when tested with 2018 and 2019 data, respectively, showing a high discriminatory power to classify a WNV-endemic area. Overall, positive summer/spring temperatures anomalies, lower water availability index (NDWI), and drier winter conditions were found to be the main determinants of WNV-outbreaks across Europe. The climate trends of the preceding year in combination with eco-climatic predictors of the first half of the year provided a robust predictive ability of the entire transmission season ahead of time. For the extraordinary 2018 outbreak year, relatively higher spring temperatures and the abundance of Culex mosquitoes were the strongest predictors, in addition to past climatic trends. Interpretation Our AI-based framework can be deployed to trigger rapid and timely alerts for active surveillance and vector control measures in order to intercept an imminent WNV-outbreak in Europe.

Urban green space can retard the UHI effect. However, most existing studies have only focused on hot regions, while little attention has been given to cold regions that also have summer heat protection requirements. Furthermore, existing researc has not classified urban green spaces according to the presence or absence of water, which can lead to inaccurate results. This paper takes four cities in cold regions of China as examples and studies the cooling effects of two different types of urban green space. The results indicate that in cold regions of China, green spaces containing water bodies have a stronger cooling effect than those without water. For green spaces without water, the cooling intensity is related to the background temperature and green space areas, while for green spaces containing water bodies, the area of the internal water body is the key influencing factor. Specifically, there is a threshold value of efficiency (TVoE) for the green space areas without water in cold region cities of China, which is approximately 0.52 ha, while there is no TVoE for the green space areas containing water bodies. Additionally, there is a TVoE for the water/land ratio of the green spaces containing water bodies of approximately 0.5. The methods and results of this study can provide a reference for future research and for urban planners and managers designing urban green spaces.","[Pang, Bo; Zhao, Jingyuan; Zhang, Jianxin; Yang, Li] Changan Univ, Dept Architecture, Xian 701164, Peoples R China",Chang'an University,"Zhao, JY (corresponding author), Changan Univ, Dept Architecture, Xian 701164, Peoples R China.",zjytougao@outlook.com,,,"Project Funding To Scientific Research Innovation Team of Shaanxi Provincial Universities [2020TD-029]; Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province [2021SF-464]; Shaanxi National Science Foundation [2019JM-475]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [300102411401, 300102411610]",Project Funding To Scientific Research Innovation Team of Shaanxi Provincial Universities; Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province; Shaanxi National Science Foundation; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),This work was financially supported by the Project Funding To Scientific Research Innovation Team of Shaanxi Provincial Universities (No.2020TD-029) and the Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province (No.2021SF-464) and Shaanxi National Science Foundation (No. 2019JM-475) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 300102411401;No. 300102411610).,,76,2,2,31,57,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1083-8155,1573-1642,,URBAN ECOSYST,Urban Ecosyst.,AUG,2022,25,4,,,,,1181,1198,,10.1007/s11252-022-01202-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-022-01202-1,,MAR 2022,18,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Urban Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,2Y8WF,,Green Submitted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000767069800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this context, recent scholarly attention has been paid to gentrification, real-estate speculation and resident displacement in the context of sustainability and green planning in the global North. Yet we know little about the environmental-justice implications of green infrastructure planning in the context of self-built settlements of the global South. To what extent do green infrastructure interventions produce or exacerbate urban socio-spatial inequities in self-built settlements? Through the analysis of a greenbelt project, an emblematic case of green infrastructure planning in Medellin, we argue that, as the Municipality of Medellin is containing and beautifying low-income neighborhoods through grabbing part of their territories and turning them into green landscapes of privilege and pleasure, communities are becoming dispossessed of their greatest assets-location, land and social capital. In the process, community land is transformed into a new form of aesthetically controlled and ordered nature for the middle and upper classes and for tourists. By contrast, communities' planning alternatives reveal how green planning can better address growth and climate risks in tandem with equitable community development.","[Anguelovski, Isabelle] ICREA, Passeig Lluis Companys 23, Barcelona 08010, Spain; [Irazabal-Zurita, Clara] Univ Missouri Kansas City, Architecture Urban Planning & Design, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Connolly, James J.

Such uncertainty creates challenges for livestock managers seeking to match herbivore numbers with forage availability to prevent vegetation degradation and optimize livestock production. Here, we assess variation in annual large herbivore production (LHP, kg/ha) across multiple herbivore densities over a 78-yr period (1940-2018) in a semiarid rangeland ecosystem (shortgrass steppe of eastern Colorado, USA) that has experienced several phase changes in global-level sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, as measured by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We examined the influence of prevailing PDO phase, magnitude of late winter (February-April) ENSO, prior growing-season precipitation (prior April to prior September) and precipitation during the six months (prior October to current April) preceding the growing season on LHP. All of these are known prior to the start of the growing season in the shortgrass steppe and could potentially be used by livestock managers to adjust herbivore densities. Annual LHP was greater during warm PDO irrespective of herbivore density, while variance in LHP increased by 69% (moderate density) and 91% (high density) under cold-phase compared to warm-phase PDO. No differences in LHP attributed to PDO phase were observed with low herbivore density. ENSO effects on LHP, specifically La Nina, were more pronounced during cold-phase PDO years. High herbivore density increased LHP at a greater rate than at moderate and low densities with increasing fall and winter precipitation. Differential gain, a weighted measure of LHP under higher relative to lower herbivore densities, was sensitive to prevailing PDO phase, ENSO magnitude, and precipitation amounts from the prior growing season and current fall-winter season. Temporal hierarchical approaches using PDO, ENSO, and local-scale precipitation can enhance decision-making for flexible herbivore densities. Herbivore densities could be increased above recommended levels with lowered risk of negative returns for managers during warm-phase PDO to result in greater LHP and less variability. Conversely, during cold-phase PDO, managers should be cognizant of the additional influences of ENSO and prior fall-winter precipitation, which can help predict when to reduce herbivore densities and minimize risk of forage shortages.","[Raynor, Edward J.; Hoover, David L.; Augustine, David J.] USDA ARS, Rangeland Resources & Syst Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Derner, Justin D.] USDA ARS, Rangeland Resources & Syst Res Unit, Cheyenne, WY 82009 USA; [Parton, William J.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Colorado State University,"Raynor, EJ (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Rangeland Resources & Syst Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA.",edwardraynor@gmail.com,"Raynor, Edward/J-8717-2015","Raynor, Edward/0000-0003-2483-4694; Hoover, David/0000-0002-9326-9791; Derner, Justin/0000-0001-8076-0736",,,,,69,11,11,1,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

This study aimed to identify the current knowledge base, evidence gaps, and implications for climate action and health policymaking to address the health impact of climate change, including in the most underserved groups. Methods: The Horizon-funded project ENBEL ('Enhancing Belmont Research Action to support EU policy making on climate change and health') organised a workshop at the 2021-European Public Health conference. Following presentations of mitigation and adaptation strategies, seven international researchers and public health experts participated in a panel discussion linking climate change and health. Two researchers transcribed and thematically analysed the panel discussion recording. Results: Four themes were identified: (1) 'Evidence is key' in leading the climate debate, (2) the need for 'messaging about health for policymaking and behaviour change' including health co-benefits of climate action, (3) existing 'inequalities between and within countries', and (4) 'insufficient resources and funding' to implement national health adaptation plans and facilitate evidence generation and climate action, particularly in vulnerable populations. Conclusion: More capacity is needed to monitor health effects and inequities, evaluate adaptation and mitigation interventions, address current under-representations of low- or middle-income countries, and translate research into effective policymaking.","[Jabakhanji, Samira Barbara; Stanistreet, Debbi] RCSI Univ Med & Hlth Sci, Sch Populat Hlth, Dept Publ Hlth & Epidemiol, 123 St Stephens Green, Dublin D02 YN77, Ireland; [Arnold, Stephen Robert] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Aunan, Kristin] CICERO Ctr Int Climate Res, N-0318 Oslo, Norway; [Chersich, Matthew Francis] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Publ Hlth, ZA-2000 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Jakobsson, Kristina] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [McGushin, Alice] UCL, Inst Global Hlth, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Kelly, Ina] Irish Med Org, Dublin D02 Y322, Ireland; [Kelly, Ina] Hlth Serv Execut, Publ Hlth Med Environm & Hlth Grp, Dublin D08 W2A8, Ireland; [Roche, Niall] Trinity Coll Dublin, Ctr Global Hlth, Dublin D02 PN40, Ireland; [Stauffer, Anne] Hlth & Environm Alliance, B-1210 Brussels, Belgium",University of Leeds; University of Witwatersrand; University of Gothenburg; University of London; University College London; Trinity College Dublin,"Jabakhanji, SB (corresponding author), RCSI Univ Med & Hlth Sci, Sch Populat Hlth, Dept Publ Hlth & Epidemiol, 123 St Stephens Green, Dublin D02 YN77, Ireland.",samirabjabakhanji@rcsi.ie,,"Jakobsson, Kristina/0000-0002-4543-3235; chersich, matthew/0000-0002-4320-9168; Jabakhanji, Samira/0000-0002-4870-9110; Aunan, Kristin/0000-0002-7865-9134; Stanistreet, Debbi/0000-0003-3738-1727",European Union [101003966],European Union(European Commission),"The organisation and conduct of the workshop described in this manuscript were funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no. 101003966; project title Enhancing Belmont Research Action to support EU policy making on climate change and health (ENBEL).

The current flood adaptation approach is failing to take advantage of the benefits provided by intact ecosystems and perpetuates social and economic inequities, leaving those who are most vulnerable at highest risk. Rooted in the experiences of the United States, we propose a new framework, the Flood Adaptation Hierarchy, which prioritizes outcomes into six tiers. Overall, the tiers distinguish between nature and nature-based solutions, with preference given to natural ecosystems. The most important outcome in our hierarchy is to avoid risk by protecting and restoring natural floodplains; next, eliminate risk by moving communities away from danger; and then to accommodate water with passive measures and active risk reduction measures. We include, but deprioritize, a defense of community assets using nature-based engineering and hardened engineering. Throughout the hierarchy, we provide guidance on the equity considerations of flood adaptation decision making and highlight impacts, resources, and voices as important equity dimensions. Implementing the framework through an iterative process, using justification criteria to manage movement among tiers, alongside equity considerations, will support adaptation to changing environmental and social conditions and contribute to risk reduction at scale. Though this approach is focused on U.S. flood management and adaptation, prioritizing risk reduction, elimination of risk, and accommodation of hazards over the defense against threats not only has global applicability to flood adaptation, but should also be evaluated for applicability to other climate-driven challenges.",,,,,,,,,,,143,0,0,8,8,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

Although effects of one or more outdoor weather parameters are sometimes mimicked by means of dynamic schedules, they never fully reproduce the complex interactions of the stochastic processes typical of real climate. The present work introduces improved measurement procedures to determine the solar factor under dynamic conditions, applicable to outdoor test cell experiments and which take into account the variation of internal energy in the control volume. An in-depth uncertainty analysis has been conducted in order to highlight the most relevant uncertainty sources and to suggest improvements to the measurement techniques. Based on an iterative application of the uncertainty analysis, we developed and optimised two new strategies to extract and measure the solar load entering through a test sample and a new design concept of test cell facility, which allows the configuration to be adapted according to various test objectives. In order to accurately analyse the storage and delay effects of the thermal capacities within the control volume of the calorimeter, lumped-parameter models of three alternative designs (the two proposed strategies and a reference, traditional one) have been developed and coded in Matlab. The simulation results suggest that, compared to a traditional solution, the two proposed solutions offer a higher measurement accuracy and measurement precision in the determination of the solar factor. In addition, the results indicate that rapidly variable solar irradiance levels are detrimental to the accuracy level of the solar factor measurement; therefore tests should be carried out under stable clear sky conditions.
