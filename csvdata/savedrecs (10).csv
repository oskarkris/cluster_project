This paper describes our attempts to explore the influence of workplace green features (such as green certification, ventilation mode, and building morphology) on health perceptions (personal sensation, sensorial assumptions, healing performance) based on a survey in Hong Kong and Singapore. The results validated the relationship between green features and health perceptions in the workplace environment. Remarkably, participants from the air-conditioned offices revealed significant higher concerns about health issues than those participants from the mixed-ventilated offices. The mixed-ventilation design performs as a bridge to connect the indoor environment and outdoor space, which enables people to have contact with nature. Additionally, the preferred building morphology of the workplace is the pattern of a building complex instead of a single building. The complex form integrates the configuration of courtyards, podium gardens, green terrace, public plaza, and other types of open spaces with the building clusters, which contributes to better health perceptions. This research contributes to the rationalization and optimization of passive climate-adaptive design strategies for green buildings in high-density tropical or subtropical cities.","[Xue, Fei; Lau, Stephen Siu Yu] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Design & Environm, 21 Lower Kent Ridge Rd, Singapore 117566, Singapore; [Gou, Zhonghua] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Cities Res Ctr, Parklands Dr, Gold Coast, Qld 4215, Australia",National University of Singapore; Griffith University,"Gou, ZH (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Cities Res Ctr, Parklands Dr, Gold Coast, Qld 4215, Australia.",sdexf@nus.edu.sg; z.gou@griffith.edu.au; stephenlau@nus.edu.sg,"Gou, Zhonghua/H-5621-2019","Gou, Zhonghua/0000-0001-9627-4724",University of Hong Kong; National University of Singapore,University of Hong Kong(University of Hong Kong); National University of Singapore(National University of Singapore),The authors express gratitude to the University of Hong Kong and National University of Singapore for scholarships and fellowships to enable raw data collection in the two cities.

Along 450 km of a selected dune ridge, 24 cross-sections reveal both a south-north change in modern and palaeo-processes and a change in palaeo-climate. The southern longitudinal draa (megadunes) were modelled by strong Pleistocene trade winds from sands most probably derived from weathered native sandstone, and were stabilized during an Early Holocene humid phase. Following aridisation, aeolian sands - probably in the form of barchan dunes - migrated some tens of kilometers farther south. The unique northern megadunes are probably transverse draa modelled during the Pleistocene by dry(!) extra-tropical westerlies. As a result of the aridisation following the humid phase, all of the draa sands, as opposed to the dune sands, are saline. The modem dunes (silk type), sitting between the draa in the north and on top of the draa in the south, reflect the bimodal wind system with a main component shifting from strong westerlies in the north to northern winds in the south.

In terms of dairy farming, it affects milk yield, quality, animal health, growth, reproduction, forage crops and rangelands. These effects are not only technically, but also socio-economically important, and adaptation is necessary to minimise losses. In this context, the purposes of this research are threefold. The first is to demonstrate how dairy farmers in the Thrace region are affected by climate change; the second is to investigate the adaptation methods they use to minimise farm-level negative effects and finally, to analyse the farm and farmer specific factors that determine the likelihood of adaptation. A total of 140 interviews with dairy farmers were carried out and logistic regression was used to investigate factors affecting their adaptation behaviour. One-third of the farmers changed the feed ration and using supplementary nutrients, while one-fourth of them used cooling systems. The logistic regression model showed that whether the farmer has non-agricultural income, education level, farm-scale, knowledge of climate change and whether children work in the farm were statistically significant factors for adaptation. In conclusion, extension services are recommended to inform smallholder farmers and raise awareness for adaptation by the middle-aged and elderly farmers.","[Koc, Gokce; Uzmay, Ayse] Ege Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-35100 Izmir, Bornova, Turkey",Ege University,"Koc, G (corresponding author), Ege Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-35100 Izmir, Bornova, Turkey.",gkc_add@hotmail.com; ayse.uzmay@ege.edu.tr,"KOÇ, Gökçe/M-1524-2015","KOÇ, Gökçe/0000-0002-3719-3390",Ege University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit [2016-ZRF-054],Ege University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit(Ege University),This study is supported by Ege University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit (Project Number 2016-ZRF-054).,,103,0,0,5,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

This study models a community water supply system as a distributed adaptation measure for decreasing the loading of the centralized water supply system. The modeled community water supply system addresses both supply and demand at the community scale using constructed wetlands, rainwater harvesting systems, household storage, and paddy fields. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a community water supply system in various climate change scenarios using three performance indicators: water saving efficiency (WSE), tolerance duration (TD), and water use efficiency (WUE). A low-frequency weather generator (LF-WGEN) was proposed and used to produce future weather data for evaluating the impacts of climate change. LF-WGEN generates future weather data based on climate scenarios derived from the outputs of general circulation models (GCMs, such as HadGEM2-AO and CSIRO-Mk3-6-0) which project current and future climate based on different representative concentration pathways (RCPs). The results indicate that low impact development (LID) modules have better performance in the first growth period and may maintain domestic functionality under climate change. All indicators show positive correlations with rainfall in most of the climate scenarios. However, with slight decreases in predicted rainfall, the WUE and WSEagri showed negative correlations to rainfall in the RCP 2.6 HadGEM2-AO and RCP 4.5 CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 climate scenarios. This could be due the lower number of consecutive dry days predicted by the LF-WGEN causing a slightly increased wetland inflow that would then decrease the irrigation water supply. Overall, the community water supply system showed strong performance in the various climate scenarios. Further study of the community water supply system needs to include an optimization of adaptation measures for practical applications.","[Li, Yuan-Hua; Tung, Ching-Pin; Li, Yuan-Hung; Chen, Pei-Yuan] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioenvironm Syst Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Tung, CP (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioenvironm Syst Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",cptung@ntu.edu.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology [105-2313-B-002-025-MY3],"Ministry of Science and Technology(Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)",This research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology (Contract No. 105-2313-B-002-025-MY3).,,16,1,1,2,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1611-2490,1611-2504,,PADDY WATER ENVIRON,Paddy Water Environ.,JAN,2018,16,1,,,,,55,69,,10.1007/s10333-017-0613-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-017-0613-z,,,15,Agricultural Engineering; Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,FX8DY,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000426322400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Reforestation and agroforestry options for environmental benefits, carbon sequestration, economic development and biodiversity conservation are now important considerations of land use planners. New information has been collected and regionally-calibrated models have been developed to facilitate better regional land use planning decisions and counter the limitations of currently available models of reforestation productivity and carbon sequestration. Surveys of above-ground biomass of 264 reforestation sites (132 woodlots, 132 environmental plantings) within the agricultural regions of South Australia were conducted, and combined with spatial information on climate and soils, to develop new spatial and temporal models of plant density and above-ground biomass productivity from reforestation. The models can be used to estimate productivity and total carbon sequestration (i.e. aboveground + below-ground biomass) under a continuous range of planting designs (e.g. variable proportions of trees and shrubs or plant densities), timeframes and future climate scenarios. Representative spatial models (1 ha resolution) for 3 reforestation designs (i.e.,woodlots, typical environmental planting, biodiverse environmental plantings) x 3 timeframes (i.e. 25, 45, 65 years) x 4 possible climates (i.e. no change, mild, moderate, severe warming and drying) were generated (i.e. 36 scenarios) for use within land use planning tools.

A plethora of aid organizations and projects have entered the region, particularly the northern areas. In Biidi 2, a small Sahelian village in northern Burkina Faso, development projects began to arrive in the 1970s and 1980s and increased in number in the early 1990s. To understand the impact of development projects in the village, we take our theoretical point of departure in the critical development literature. By way of ethnographic fieldwork we show that the importance of projects in Biidi 2 is often unrelated to their aims and that local participation does not entail a negation of but rather an almost complete compliance with project aims. 'Partnership' between development projects and local populations is also seen elsewhere in the Sahel. A number of good explanations for this have been proposed. None have, however, placed this situation in a climate change context. In this article, we explore whether the development 'partnership' experienced in Biidi 2 is related to climate variation and conclude that there is a close correlation between climate change, the need to buy food and local participation in development projects.","[Nielsen, Jonas Ostergaard] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Anthropol, Waterworlds Res Ctr, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [D'haen, Sarah] Univ Louvain la Neuve, Earth & Life Inst, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res TECLIM, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Reenberg, Anette] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geog & Geol, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Copenhagen,"Nielsen, JO (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Anthropol, Waterworlds Res Ctr, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",Jonas.nielsen@anthro.ku.dk,"Reenberg, Anette/E-1476-2015; D'haen, Sarah/E-6698-2015","Reenberg, Anette/0000-0003-2676-380X; D'haen, Sarah/0000-0002-5983-868X; Nielsen, Jonas/0000-0002-9518-7511",,,,,62,26,26,1,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

This requires linking climate adaptation to disaster risk management (DRM), leading to what has been broadly referred to as climate risk management (CRM). While this concept has received attention in debate, important gaps remain in terms of operationalizing it with applicable methods and tools for specific risks and decision-contexts. By developing and applying a methodological approach to CRM in the decision context of sovereign risk (flooding) in Austria we test the usefulness of CRM, and based on these insights, inform applications in other decision contexts. Our methodological approach builds on multiple lines of evidence and methods. These comprise of a broad stakeholder engagement process, empirical analysis of public budgets, and risk-focused economic modelling. We find that a CRM framework is able to inform instrumental as well as reflexive and participatory debate in practice. Due to the complex interaction of social-ecological systems with climate risks, and taking into account the likelihood of future contingent climate-related fiscal liabilities increasing substantially as a result of socioeconomic developments and climate change, we identify the need for advanced learning processes and iterative updates of CRM management plans. We suggest that strategies comprising a portfolio of policy measures to reduce and manage climate-related risks are particularly effective if they tailor individual instruments to the specific requirements of different risk layers.","[Schinko, Thomas; Mechler, Reinhard; Hochrainer-Stigler, Stefan] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Schinko, Thomas] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Graz, Austria; [Mechler, Reinhard] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); University of Graz; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Schinko, T (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.;Schinko, T (corresponding author), Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Graz, Austria.",schinko@iiasa.ac.at,,"Hochrainer-Stigler, Stefan/0000-0002-9929-8171; /0000-0003-2239-1578","International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Austrian Climate and Energy Fund (Austrian Climate Research Program (ACRP), project PACINAS) [B368621]","International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Austrian Climate and Energy Fund (Austrian Climate Research Program (ACRP), project PACINAS)","Open access funding provided by International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA).

As part of Ofwat's fifth Periodic Review (PR09), water companies recently released their draft Water Resources Management Plans, setting out how each company intends to maintain the balance between the supply and demand for water over the next 25 years, following Environment Agency guidelines. This paper reviews these plans to determine company estimates of the impact of climate change on water supply relative to other resource pressures. The approaches adopted for incorporating the impact in the plans and the proposed management solutions are also identified. Climate change impacts for individual resource zones range from no reductions in deployable output to greater than 50% over the planning period. The estimated national aggregated loss of deployable output under a core climate scenario is similar to 520 Ml/d (3% of deployable output) by 2034/2035, the equivalent of the supply of one entire water company (South West Water). Climate change is the largest single driver of change in water supplies over the planning period. Over half of the climate change impact is concentrated in southern England. In extreme cases, climate change uncertainty is of the same magnitude as the change under the core scenario (up to a loss of similar to 475 Ml/d). 44 of the 68 resource zones with available data are estimated to have a climate change impact. In 35 of these climate change has the greatest impact although in 10 zones sustainability reductions have a greater impact. Of the overall change in downward pressure on the supply-demand balance over the planning period, similar to 56% is accounted for by increased demand (620 Ml/d) and supply side climate change accounts for similar to 37% (407 Ml/d). Climate change impacts have a cumulative impact in concert with other changing supply side reducing components increasing the national pressure on the supply-demand balance. Whilst the magnitude of climate change appears to justify its explicit consideration, it is rare that adaptation options are planned solely in response to climate change but as a suite of options to provide a resilient supply to a range of pressures (including significant demand side pressures). Supply-side measures still tend to be considered by water companies to be more reliable than demand-side measures. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To be 'flood resilient', countries should have sufficient capacity to resist, the capacity to absorb and recover, and the capacity to transform and adapt. Based on international comparative research, we conclude that six key governance strategies will enhance 'flood resilience' and will secure the necessary capacities. These strategies pertain to: (i) the diversification of flood risk management approaches; (ii) the alignment of flood risk management approaches to overcome fragmentation; (iii) the involvement, cooperation, and alignment of both public and private actors in flood risk management; (iv) the presence of adequate formal rules that balance legal certainty and flexibility; (v) the assurance of sufficient financial and other types of resources; (vi) the adoption of normative principles that adequately deal with distributional effects. These governance strategies appear to be relevant across different physical and institutional contexts. The findings may also hold valuable lessons for the governance of climate adaptation more generally.","[Driessen, Peter P. J.; Hegger, Dries L.

Recovery time from chill coma is a measure of cold tolerance and it is a good index of climatic adaptation. We tested differences in recovery time of the common woodlouse (Porcellio laeris) exposed to different thermal conditions. Individuals were sampled from four dirferent Populations in Chile. spanning a latitudinal range of similar to 10. Significant differences were found in recovery time among experimental temperatures and among populations. but no interaction between these factors. The results of recovery time in P. laeris showed a positive increment with annual mean minimum temperature, indicating that there is geographical variation in recovery time. While body mass presented interopopulational variation. this variation was not associated with thermal variables or latitude. Overall, our results agree with previous Studies in the sense that recovery time from chill coma decreases towards high latitudes, and it is independent of taxa, continent and hemisphere.

As current research shows, urban areas are more vulnerable to climate change than rural areas. Numerous people are affected by climate change in their daily life, health and well-being. The need to react is undisputed and has led to numerous guidelines and directives for urban climate adaptation. Plants are commonly mentioned and recommended as one key to urban climate adaptation. Due to shading of open space and building surfaces, as well as evapotranspiration, plants reduce the energy load on the urban fabric and increase thermal comfort and climate resilience amongst many other ecosystem services. Plants, therefore, are described as green infrastructure (GI), because of the beneficial effects they provide. Extensive green roofs are often discussed regarding their impact on thermal comfort for pedestrians and physical properties of buildings. By means of Stadslab2050 project Elief Playhouse in Antwerp, Belgium, a single-story building in the courtyard of a perimeter block, the effects of different extensive green roof designs (A and B) on the microclimate, human comfort at ground and roof level, as well as building physics are analyzed and compared to the actual roofing (bitumen membrane) as the Status Quo variant. For the analyses and evaluation of the different designs the innovative Green Performance Assessment System (GREENPASS (R)) method has been chosen. The planning tool combines spatial and volumetric analyses with complex 3D microclimate simulations to calculate key performance indicators such as thermal comfort score, thermal storage score, thermal load score, run-off and carbon sequestration. Complementary maps and graphs are compiled. Overall, the chosen method allows to understand, compare and optimize project designs and performance. The results for the Elief Playhouse show that the implementation of green roofs serves a slight contribution to the urban energy balance but a huge impact on the building and humans. Variant B with entire greening performs better in all considered indicators, than the less greened design Variant A and the actual Status Quo. Variant B will probably bring a greater cost/benefit than Variant A and is thus recommended.","[Scharf, Bernhard] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Soil Bioengn & Landscape Construct, Dept Civil Engn & Nat Hazards, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Kraus, Florian] GREENPASS GmbH, A-1070 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Scharf, B (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Soil Bioengn & Landscape Construct, Dept Civil Engn & Nat Hazards, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",bernhard.scharf@boku.ac.at; florian.kraus@greenpass.at,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,City of Antwerp,City of Antwerp,This research was funded by the City of Antwerp in the frame of Stadslab2050.,,54,20,20,8,44,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,SEP,2019,9,9,,,,,,,205,10.3390/buildings9090205,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings9090205,,,26,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,JA2NO,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000487653800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on a structured literature review, we interrogate such claims, asking whether such approaches may (or may not) contribute to social change and, more specifically, empowerment. We present a review of the predominant meaning and interlinkages of the EbA and empowerment concepts, which shows that EbA pays insufficient attention to issues of empowerment and agency. On this basis, we discuss how an empowerment lens could be (better) integrated into the conceptualization of EbA, suggesting key dimensions through which this could be supported. We show that the emphasis on empowerment theory and the merits that it brings to the EbA literature are helpful, leading to a number of important questions to adaptation projects on the ground. Incorporating an empowerment lens leads to an increased consideration of issues of power more broadly, especially the way marginalized groups' agency, access, and aspirations are conditioned by social structures that may prevent strategic adaptation choices. We conclude that EbA will facilitate empowerment better by explicitly considering how social benefits can emerge from the interplay between particular types of actions, marginalized people's adaptive strategies, and their relational context.","[Woroniecki, Stephen; Warnsler, Christine; Boyd, Emily] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden; [Warnsler, Christine] Uppsala Univ, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci CNDS, Uppsala, Sweden",Lund University; Centre of Natural Hazards & Disaster Science (CNDS); Uppsala University,"Woroniecki, S (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden.",,,"Woroniecki, Stephen/0000-0003-1894-2859",Linnaeus Centre LUCID - Swedish Research Council Formas,Linnaeus Centre LUCID - Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),"The work was financially supported by the Linnaeus Centre LUCID, funded by the Swedish Research Council Formas.",,104,28,28,2,17,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

In order to assess tropical cyclone risk, direct economic damage is frequently modeled based on hazard intensity, asset exposure, and vulnerability, the latter represented by impact functions. In this study, we show that assessing tropical cyclone risk on a global level with one single impact function calibrated for the USA - which is a typical approach in many recent studies - is problematic, biasing the simulated damage by as much as a factor of 36 in the north West Pacific. Thus, tropical cyclone risk assessments should always consider regional differences in vulnerability, too. This study proposes a calibrated model to adequately assess tropical cyclone risk in different regions by fitting regional impact functions based on reported damage data. Applying regional calibrated impact functions within the risk modeling framework CLIMADA (CLIMate ADAptation) at a resolution of 10 km worldwide, we find global annual average direct damage caused by tropical cyclones to range from USD 51 up to USD 121 billion (value in 2014, 1980-2017) with the largest uncertainties in the West Pacific basin where the calibration results are the least robust. To better understand the challenges in the West Pacific and to complement the global perspective of this study, we explore uncertainties and limitations entailed in the modeling setup for the case of the Philippines. While using wind as a proxy for tropical cyclone hazard proves to be a valid approach in general, the case of the Philippines reveals limitations of the model and calibration due to the lack of an explicit representation of sub-perils such as storm surges, torrential rainfall, and landslides. The globally consistent methodology and calibrated regional impact functions are available online as a Python package ready for application in practical contexts like physical risk disclosure and providing more credible information for climate adaptation studies.","[Eberenz, Samuel; Luethi, Samuel; Bresch, David N.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Eberenz, Samuel; Luethi, Samuel; Bresch, David N.] Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, CH-8058 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss),"Eberenz, S (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.;Eberenz, S (corresponding author), Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, CH-8058 Zurich, Switzerland.",eberenz@posteo.eu,"; Bresch, David N./D-5298-2018","Eberenz, Samuel/0000-0001-7221-4647; Bresch, David N./0000-0002-8431-4263; Luthi, Samuel/0000-0003-2884-3467",Innosuisse - Schweizerische Agentur fur Innovationsforderung [26792.1 PFES-ES],Innosuisse - Schweizerische Agentur fur Innovationsforderung,This research has been supported by the Innosuisse - Schweizerische Agentur fur Innovationsforderung (grant no. 26792.1 PFES-ES).,,77,10,10,3,14,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1561-8633,1684-9981,,NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS,Nat.

Therefore, the impact of climate change and the development of adaptation strategies for maize are crucial to agricultural production and food security. The current study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of climate change and the development of adaptations strategies for maize in semi-arid environments using the Cropping System Model (CSM)-CERES-Maize of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). The model was calibrated and evaluated with an experimental data set and compared to on-farm data. The sensitivity of the model was evaluated against Carbon, Temperature, Water and Nitrogen (CTWN) analysis for the same environments. Survey data for maize were collected from 64 farms in the Faisalabad district of Pakistan using a stratified random sampling technique. Initial crop conditions and management practices were used as input data for CSM-CERES-Maize. Current climate data from 1980 to 2010 were obtained from the nearest weather station and future climate projections for 2040-2069 were obtained from Global Climate Models (GCMs) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5. Representative Agricultural Pathways (RAPs) were designed to represent the future autonomous production system. The GCM results showed an increase of 3.4 degrees C in maximum and 3.8 degrees C in minimum temperature for hot/dry conditions. The projected increase in temperatures for the hot/dry GCM would result in a 28 % reduction for the current production system and a 29 % reduction for the future maize production system by the middle of the century. The impact of climate adaption options on current production systems was evaluated and the results showed that yield increased by 21 %. Results of climate adaptation for the future production system indicated that yield would increase by 12-17 % for all GCMs. Both the current and future production systems were negatively affected by climate change. However, improved management as adaptation strategies can offset the potential decrease in yield.","[Ahmad, Ishfaq] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Ctr Climate Res & Dev, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Ahmad, Burhan] Pakistan Meteorol Dept, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Ahmad, Ishfaq; Boote, Kenneth; Hoogenboom, Gerrit] Univ Florida, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Hoogenboom, Gerrit] Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Syst, Gainesville, FL USA",COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI); State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Ahmad, I (corresponding author), COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Ctr Climate Res & Dev, Islamabad, Pakistan.;Ahmad, I (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",ishfaqahmad@comsats.edu.pk,"Hoogenboom, Gerrit/F-3946-2010","Hoogenboom, Gerrit/0000-0002-1555-0537; ahmad, Ishfaq/0000-0001-5654-7951",,,,,108,31,32,3,36,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1161-0301,1873-7331,,EUR J AGRON,Eur.

Climate change-induced risks and interventions to reduce these risks do not only impact urban risk management systems and infrastructures, but also people's daily lives. In order to build public support for climate adaptation and resilience-building and stimulate collaboration between authorities and citizens, it is necessary that adaptation and resilience-building are locally meaningful. Thus, interventions should be rooted in citizens' concerns and aspirations for their city. Urban policymakers and researchers have started the search for better citizen participation in adaptation. However, tools to connect the relatively strategic and long-term notions of adaptation to a gradually changing climate held by planners and scientists with how citizens experience today's climate and weather remain elusive. This paper investigates the use of 'narratives of change' as an approach to elicit perceptions of past, present and future weather, water, and climate, and how these relate to citizens' desired futures. We tested this by eliciting and comparing narratives of change from authorities and from citizens in the Dutch city of Dordrecht. Our analysis of the process showed that historical events, embedded in local memory and identity, have a surprisingly strong impact on how climate change is perceived and acted upon today. This contributes to an awareness and sense of urgency of some climate risks (e.g. flood risks). However, it also shifts attention away from other risks (e.g. intensified heat stress). The analysis highlighted commonalities, like shared concerns about climate change and desires to collaborate, but also differences in how climate change, impacts, and action are conceptualized. There are possibilities for collaboration and mutual learning, as well as areas of potential disagreement and conflict. We conclude that narratives are a useful tool to better connect the governance of climate adaptation with peoples' daily experience of climate risks and climate resilience, thereby potentially increasing public support for and participation in resilience-building.","[Marschutz, Benedikt; Runhaar, Hens; Hegger, Dries; Mees, Heleen; Vervoort, Joost; Wardekker, Arjan] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Bremer, Scott; Wardekker, Arjan] Univ Bergen, Ctr Study Sci & Humanities, Bergen, Norway; [Runhaar, Hens] Wageningen Univ & Res, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Utrecht University; University of Bergen; Wageningen University & Research,"Wardekker, A (corresponding author), POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",J.A.Wardekker@uu.nl,"Wardekker, Arjan/U-8500-2019; Runhaar, Hens A.C./L-5395-2013; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Hegger, Dries/L-9301-2013; Mees, Heleen/L-5394-2013","Wardekker, Arjan/0000-0001-7974-4835; Runhaar, Hens A.C./0000-0001-7790-097X; Hegger, Dries/0000-0003-2721-3527; Mees, Heleen/0000-0002-4401-6106",EU ERA4CS/JPI Climate project CoCliServ,EU ERA4CS/JPI Climate project CoCliServ,This paper was funded through the EU ERA4CS/JPI Climate project CoCliServ Co-development of place-based climate services for action.

Based on high-resolution grid data, this study combines the daily-scale ERA5-Land dataset and the monthly-scale SPEI dataset with multiple indicators to analyze CDHWs. We calculated and analyzed the temporal and spatial modal distribution of CDHWs in Central Asia from 1981 to 2018, and in this paper, we discuss the sequence relationship between drought events, heatwave events, and CDHWs. The results show that the number of CDHWs in the study region have increased over time and expanded in terms of area, especially in eastern and southwestern Central Asia. The tsum (total frequency of CDHWs) was 0.5 times higher than the total heatwave frequency and it increased at a rate of 0.17/yr. The maximum duration of tmax (maximum duration of CDHWs in days) was 17 days. Furthermore, the occurrence rate of tmax was 96.67%, and the AH (CDHWs' accumulated heat) had a rate of 97.78%, which, upon examination of the spatial trend pattern, accounted for the largest increase in terms of area. We also found that the TAH (CDHWs' average temperature anomalies, SPEI < -0.5) shows obvious seasonality, with the increases in winter and spring being significantly greater than the increases in summer and autumn. The intensity of the CDHWs was stronger than that of a single extreme event, the temperature anomaly was higher than the average of 0.4-0.8 degrees C, and there was a north-south spatial pattern across the study region. In eastern and northwestern Central Asia, the AH and heatwaves (SPEI < -0.5) increased by 15-30 times per year on average. During the transition from the base period to the reference period, CDHWs increased by 25%, and the number of dry days prior to the CDHWs decreased by 7.35 days. The conclusion of our study can provide a theoretical basis for coping with climate change in arid zones.","[Wang, Chuan; Li, Zhi; Chen, Yaning; Li, Yupeng; Liu, Xigang; Hou, Yifeng; Wang, Xuechun; Kulaixi, Zulipiya; Sun, Fan] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chuan; Liu, Xigang; Sun, Fan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Hou, Yifeng; Wang, Xuechun; Kulaixi, Zulipiya] Xinjiang Univ, Coll Geog & Remote Sensing Sci, Urumqi 830046, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xinjiang Institute of Ecology & Geography, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Xinjiang University","Li, Z (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.",wangchuan201@mails.ucas.ac.cn; liz@ms.xjb.ac.cn; chenyn@ms.xjb.ac.cn; liyupeng@ms.xjb.ac.cn; liuxigang20@mails.ucas.ac.cn; hyf@stu.xju.edu.cn; wxchun@stu.xju.edu.cn; 107556519103@stu.xju.edu.cn; sunfan18@mails.ucas.ac.cn,,"Wang, Chuan/0000-0001-6043-3463",National Natural Science Foundation of China [U2003302]; Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [ZDRWZS-2019-3]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [2018480],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,The research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U2003302) and the Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (ZDRWZS-2019-3).

We begin by describing the background of this project, including details about climate resiliency efforts in West Michigan and the Toolbox dialogue method, which was extended in this project from academic research into community organization involving the West Michigan Climate Resiliency Framework Initiative. This extension involved application of several methods, which are the focus of the Methods section.

Retrofitting urban infrastructure is a socio-technical process like planned or autonomous adaptation, where the motivation and ability of the stakeholders should be ascertained to avoid implementation bottlenecks. This paper aims at improving the understanding of institutional decision making for implementing retrofitting responses using the Motivation and Abilities (MOTA) framework. Motivation and abilities of the stakeholders to retrofit the urban drainage system in Ho Chi Minh City for maintaining the service levels in a changing climate urbanization were explored. The MOTA scores, based on stakeholder consultation and surveys, were obtained for retrofitting responses. The analysis of MOTA scores revealed that the motivation and ability of the stakeholders differed based on the adaptation objectives for planning and implementing drainage retrofitting responses. Hence it is recommended to use MOTA framework as a practical means to explore the inherent biases and internal processes of various actors to understand and communicate the need to integrate decision making in a sustainable manner.","[Hong Quan Nguyen; Dung Duc Tran; Long Phi Ho; Nguyen Xuan Quang Chau] Viet Nam Natl Univ Ho Chi Minh City VNU HCM, Ctr Water Management & Climate Change WACC, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Hong Quan Nguyen] Ho Chi Minh City Peoples Comm, Dept Sci & Technol, ICST, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Radhakrishnan, Mohanasundar; Pathirana, Assela] Delft Inst Water Educ, IHE, Delft, Netherlands; [Thi Kim Ngan Bui] Dist 1 People Comm, Div Environm & Resources, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Viet Thanh Tong] Ho Chi Minh City Peoples Comm, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Luu Trung Phung Huynh] Ho Chi Minh City Peoples Comm, Dept Sci & Technol, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Thi Thu Trang Ngo] Univ Social Sci & Humanities, VNU HCM, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Huu Loc Ho] Nguyen Tat Thanh Univ, NTT Hi Tech Inst, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Huu Loc Ho] Nanyang Technol Univ, Nanyang Environm & Water Res Inst, Singapore, Singapore",Vietnam National University Hochiminh City; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; Vietnam National University Hochiminh City; Nguyen Tat Thanh University (NTTU); Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI); Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Ho, HL (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Nanyang Environm & Water Res Inst, Singapore, Singapore.",hohl@ntu.edu.sg,"Tran, Dung Duc/J-2496-2015","Tran, Dung Duc/0000-0003-2331-4996; Nguyen Xuan Quang, Chau/0000-0002-9597-1787; Radhakrishnan, Mohanasundar/0000-0003-3785-7713; Nguyen, Hong Quan/0000-0001-7685-8191; ho, loc/0000-0002-8300-6699",Ho Chi Minh Department of Science and Technology through the Institute for Computational Science and Technology (ICST),Ho Chi Minh Department of Science and Technology through the Institute for Computational Science and Technology (ICST),The authors acknowledge and appreciate the inputs provided through the recent initiative on Green Infrastructure supported by the Ho Chi Minh Department of Science and Technology through the Institute for Computational Science and Technology (ICST).

One reason why executives may not take more decisive action on adaptation is the type of information they rely on for decision-making purposes. From this perspective, executives who engage more with scientific information sources for decision-making purposes would be likely to have a more comprehensive understanding of climate change, and would consequently be more concerned about their company's vulnerability and adaptation needs. So far, however, there is limited evidence showing that executives' lack of engagement with scientific information influences their perception that climate change is a serious issue. In this paper, we use survey data collected from 125 executives across the top 500 companies on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX-500) to examine the links between how executives obtain information on climate change and their perceived need for adaptation action. Findings show that executives who report greater engagement with scientific information express greater concern about their company's vulnerability, which also translates into a greater perceived need for adaptation action. Making scientific information accessible to executives is therefore important for communicating climate science to a business audience.","[Linnenluecke, Martina K.; Griffiths, Andrew] Univ Queensland, UQ Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Mumby, Peter J.] Univ Queensland, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Linnenluecke, MK (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, UQ Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",m.linnenluecke@business.uq.edu.au,"Mumby, Peter/F-9914-2010; Linnenluecke, Martina/J-7237-2013","Mumby, Peter/0000-0002-6297-9053; Linnenluecke, Martina/0000-0001-7984-9717",,,,,47,24,24,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

However, these curves excluding ecological requirement are generally derived from observed or synthetic flows and have rarely been determined by future flows under climate change. This paper develops an integrated adaptive optimization model (IAOM) for derivation of multipurpose reservoir operating rule curves including ecological operating rule curve under future climate change. Steps in the proposed IAOM include: (1) weather generator module to generate feasible future climate conditions, (2) VIC model as the hydrological simulation module to generate streamflows from those future weather conditions, and (3) multipurpose reservoir optimization module to determine the optimal reservoir operations to deal with climate change. China's Danjiangkou reservoir in Han River basin is selected for a case study. The results demonstrate that the IAOM provides optimal multipurpose reservoir operating rule curves that reflect the hydrologic characteristics of future climate change. Ecological supply water operation will alleviate negative effect of dam on river ecosystem without reducing conservation benefits and flood control standard. Therefore, they can consult with reservoir administrators if it is useful results for operations. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Broadly, literature that analyzes the success of CIS as an enabler of climate adaptation focuses only minimally on the role of contextual social dynamics in achieving CIS uptake. This gap prompted the subject of this paper, which illuminates how the spread of CIS is a function of ground-level communication processes and social ties, as conceptualized by social network theorists. This is particularly evident in literature examining the gender implications of CIS, which reveals how the power dynamics of knowledge-sharing and women's weaker social networks hinder their access to climate information. This review contributes to the social science on climate change a novel triangulation of climate information, gender, and social network literatures. It aims to highlight CIS scholars' calls, albeit infrequent, for greater attention to the influence of social networks on the flow of information to women. This is illustrated through two case studies in which authors use social network analyses to reveal barriers to women's CIS access and continued use. Connecting these disparate bodies of literature uncovers potentially viable, though seldom explored, pathways for improving the gender responsiveness and overall effectiveness of CIS, such as delivering information through existing ground-level social structures.","[Sprout, Elizabeth] 69 Gates Ave 4, Brooklyn, NY 11238 USA",,"Sprout, E (corresponding author), 69 Gates Ave 4, Brooklyn, NY 11238 USA.",elizabethasprout@gmail.com,,"Sprout, Elizabeth/0000-0002-2995-4225",,,,,37,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1877-3435,1877-3443,,CURR OPIN ENV SUST,Curr.

The ability to spatially incorporate multiple biophysical environments is crucial to ecosystem services, thus promoting cooperation between science and policy in seeking solutions to global challenges, including drought disasters. Therefore, understanding ecosystem services, for instance, from forest/vegetation in view of contributing to drought disaster risk adaptation is critical to human-nature interactions and proper sustainable conservation thereof. No known study has been done on ecosystem services and their contributions to drought management or other climate adaptation in South Africa. This study aimed at quantifying drought disaster risk adaptation based on ecosystem services in South Africa. It was identified that ecosystem services to society have been directly affected by anthropogenic and natural phenomena, thereby influencing drought severity and its impacts. These impacts and their associated risks are evident globally, including in South Africa. We found out that ecosystems in South Africa have been affected and extremely vulnerable to recurrent natural disasters, such as droughts. To achieve long-term solutions to such drought-related risks and challenges, feedback mechanisms between human-natural and related factors and ecosystem services-based drought adaptation need to be understood and planned. Timely spatiotemporal assessment, planning and management strategies need to be considered to find solutions or ways forward to South Africa in combating drought disasters.","[Orimoloye, Israel Ropo; Zhou, Leocadia; M.

For bamboo as a hygroscopic material, the coupled heat and moisture process model was adopted for the hygrothermal performance study of bamboo construction. With 4 groups of meteorological data from 2 representative cities in the Hot-Humid climate region of North America as external conditions, exterior walls were constructed in WUFI Plus and the coupled heat and moisture process simulation was performed. Based on the statistical analyses of a large sample of simulation results, scientific laws for promoting the parameter optimization were generated, for which the simulation results were grouped to the indicators on three level, including annual exterior walls hygrothermal performance, indoor hygrothermal environment and HVAC demand. Factor impact analyses were carried out to investigate the effect of the partition boards, thermal insulation infill and air layer arrangement. Hygrothermal performance design optimization suggestions were generated, in terms of material and construction parameters optimization, which would support the climate adaptive design of bamboo building envelope in Hot-Humid climate region.

We find that actors and policy preferences are arranged in a two-dimensional space, with highly engaged actors more likely to consider environmental justice and ecological aspects of sea level rise.

Yet, vulnerability to climate variability and change in these contexts is a function not just of biophysical outcomes but also of institutional factors that can vary significantly at relatively finer scales. This paper seeks to contribute towards closing this gap by examining institutional options for sustainable water management in rural SSA in the context of climate change and variability. It explores challenges for transforming water-related institutions and puts forward institutional alternatives towards adapting to increasingly complex conditions created by climate change and variability. The paper suggests revisiting the Integrated Water Resources Management approach which has dominated water institutional debates and reforms in Africa over the recent past, towards actively adopting resilience and adaptive management lenses in crafting water institutional development initiatives.","[Nyamwanza, Admire M.] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa; [Kujinga, Krasposy K.] WaterNet Secretariat, Harare, Zimbabwe",University of Cape Town,"Nyamwanza, AM (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa.",anyamwanza@gmail.com,,,IDRC,IDRC,"This paper emanates from a literature review of the key conceptual framings informing the research project 'Local institutional adaptation and sustainable water management in the context of climate variability and change: A case study in the mid-Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe' undertaken by the first author under the African Climate Change Fellowship Program Phase 3 (ACCFP III).

Thus, land use change was identified as one of the most influential factors and in some scenarios, urban growth caused changes in runoff quantity and quality exceeding those caused by a changing climate. Adaptation measures, including the reduction of directly connected impervious surfaces (DCIS) through the integration of more green spaces into the urban landscape, or disconnection of DCIS were effective in reducing runoff volume and pollutant loads.

Drawing on the protection motivation theory, a threat, coping, social appraisal, maladaptation and behavioral intention to adopt adaptation measures (TCSMBI) model was proposed to predict farmers' adaptation. A structural equation model was then employed to analyze the relationships between variables in the TCSMBI model with 658 apple farmers in Shaanxi province, China. The empirical results showed that threat appraisal and coping appraisal have positive and significant impacts on behavioral intention to climate change.

This study shows that supply chains for two popular processed products in the United States, French fries and pasta sauce, will be remarkably resilient, through planting adaptation strategies. Food systems are increasingly challenged to meet growing demand for specialty crops due to the effects of climate change and increased competition for resources. Here, we apply an integrated methodology that includes climate, crop, economic and life cycle assessment models to US potato and tomato supply chains. We find that supply chains for two popular processed products in the United States, French fries and pasta sauce, will be remarkably resilient, through planting adaptation strategies that avoid higher temperatures. Land and water footprints will decline over time due to higher yields, and greenhouse gas emissions can be mitigated by waste reduction and process modification. Our integrated methodology can be applied to other crops, health-based consumer scenarios (fresh versus processed) and geographies, thereby informing decision-making throughout supply chains. Employing such methods will be essential as food systems are forced to adapt and transform to become carbon neutral due to the imperatives of climate change.","[Gustafson, David; McLean, Morven; Tarar, Layla] Agr & Food Syst Inst, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Asseng, Senthold; Hoogenboom, Gerrit; Zhao, Chuang; Fraisse, Clyde; Xiao, Liujun] Univ Florida, Agr & Biol Engn Dept, Gainesville, FL USA; [Kruse, John; Intarapapong, Pon; Rosenbohm, Marc] WAEES, Columbia, MO USA; [Thoma, Greg; Matlock, Marty; Parajuli, Ranjan] Univ Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Guan, Kaiyu; Li, Yan; Wu, Genghong] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Rajagopalan, Kirti; Stockle, Claudio; Kruger, Chad; Nelson, Roger Leroy] Washington State Univ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Sulser, Timothy B.; Wiebe, Keith] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Gimenez, Carmen] Univ Cordoba, Dept Agron, Cordoba, Spain; [Karimi, Tina] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY USA; [Marshall, Elizabeth] USDA, Nat Resources Conservat Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Pronk, Annette; van Evert, Frits] Wageningen Plant Res, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Raymundo, Rubi] Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Riddle, Anne A.] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC USA; [Sonke, Dan] Campbell Soup, Davis, CA USA; [Asseng, Senthold] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Life Sci Engn, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [McLean, Morven] Bill & Melinda Gates Agr Innovat, St Louis, MO USA; [Sonke, Dan] Blue Diamond Growers, Sacramento, CA USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Washington State University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Universidad de Cordoba; Cornell University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Wageningen University & Research; Kansas State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Technical University of Munich,"Gustafson, D (corresponding author), Agr & Food Syst Inst, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",dgustafson@foodsystems.org,"Hoogenboom, Gerrit/F-3946-2010; Guan, Kaiyu/N-5772-2015; Parajuli, Ranjan/G-8676-2013","Hoogenboom, Gerrit/0000-0002-1555-0537; Guan, Kaiyu/0000-0002-3499-6382; Gustafson, David/0000-0001-6359-7017; Parajuli, Ranjan/0000-0002-6279-9642; Karimi, Tina/0000-0003-2801-8854; Thoma, Greg/0000-0001-8757-7635; Fraisse, Clyde W./0000-0001-9875-2187; Wiebe, Keith/0000-0001-6035-620X","USDA NIFA [2017-68002-26789]; CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets","USDA NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets(CGIAR)","Funding was supplied by USDA NIFA award no. 2017-68002-26789.

However, rare studies have considered to alleviate the SUHI from a network perspective, which was demonstrated by first building a SUHI network to identify the key nodes and links of a SUHI network and subsequently breaking this network to effectively mitigate SUHI. Here, a new approach to build SUHI network is proposed, which integrates morphological spatial pattern analysis and circuit theory. It includes: i) identification of stable and high-risk SUHI patches, ii) extraction of the core type, iii) evaluation of core importance, iv) construction of a friction map, and v) generation of links and pinch-points. Dongguan city was selected as case and the results showed: 1) 42 links were identified with 31 pinch points located in these links; 2) Most of these links and pinch-points were distributed in the southwestern and northwestern regions; 3) Cooling measures (patch-based) should be implemented in these specific areas to avoid connections between the links and nodes that could seriously aggravate the thermal environment of entire region. The method and reverse thinking process adopted could provide new insights for climate adaption planning and urban sustainability.","[Yu, Zhaowu] Fudan Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jinguang] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China; [Yang, Gaoyuan] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Sci, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark",Fudan University; Nanjing Forestry University; University of Copenhagen,"Yang, GY (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Fac Sci, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark.",zhaowu_yu@fudan.edu.cn; gy@ign.ku.dk,"Gaoyuan, Yang/HKO-4087-2023; Yu, Zhaowu/E-8032-2016","Yang, Gaoyuan/0000-0001-9735-6529; Yu, Zhaowu/0000-0003-4576-4541; Zhang, Jinguang/0000-0003-4696-5652",Shanghai Science and technology Innovation Action Plan [21ZR1408500]; National Science Fundation of China [4217010227]; Shanghai Key Lab for Urban Ecological Processes and Eco-Restoration [SHUES2021A02],Shanghai Science and technology Innovation Action Plan; National Science Fundation of China; Shanghai Key Lab for Urban Ecological Processes and Eco-Restoration,"The study was supported by the Shanghai Science and technology Innovation Action Plan (grand no. 21ZR1408500), National Science Fundation of China (grand no. 4217010227), and Shanghai Key Lab for Urban Ecological Processes and Eco-Restoration (grant no.

To determine the range of weather impacts on the Games, this study examines the official Olympic post-Games reports from 1924 to 2010. Impacts include preparations for the Games, holding outdoor opening-closing ceremonies, outdoor sporting competitions, spectator comfort, transportation, and television broadcasts. The study also examines the range of historical adaptations that have developed to manage weather risks at the OWG. Three adaptation eras are identified, spanning the history of the games: emergent adaptation, technological transition, and advanced adaptation. Analysis reveals that while weather-induced impacts have always been a part of the Games, these impacts would be far greater if not for technical climatic adaptations. With the average daytime temperature of host locations steadily increasing from 0.4 degrees C at the Games held in the 1920-1950s to 7.8 degrees C at the Games held in the twenty-first century, it would be difficult to imagine recent host cities/regions successfully delivering the diverse Games programme exclusively on natural ice and snow. The connection between the evolving needs for weather risk management strategies by Olympic organisers and the growth of the Olympics in size and scope is also discussed.","[Rutty, M.; Scott, D.; Johnson, P.] Univ Waterloo, Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Steiger, R.] MCI Tourism Business Studies, Innsbruck, Austria",University of Waterloo,"Scott, D (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",daniel.scott@uwaterloo.ca,"Scott, Daniel/AAB-6190-2020; Steiger, Robert/D-4796-2019; Rutty, Michelle/GPX-7857-2022","Scott, Daniel/0000-0001-7825-9301; Steiger, Robert/0000-0002-1752-6450; Rutty, Michelle/0000-0002-4567-7766; Johnson, Peter/0000-0003-4572-2915",,,,,60,12,14,6,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1368-3500,1747-7603,,CURR ISSUES TOUR,Curr.

Hence, private mitigation measures which proactively protect homes from being flooded or reduce flood damage are an essential part of modern flood risk management. This study analyses private flood mitigation measures among German households. The final data set covers more than 4200 households from all parts of the country, including flood plains as well as areas which are typically not at a high risk of riverine flooding. The results suggest that the propensity to mitigate flood damage increases i.a. with past damage experience and damage expectations for the future. The latter effect can be interpreted as a 'climate adaptation signal' in the flood mitigation behaviour. All other factors remaining equal, a strong belief in a climate-change-induced increase of personal flood damage in the next decades correlates with an increase of the probability of flood mitigation by more than 10 percentage points. Moreover, empirical evidence for moral hazard in the flood mitigation behaviour cannot be observed. Households expecting insurance coverage do not reduce their mitigation efforts. Likewise, the expectation of government relief payments hinders mitigation only for some groups of households. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Cities are vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change because of their concentration of people and infrastructure, the physical (geographical, material, and structural) attributes of the built environment, and the ecological interdependence with the urban ecosystem. Australia is one of the most highly urbanized countries in the region and its already variable climate is set to become hotter and drier with climate change. Climate change in Australia is expected to increase morbidity and mortality from thermal stress, bacterial gastroenteritis, vector-borne disease, air pollution, flooding, and bushfires. The cost and availability of fresh water, food, and energy will also likely be affected. The more vulnerable urban populations, including the elderly, socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, and those with underlying chronic disease, will be most affected. Adaptation strategies need to address this underlying burden of disease and inequity as well as implement broad structural changes to building codes and urban design, and infrastructure capacity. In doing so, cities provide opportunities to realize co-benefits for health (eg, from increased levels of physical activity and improved air quality). With evidence that climate change is underway, the need for cities to be a focus in the development of climate adaptation strategies is becoming more urgent.","[Bambrick, Hilary Jane] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Med, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia; [Bambrick, Hilary Jane; Capon, Anthony Guy] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Barniett, Guy Bruce; Beaty, R.

Their bonding social capital has significantly positive relationship with their adaptation decisions, but bridging social capital does not have such statistically significant relationship.

Recent ethnographic studies have, however, highlighted tensions created by the capitalist cash economy, which promotes individualism over other forms of engagement in the market. Accordingly, this article aims to examine these tensions to identify the consequences for responses to ongoing climate change, arguing that there are other forms of capitalism that blend components of the moral economy with capitalist cash economies. I have referred to these forms of sociality, marketisation, and capitalism as possessive communalism in recognition of the prioritising of sociocentric values and rural traditions of social protection. I argue that it is important for aid organisations and governmental programmes to recognise and support these diverse forms of capitalism that retain traditional values and practises.","[Singh-Peterson, Lila] Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; [Singh-Peterson, Lila] Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Agr & Environm Sci, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; [Singh-Peterson, Lila] Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Culture & Heritage, Brisbane, QLD, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Southern Queensland; University of Southern Queensland,"Singh-Peterson, L (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.;Singh-Peterson, L (corresponding author), Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Agr & Environm Sci, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.;Singh-Peterson, L (corresponding author), Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Culture & Heritage, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.",l.singhpeterson@uq.edu.au,,,,,,,54,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1444-2213,1740-9314,,ASIA PAC J ANTHROPOL,Asia Pac.

The primary source of the net long-term variability is evaluated based on historical wave simulations. Results show that the monsoon, extratropical, subtropical, and polar wave climate types of the Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans are dominated by natural variability, whereas the extratropical and subtropical wave climate types in the Indian Ocean, and the tropical wave climate types of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans exhibit a global warming signal. In the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean, strong natural variability may mask a global warming signal that is yet to emerge as being statistically significant. In addition, wave climate teleconnections were found across the world that can provide a framework for joint strategies to achieve the goals of climate adaption for resilient coastal communities and environments.","[Oderiz, I; Silva, R.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ingn, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Mortlock, T.

Despite an increase in the number of CBA projects being implemented, detailed analysis and evaluation of their efficacy and the barriers faced in achieving successful outcomes is lacking. This study draws on an analysis of grey literature (i.e. project and donor reports) to explore the barriers faced in achieving effective CBA. An extensive global search of online project evaluations yielded 25 documents comprising 69 projects from which this analysis is based. This paper first presents an overview of the 69 projects and highlights any trends. Second, this paper describes the barriers to CBA according to three broad themes: socio-political, resource, and physical systems and processes. Following this is a discussion of the most prevalent barriers: cognitive and behavioural, financial, and human resources. Third, this paper discusses the key findings elucidated from this review. This includes the need for greater sharing of project reports and findings so lessons can be learned across spatial and temporal scales, and the disparity between critical academic literature on CBA and what is implemented in practice.","[Piggott-McKellar, Annah E.; McNamara, Karen E.; Watson, James E.

According to the latest projections, African countries will continue to face increasing inequalities, as well as risks to human health, water and food security, due to climate change. African countries are also struggling to reduce gender-related power imbalances in adaptation and mitigation that magnify existing vulnerabilities, particularly those of women. Therefore, any advances made in this narrative are significant. This paper investigates the needs and potential for gender-balanced leadership/empowerment in adaptation and mitigation based on climate change experts' views on the advances made in Africa. This is complemented by a bibliometric analysis of the literature published on the topic between the years 2015 and 2022. The study suggests that although women's influence on climate change related decisions is growing, a series of barriers need to be overcome, among which are lack of knowledge and political will. The COVID-19 pandemic is seen as having both positive and negative potentials for gender-balanced leadership/empowerment. The findings provide a premise for identifying possible directions of further actions towards gender-balanced leadership/empowerment in climate change in African countries.","[Kovaleva, Marina; Leal Filho, Walter] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Res & Transfer Ctr Sustainable Dev & Climate Chan, Ulmenliet 20, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany; [Borgemeister, Christian] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Genscherallee 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Kalungu, Jokastah Wanzuu] South Eastern Kenya Univ SEKU, Dept Agr Engn, POB 170-90200, Kitui, Kenya",Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg; University of Bonn,"Kovaleva, M (corresponding author), Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Res & Transfer Ctr Sustainable Dev & Climate Chan, Ulmenliet 20, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany.",Marina.Kovaleva@haw-hamburg.de; walter.leal2@haw-hamburg.de; cb@uni-bonn.de; jokastahkalungu@gmail.com,,"Borgemeister, Christian/0000-0001-8067-0335; Leal Filho, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225",International Climate Change Information and Research Programme (ICCIRP); initiative 100 Papers to Accelerate Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Initiative,International Climate Change Information and Research Programme (ICCIRP); initiative 100 Papers to Accelerate Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Initiative,This paper is funded by the International Climate Change Information and Research Programme (ICCIRP) and is part of the initiative 100 Papers to Accelerate Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Initiative.,,135,0,0,11,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2022,14,15,,,,,,,9410,10.3390/su14159410,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14159410,,,27,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,3R7RV,,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000839106200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Transportation plans and related documentation of metropolitan planning organizations and international cities were reviewed to ascertain whether climate change considerations are being incorporated into the transportation planning process. The review revealed that climate change considerations were not included in a majority of cases in the transportation planning process, especially to adapt transportation systems to the potential effects of climate change. When such consideration did occur, the focus was on greenhouse gas (GHG) emission mitigation, with data collection techniques and analysis tools that were better developed and already in place within many planning organizations. A conceptual framework for transportation planning is presented and used to illustrate how some agencies have considered climate change in each step of the planning process.

A growing body of evidence suggests that BMI is a poor indicator of health across populations, and that there may be a metabolically healthy obese phenotype. Here, we review the reasons why BMI is an inadequate tool for assessing cardiometabolic health. We then suggest that cold climate adaptations may also render BMI an uninformative metric. Underlying evolutionary and environmental drivers may allow for heat conserving larger body sizes without necessarily increasing metabolic health risks. However, there may also be a potential mismatch between modern obesogenic environments and adaptations to cold climates, highlighting the need to further investigate the potential for metabolically healthy obese phenotypes among circumpolar and other populations as well as the broader meaning for metabolic health. Lay Summary Global obesity rates are on the rise; however, body mass index (BMI) is a poor indicator of metabolic health. Here, we propose that cold climate populations may exhibit high BMIs, but relatively healthy metabolic profiles (metabolically healthy obesity) due to environmental and evolutionary pressures associated with inhabiting a cold climate.","[Ocobock, Cara; Niclou, Alexandra] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Anthropol, 296 Corbett Family Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Ocobock, Cara] Univ Notre Dame, Eck Inst Global Hlth, Inst Educ Initiat, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame,"Ocobock, C (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Anthropol, 296 Corbett Family Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",cocobock@nd.edu,,"Ocobock, Cara/0000-0002-6949-2029",,,,,102,1,1,3,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",,2050-6201,,EVOL MED PUBLIC HLTH,Evol.

For decades forest as a key natural resource was managed with main focus on timber production. However, several factors influenced shifting forest management, including forest regeneration to meet a wide range of society needs. This review study aims to reveal the historical development of forest regeneration identifying knowledge gaps and supporting decisions that promote sustainable regeneration of future forests. The development of forest regeneration management and policy in the Nordic-Baltic countries is analyzed through reforestation and afforestation practices as well as legislation aspects using a narrative review approach. Trends in forest regeneration practices within the region are identified and explored over a timeframe spanning from 1900 until today. Despite diverse forestry management structures and differing political, social situations, the study shows that forest regeneration development has followed similar patterns over time in all Nordic-Baltic region countries: extensive forestry, clear-cut forestry, retention forestry and currently evolving climate-adaptive forestry. Nevertheless, regional differences among the Nordic-Baltic countries, especially in forest regeneration-related legislation, were identified due to a mixture of international and local driving forces.","[Girdziusas, Sigitas; Metslaid, Marek] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Forestry & Rural Engn, Kreutz Waldi 5, EE-51006 Tartu, Estonia; [Lof, Magnus] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, Lomma, Sweden; [Hanssen, Kjersti Holt; Floistad, Inger Sundheim] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, Div Forest & Forest Resources, As, Norway; [Lazdina, Dagnija; Liepins, Kaspars] Latvian State Forest Res Inst Silava, Salaspils, Latvia; [Madsen, Palle] InNovaSilva ApS, Vejle, Denmark; [Saksa, Timo] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Suonenjoki, Finland",Estonian University of Life Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research; Latvian State Forest Research Institute Silava; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Girdziusas, S (corresponding author), Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Forestry & Rural Engn, Kreutz Waldi 5, EE-51006 Tartu, Estonia.",sigitas.girdziusas@student.emu.ee,,"Saksa, Timo/0000-0002-1776-2357; Hanssen, Kjersti Holt/0000-0002-1715-3092","Estonian University of Life Sciences [P180024MIME, P200029MIME]; SNS-EFINORD",Estonian University of Life Sciences; SNS-EFINORD,"This study was supported by the projects of Estonian University of Life Sciences P180024MIME and P200029MIME.

After more than a century of resource and land use change, some question the need for proactive management, particularly given novel social, ecological, and climatic conditions. To address this question, we first provide a framework for assessing changes in landscape conditions and fire regimes. Using this framework, we then evaluate evidence of change in contemporary conditions relative to those maintained by active fire regimes, i.e., those uninterrupted by a century or more of human-induced fire exclusion. The cumulative results of more than a century of research document a persistent and substantial fire deficit and widespread alterations to ecological structures and functions. These changes are not necessarily apparent at all spatial scales or in all dimensions of fire regimes and forest and nonforest conditions. Nonetheless, loss of the once abundant influence of low- and moderate-severity fires suggests that even the least fire-prone ecosystems may be affected by alteration of the surrounding landscape and, consequently, ecosystem functions. Vegetation spatial patterns in fire-excluded forested landscapes no longer reflect the heterogeneity maintained by interacting fires of active fire regimes. Live and dead vegetation (surface and canopy fuels) is generally more abundant and continuous than before European colonization. As a result, current conditions are more vulnerable to the direct and indirect effects of seasonal and episodic increases in drought and fire, especially under a rapidly warming climate. Long-term fire exclusion and contemporaneous social-ecological influences continue to extensively modify seasonally dry forested landscapes. Management that realigns or adapts fire-excluded conditions to seasonal and episodic increases in drought and fire can moderate ecosystem transitions as forests and human communities adapt to changing climatic and disturbance regimes. As adaptation strategies are developed, evaluated, and implemented, objective scientific evaluation of ongoing research and monitoring can aid differentiation of warranted and unwarranted uncertainties.","[Hagmann, R.

It examines how the CBACs would be sustained locally without colliding with the present system of government. The main objective of this is to identify how the CBACs could act independently as per local demands, without any conflict with the existing system, in order to ensure sustainable adaptation in future. To achieve these objectives the author conducted interviews with key informants at both local and national levels, and also conducted eight participatory rapid appraisal sessions at eight coastal communities. The author finds that severe corruption is impeding the existing system of relief and rehabilitation at community levels. The paper emphasises that the government of Bangladesh urgently needs to formulate a national adaptation policy, and that within that policy the concept of CBACs at community level should be prioritised. This would provide the government with guidelines for the use, at community level, of adaptation funds from developed countries in order to reduce future vulnerability in Bangladesh.","[Younus, Md Aboul Fazal] Univ Adelaide, Sch Social Sci, Fac Arts, Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Younus, MAF (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Social Sci, Fac Arts, Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",md.younus@adelaide.edu.au,,,,,,,64,8,9,0,28,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1747-7891,1878-0059,,ENVIRON HAZARDS-UK,Environ.

In theory, climate-related decision support identifies the need to move beyond the linear dissemination of information from experts to decision-makers. Interviews with researchers and federal program managers, however, show that in practice there are still wide gaps between the development of climate science and its application. Lessons learned in two example cases of decision support experiments are discussed to highlight some of the on-going challenges in applying climate science, e.g. defining decision support, involving decision-makers, and determining effectiveness. The published literature also shows these reoccurring challenges but emphasizes more collaboration between science and decision-makers as this improves the relevance, compatibility, and accessibility of climate science information and can increase users' receptiveness. This article proposes that the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) can help the development of decision support resources, in one way, by coordinating an Internet-based practitioners' network. A coordinated network could provide opportunities for climate-related decision support practitioners to build collaborative partnerships, share lessons-learned, provide feedback to the USGCRP, and thereby assist the transition of science into decision-making processes to better address adaptation planning.","Univ N Dakota, Dept Earth Syst Sci & Policy, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA",University of North Dakota Grand Forks,"Romsdahl, RJ (corresponding author), Univ N Dakota, Dept Earth Syst Sci & Policy, Stop 9011, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA.",rebecca.romsdahl@und.edu,,,,,,,99,11,11,1,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Hence, with consideration of the respective advantages and limitations of the coastal morphological modelling approach to inform coastal management and climate adaptation strategies, the inclusion of these processes in predictive numerical models requires careful validation and interpretation. The timescale of their investigation dictates the optimal numerical modelling approach that should be applied to simulate and predict beach morphology changes. The level of detail and therefore, process understanding, obtained from numerical modeling ranges from 1D shoreline models to more sophisticated 3D physical process models. Here, we present the application and validation of a 3D process-based model (Delft3D) to simulate the dispersion of a nearshore beach nourishment in the outer surf zone at a highly variable (energy and direction) open coast beach on the east coast of Australia.","[Strauss, Darrell; da Silva, Guilherme Vieira; da Silva, Ana Paula; Murray, Thomas; Faivre, Gaelle] Griffith Ctr Coastal Management, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Wharton, Courtney] City Assets Transport & Infrastruct, City Of Gold Coast, Australia",,"Strauss, D (corresponding author), Griffith Ctr Coastal Management, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia.",d.strauss@griffith.edu.au,"Da Silva, Ana Paula/AAU-5571-2021; Strauss, Darrell/D-6489-2013","Da Silva, Ana Paula/0000-0001-8348-5899; Vieira da Silva, Guilherme/0000-0002-1109-0246; Strauss, Darrell/0000-0002-3411-0991; Murray, Thomas/0000-0001-6071-2139",City of Gold Coast; Advance Queensland Research Fellowship [AQRF02815-16RD1],City of Gold Coast; Advance Queensland Research Fellowship,"This research project was sponsored by the City of Gold Coast (the City) through a funding and collaboration agreement between the City and Griffith University.

This study explores the effectiveness of TMNs in reaching adaptation outcomes and how financial, material, and knowledge exchanges of TMNs tend to exclude adaptation in high-priority intermediary cities. Nearly 40 semi-structured interviews with Indonesian city actors and a preliminary catalogue of cities participating in TMNs reveal that risk-averse selection criteria, insufficient impact assessments, and duplicative institutional efforts reinforce disparities between primary and intermediary cities. To effectively build adaptive capacity in the most vulnerable regions, TMNs should remove participation barriers for intermediary cities, improve incentives for institutional collaboration, and adopt more rigorous evaluative metrics. These results directly inform the governance, resource allocation, and operational goals of TMN stakeholders to advance distributive climate justice.","[Geldin, Samuel] Univ Penn, Sch Design, 210 South 34th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Geldin, S (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Sch Design, 210 South 34th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",sgeldin@design.upenn.edu,,,Yale Tropical Resources Institute; Yale Center for Southeast Asia Studies; Yale Center for East Asia Studies,Yale Tropical Resources Institute; Yale Center for Southeast Asia Studies; Yale Center for East Asia Studies,"I would like to thank the Yale Tropical Resources Institute, the Yale Center for Southeast Asia Studies, and the Yale Center for East Asia Studies for supporting this research.",,80,2,2,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,1746-0301,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

The expected declines of anthropogenic aerosols in the 21st century from present-day levels would cause an additional warming of the Earth's climate system, which would aggravate the climate extremes caused by GHG warming. We examine the increased rate of precipitation extremes with global mean surface warming in the 21st century caused by anthropogenic GHGs and aerosols, using an Earth system model ensemble simulation. Similar to mean precipitation, the increased rate of precipitation extremes caused by aerosol forcing is significantly larger than that caused by GHG forcing. The aerosol forcing in the coming decades can play a critical role in inducing change in precipitation extremes if a lower GHG emission pathway is adopted. Our results have implications for policy-making on climate adaptation to extreme precipitation events.","[Lin, Lei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lin, Lei; Wang, Zhili] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lin, Lei; Wang, Zhili] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Key Lab Atmospher Chem CMA, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lin, Lei] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Atmospher Sci, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yangyang] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX USA; [Fu, Qiang] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Sun Yat Sen University; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Lanzhou University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Wang, ZL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Wang, ZL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Key Lab Atmospher Chem CMA, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wangzl@camscma.cn,"Xu, Yangyang/I-1930-2018; Wang, Zhili/K-4111-2019; Fu, Qiang/W-5836-2019; Lin, Lei/AAA-8733-2020","Xu, Yangyang/0000-0001-7173-7761; Wang, Zhili/0000-0002-4392-3230; Lin, Lei/0000-0002-7946-4363","National Key Project of MOST [2016YFC0203306]; Fund for Creative Research Groups of National Natural Science Foundation of China [41321001]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41575139, 41305025, 41330527, 41575006]; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change; Advanced Study Program of NCAR; Regional and Global Climate Modeling Program of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science [DE-FC02-97ER62402]; National Science Foundation (NSF); NSF",National Key Project of MOST; Fund for Creative Research Groups of National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change; Advanced Study Program of NCAR; Regional and Global Climate Modeling Program of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This study was supported by the National Key Project of MOST (2016YFC0203306), the Fund for Creative Research Groups of National Natural Science Foundation of China (41321001), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41575139, 41305025, 41330527, and 41575006) and Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change.

Induced innovation could offset some of this threat. This paper explores the demand and supply for climate adaptation innovation in a market economy. Such innovation attenuates the past relationship between the population death rate and extreme heat. Climate change induces this innovation because the rising temperatures increase demand for self protection products and for profit firms respond to these incentives. We then augment the model to introduce climate skeptics. Such skeptics reject the claim that the world's average temperature is rising and thus do not increasingly demand adaptation products. In an economy featuring no government to enact optimal taxation, we quantify how rational agents are affected by the presence of climate skeptics. (C) 2017 University of Venice.

The primary emphasis on health-related concerns constrains the pro-environmental movements' ability to advance. Particularly in developing nations, financial institutions may be critical in promoting green recovery. This research uses data from 30 Chinese provinces from 2005 to 2021 to investigate whether adaptation preparation's financial mechanism affects the impact of climate change and green economic development (a measure of productivity growth). We applied numerous robustness tests for the validation of empirical findings of the study. The results shown that increased financial mechanisms have a considerable negative impact on economic development and productivity growth. However, the severity of these impacts depends heavily on the degree of adaptive preparedness. We find that increased financial inclusion may lead to a revival in economic development for provinces with improved adaptability capabilities (banking sector). On the other hand, climate change may have long-term negative effects on economic development and productivity growth in places with a limited capacity for adaptation. Therefore, in China financial mechanisms might affect green economic development and climate change mitigation are the quality of institutions and income level. The development plan must included by the practioners for furthure policy planning about climate adaptation.","[Liu, Puxin] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Liu, PX (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",puxinliu98@163.com,,,,,,,62,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1573-9414,1574-0277,,ECON CHANG RESTRUCT,Econ.

We used continuous suitability models capable of reflecting incremental changes to project the suitability of locations across New Zealand for cultivating apple and kiwifruit in the mid- and late-century. These projections used future weather data from climate model simulations for two contrasting greenhouse gas (GHG) pathways: stringent GHG mitigation and unabated GHG emissions. To improve the suitability of the modelled temperature data, specifically for use with biologically driven, crop suitability models, we developed new bias-variance adjustments that preserved climate change signals within the data. Preliminary projections of land use across a range of alternative primary industries were obtained from a multinomial logit model incorporating continuous suitability scores as predictors. We refined the preliminary land-use projections by providing them as inputs into a simulation model of land use incorporating other drivers and constraints. This methodology provides a means for projecting future land use and the spatial footprints of primary industries, based on biological and econometric considerations, under different modelled climate change scenarios.","[Vetharaniam, Indrakumar; Muller, Karin] New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res Ltd, Hamilton 3214, New Zealand; [Timar, Levente] Motu Econ & Publ Policy Res, Wellington 6142, New Zealand; [Stanley, C.

Local food production-rooted in collective local and Indigenous traditions, self-sufficiency, and climate-adaptive agricultural practices-has long emphasised a fibre-rich, plant-based diet; however, common histories of dietary colonialism have replaced local, small-scale farming and fisheries with non-nutritive cash crops, intensive livestock operations, and high-quality food exportation. Along with declines in traditional food availability, the resulting food import dependence has fostered a diabetogenic ecosystem composed of energy-dense cereal products, animal-based fats, and processed foods. The destabilisation of local food sectors undermines small island social and cultural systems, contributes to impoverishment and food insecurity during natural disasters, and, ultimately, can reduce diet quality and increase type 2 diabetes risk. Despite ongoing marginalisation of traditional local food systems, locally produced foods such as starchy roots, legumes, fruits, and seafood persist as nutritious and ecologically relevant cornerstones of self-determined local economic productivity and dietary health. Findings from community and epidemiological work suggest that local food production-bolstered by local and Indigenous agroecological knowledge, cultural preservation, and collective agency-can aid in reclaiming healthy and climate-resilient small island food systems.","[Marrero, Abrania; Mattei, Josiemer] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Thus far Earth system modeling efforts have primarily focused on projected mean state changes and the sensitivity of specific modes of climate variability, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, our knowledge of forced changes in the overall spectrum of climate variability and higher-order statistics is relatively limited. Here we present a new 100-member large ensemble of climate change projections conducted with the Community Earth System Model version 2 over 1850-2100 to examine the sensitivity of internal climate fluctuations to greenhouse warming. Our unprecedented simulations reveal that changes in variability, considered broadly in terms of probability distribution, amplitude, frequency, phasing, and patterns, are ubiquitous and span a wide range of physical and ecosystem variables across many spatial and temporal scales. Greenhouse warming in the model alters variance spectra of Earth system variables that are characterized by non-Gaussian probability distributions, such as rainfall, primary production, or fire occurrence. Our modeling results have important implications for climate adaptation efforts, resource management, seasonal predictions, and assessing potential stressors for terrestrial and marine ecosystems.","[Rodgers, Keith B.; Lee, Sun-Seon; Timmermann, Axel; Kim, Ji-Eun; Stein, Karl; Yamaguchi, Ryohei; Bodai, Tamas; Huang, Lei] Inst Basic Sci, Ctr Climate Phys, Busan, South Korea; [Rodgers, Keith B.; Lee, Sun-Seon; Timmermann, Axel; Kim, Ji-Eun; Stein, Karl; Yamaguchi, Ryohei; Bodai, Tamas; Huang, Lei] Pusan Natl Univ, Busan, South Korea; [Rosenbloom, Nan; Danabasoglu, Gokhan; Deser, Clara; Edwards, Jim; Simpson, Isla R.; Kim, Who M.; Lamarque, Jean-Francois; Lombardozzi, Danica L.; Wieder, William R.; Yeager, Stephen G.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Stuecker, Malte F.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Stuecker, Malte F.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Chung, Eui-Seok] Korea Polar Res Inst, Incheon, South Korea; [Wieder, William R.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Institute for Basic Science - Korea (IBS); Pusan National University; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI); University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Rodgers, KB; Timmermann, A (corresponding author), Inst Basic Sci, Ctr Climate Phys, Busan, South Korea.;Rodgers, KB; Timmermann, A (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Busan, South Korea.",krodgers@pusan.ac.kr; axel@ibsclimate.org,"Yamaguchi, Ryohei/HKV-4527-2023; Stuecker, Malte Fabian/H-6304-2011; Kim, Who Myung/F-5348-2018; Timmermann, Axel/F-4977-2011","Yamaguchi, Ryohei/0000-0002-7800-5798; Stuecker, Malte Fabian/0000-0001-8355-0662; Kim, Who Myung/0000-0001-5754-9852; Timmermann, Axel/0000-0003-0657-2969; Kim, Ji-Eun/0000-0002-3943-8902; Danabasoglu, Gokhan/0000-0003-4676-2732; WIEDER, WILLIAM/0000-0001-7116-1985; Rosenbloom, Nan/0000-0001-7389-3346; Stein, Karl/0000-0002-2432-1867","Institute for Basic Sciences (IBS), Republic of Korea [IBS-R028-Y1, IBS-R028-D1]; NOAA Climate Program Office Modeling Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) program [NA20OAR4310445]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture [2015-67003-23485]; NASA Interdisciplinary Science Program [NNX17AK19G]; Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) component of the Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program of the US Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) via the US NSF [IA 1947282]; US NSF [1852977]; Korea Polar Research Institute [PE21010]; Ministry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea [IBS-R028-D1-2021-A00] Funding Source: Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI), National Science & Technology Information Service (NTIS)","Institute for Basic Sciences (IBS), Republic of Korea; NOAA Climate Program Office Modeling Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) program; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); NASA Interdisciplinary Science Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) component of the Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program of the US Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) via the US NSF; US NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Korea Polar Research Institute(Korea Polar Research Institute of Marine Research Placement (KOPRI)); Ministry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea(Ministry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)","The work of Keith B.

While looking at the spatiotemporal variability of land surface temperature (LST), there is still a gap in understanding patterns of change. In this paper, we analysed diurnal and nocturnal annual mean LST trends in continental (Beijing), temperate (Mexico City and Santiago), and arid (Cairo, Hyderabad, and Riyadh) cities employing 1 km MODIS data (2003-2019). Each time-series was assessed with the structure of a space-time cube. Hot and cold spots were detected for each year and the LST trends were analysed. Each pixel was classified into different space-time LST trends and their SUHIs were estimated. Cities exhibit trends of increasing temperatures in cold and hot spots for diurnal and nocturnal data. Temperatures are increasing faster in hot spots for diurnal and in cold spots for nocturnal scenes. Steady hot spots and warming hot spots exhibit the highest SUHIs for day and night. Our approach provides a framework to empirically delineate the spatial intraurban heterogeneity of LST patterns over time. This spatially explicit information provides insights into urban areas requiring heat mitigation strategies and can be used to monitor the performance of measures already implemented for climate adaptation.

Literature suggests forest carbon sequestration (FCS) is a good alternative to mitigate climate change due to its ability to sequester carbon at low cost. Nevertheless, FCS subsidies have not been addressed together with impacts on food security and climate change reduced crop yields. In our multidisciplinary work, we collected the crop yield shocks from global circulation-crop modeling. We also developed a new version of a computable general equilibrium model for the economic analysis. Thus, we evaluate the global economic impacts of using carbon taxes and FCS to achieve 50% emission reductions. We find that implementing an aggressive FCS incentive can cause substantial increases in food prices because of land competition between forest and crop production. Without climate induced yield reductions, FCS is attractive, but not with the yield reductions. With the climate induced yield shocks, food price increases are huge-so large that it is clear this approach could not be adopted in the real world. The results cry out for investment in agricultural research on climate adaptation. Our findings suggest economic well-being falls more without mitigation than with 50% emission reductions.","[Pena-Levano, Luis Moises] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, 1200 N Pk Rd,Off 104, Plant City, FL 33563 USA; [Taheripour, Farzad; Tyner, Wallace E.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Pena-Levano, LM (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, 1200 N Pk Rd,Off 104, Plant City, FL 33563 USA.",lpenalevano@ufl.edu,"LEVANO, Luis PENA/AAW-7095-2020","LEVANO, Luis PENA/0000-0003-2486-8472","Purdue Climate Change Research Center (PCCRC); Ludwig Kruhe Fellowship, Purdue University, U.S","Purdue Climate Change Research Center (PCCRC); Ludwig Kruhe Fellowship, Purdue University, U.S","Partial funding for this research was provided by the Purdue Climate Change Research Center (PCCRC) and the Ludwig Kruhe Fellowship, Purdue University, U.S. We are also thankful for the suggestions by Dr. Thomas Hertel who provided important insights that improved our study.",,69,21,21,9,55,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We find that while California's total annual energy consumption increased by just 2:6%-during the analysis period, the amount of water required to produce that energy grew by 260%. Neatly all of the increase in California's energy-related water footprint was associated with water use in locations outside of California, where energy products that the state consumes were, and continue to be, produced.

In Canada, the government of British Columbia spent several years developing its Future Forest Ecosystems Initiative as part of a larger climate change response strategy in the forest sector. Similarly, in the United States, wildfire related events have led to climate change inspired efforts by individual states (e.g., Alaska, California) and the US Forest Service has recently undertaken plans to incorporate climate change considerations in national forest planning beginning with the National Road Map for Responding to Climate Change. This paper highlights a number of shortcomings with both these national and sub-national strategies with respect to the relationships existing between governance, forestry and climate change. It proposes incorporating considerations of governance mechanisms directly into forest sector planning and the need to assess not only natural system level changes but also the extent to which new problems can be dealt with by 'old' or 'new' governance arrangements.

Most studies focused on traditional ecological or indigenous knowledge. Three simple questions were addressed: (1) How are changes in climate recognized? (2) What is known about how to adapt to changes in climate? (3) How do people learn about how to adapt? Awareness of change is an important element of local knowledge. Changes in climate are recognized at multiple time scales from observations that warn of imminent extreme weather through expectations for the next season to identification of multi-year historical trends. Observations are made of climate, its impact on physical resources, and bio-indicators. Local knowledge about how to adapt can be divided into four major classes: land and water management, physical infrastructure, livelihood strategies, and social institutions. Adaptation actions vary with time scale of interest from dealing with risks of disaster from extreme weather events, through slow onset changes such as seasonal droughts, to dealing with long-term multi-year shifts in climate. Local knowledge systems differ in the capacities and ways in which they support learning. Many are dynamic and draw on information from other places, whereas others are more conservative and tightly institutionalized. Past experience of events and ways of learning may be insufficient for dealing with a novel climate. Once the strengths and limitations of local knowledge (like those of science) are grasped the opportunities for meaningful hybridization of scientific and local knowledge for adaptation expand.","Chiang Mai Univ, Unit Social & Environm Res, Fac Social Sci, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand",Chiang Mai University,"Lebel, L (corresponding author), Chiang Mai Univ, Unit Social & Environm Res, Fac Social Sci, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.",llebel@loxinfo.co.th,"Lebel, Louis/D-4130-2014","Lebel, Louis/0000-0001-6187-6418",Adaptation Knowledge Platform,Adaptation Knowledge Platform,"The preparation of this paper was supported by the Adaptation Knowledge Platform.

The context for these measures has been changing both as a consequence of the growth of the global economy and as a result of the biophysical transformations that are integral to this expansion through the period of the great acceleration. Climate adaptation practices frequently invoked practices of enclosure and expulsion that are often counter-productive. Novel circumstances due to accelerating Anthropocene change now shape the policy landscape, while numerous policy-makers grapple with how to implement the Sustainable Development Goals. These require rethinking the bordering practices that govern environmental matters and the relationships of territory to ecological function.

This is because of the lack of detailed analysis for decision-makers regarding construction and maintenance costs for different types and how effective various measures are at managing precipitation at a catchment scale. This paper contributes to fill this gap in knowledge by developing a green infrastructure cost-effectiveness ranking index (GICRI) able to evaluate the stormwater runoff volume reduction of multiple green infrastructure alternatives under different climate change scenarios, over differing spatial configurations and combining this performance data with their construction and maintenance costs. After applying this model over two case study areas, this paper provides three main insights. First, climate change projections have a significant impact on green infrastructure cost-effectiveness. Second, as green infrastructure cost-effectiveness is influenced by the spatial scale, there are different challenges for larger cities and smaller regional towns. Building on this, the paper argues that GICRI can be a simple and fast heuristic to increase the use of green infrastructure by informing decision-makers regarding how and where to prioritize investment or where greater modelling is needed.","[Junqueira, Juliana Reu; Serrao-Neumann, Silvia; White, Iain] Univ Waikato, Sch Social Sci, Environm Planning Programme, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Serrao-Neumann, Silvia] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Brisbane, Australia; [Junqueira, Juliana Reu] Univ Waikato, Sch Social Sci, Environm Planning Programme, Knighton Rd 1, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand",University of Waikato; Griffith University; University of Waikato,"Junqueira, JR (corresponding author), Univ Waikato, Sch Social Sci, Environm Planning Programme, Knighton Rd 1, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",jj152@students.waikato.ac.nz,,"Reu Junqueira, Juliana/0000-0002-2218-4862",University of Waikato,University of Waikato,University of Waikato,,47,1,1,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1747-6585,1747-6593,,WATER ENVIRON J,Water Environ.

Studying adaptation not only assists in knowing how farmers are dealing with the repercussions of climate change, but also provides the baseline for the planned interventions which are essential in this era of human-instigated climate change. We used case study data to examine whether and how subsistence-oriented smallholder farmers in three agro-ecological zones of Nepal (Terai, Hill, and Mountain) are developing and implementing adaptation strategies. The findings from small farm household interviews (n = 384), key informant interviews (n = 33), and focus group discussions (n = 3) suggest that farmers are dealing with the challenges facing their traditional agricultural practices. The main adaptation strategies include changing crop types and varieties, adding fertilizers, the use of new technologies, soil and water management, diversification of income sources, and migration. Both climatic and non-climatic factors were found to influence these subsistence smallholder farmers' adaptation practices. However, climatic factors that are beyond individual control threatened the livelihood of rural farmers who predominantly rely on natural resources for their livelihood and income. The findings highlight the interplay of multiple agents: local farmers, community-based organizations, and the local and central government organizations in the role they play in assisting farmers adapt to the impacts of climate change; this interplay emphasizes the need for collaboration for effective adaptation. The findings from this study can inform policymakers about ongoing adaptation measures as well as the needs of farmers. This information can assist in bridging the gap between farm households and policymakers and help develop suitable policies and effective adaptation strategies within this local Nepalese context.","[Karki, Sikha; Burton, Paul] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Gold Coast Campus, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Karki, Sikha] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Gold Coast Campus, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Mackey, Brendan] Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Gold Coast Campus, Nathan, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University,"Karki, S (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Gold Coast Campus, Nathan, Qld, Australia.;Karki, S (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Gold Coast Campus, Nathan, Qld, Australia.",sikha.karki@griffithuni.edu.au,"Mackey, Brendan/ABE-3805-2020; Burton, Paul/AAG-3436-2020","Burton, Paul/0000-0002-6092-0779; Mackey, Brendan/0000-0003-1996-4064; Karki, Sikha/0000-0002-9739-5584",Griffith University,Griffith University(Griffith University),Thanks to Griffith University Postgraduate Scholarship for providing financial support to the first author for conducting this study.

Positive effects of urban green infrastructure (GI) were found for NO2 removal, recreation opportunities and lowered urban heat island effect.

Institutional framing of change imperatives can significantly condition associated governance responses. This paper builds on scholarly conversations concerning the conceptual role of 'storylines' in shaping institutional responses to climate change through governance. I draw on conceptual perspectives of climate change as a 'transformative stressor', which can compel institutional transformation within planning. The concepts of storylines and transformative stressors are conceptually linked. The conceptual approach is applied to an empirical enquiry focused on the regional planning regime of South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia. In this paper I report on and examine three institutional storylines of responding to climate change through planning governance in SEQ. I conclude that the manifestation of climate change as a transformative stressor in SEQ prompted institutional transformation, leading to a dominant storyline focused on climate adaptation as an important facet of regional planning governance.","Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Property & Planning Discipline, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Matthews, T (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Property & Planning Discipline, 2 George St,GPO Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",tony.matthews@qut.edu.au,,"Matthews, Tony/0000-0003-0838-5462",,,,,45,5,5,3,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0263-774X,1472-3425,,ENVIRON PLANN C,Environ.

After bleaching most of the brightness losses were regained with the exception of the high-intensity sprinkled wood. The high-intensity sprinkling also gave poorer brightness stability. Pulp made from blue stained wood suffered from decreased brightness compared with corresponding non-infected wood.

With projected increase (0.70-1.03 degrees C) in spring temperature and reduction (6-55%) in winter precipitation, the upper Zayandeh-Rud sub-basin, the main source of renewable water supply, will likely become warmer and drier. In the lower sub-basin, 1.1-1.5 degrees C increase in temperature and 11-31% decrease in annual precipitation are likely. A system dynamics model was used to analyze adaptation strategies taking into account feedbacks between water resources development and biophysical and socioeconomic sub-systems. Results suggest that infrastructural improvements, rigorous water demand management (e.g., replacing high water demand crops such as rice, corn, and alfalfa), and ecosystem-based regulatory prioritization, complemented by supply augmentation can temporarily alleviate water stress in a basin that is essentially governed by the Limits to Growth archetype.","[Gohari, Alireza] Isfahan Univ Technol, Coll Agr, Dept Water Engn, Esfahan, Iran; [Mirchi, Ali] Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Civil Engn, 500 W Univ Ave, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; [Mirchi, Ali] Univ Texas El Paso, Ctr Environm Resource Management, 500 W Univ Ave, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; [Madani, Kaveh] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London SW7 2AZ, England",Isfahan University of Technology; University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso; University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso; Imperial College London,"Madani, K (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London SW7 2AZ, England.",alirezagohari@gmail.com; amirchi@utep.edu; k.madani@imperial.ac.uk,"Madani, Kaveh/E-9366-2011","Madani, Kaveh/0000-0003-0378-3170; Gohari, Alireza/0000-0002-6587-3836",,,,,69,76,79,2,48,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

However, there is insufficient information about the effectiveness of adaption policies, measures and actions. For this reason, the establishment of monitoring programmes is considered to be necessary. Such programmes can contribute to knowledge, learning and data to support adaptation governance. In the European Union (EU), member states are encouraged to develop National Adaptation Strategies (NASs). The NASs developed so far vary widely because of differing views, approaches and policies. A number of member states have progressed to monitoring and evaluating the implementation of their NAS. It is possible to identify key elements in these monitoring programmes that can inform the wider policy learning process. In this paper, four generic building blocks for creating a monitoring and evaluation programme are proposed: (1) definition of the system of interest, (2) selection of a set of indicators, (3) identification of the organisations responsible for monitoring and (4) definition of monitoring and evaluation procedures. The monitoring programmes for NAS in three member states-Finland, the UK and Germany-were analysed to show how these elements have been used in practice, taking into account their specific contexts. It is asserted that the provision of a common framework incorporating these elements will help other member states and organisations within them in setting up and improving their adaptation monitoring programmes.","[Klostermann, Judith; van de Sandt, Kaj] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, WUR Alterra, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Minnen, Jelle; Pieterse, Nico; van Bree, Leendert] Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy PBL, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Harley, Mike] Climate Resilience Ltd, Rutland, England; [Hilden, Mikael] Finnish Environm Inst, Helsinki, Finland; [Leiter, Timo] Deutsch Gesell Int Zusammenarbeit GIZ GmbH, Competence Ctr Climate Change, Rabat, Morocco",Wageningen University & Research; Finnish Environment Institute,"Klostermann, J (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, WUR Alterra, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",Judith.Klostermann@wur.nl,"Leiter, Timo/Y-8069-2019","Leiter, Timo/0000-0003-4982-8063","Dutch National Research Programme Knowledge for Climate, theme 8; EU-project BASE [308337]","Dutch National Research Programme Knowledge for Climate, theme 8; EU-project BASE","This research has been funded by the Dutch National Research Programme Knowledge for Climate, theme 8 (www.knowledgeforclimate.org).

What is the relationship between residents' exposure, perceptions of climate trends, and concerns about the future? How do these factors influence openness to different adaption strategies? Are these strategies considered to be progressive-where protection is indexed to minor threats and retreat occurs when protection measures fail-or are these dichotomous choices? We apply structural equation modeling to evaluate these decision pathways using a 2017 household survey in North Carolina's (USA) Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula (n = 147).

Meanwhile, climate change (CC) is a crucial issue limiting agricultural production worldwide. Farmers' lives, severely affected by extreme weather conditions, are resulting in the reduced production of major economic crops. The CC has drastically influenced the major agricultural sectors of Pakistan, leading to a significant decline in farmers' living standards and the overall economy. Climate-smart and eco-friendly agricultural practices can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and ameliorate agricultural productivity under extreme environmental conditions. This paper highlights farmers' autonomous CC adaptation strategies and their influence on cash crop (maize for this study) yield under prevailing circumstances. The current study used a simultaneous equation model to examine the different adaptation impacts on adapters and non-adapters. The survey results of 498 maize farmers in rural Pakistan revealed that growers were aware of the recent CC and had taken adequate adaptive measures to acclimatize to CC. Farmers' arable land area, awareness level, and information accessibility to CC are the most crucial factors that impart a significant role in their adaptation judgments. However, most growers have inadequate adaptation strategies, including improved irrigation and the utilization of extensive fertilizers and pesticides. Using a simultaneous equation model of endogenous switching regression, the study found that farmers not adapted to CC were negatively affecting maize productivity. Therefore, this study suggests that policymakers pay attention to the countermeasures farmers have not taken to mitigate the impact of CC. In addition, policymakers should deliver appropriate adaptation strategies to assist growers in coping with climate-related natural hazards and ensure farmers' livelihood security, rural revitalization, and sustainable agricultural development.","[Khan, Nawab; Kazim, Rizwan; Zhang, Shemei] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Management, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China; [Ma, Jiliang] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Dev, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Kassem, Hazem S.] King Saud Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Rural Soc, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia; [Ray, Ram L.] Prairie View A&M Univ, Coll Agr & Human Sci, Prairie View, TX 77446 USA; [Ihtisham, Muhammad] Yibin Univ, Sch Agr Forestry & Food Engn, Yibin 644000, Peoples R China; [Ihtisham, Muhammad] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Hort & Forestry, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China","Sichuan Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Economics & Development, CAAS; King Saud University; Texas A&M University System; Prairie View A&M University; Yibin University; Huazhong Agricultural University","Zhang, SM (corresponding author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Management, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.",zhangshemei@163.com,"Kassem, Hazem/AAG-9089-2020","Kassem, Hazem/0000-0001-9327-3283; Jiliang, Ma/0000-0002-9734-1164; Ihtisham, Muhammad/0009-0005-3614-5281; Ray, Ram L/0000-0002-7833-9253","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [RSP-2021/403]","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University)","The authors extend their appreciation to the researchers supporting the project of (No: RSP-2021/403) King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",,88,2,2,11,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Using results from a nationally representative sample in Bangladesh, one of the most climate-vulnerable nations in the world, we examine citizens' perspectives about the responsibility of different levels of government to address climate change problems. Inasmuch as Bangladeshi survey respondents do draw distinctions, they trust local governments more than the national one. However, local governments tend to be relatively weak vis-a-vis the national government: political and financial resources are concentrated there, and the national government has access to the resources of international financial institutions. Furthermore, respondents tend to view local officials as embedded community networks more than as formal government agents. We conclude that better public communications across levels of government with vulnerable communities are needed if these communities are to protect themselves from extreme weather events, access services, and reap the benefits of polycentric climate adaptation governance across a full range of levels.","[Eisenstadt, Todd A.] Amer Univ, Ctr Environm Policy, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Haque, Tawfique] North South Univ, South Asian Inst Policy & Governance, Dhaka 1229, Bangladesh; [Toman, Michael] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Wright, Matthew] Univ British Columbia, Ctr Migrat Studies, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",American University; North South University (NSU); Resources for the Future; University of British Columbia,"Eisenstadt, TA (corresponding author), Amer Univ, Ctr Environm Policy, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",eisensta@american.edu; tawfique.haque@northsouth.edu; toman@rff.org; matthew.wright@ubc.ca,,"Eisenstadt, Todd/0000-0003-3431-0819; Toman, Michael/0000-0001-6570-7398",World Bank's administrative budget,World Bank's administrative budget,"This research was funded by the World Bank's administrative budget for research support, which was allocated to M.T. for use in covering costs associated with the other authors' participation.

However, are emerging adaptation interventions equitable by reflecting the priorities of local level vulnerable populations? This research sought to find out whether the engagement of local institutions in projects that seek to achieve country ownership enabled local level vulnerable groups to participate in and influence adaptation decision-making processes and outcomes, thereby enabling them to have a voice in local level adaptation. It used a case study of a Global Environmental Facility-managed coastal adaptation project in Tanzania, which sought to restore and protect mangroves to enable adaptation to sea level rise. Data was generated from 13 Focus Group Discussions and survey questionnaires administered to 629 individuals in three locations on the mainland of Tanzania and in Zanzibar. The findings indicate that community-based organizations were used to facilitate the implementation of project activities at the community level. However, participation spaces created in the project and facilitated by these local institutions were exclusionary and failed to enable vulnerable community groups to have a voice on mangrove restoration and protection. Use of these local institutions altered local level power relations and disempowered other pre-existing and (in)formal local resource management institutions. Community members questioned legitimacy of actions implemented by these local institutions. These findings suggest that working with local level stakeholders to generate country ownership does not automatically guarantee that actions will address the needs of local vulnerable groups. Multilateral climate finance institutions should acknowledge these risks and implement measures to address them.","[Omukuti, Jessica] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 5AH, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Omukuti, J (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 5AH, Berks, England.",j.a.omukuti@pgr.reading.ac.uk,,"OMUKUTI, Jessica/0000-0003-3094-8647","Leverhulme Doctoral Programme in Climate Justice: Ethics, Politics, Law at the University of Reading [DS-2014-002]","Leverhulme Doctoral Programme in Climate Justice: Ethics, Politics, Law at the University of Reading","This work was funded through the Leverhulme Doctoral Programme in Climate Justice: Ethics, Politics, Law (Grant number DS-2014-002) at the University of Reading.",,102,13,13,4,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,MAY,2020,94,,,,,,,,104525,10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104525,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104525,,,12,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LE4WJ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000526720000014,View Full Record in Web of Science

These settlements, too, are sites for climate hazards such as heat stress and flooding, affecting climate-displaced and economic migrants alike. The demands of growing migrant populations and long-term informal settlement dwellers converge around rights to secure land and housing, acknowledged in policies at both national and urban scales. Yet, settlements continue to face evictions, revealing a significant mismatch between policy aspirations and concrete urban planning strategies. Based on our ongoing research in the informal settlements of Dhaka, Bangladesh, we point to a structural condition we call discursive partition which continues to exclude climate-impacted dwellers from urban resilience policies despite their formal recognition in national climate policies. Based on evidence of how climate-impacted dwellers themselves lead urban adaptation, we point to three critical revisitations for just climate adaptation plans.","[Huq, Efadul] Sith Coll, Environm Sci & Policy, Northampton, MA 01063 USA; [Shafique, Tanzil] Univ Sheffield, Arts Tower Level 14 19, Sheffield S10 2TN, England",University of Sheffield,"Huq, E (corresponding author), Sith Coll, Environm Sci & Policy, Northampton, MA 01063 USA.",ehuq@smith.edu; t.i.shafique@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,98,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,1746-0301,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

We describe an array of emerging evidence-based approaches, including greening gray infrastructure, restoring habitats, and developing biotechnologies. We then explore new economic instruments and incentives for supporting these new approaches and evaluate their feasibility in delivering these objectives.

This study takes advantage of climate opportunities and provides a new concept and mode of urban climate services in order to address climate change. Eighteen indicators based on climate and climate-related variables were used to provide an assessment, in the form of an index, of how livable a city is depending on prevailing climatic conditions. The resulting index can also be used to investigate how recent and future changes in the climatic conditions could affect livability. All Chinese cities and regions share the common goals of promoting low-carbon development, improving resilience against climate change, and integrating economic growth with climate actions. Climate services have been developed in China to provide decision-makers this measure of livability. Such a move facilitates sustainable development alongside economic growth by aiding government efforts in climate adaptation and low-carbon development. Our approach represents multidisciplinary and demand-driven research on adaptation to and the impacts of regional climate change, thereby transforming climate science into a climate service and ensuring that climate information can be provided in a scientific, practical, and customized way for policy-makers. The outputs can be used locally to take concrete climate actions and integrate climate services into decision-making processes.","[Wang Yu-Jie] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Int Joint Res Lab Climate & Environm Change,Colla, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Wang Yu-Jie] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Chen Yu; Song Lian-Chun; Ai Wan-Xiu; Han Zhen-Yu; Li Xiu-Cang; Huang Zi-Li] China Meteorol Adm, Lab Climate Change, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hewitt, Chris] Met Off, Exeter EX1 3BP, Devon, England; [Hewitt, Chris] Univ Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Ding Wei-Hua] Zhejiang Meteorol Bur, Jiande Meteorol Serv, Hangzhou 311600, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; China Meteorological Administration; Met Office - UK; University of Southern Queensland,"Song, LC (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Lab Climate Change, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",songlc@cma.gov.cn,,"Hewitt, Chris/0000-0002-4718-4009",National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFA0606302]; UKeChina Research & Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office CSSP China as part of the Newton Fund,National Key R&D Program of China; UKeChina Research & Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office CSSP China as part of the Newton Fund,This work was jointly supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFA0606302) and by the UKeChina Research & Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office CSSP China as part of the Newton Fund.,,37,1,1,16,61,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING, 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1674-9278,,,ADV CLIM CHANG RES,Adv.

Therefore, an urgent need exists for reliable meteorological data in other environments (e.g., cities, lakes, forests) to complement these conventional networks.

Increasingly, a toolbox of methods is employed to facilitate stakeholder input. In this paper we evaluate four potential added values of using a toolbox of methods and the effect on the quality of resulting scenarios. Ten case studies within a large project (SCENES), that set out to develop participatory scenarios for Europe's freshwaters, are used to test our hypotheses. We analysed a first series of scenario workshops, evaluating (dis)advantages of the toolbox and the quality of scenarios as perceived by stakeholders and local organisers. As can be deduced from the resulting scenarios, results indicate that all hypothesised added values materialised to some extent. Using a toolbox enlarges the possibilities to: (1) adapt to local circumstances; (2) adapt to a variety of stakeholders; (3) compare results across scales and across case studies; and (4) facilitate a link of models and stories. However, a careful balance has to be found between the length of workshop, number and type of tools employed, and previous experience of stakeholders and local organisers. The results have implications for practitioners setting out to develop water or climate adaptation scenarios that could benefit from all the added values tested here. Finally, employing a toolbox can positively influence scenario quality, although more structured tests are needed.","[Kok, Kasper; van Vliet, Mathijs] Wageningen Univ, Land Dynam Grp, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Kok, K (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Land Dynam Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",kasper.kok@wur.nl,"van Vliet, Mathijs/G-3381-2012","van Vliet, Mathijs/0000-0003-1820-8144; Kok, Kasper/0000-0002-6319-9227",European Commission [036822],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"We want to acknowledge the support of SCENES by the European Commission under contract number 036822.

To respond to this threat, the structure of the delta's agriculture-based economy must transform, becoming more adaptive to changing conditions. One adaptive livelihood option is the use of flood-based farming systems in the upper VMD. The present study examines local perceptions of such a system in Dong Thap Province, a lowland, flood-affected area of the upper VMD. Specifically, we explored lotus farming as a potential flood-based adaptive livelihood model for the region. The study advances the current literature by using historical research, embedded in narrative analysis applying the social construction of technology (SCOT) lens. We collected data through in-depth interviews and field surveys to qualitatively analyze the emergence and status of lotus cultivation in the study area, zooming in on how local society evolved with expansion of this farming model. The findings suggest that as an innovative idea, lotus farming initially emerged due to unfavorable natural conditions, and then was developed as an attractive nature-based livelihood, and thus received increased attention. It has been accepted and modified over time according to the new interests of further stepped-in stakeholders.

Andean rural communities are particularly vulnerable to changing social and environmental conditions. Changing climate over the past forty years and current forecast models point to increasing temperatures and later onset of rains during the growing season. Current meteorological models are coarse grained and not well suited to the complex topology of the Andes-so local-scale information is required for decisions. This article outlines a process for developing new local knowledge that can be used to enhance adaptive processes. This is a three-step process that includes assessment of local knowledge, the development of future scenarios, and the use of participatory research methods to identify alternative adaptation strategies. Initial analyses based on the survey of 330 households in nine communities indicate that northern Alitplano communities are more vulnerable than central Altiplano ones. In both areas, losses from climate shocks are high, but the types of hazards vary by location. The use of local knowledge indicators of climate is declining, and downscaling of climate forecasts is unlikely to occur due to the lack of data points and the large number of microclimates. Participatory mapping and research, where knowledge is shared, are processes that enhance adaptive capacity and are critical to building resilience. This article outlines a strategy for linking science-based and indigenous methods to develop early warning systems that are an important part of coping strategies. This approach combines science and indigenous knowledge to enhance adaptive capacity.","[Valdivia, Corinne] Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Seth, Anji] Univ Connecticut, Dept Geog, Storrs, CT 06296 USA; [Gilles, Jere L.] Univ Missouri, Dept Rural Sociol, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Garcia, Magali; Cusicanqui, Jorge; Navia, Fredy; Yucra, Edwin] Univ Mayor San Andres, Fac Agron, Inst Invest Agropecuarias & Recursos Nat, La Paz, Bolivia; [Jimenez, Elizabeth] Univ Mayor San Andres, CIDES Postgrado Ciencias Desarrollo, La Paz, Bolivia",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Connecticut; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Universidad Mayor de San Andres; Universidad Mayor de San Andres,"Valdivia, C (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Dept Agr Econ, 200 Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",valdiviac@missouri.edu; anji.seth@uconn.edu; gillesj@missouri.edu; magalygc1@yahoo.es; ejimeneza@entelnet.bo; acusican@gmail.com; anavia@umsa.bo; yucra@gmail.com,,"Yucra Sea, Edwin Eusebio/0000-0001-9001-0031; Gilles, Jere/0000-0002-8260-6924",,,,,55,121,127,2,148,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-5608,1467-8306,,ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR,Ann.

The specific survey carried out amongst relevant local stakeholders showed a high level of concern about the current and future effects of climate change on the physical and socio-economic structures of the Ebro delta. The results of the survey also showed that there is a general agreement on the lack of social and political awareness of the problems that climate change can create in the delta in the near future, as well as a lack of adaptation strategies (only suggested or already being implemented). Finally, the conclusions of the study mainly rely on the different adaptation strategies proposed by previous studies.

Higher water temperatures and changes in extremes hydrometeorological events (including floods and droughts) are likely to exacerbate different types of pressures on water resources with possible negative impacts on ecosystems and human health. In addition, sea-level rise is expected to extend areas of salinisation of groundwater and estuaries, resulting in a decrease of freshwater availability for humans and ecosystems in coastal areas. Furthermore, climate-related changes in water quantity and quality are expected to affect food availability, water access and utilisation, especially in arid and semi-arid areas, as well as the operation of water infrastructure (e.g. hydropower, flood defences, and irrigation systems). This paper serves as an introduction to the special issue of Environment Science & Policy dealing with climate change impacts on water-related disasters. It provides a brief background about relevant EU water policies and examples of EU-funded research trends which illustrate on-going efforts to improve understanding and modelling of climate changes related to the hydrological cycles at scales that are relevant to decision making (possibly linked to policy).

The need for effective restoration tools capable of promoting large-scale recovery of coastal ecosystems in the face of intensifying climatic stress has never been greater. We identify four major challenges for more effective implementation of coastal marine ecosystem restoration (MER): (1) development of effective, scalable restoration methods, (2) incorporation of innovative tools that promote climate adaptation, (3) integration of social and ecological restoration priorities, and (4) promotion of the perception and use of coastal MER as a scientifically credible management approach. Tackling these challenges should improve restoration success rates, heighten their recognition, and accelerate investment in and promotion of coastal MER. To reverse the accelerating decline of marine ecosystems, we discuss potential directions for meeting these challenges by applying coastal MER tools that are science-based and actionable. For coastal restoration to have a global impact, it must incorporate social science, technological and conceptual advances, and plan for future climate scenarios.","[Abelson, Avigdor] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Reed, Daniel C.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Edgar, Graham J.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Smith, Carter S.; Silliman, Brian] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Beaufort, NC USA; [Kendrick, Gary A.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Kendrick, Gary A.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Orth, Robert J.] Coll William & Mary, Sch Marine Sci, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; [Airoldi, Laura] Univ Padua, Chioggia Hydrobiol Stn Umberto DAncona, Dept Biol, UO CoNISMa, Chioggia, Italy; [Airoldi, Laura] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento BIGEA & CIRSA, Ravenna, Italy; [Beck, Michael W.; Nelson, Peter] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Krause, Gesche] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res AWI, Alfred Wegener Inst, Earth Syst Knowledge Platform ESKP, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Shashar, Nadav; Stambler, Noga] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Fac Life Sci, Eilat Campus, Elat, Israel; [Stambler, Noga] Israel Soc Ecol & Environm Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel","Tel Aviv University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of Tasmania; Duke University; University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia; William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science; University of Padua; University of Bologna; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Ben Gurion University","Abelson, A (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, Tel Aviv, Israel.",avigdor@tauex.tau.ac.il,"Airoldi, Laura/I-3553-2019; Edgar, Graham/C-8341-2013","Airoldi, Laura/0000-0001-5046-0871; Edgar, Graham/0000-0003-0833-9001; Kendrick, Gary/0000-0002-0276-6064","project TETRIS (PRIN 2011, Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research); project CASCADE (INTERREG V A Italy-Croatia CBC Program); United States National Science Foundation's Long Term Ecological Research program; Lenfest Ocean Program; Australian Research Council Linkage grant [LP130100155]; Israel's Ministry of Environmental Protection; Israel Society of Ecology and Environmental Sciences","project TETRIS (PRIN 2011, Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); project CASCADE (INTERREG V A Italy-Croatia CBC Program); United States National Science Foundation's Long Term Ecological Research program; Lenfest Ocean Program; Australian Research Council Linkage grant(Australian Research Council); Israel's Ministry of Environmental Protection; Israel Society of Ecology and Environmental Sciences","LA was supported by projects TETRIS (PRIN 2011, Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research) and CASCADE (INTERREG V A Italy-Croatia CBC Program), and DR by the United States National Science Foundation's Long Term Ecological Research program.

Changes in this region pose a heightened threat due to the immense amount of carbon frozen as organic material in the soil. When permafrost thaws, organic material decays and releases as greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to further warming. A better understanding of the processes that influence permafrost degradation is needed to inform climate adaptation and mitigation planning. This study assesses changes to Arctic permafrost across 35 ensemble member simulations from the Community Earth System Model 1 Large Ensemble Project, under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 21st century scenario. Most Arctic near-surface permafrost is lost by 2100, but timing varies across regions and with soil depth. Internal climate variability, represented by differences between ensemble members, has a constrained influence on degradation timing due to relative consistency of summer temperature increases and insulation by winter snow cover.","[McSweeney, Killian; Kooperman, Gabriel J.] Univ Georgia, Dept Geog, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Kooperman, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Geog, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",kooperman@uga.edu,,,"U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) Program [DE-SC0019459, DE-SC0021209]; University of Georgia's Center for Undergraduate Research Opportunities; National Science Foundation (NSF)",U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); University of Georgia's Center for Undergraduate Research Opportunities; National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The authors acknowledge support from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) Program (DE-SC0019459 and DE-SC0021209).

Drawing on 105 interviews with people involved in salmon management, this study embeds risk assessments of selective breeding in the context of present interventions into salmon life cycles. While responses to novel technologies are frequently plotted along a support-opposition continuum, the debate over selective breeding Pacific salmon is multivalent, with respondents supporting selective breeding in some contexts while opposing it in others. Nearly half of respondents supported selective breeding to fix the mistakes of past interventions and rewild salmon. Given that past problems have stemmed from technological responses, these findings paradoxically suggest that further interventions may not necessarily be perceived as violating values of naturalness or wildness. Genomic technologies offer new pathways for climate adaptation. In doing so, they expand ethical debates about the role of humans and novel technologies in conserving and managing wildlife.","[Berseth, Valerie] Univ British Columbia, Dept Sociol, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Berseth, V (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Sociol, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",valerieberseth@alumni.ubc.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Genome Canada; Genome Quebec; Genome BC,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Genome Canada(Genome Canada); Genome Quebec; Genome BC,"This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, Genome Canada, Genome Quebec, and Genome BC.",,63,1,1,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2325-1042,,,ENVIRON SOCIOL,Envir.

Most research on environmental migration examines the drivers of mobility, identifying the locations that are most affected by environmental change. By contrast, little attention is paid to where migrants might move to in response to these changes. The paper argues that much can be learned from applying established knowledge from the migration research literature to the specifics of environmental mobility. Migration destinations of environmental movers are examined in two different contexts. First, research is reported relating to the migration destinations of populations affected by drought and food insecurity. Second, Europe is studied as a destination region for migration flows. The paper concludes that, in place of estimates of the number of environmental migrants, a more productive focus of research would be to achieve deeper understanding of the destinations selected by current environmental migrants, and to appreciate why immobility is as great a problem as movement to new locations for those concerned with climate adaptation planning.","Univ Dundee, Sch Environm, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland",University of Dundee,"Findlay, AM (corresponding author), Univ Dundee, Sch Environm, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",a.m.findlay@dundee.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/G027153/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G027153/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,54,94,94,8,50,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

In the urban context, such adaptation strategies require a thorough under-standing of the built-up response to the incoming solar radiation, i.e., the urban energy balance cycle and its implications for the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Despite readily available, diurnal Land Surface Temperature (LST) data does not provide a meaningful picture of the UHI, in these midlatitudes FUAs. On the contrary, the mid-morning satellite overpass is characterized by the absence of a significant surface UHI (SUHI) signal, corre-sponding to the period of the day when the urban-rural air temperature difference is typically negative. Conversely, nocturnal high-resolution LST data is rarely available. In this study, an energy balance-based machine learning ap-proach is explored, considering the Local Climate Zones (LCZ), to describe the daily cycle of the heat flux components and predict the nocturnal SUHI, during an HW event. While the urban and rural spatial outlines are not visible in the diurnal thermal image, they become apparent in the latent and storage heat flux maps - built-up infrastructures up -take heat during the day which is released back into the atmosphere, during the night, whereas vegetation land sur-faces loose diurnal heat through evapotranspiration. For the LST prediction model, a random forest (RF) approach is implemented. RF results show that the model accurately predicts the LST, ensuring mean square errors inferior to 0.1 K. Both the latent and storage heat flux components, together with LCZ classification, are the most important ex-planatory variables for the nocturnal LST prediction, supporting the adoption of the energy balance approach. In fu -ture research, other locations and time-series data shall be trained and tested, providing an efficient local urban climate monitoring tool, where in-situ air temperature observations are not available.

It generally involves a process of defining climate impacts, vulnerabilities, and actions that can build community resilience. Typically, these processes rely on climate experts and policy-makers to define what is at risk, and therefore what is worthy of investment and protection. Emerging approaches to community-based adaptation-planning advocate for stronger community control over these processes. Drawing on a place-based approach to adaptation, this paper examines place meaning as a co-constructed process. It explores how this process shapes opportunities for community-based climate action in Churchill, Canada. Results indicate that community members acknowledge many competing threats to their sense of place, and suggest that this competition may reduce the perceived need to prioritise climate action to protect connections to place. Results also reveal a concern among community members that local place identity has been appropriated for economic gain, which may further reduce the drive to act in protection of an already exploited sense of place. Overall, findings support calls to adopt place-based perspectives to enhance the capacity of adaptation planning to understand local needs, values, and levers for action.","[Groulx, Mark] Univ Northern British Columbia, Sch Environm Planning, 3333 Univ Way, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada",University of Northern British Columbia,"Groulx, M (corresponding author), Univ Northern British Columbia, Sch Environm Planning, 3333 Univ Way, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada.",mark.groulx@unbc.ca,,,,,,,75,5,5,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2017,22,11,,,,,1378,1393,,10.1080/13549839.2017.1348343,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2017.1348343,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,FQ6MD,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000418477700005,View Full Record in Web of Science

It examines the adaptations outlined in national policy to address desertification and climate change (in accordance with international commitments to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) as well as the local autonomous adaptations being undertaken at household level. While policy efforts to address desertification and climate change share some common ground, they appear to be poorly mainstreamed into broader development processes at the national level. At the same time, many agricultural and livelihood adaptations outlined in national policy focus primarily on rural areas rather than embracing the rural urban flows of people and money, identified as vital in the local-level analyses. Given current in-country migration patterns and Malawi's rapid urbanization, this is an important oversight. A more integrated approach is necessary within national policy to consider rural and urban areas and their interlinkages, and play a stronger facilitating role in supporting local autonomous adaptations. This is vital if adaptation efforts are to contribute to wider development goals and have a greater impact on increasing overall resilience to environmental and climate change.","[Stringer, Lindsay C.; Dougill, Andrew J.; Dyer, Jen C.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Mkwambisi, David D.] Univ Malawi, Dept Nat Resources, Bunda Coll, Lilongwe, Malawi",University of Leeds; University of Malawi,"Stringer, LC (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",l.stringer@see.leeds.ac.uk,,"Stringer, Lindsay/0000-0003-0017-1654; Dougill, Andrew/0000-0002-3422-8228",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,55,12,12,0,40,EARTHSCAN,LONDON,"14A ST CROSS STREET, LONDON, EC1N 8XA, ENGLAND",1756-5529,,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

This study investigates the role of the traditional agricultural practices of the Xo Dang ethnic minority groups in Central Vietnam and provides insights into the factors that influence farmers to adopt these practices in response to climate change. Primary data was obtained through three focus group discussions and 87 household surveys involving the Xo Dang people through face-to-face semi-structured interviews in the Tra Doc commune, Bac Tra My district, Quang Nam province, Central Vietnam. The binary logistic regression model was used to examine the factors which have influenced the choices made by this community in response to climate change. The results showed that Xo Dang people were highly aware of climate change risks and had, in response, employed their current adaptation practices. The major adaptation strategies implemented by the Xo Dang people included the use of flora and fauna indicators, native plant varieties, the adjustment of planting calendars, irrigation practices, and the application of intercropping. The results indicated that the living years, their monthly farm incomes, and farmer's perceptions of ongoing climate change effects on their environment were the factors that significantly affected farmers' adaptation decisions. Understanding indigenous knowledge plays a fundamental role in the processes of deciding the appropriate adaptation techniques more effectively and making use of human resources. Therefore, policy makers should pay much attention to indigenous knowledge to combat climate change in future national policies and projects.","[Chuong Van Huynh] Hue Univ, Presidential Board, 03 Le Loi St, Hue, Vietnam; [Quy Ngoc Phuong Le; Phuong Thi Tran; Ha Ngan Trinh] Hue Univ, Univ Agr & Forestry, Fac Land Resources & Agr Environm, 102 Phung Hung St, Hue, Vietnam; [Mai Thi Hong Nguyen] Hue Univ, Univ Agr & Forestry, Fac Forestry, 102 Phung Hung St, Hue, Vietnam; [Chuong Van Huynh; Tan Quang Nguyen; Tung Gia Pham; Linh Hoang Khanh Nguyen; Loan Thi Dieu Nguyen] Hue Univ, Int Sch, 04 Le Loi St, Hue, Vietnam",Hue University; Hue University; Nong Lam University; Hue University; Nong Lam University; Hue University,"Huynh, CV (corresponding author), Hue Univ, Presidential Board, 03 Le Loi St, Hue, Vietnam.;Huynh, CV (corresponding author), Hue Univ, Int Sch, 04 Le Loi St, Hue, Vietnam.",huynhvanchuong@hueuni.edu.vn,", Van Chuong Huynh/AAI-6900-2021; Pham, Tung/HLQ-4792-2023",", Van Chuong Huynh/0000-0003-1383-6491; Gia Pham, Tung/0000-0001-6377-2639; Nguyen Quang, Tan/0000-0003-2442-6359",Ministry of Education and Training of Vietnam [B2019-DHH-02],Ministry of Education and Training of Vietnam,This work was supported by Ministry of Education and Training of Vietnam (B2019-DHH-02).,,62,10,10,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,DEC,2020,6,12,,,,,,,e05656,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05656,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05656,,,12,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,PQ8PF,33313437,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000606804700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Respondents generally perceived that the rainy season had changed in the past 5 years, with the season now beginning in December and ending in March. The households have resorted to shifting cultivation practices, replanting, use of wetlands in preference to upland fields, changing of seed varieties or crops, selling of livestock and informal trading as coping strategies. Although non-governmental organisations have assisted the community to set up irrigation schemes, a few selected community members have benefited from the initiative.

Economic losses and modifications of production processes are fundamental issues to consider in coping with the harmful consequences of climate variability. The literature and empirical evidence show that the wine sector is extremely vulnerable to this risk. These studies show that this sector lacks appropriate adaptation strategies due to the complexity of the analysed systems and interrelations between a number of socio-economic and environmental variables. The present study designed a decision support system to identify adaptation strategies for wine farms undergoing climate change. The tool allows for the analysis of a wine farm's economic performance when it adopts measures to cope with climatic variability. Average values for climate change and extreme events were considered to assess different scenarios. A mix-method approach was applied to integrate probability calculations, complex system analyses and operational research (a metaheuristic approach). The model was tested on a case study located in central Italy (Chianti Classico). To maintain and improve future financial performance, organic farming and adjustments to procedural guidelines were recommended as key strategies. Economic variables, such as the average price of wine, seem to have a strong influence on farms' implementation of adaptive measures. An additional result seems to suggest that insurance schemes in areas producing high quality wine are only suitable when low-level deductibles and public funding are available. The present work shows that the decision support system favours analytical sensitivity to different scenarios and variables related to climate change as well as to socio-economic shifts in the viticulture sector.

A UHI anomaly is defined as an uninterrupted streak of days where the temperature differential measured at 12.00 AM between the city core and its surroundings is higher than a given threshold. From this definition, three UHI indicators are obtained: mean intensity, mean duration of the event and occurrence rate. We study the influence of urban morphology on the UHI indictors with a Heckman model. A sample selection bias is detected for mean intensity and mean duration. The estimation results also show that some urban morphological features have a mitigating effect, while some others play a role at the adaptation level.","[Florenzio, N.; Guastella, G.; Pareglio, S.] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Milan, Italy; [Guastella, G.; Pareglio, S.] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Math & Phys, Brescia, Italy; [Magni, F.; Musco, F.] IUAV Univ, Dept Design & Planning Complex Environm, Venice, Italy",Fondazione Mattei; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IUAV University Venice,"Florenzio, N (corresponding author), Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Milan, Italy.",nicolo.florenzio@feem.it,,"Magni, Filippo/0000-0002-1399-1080; Florenzio, Nicolo/0000-0002-0249-445X",,,,,61,2,2,4,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

Mexico is reallocating its public expenditure to attend country-wide social needs causing budgetary constraints, which hinders PES and ENAREDD+ as funding sources. This led the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC) to consider a PES with a matching funds approach to provide sufficient financial resources for adaptation measures. To estimate the available funds, INECC developed an exercise of economic valuation of ecosystem services. The watershed of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco, Mexico, was the chosen location given its ecological and touristic importance and because of its urgent need to implement adaptation measures due to its heighted vulnerability to climate change. This article intends to showcase the value that upstream ecosystem services provide to tourism, the potential to implement adaptation measures in the region and to estimate local available funds to develop ecosystem-based adaptation measures (EbA). A literature review was conducted to understand the regional environmental, social, and economic dynamics and to identify the main ecosystem services; then, the value of ecosystem services was estimated via the willingness to pay and accept (WTP and WTA) using contingent valuation. Also economic data regarding forestry and agriculture was collected to calculate the forest conservation opportunity cost. The results showed that tourist and residents would be willing to pay circa $150 million USD per year and farmers would be willing to accept circa $75 million USD. This evidences the potential to implement forest conservation activities that will contribute to adaptation and mitigation objectives of Mexico's NDC.","[Matias Figueroa, Carlos; del Pilar Salazar Vargas, Maria] Inst Nacl Ecol & Cambio Climat INECC, Coordinac Gen Adaptac Cambio Climat & Ecol, Carr Picacho Ajusco 4219, Mexico City 14210, DF, Mexico; [Lara Pulido, Jose Alberto] Univ Iberoamer, Ctr Trasdisciplinar Sustentabilidad, Prolongac Paseo Reforma 880, Mexico City 01219, DF, Mexico",Universidad Iberoamericana Ciudad de Mexico,"Figueroa, CM (corresponding author), Inst Nacl Ecol & Cambio Climat INECC, Coordinac Gen Adaptac Cambio Climat & Ecol, Carr Picacho Ajusco 4219, Mexico City 14210, DF, Mexico.",matiasmf17@hotmail.com; pilar.salazar@inecc.gob.mx,"Lara-Pulido, José Alberto/A-1840-2018","Lara-Pulido, Jose Alberto/0000-0003-1484-8451; Matias Figueroa, Carlos/0000-0003-4616-9517",,,,,25,0,0,1,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

However, its distribution and potential growing regions of cherimoya are not defined for Mexico. That is why, this research aims to map the natural distribution of cherimoya and different eco-climatic regions where it is grown in Mexico as well as to map the climatic adaptability with the current climate and a prospection with the climate change scenario, all by different models of GIS. The general distribution model of cherimoya in Mexico showed that it had a chance to find cherimoya \in a natural way in the biogeographic provinces Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, Sierra Madre del Sur and Highlands of Chiapas. Three eco-climatic groups were found in the distribution of cherimoya that corresponded to climates C(m)(w), (A)C(e'), and (A)C(e), respectively. Where the group with climate (A)C(e) had the most restricted distribution. The potential growing regions of excellent adaptation of cherimoya were found in the biogeographic provinces of Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, Sierra Madre Occidental, Sierra Madre Oriental, Sierra Madre del Sur and Highlands of Chiapas. Finally, based on eco-crop modelling, it is concluded that climate change will not greatly affect areas of excellent adaptation of cherimoya in Mexico.","[Ruben Rodriguez-Nunez, Jesus; Pena-Caballero, Vicente; Alberto Nunez-Colin, Carlos] Univ Guanajuato, Programa Biotecnol, Mutualismo 303, Guanajuato 38060, Mexico; [Campos-Rojas, Eduardo] Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Dept Fitotecnia, Km 38-5 Carretera Mexico Texcoco, Chapingo 56230, Texcoco, Mexico; [Andres-Agustin, Jorge] Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Ctr Reg Univ Ctr Occidente, Perifer Paseo Republ 1000, Morelia 58170, Michoacan, Mexico; [Alia-Tejacal, Iran] Univ Autonoma Estado Morelos, Fac Ciencias Agr, Av Univ 1001, Cuernavaca 62210, Morelos, Mexico; [Angel Ortega-Acosta, Santo] Univ Autonoma Guerrero, Fac Ciencias Agr & Ambientales, Carretera Iguala Teloloapan S-N, Iguala De La Independenc 40040, Guerrero, Mexico; [Jesus Madera-Santana, Tomas] Ctr Invest Alimentac & Desarrollo AC, Antigua Carretera Victoria Km 0-6, Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico",Universidad de Guanajuato; Universidad de Occidente; Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Morelos; CIAD - Centro de Investigacion en Alimentacion y Desarrollo,"Nunez-Colin, CA (corresponding author), Univ Guanajuato, Programa Biotecnol, Mutualismo 303, Guanajuato 38060, Mexico.",jesus.rodriguez@ugto.mx; educamro55@gmail.com; aajorge2000@yahoo.com.mx; iran.alia@uaem.mx; ortega.santo@colpos.mx; vicente.caballero@ugto.mx; madera@ciad.mx; carlos.nunez@ugto.mx,"Núñez-Colín, Carlos A./P-5353-2019","Núñez-Colín, Carlos A./0000-0002-9912-6097; Rodriguez-Nunez, Jesus R./0000-0002-6294-3050",SAGARPA-CONACYT fund [266891]; Universidad de Guanajuato [CIIC 006/2019],SAGARPA-CONACYT fund; Universidad de Guanajuato,This research was supported by SAGARPA-CONACYT fund through the project 266891 and by Universidad de Guanajuato with the concurrent grant by the project CIIC 006/2019.,,49,6,6,0,4,"UNIV ESTADUAL PARAIBA, EDITORA-EDUEP",CAMPINA GRANDE,"AV DAS BARAUNAS, 351 COMPLEXO ADMINISTRATIVO, CAMPUS UNIVERSITARIO, BODOCONGO, CAMPINA GRANDE, PARAIBA 58109-753, BRAZIL",2238-4782,,,ETHNOBIOL CONSERV,Ethnobiol.

COFA provides the FAS financial assistance to build their economies and foster financial independence; in exchange, the United States has regional military control. The United States is the world's second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, while the FAS produce few emissions but are vulnerable to climate impacts. I highlight inconsistencies in U.S. policies from within its own paradigm by 'seeing like an empire' to show how contradicting priorities jeopardise American interests in the region. Aid provided by COFA has done little to build infrastructure supporting the FAS's economically independence, and climate change diverts economic resources to funding climate adaptation. The United States is currently battling China to maintain hegemony in the Pacific, making the FAS strategically important for national security. Meanwhile, climate change threatens U.S. military installations in the FAS. It is in the United States' best interests to limit emissions to protect its investments in the FAS, but this requires a policy change to prioritise its commitments in Micronesia over climate change denial.","[Cannon, Sara E.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, 1984 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Cannon, SE (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, 1984 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",s.cannon@oceans.ubc.ca,"Cannon, Sara E./AFU-9890-2022","Cannon, Sara E./0000-0002-1402-6370",,,,,102,0,0,2,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1360-7456,1467-8373,,ASIA PAC VIEWP,Asia Pac.

While many studies have attempted to identify different methods to adapt pavements to future climate conditions, the potential economic impacts of the adaptations still remain largely unquantified. This study presents the results of a comprehensive life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) aimed at quantifying the potential economic impacts of a climate adaptation method, in which an upgraded asphalt binder (Performance Grade PG 76-22) is used in the construction and maintenance of flexible pavement sections in lieu of the original binder (PG 70-22) for improved resistance against high temperatures. For each of three major Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) districts with different climates, three case studies consisting of typical interstate, primary, and secondary pavement sections were considered. The LCCA accounted for the costs incurred during the mixture's production, maintenance, and use phases of the pavement life cycle by explicitly considering future climate projections, pavement life-cycle performance, maintenance effects, and work zone user delays. The study concludes that pavements using the upgraded binder not only perform better over time but are also economically advantageous compared to those with the original binder under the conditions of the anticipated future climate conditions (2020-2039).","[Qiao, Yaning] China Univ Min & Technol, State Key Lab Geomech & Deep Underground Engn, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Santos, Joao] Univ Twente, Construct Management & Engn, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Stoner, Anne M.

We evaluate how confidence in conservation recommendations may change with agreement among alternative climate projections and metrics of climate exposure. We assessed agreement among three multivariate estimates of climate exposure (forward velocity, backward velocity, and climate dissimilarity) using 18 alternative climate projections for the contiguous United States. For each metric, we classified maps into quartiles for each alternative climate projections, and calculated the frequency of quartiles assigned for each gridded location (high quartile frequency= more agreement among climate projections). We evaluated recommendations using a recent climate adaptation heuristic framework that recommends emphasizing various conservation strategies to land based on current conservation value and expected climate exposure. We found that areas where conservation strategies would be confidently assigned based on high agreement among climate projections varied substantially across regions. In general, there was more agreement in forward and backward velocity estimates among alternative projections than agreement in estimates of local dissimilarity. Consensus of climate predictions resulted in the same conservation recommendation assignments in a few areas, but patterns varied by climate exposure metric. This work demonstrates an approach for explicitly evaluating alternative predictions in geographic patterns of climate change.","[Belote, R.

Here, we have analysed several European projects that utilised the resilience approach successfully. Dutch policies already include resilience and climate adaptation in urban strategies. Moreover, they share those strategies with urban communities, making the innovation of the city real and cutting-edge. In Italy, on the other hand, the concept of resilience is present only in some regional laws and is still not used as an urban tool. In this paper, we aim to demonstrate how resilience can become the new paradigm of smart planning. Furthermore, we demonstrate how resilience is fundamental at all levels of urban intervention, involving municipal authorities, architects and urban planners, firms and enterprises, citizens and communities. The urban governance must establish specific goals and objectives to create a smart and sustainable city. Resilience should be one of these main aims, in order to achieve an innovative city design.

Public investment is carried out considering several drivers, from economic development to demographics, climate, and pollutants. Meanwhile, the need for evaluation methods is also increasing, so their development has grown in recent years. Among these, Multi-Criteria Analysis methodologies (MCA) have taken on great importance. This work aims to demonstrate the usefulness of MCA in addressing crucial environmental issues, such as the use of water resources for agricultural and food production. The document presents an application of MCA for the ranking and selection of projects to be financed under the Italian National Plan on Water Resources. The Plan is part of the national initiatives planned for the adaptation of the agricultural sector to climate change.

The vulnerabilities to climate change are extremely high in Himalayan cities. New theoretical approaches are required to accurately define problems, causation and potential solutions. Our research has experimented with and developed the concept of Critical Urban Water Zones (CUWZs), which integrates vertical and horizontal elements of the physical environment with social, political and cultural considerations over time.

In response, this article advocates developing an ecologically informed intersectional approach designed to disclose the ways racism contributes to the construction of illegible lives in the domain of climate policies and practices. Differential impacts of climate change, while an important dimension, is ultimately inadequate to understanding and responding to both climate justice and environmental racism. What is required is a rich understanding of the histories and lineages of the deep incorporation of racism and environmental exploitation. To catalyze such an approach to climate justice, this article develops an analysis of three instances of the intermingling of racism and environmental exploitation: climate adaptation practices in Lagos, Nigeria; the enmeshment of race and coal mining in the post-Civil War United States; and the infusing of precarity and rainforest destruction in Brazil.","[Tuana, Nancy] Penn State Univ, Philosophy & Women Gender & Sexual Studies, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Tuana, N (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Philosophy & Women Gender & Sexual Studies, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,,,,,,,89,42,42,4,31,PENN STATE UNIV PRESS,UNIVERSITY PK,"820 NORTH UNIV DRIVE, U S B 1, STE C, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA",2165-8684,2165-8692,,CRIT PHILOS RACE,Crit.

Transparent and conductive metal nanomesh (NM) films are promising candidates for thermochromic smart windows due to their excellent thermal conductivity, high optical transparency at near infrared wavelengths, and outstanding stability. In this study, ZnO/Au/Al2O3 NM films with periodicities of 200 and 370 nm are reported. The ZnO/Au/Al2O3 NM film with a 370 nm periodicity exhibits a transmittance over 90% at 550 nm and sheet resistance lower than 20 ohm sq(-1). Based on a standard figure of merit, this structure outperforms current state-of-the-art NM films. Here, the integration of ZnO/Au/Al2O3 NM films into a thermochromic perovskite smart window is also demonstrated. The transparency of the smart window structure is manipulated by transient resistive heating to trigger the thermochromic transition to the opaque state, which can be then maintained solely by 1-sun, AM 1.5 G illumination. This climate-adaptive, low power-activated, and fast-switching smart window structure opens new pathways toward its practical application in the real world.","[Wu, Shang-Hsuan; Cossio, Gabriel; Braun, Benjamin; Wu, Frances Camille M.; Yu, Edward T.

The L*, h*, total phenols, total flavonoids, reducing sugars, and amino acids decreased along with the increase of deacetylation degree of KGM while a*, Delta E, and browning index increased. The results indicated that the oxidation or polymerization of polyphenols and flavones in alkaline circumstances, and the carbonyl ammonia reaction between reducing sugars and amino acids may be the main reasons for color changes of KGM flour during deacetylation.

However, in the past months, concerns have increased about the fact the health emergency has put on hold during the pandemic many climate adaptation and mitigation policies. We focus our attention on understanding the role of the recent health emergency on the transmission of information related to climate change, jointly with other socio-economic variables, social norms, and cultural dimensions. In doing so, we create a unique dataset containing the number of tweets written with specific climate related keywords per country worldwide, as well as country specific socio-economic characteristics, relevant social norms, and cultural variables. We find that socio-economic variables, such as income, education, and other risk-related variables matter in the transmission of information about climate change and Twitter activity. We also find that the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly decreased the overall number of messages written about climate change, postponing the climate debate worldwide; but particularly in some vulnerable countries. This shows that in spite of the existing climate emergency, the current pandemic has had a detrimental effect over the short-term planning of climate policies in countries where climate action is urgent.","[Loureiro, Maria L.] Univ Santiago de Compostela, ECOBAS, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Allo, Maria] Univ A Coruna, La Coruna, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Universidade da Coruna,"Loureiro, ML (corresponding author), Univ Santiago de Compostela, ECOBAS, Santiago De Compostela, Spain.",maria.loureiro@usc.es,"Alló, Maria/GLV-5840-2022; Loureiro, Maria L./Q-2384-2015","Alló, Maria/0000-0003-1389-7235; Loureiro, Maria L./0000-0002-7082-3980",Spanish Agency of Research (Agencia Estatal de Investigacion) [PID2019-111255RB-100],Spanish Agency of Research (Agencia Estatal de Investigacion),Both authors thank the editor (James Butler) and the anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions.

Worldwide, agroforestry is practiced by more than 1.2 billion people, on around 1 billion hectares (ha) of land area, while in India, around 25.32 million hectares area comes under agroforestry. Agroforestry system is the enhancement of overall farm productivity, soil enrichment through litter fall, above and below ground carbon sequestration, maintaining environmental services. Different agroforestry systems are adapted at the global level and periodic monitoring and estimation of area under agroforestry, monitoring of tree and soil carbon stocks is still a challenging task due to the lack of uniform methodology.

Scholars of the past, however, show that societies have dynamically and heterogeneously coped with climate variability and with recurrent and abrupt weather extremes. This research aims to explore climate adaptation in preindustrial societies taking into account different levels of social organisation. We argue that this multilevel perspective can enrich our understanding of the different strategies to cope with climate impacts in past societies. Archival research was carried out in the early modem villages of Terrassa and Sant Pere (Barcelona, Spain) to reconstruct the set of strategies to cope with recurrent droughts both at community and household levels. We found that peasant families developed a wider range of strategies than communities, but that many strategies used by households and communities overlapped, potentially generating a redundancy effect and fostering complex strategies operating through cross-level interactions. By studying past adaptation strategies with common taxonomies and detailed methodologies, our paper aims to improve interdisciplinary communication with research about the human dimensions of anthropogenic climate change.","[Grau-Satorras, Mar; Otero, Iago; Reyes-Garcia, Victoria] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals ICTA, Barcelona, Spain; [Grau-Satorras, Mar] Univ Oberta Catalunya UOC, Urban Transformat & Global Change Lab TURBA, Internet Interdisciplinary Inst IN3, Barcelona, Spain; [Otero, Iago] Humboldt Univ, Integrat Res Inst Transformat Human Environm Syst, Berlin, Germany; [Gomez-Baggethun, Erik] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Fac Landscape & Soc, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, As, Norway; [Gomez-Baggethun, Erik] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Trondheim, Norway; [Reyes-Garcia, Victoria] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats ICREA, Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; UOC Universitat Oberta de Catalunya; Humboldt University of Berlin; Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Autonomous University of Barcelona; ICREA,"Grau-Satorras, M (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals ICTA, Barcelona, Spain.;Grau-Satorras, M (corresponding author), Univ Oberta Catalunya UOC, Urban Transformat & Global Change Lab TURBA, Internet Interdisciplinary Inst IN3, Barcelona, Spain.",mgrausat@uoc.edu; iago.otero.armengol@gmail.com; erik.gomez@nmbu.no; Victoria.Reyes@uab.cat,"Satorras, Mar/AAB-2054-2021; /C-4552-2008",/0000-0002-2914-8055,Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation through the CONSOLIDER SimulPast project [CSD2010-00034]; Generalitat de Catalunya,"Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation through the CONSOLIDER SimulPast project(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya)","The research leading to the results presented in this paper was funded by the former Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation through the CONSOLIDER SimulPast project (CSD2010-00034) and by the Generalitat de Catalunya (FI-DGR2013).

While ongoing lifestyle transitions account for rising obesity, the origins of low lean mass remain unclear. We analysed proxies for lean mass and stature among South Asian skeletons spanning the last 11,000 years (n = 197) to investigate the origins of South Asian low lean mass. Compared with a worldwide sample (n = 2,003), South Asian skeletons indicate low lean mass. Stature-adjusted lean mass increased significantly over time in South Asia, but to a very minor extent (0.04 z-score units per 1,000 years, adjusted R-2 = 0.01). In contrast stature decreased sharply when agriculture was adopted. Our results indicate that low lean mass has characterised South Asians since at least the early Holocene and may represent long-term climatic adaptation or neutral variation. This phenotype is therefore unlikely to change extensively in the short term, so other strategies to address increasing non-communicable disease rates must be pursued.","[Pomeroy, Emma] Univ Cambridge, Dept Archaeol, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3DZ, England; [Mushrif-Tripathy, Veena] Deccan Coll Postgrad & Res Inst, Dept Archaeol, Pune 411006, Maharashtra, India; [Cole, Tim J.; Wells, Jonathan C.

This paper provides a concise overview of the current state of knowledge in Europe on the costing of mitigation measures for the reduction of natural hazard risks (droughts, floods, storms and induced coastal hazards as well as alpine hazards) and identifies knowledge gaps and related research recommendations. Furthermore, it provides a taxonomy of related mitigation options, classifying them into nine categories: (1) management plans, land-use planning, and climate adaptation; (2) hazard modification; (3) infrastructure; (4) mitigation measures (stricto sensu); (5) communication in advance of events; (6) monitoring and early warning systems; (7) emergency response and evacuation; (8) financial incentives; and (9) risk transfer (including insurance). It is found that the costing of mitigation measures in European and in other countries has almost exclusively focused on estimating direct costs. A cost assessment framework that addresses a range of costs, possibly informed by multiple stakeholders, would provide more accurate estimates and could provide better guidance to decision makers.

Motivated by water allocation among unequal actors in NE Brazil, within Ceara State, we employ 'ultimatum' field experiments in which one participant lacks information. We find that, despite having veto power, the less informed are vulnerable to inequity. When all are informed, we see a typical resource split (60% initiator-40% responder) that balances an initiator's advantage with a responder's willingness to punish greed. When instead responders have only a resource forecast upon which to base decisions, the fully informed initiators get 80% of resources for conditions of resource scarcity. Thus, despite each of the stakeholder types having an unquestioned 'seat at the table', information asymmetries make bargaining outcomes more unequal. Our results are widely relevant for adaptation involving the joint use of information, and suggest that equity can rise with dissemination of scientific outputs that are integral in adaptation.

This particularly applies in Malaysia due to its rank as the second largest palm oil producer in the world. The anthropogenic activities and the agroecological practices in oil palm plantation, including excessive use of fertilisers, bush fire due to land clearing, and cultivation on peatland, have exacerbated the effects of climate change featuring extreme events, drought, flooding, heatwave, as well as infestation of pest and diseases. These adverse impacts on oil palm production highlight the significance of deploying effective adaptation strategies. The study aims to examine the impact of climate change on oil palm production and identify the farmers' adaptation strategies to the impacts of climate change in Malaysia. This study was conducted a comprehensive review of the articles published from 2000 to 2021 in the contexts of climate change and oil palm production in Malaysia. The review shows that climate change has a range of impacts on the oil palm production in Malaysia. As a result, several adaptation options were identified, such as breeding of hybrid varieties that are tolerant and resistant to heat; sustainable management of soil; pit and tranches to enhance water management in plantation areas; minimal use of fertilisers, herbicides, and pesticides; zero burning; and minimum tillage. The reviewed studies recommended the following to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change: sustainable national policy on climate change, conservation of the existing carbon stock, effective management of tropical rainforest biodiversity, afforestation for carbon sequestration, and reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission.","[Abubakar, Ahmed; Ishak, Mohd Yusoff; Makmom, Abdullah Ahmad] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Forestry & Environm, Serdang 43400, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Abubakar, A (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Forestry & Environm, Serdang 43400, Malaysia.",abubakar8550483@gmail.com; m_yusoff@upm.edu.my; amakmom@upm.edu.my,"Ahmed, Abubakar/O-5217-2016; Ahmed, Abubakar/CAA-7981-2022; Ahmed, Abubakar/GQQ-0575-2022","Ahmed, Abubakar/0000-0002-0532-6371; Ahmed, Abubakar/0000-0002-0813-1967; ","Tertiary Education Trust Fund, Nigeria (TETFUND)","Tertiary Education Trust Fund, Nigeria (TETFUND)","The study was funded by the Tertiary Education Trust Fund, Nigeria (TETFUND).",,269,9,9,11,41,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

However, little effort has been invested in compiling, aggregating, and systematizing such responses to assess global patterns in local adaptation. Drawing on a systematic review of 119 peer-reviewed publications with 1851 reported local responses to climate change impacts, we show that Indigenous Peoples and local communities across the world apply a diverse portfolio of activities to address climate change impacts. While many responses involve changes to natural resource based livelihoods, about one-third of responses involve other activities (e.g. networking, off-farm work). Globally, local responses to climate change impacts are more likely to be shaped by people's livelihood than by the climate zone where they live.","[Schlingmann, Anna; Benyei, Petra; Corbera, Esteve; Marelle, Andrea; Soleymani-Fard, Ramin; Reyes-Garcia, Victoria] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Graham, Sonia] Univ Wollongong, Sch Geog & Sustainable Communities, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Corbera, Esteve; Reyes-Garcia, Victoria] Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats ICREA, Barcelona, Spain; [Corbera, Esteve] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Geog, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Sanesteban, Irene Martinez] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Reyes-Garcia, Victoria] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Anthropol, Barcelona 08193, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Wollongong; ICREA; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Schlingmann, A (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Barcelona 08193, Spain.",anna.schlingmann@uab.cat,"Graham, Sonia/G-4399-2012; Corbera, Esteve/C-5368-2015; /C-4552-2008","Graham, Sonia/0000-0003-4195-4559; Corbera, Esteve/0000-0001-7970-4411; /0000-0002-2914-8055","European Research Council (ERC) [771056-LICCI-ERC-2017-COG]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2017-SGR-775]; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [CEX2019-000940-M]; Laboratory for the Analysis of Social-Ecological Systems in a Globalized world (LASEG), Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona","European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities(Spanish Government); Laboratory for the Analysis of Social-Ecological Systems in a Globalized world (LASEG), Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona","Research leading to this work has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under grant agreement No 771056-LICCI-ERC-2017-COG.

In this study we investigate how climate and crop model uncertainties affect multi-objective optimization outputs aiming to identify optimum agricultural management adaptations for Western Switzerland. Results are visualized by ternary plots that map optimum management measures, crop yield, erosion and leaching with associated uncertainties for navigating through the optimum adaptation space. We find that the relevance of climate model vs. parameter uncertainty can differ substantially depending on the prioritization of objectives and local conditions. The optimum choice of irrigation level was found to be the decision variable subject to greatest uncertainty particularly on coarser soil. This finding suggests that for the long-term planning of irrigation infrastructure and management, a robust adaptation approach is required for approaching unavoidable uncertainty from a risk management perspective.

Some such tools have emerged in response to social and economic shifts in light of anticipated climatic change. Climate change will play out at the local level, and adaptive behaviours will be influenced by local resources and knowledge. Community-based insights are essential building blocks for effective planning. However, in order to mainstream and scale up adaptation, it is useful to have mechanisms for evaluating the benefits and costs of candidate adaptation strategies. This article reviews relevant literature and presents an argument in favour of using various modelling tools directed at these considerations. The authors also provide evidence for the balancing of qualitative and quantitative elements in assessments of programme proposals considered for financing through mechanisms that have the potential to scale up effective adaptation, such as the Adaptation Fund under the Kyoto Protocol. The article concludes that it is important that researchers and practitioners maintain flexibility in their analyses, so that they are themselves adaptable, to allow communities to best manage the emerging challenges of climate change and the long-standing challenges of development.","[Nay, John Jacob] Vanderbilt Univ, Program Integrated Computat Decis Sci, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [Nay, John Jacob] Vanderbilt Univ, Inst Energy & Environm, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [Abkowitz, Mark] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Chu, Eric] MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Gallagher, Daniel] Adaptat Fund Board Secretariat, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Wright, Helena] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Environm Policy, London, England",Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Imperial College London,"Nay, JJ (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Program Integrated Computat Decis Sci, PMB 407702,2301 Vanderbilt Pl, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.",john.j.nay@vanderbilt.edu,"Gallagher, Daniel/Q-7133-2019; Chu, Eric/O-6464-2015; Chu, Eric/B-6509-2015","Gallagher, Daniel/0000-0001-7291-5558; Chu, Eric/0000-0002-5648-6615; Chu, Eric/0000-0002-5648-6615",,,,,79,24,24,0,47,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The importance of the role of the private sector is evident from lessons drawn from the increasing amount of empirical experience on adaptation projects supported by climate funds: successful private sector engagement in adaptation will catalyse greater investment in reducing vulnerability; this in turn will accelerate the replication of climate-resilient technologies and services in core development sectors, especially in developing countries where investment in long-lived infrastructure is growing rapidly. Private sector companies should integrate adaptation into their strategies and investments for their own economic interest, as well as for their clients' interest and for the interests of the countries in which they operate. Unfortunately, private sector efforts on adaptation are not widely understood or seen as good business practice, and generally face several obstacles. Public policy should incentivize such investments by communicating risks, offering incentives for resilience enhancing measures, and where necessary by putting in place regulation to avoid shifting risks onto the public. Stronger public-private partnerships will also help to enhance climate resilience, and at the same time create business opportunities. Private firms will develop many of the products and services that will enable lower cost and more effective responses to climate change, which can be the basis for growing businesses. Ultimately, a paradigm shift is required for business to fully integrate the value associated with managing climate risks.","[Biagini, Bonizella; Miller, Alan] Global Environm Facil, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Miller, Alan] Int Finance Corp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",,"Biagini, B (corresponding author), Global Environm Facil, Mail Stop P4-400,1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",bbiagini@thegef.org,,,,,,,37,40,42,2,43,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Most Studies that addressed the Vulnerability Of agriculture to climate change have focused oil potential impacts without considering adaptation. When adaptation strategies are considered, socio-economic conditions and farm management are often ignored, but these strongly influence current farm performance and are likely to also influence adaptation to future changes. This Study analysed the adaptation of farmers and regions in the European Union to prevailing climatic conditions, climate change and climate variability in the last decades (1990-2003) in the context of other conditions and changes. We compared (1) responses in crop yields with responses in farmers' income, (2) responses to spatial climate variability with responses to temporal climate variability, (3) farm level responses with regional level responses and (4) potential climate impacts (based oil crop models) with actual climate impacts (based on farm accountancy data). Results indicated that impacts oil crop yields cannot directly be translated to impacts on farmers' income, as farmers adapt by changing crop rotations and inputs. Secondly, the impacts of climatic conditions on spatial variability in crop yields and farmers' income, with generally lower yields in warmer climates, is different from the impacts of temporal variability in climate, for which more heterogeneous patterns are observed across regions in Europe. Thirdly, actual impacts of climate change and variability are largely dependent on farm characteristics (e.g. intensity, size, land use), which influence management and adaptation. To accurately understand impacts and adaptation, assessments should consider responses at different levels of organization. As different farm types adapt differently, a larger diversity in farm types reduces impacts of climate variability at regional level, but certain farm types may still be vulnerable. Lastly, we observed that management and adaptation can largely reduce the potential impacts of climate change and climate variability oil crop yields and farmers' income. We conclude that for reliable projections of the impacts of climate change oil agriculture, adaptation should not be seen anymore as a last step in a vulnerability assessment, but as integrated part of the models used to simulate crop yields, farmers' income and other indicators related to agricultural performance.

Climate extremes have been linked to adverse economic outcomes. Hence, adaptation is a key component of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreements and development assistance. Effective climate adaptation policy requires an understanding of how temperature and rainfall variability affect migration patterns. Yet, how individuals in developing countries manage climate variation is poorly understood, especially in Africa. Combining high-resolution climate data with panel micro-data on migration, labor participation, and demographics, we employ regression analysis to assess temporary migration responses to local temperature and precipitation anomalies in four East African countries. We find that climate impacts are most pronounced in urban areas, with a standard deviation temperature increase and rainfall decrease leading to respective 10 and 12 percent declines in out-migration relative to mean values. Evidence from other labor market outcomes suggests that urban out-migration is not associated with reduced local employment opportunities. Instead, declines in urban out-migration appear to coincide with negative local climate employment impacts. These results challenge the narrative that temporary out-migration serves as a safety valve during climate extremes and that climate change will most strongly affect out-migration rates from rural areas in developing countries.

Robust projected changes in certain aspects of ENSO have been recently established(3-5). However, there is as yet no consensus on the change in the magnitude of the associated sea surface temperature (SST) variability(6-8), commonly used to represent ENSO amplitude(1,6), despite its strong effects on marine ecosystems and rainfall worldwide(1-4,9). Here we show that the response of ENSO SST amplitude is time-varying, with an increasing trend in ENSO amplitude before 2040, followed by a decreasing trend thereafter. We attribute the previous lack of consensus to an expectation that the trend in ENSO amplitude over the entire twenty-first century is unidirectional, and to unrealistic model dynamics of tropical Pacific SST variability. We examine these complex processes across 22 models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) database(10), forced under historical and greenhouse warming conditions. The nine most realistic models identified show a strong consensus on the time-varying response and reveal that the non-unidirectional behaviour is linked to a longitudinal difference in the surface warming rate across the Indo-Pacific basin. Our results carry important implications for climate projections and climate adaptation pathways.","[Kim, Seon Tae; Cai, Wenju] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia; [Cai, Wenju; Wu, Lixin] Ocean Univ China, Qingdao Collaborat Innovat Ctr Marine Sci & Techn, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China; [Jin, Fei-Fei] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Meteorol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Santoso, Agus] Univ New S Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Santoso, Agus] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Guilyardi, Eric] IPSL, LOCEAN, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Guilyardi, Eric] Univ Reading, NCAS Climate, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England; [An, Soon-Il] Yonsei Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Ocean University of China; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; Yonsei University,"Kim, ST (corresponding author), CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia.",seontae.kim@csiro.au; wenju.cai@csiro.au,"Santoso, Agus/J-7350-2012; Kim, Seon Tae/G-6361-2011; AN, SOON-IL/CWF-6596-2022; Guilyardi, Eric/D-4868-2011; Santoso, Agus/P-1918-2019; Cai, Wenju/C-2864-2012","Santoso, Agus/0000-0001-7749-8124; Kim, Seon Tae/0000-0003-2628-0904; Guilyardi, Eric/0000-0002-2255-8625; Santoso, Agus/0000-0001-7749-8124; Cai, Wenju/0000-0001-6520-0829","CSIRO Office of Chief Executive and Wealth from Oceans Flagship; Australian Climate Change Science Program; CSIRO Office of Chief Executive Science Leader award; Australian Research Council; National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2009-C1AAA001-2009-0093042]; Natural Environment Research Council [ncas10009] Funding Source: researchfish; Directorate For Geosciences; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences [1406601] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; National Research Foundation of Korea [2009-0093066] Funding Source: Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI), National Science & Technology Information Service (NTIS)",CSIRO Office of Chief Executive and Wealth from Oceans Flagship; Australian Climate Change Science Program; CSIRO Office of Chief Executive Science Leader award; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Directorate For Geosciences; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we thank the climate modelling groups for producing and making available their model output.

Bet She'an is one of the oldest cities in the Middle East, with archeological layers dating from 1900 BC. Egyptians, early Israelites, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, early Moslems, Crusaders, Ottomans and more recently British and Israelis were dominant cultures that lived in Bet She'an. Each used a unique strategy to adapt the built environment to the harsh climatic conditions which exist at the margin of the very hot, arid Jordan Valley, which is the lowest part of the known Syro-African Rift Valley. Despite an impressive history of climatic adaptations, the last two generations have not effectively utilized the experience of previous inhabitants. One of the aims of the master plan is to reintegrate the climatic design at all levels, renew the historic features and thereby improve the climatic quality. Analysis of climatic data served as a starting point for the identification of planning problems. The master plan solutions are presented on 3 scales: (1) overall urban scale; (2) neighborhood scale, and (3) individual building scale.

Applied in the EMP of a new university satellite campus, comprising of five buildings with mixed energy uses, both the 2050 net-zero emissions and the energy resilience objectives are met by an energy provision portfolio that consists of air source heat pumps for heating and cooling, and a combination of PV panels, purchased green power, standard (non-green) grid power, battery and thermal heat and cold storage tanks - with only a modest 6% increase in costs compared to a reference solution.

Specifically, it focuses on the reactions people have to the forms of gridlock that can make intense flooding, and climate change more generally, feel like an insurmountable problem. As I detail throughout this article, gridlock is an object of intervention in the development, maintenance, and operations of the storm early warning system. The management of gridlock is synonymous with aspirations to make more consistent institutional arrangements of vigilance. But Civil Defense Commission staff and village residents run into difficulties making enhancements because gridlock unfolds across multiple historical tenses. That is, as they implement the storm early warning system, gridlock reveals itself as a product of past and ongoing governmental practices that permeate the present in ways that shape uncertainty about the future. In this respect, this article extends conversations in anthropological scholarship on anticipation around the different configurations of political time within contexts of climate change/risk and governance.","[Vaughn, Sarah E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Anthropol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Vaughn, SE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Anthropol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",sev83@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,58,0,0,1,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2575-1433,2049-1115,,HAU-J ETHNOGR THEORY,HAU-J.

Consequently, climate change can negatively affect crop yields and livestock production thus threatening food security, especially in a vulnerable continent like Africa. This review provides an overview of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices and their impacts on smallholder farmers in five African countries (Algeria, Senegal, Benin, Nigeria and Zambia). A total of 164 published articles on CSA practices were reviewed. Analysis of extracted data showed that CSA practices are classified as follows: agricultural practices, restoration practices of degraded lands, forest and cropland regeneration practices, practices in the livestock sub-sector, water resources and use of weather and climate information services. Moreover, climate change effects differed alongside strategies adapted from one country to another. Adoption of these strategies was often influenced by financial means put in place by governments, the role of policy legislation, access to climate information and farmers' intellectual level. To address this deficiency, scientific-outcome-based research should be used to increase the effectiveness of climate adaptation management programs. In conclusion, to enhance the uptake of climate-smart agricultural practices in Africa, this review recommends the use of scientific-research-driven adaptation measures and prioritization of climate change in governments' agendas.","[Ariom, Thaddaeus Obaji] Fed Univ Agr, Inst Food Secur Environm Resources & Agr Res, Dept Microbiol, POB 2240, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria; [Dimon, Elodie] Univ Parakou, Fac Agron, Lab Anim Ecol Hlth & Prod, POB 123, Parakou, Benin; [Nambeye, Eva] Univ Zambia, Sch Agr Sci, Dept Anim Sci, POB 32379, Lusaka, Zambia; [Adelusi, Oludotun Olusegun] Fed Univ Agr, Dept Anim Nutr, POB 2240, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria; [Boudalia, Sofiane] Univ 8 Mai 1945 Guelma, Fac Sci Nat & Vie & Sci Terre & Univers, Lab Biol Eau & Environm, POB 4010, Guelma 24000, Algeria","University of Agriculture, Abeokuta; University of Zambia; University of Agriculture, Abeokuta; Universite 8 Mai 1945 de Guelma","Nambeye, E (corresponding author), Univ Zambia, Sch Agr Sci, Dept Anim Sci, POB 32379, Lusaka, Zambia.",eva.nambeye@unza.zm,,"Adelusi, Oludotun/0000-0002-8723-9190; BOUDALIA, Sofiane/0000-0002-7729-185X",,,,,213,3,3,13,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2022,14,18,,,,,,,11370,10.3390/su141811370,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141811370,,,32,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,4S8XZ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000857717800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Urban planning and design are effective tools in dealing with climate adaptation and mitigation issues. However, climate risk and its impacts are multiscale and complex due to interdependence between urban infrastructure systems. Identifying adaptation strategies to cope with these impacts requires planners to understand potential interdependent and interrelated consequences of infrastructure failure under natural hazards, and evaluate cascading and cumulative effects of climate change. This article discussed opportunities and challenges to incorporate interdependent social and physical infrastructure systems in the adaptation planning and hazard mitigation process, including climate hazard assessment, adaptation goal identification, adaptation strategy development, and implementation. The availability of urban big data and high computational resources will enable urban planners and decision-makers to better deal with those complex impacts from climate change and natural hazards. Successful adaptation planning and hazard mitigation for interdependent infrastructure systems also needs to solve issues in uncertainties of climate projection, institutional barriers of adaptation, and challenges of urban big data. Potential solutions to these challenges would include cooperation among multidisciplinary experts, coordination between different levels of governments, and developing the ethical framework for data protection and robust methodologies to detect and reduce data bias.","[Han Yu; Ye Xinyue] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Urban Planning, College Stn, TX 77840 USA; [Huang Xiao] Univ Arkansas, Dept Geosci, Fayetteville, AR USA; [Dadashova, Behar] Texas A&M Transportat Inst, Bryan, TX USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Ye, XY (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77840 USA.",xinyue.ye@tamu.edu,,,National Science Foundation (NSF) [SMA-2122054]; Texas A&M University Harold L.

However, as seed procurement areas approach jurisdictional boundaries (states, provinces, nations), across which seed and seed transfer systems are not typically shared, innovative approaches are required to identify those plantation areas for which suitable domestic provenances will be lacking, as well as areas in neighbouring jurisdictions with matching warmer, future climates that could fill domestic seed supply gaps. We describe a straightforward, climate envelope approach to locate these areas, using British Columbia (BC), Canada, and the Pacific Northwest (PNW), USA, to illustrate the analysis. We find that 21% of BC's ecosystems (seed zones) will be at moderate or high risk of lacking adapted domestic provenances for plantation establishment by 2040. Importantly, however, we find large areas in the PNW that should be able to fill most of BC's domestic seed supply gaps.

However, localized PE approaches have been criticized as insufficient for producing careful generalizations needed to affect policymaking. We offer an approach to critically explore factors that shape the distribution of climate adaptation interventions-and their potential equity and sustainability-related implications-across larger, policy-relevant scales. Our methodology uses local field-work findings to inform secondary data collection and specify mesoscale regression models, which reanalyze, at larger spatial scales, potentially meaningful relationships between social, economic, and environmental factors and the distribution of adaptation initiatives. An epistemological heuristic is offered to navigate the consistencies and inconsistencies between local qualitative and mesoscale quantitative data to develop a more comprehensive, yet partial, understanding of scaled political-ecological relations. The integrative approach is applied to analyze how sociospatial and biophysical characteristics affect the distribution of more than 16,000 farm ponds across 352 subdistricts in Maharashtra, an emerging adaptation subsidized by the state government to reduce crop risks from precipitation variability. The degree of compatibility between local qualitative and regional-scale quantitative results can support the development of novel research questions and actionable science for policy change.","[Shah, Sameer H.; Harris, Leila M.] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Harris, Leila M.] Univ British Columbia, Inst Gender Race Sexual & Social Justice, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"Shah, SH (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",sameer.shah@alumni.ubc.ca; lharris@ires.ubc.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada's Canada Graduate Scholarship [767-2016-2400]; Michael Smith Foreign Supplement [771-2017-0100]; International WaTERS Research Network; Nehru Humanitarian Graduate Scholarship; Liu Scholar Bottom Billion Grant [349]; University of British Columbia's Four-Year Fellowship and Faculty of Science,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada's Canada Graduate Scholarship; Michael Smith Foreign Supplement; International WaTERS Research Network; Nehru Humanitarian Graduate Scholarship; Liu Scholar Bottom Billion Grant; University of British Columbia's Four-Year Fellowship and Faculty of Science,"This article was financially supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada's Canada Graduate Scholarship (#767-2016-2400) and Michael Smith Foreign Supplement (#771-2017-0100), the International WaTERS Research Network, the Nehru Humanitarian Graduate Scholarship, the Liu Scholar Bottom Billion Grant (#349), and the University of British Columbia's Four-Year Fellowship and Faculty of Science.",,69,1,1,6,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2469-4452,2469-4460,,ANN AM ASSOC GEOGR,Ann.

Not only do they need to implement regulatory and infrastructural measures, but they also need to promote complementing self-protective measures at the household level. The individual motivation of municipal actors to pursue climate adaptation can be important for the implementation of such measures, obviously alongside several other factors, such as financial and administrative issues. A questionnaire survey with a non-random sample of 77 local government actors from 15 of the 16 German federal states was conducted, focusing on potential key factors concerning the motivation to implement adaptation measures against hazardous impacts of heavy rain. Additionally, the perceived effectiveness and realizability of selected municipal structural measures and of activation measures promoting self-protective behavior were collected. It can be shown that the perceived realizability of adaptation measures as well as knowledge of risk and adaptation may be key factors in the motivation to implement both activation and structural measures, while motivation and implementation are only partially related. The results imply a need for the evaluation of activation measures and a need for further research on the motivation of municipal actors to implement activation measures.","[Werg, Jana Lorena] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Grothmann, Torsten] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Business Adm Econ & Law, Ecol Econ Grp, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany; [Loechtefeld, Stefan] E Fect eG, D-10437 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Werg, JL (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",jana.werg@hu-berlin.de; torsten.grothmann@uni-oldenburg.de; loechtefeld@e-fect.de,,,German Environment Agency [3716 48 103 0],German Environment Agency,"This research work received no external funding.

Of various facade elements, this study focuses on designing and validating the SMP components as prototypes for shading devices for the Climate Adaptive Building Skin (CABS), to approach design decisions of optimal activation temperature, size, arrangements, and operating scenarios using digital models and simulation tools following the presented research framework in conjunction with design-to-fabrication studies in parallel. Prior to performance evaluations, the operating principles of SMP shading devices and interpretation of temperature data in relation to the urban conditions are prescribed. This research is based on a sustainability assessment of state-of-the-art responsive facade design integrating SMP elements combining active and passive measures to support a sustainable architectural design that provides less heat gain and better daylight comfort while demonstrating the simplified performance analysis method of SMP prototype designs.

Individuals' opinions on climate change are often based on emotion rather than on scientific evidence. Therefore, research into the emotional characteristics of the imagery that the non-expert public find relevant to climate change is important in order to build a database of effective climate change imagery, which can then be used by scientists, policymakers, and practitioners in mobilizing climate adaptation and resilience efforts. To this end, we collected ratings of relevance to climate change as well as emotional arousal and valence on 320 images to assess the relationship between relevance to climate change and the emotional qualities of the image. In addition, participants' environmental beliefs were measured, to investigate the relationship between beliefs and image ratings. The results suggest that images rated highly relevant to climate change are higher in negative emotional valence and emotional arousal. Overall, images were rated as being more relevant to climate change by participants with higher pro-environmental disposition. Critically, we have compiled the mean relevance, valence, and arousal ratings of each of these 320 images into a database that is posted online and freely available (https://affectiveclimateimages.weebly.com; https://www.nmu.edu/affectiveclimateimages) for use in future research on climate change visuals.","[Lehman, Betsy; Carlson, Joshua M.] Northern Michigan Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, Marquette, MI 49855 USA; [Thompson, Jessica] Northern Michigan Univ, Dept Commun & Performance Studies, Marquette, MI USA; [Davis, Shawn] Slippery Rock Univ, Pk Conservat & Recreat Therapy Dept, Slippery Rock, PA USA",Northern Michigan University; Northern Michigan University; Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Slippery Rock University - Pennsylvania,"Lehman, B; Carlson, JM (corresponding author), Northern Michigan Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, Marquette, MI 49855 USA.",ellehman@nmu.edu; joshcarl@nmu.edu,"Thompson, Jessica/GXW-0323-2022",,,,,,37,18,18,5,25,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

The geographic and political ecological literature-and the literature informed by geography and political ecology-generally explores the relationship between climate change and conflict through case studies, employing a wide range of methods that enable understandings not accessible through exclusively large-n quantitative studies. As a result, this literature focuses on questions and challenges that are generally overlooked in the wider climate-conflict literature, including the importance of spatial and temporal scale and the ways in which vulnerability and resilience frame this relationship. Recent Findings This literature uniquely challenges the dominant threat multiplier framing of climate change's impact on climate, questioning this narrative's unidirectional flow from climate vulnerability to conflict, exploring how climate change can create opportunities for peacebuilding as well as conflict, and identifying how climate adaptation activities can themselves become catalysts for conflict. Summary While geographic and political ecological lenses on the relationship between climate change and conflict do not have all the answers needed to address the challenges and opportunities presented by this relationship, the framings these lenses offer are essential to building meaningful, actionable understandings going forward.","[Abrahams, Daniel] Univ South Carolina, Dept Geog, Callcott Bldg,709 Bull St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Carr, Edward R.] Clark Univ, Int Dev Community & Environm Dept IDCE, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Carr, Edward R.] Clark Univ, Humanitarian Response & Dev Lab, George Perkins Marsh Inst, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Clark University; Clark University,"Abrahams, D (corresponding author), Univ South Carolina, Dept Geog, Callcott Bldg,709 Bull St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",abrahad@email.sc.edu,"Abrahams, Daniel/ABI-5716-2020; Carr, Edward R/A-7206-2009","Abrahams, Daniel/0000-0003-4489-7991; Carr, Edward/0000-0001-7784-471X",,,,,97,26,26,3,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2198-6061,,,CURR CLIM CHANGE REP,Curr.

Local leaders provided a description of how local context (e. g., climate, governance and city structure) impacted heat preparedness. Despite the differences among study cities, political will and resource access were critical to driving heat-health related programming. Upon completion of our interviews, we convened leaders in each city to discuss these findings and their ongoing efforts through day-long workshops.

The Ukraine war, COVID-19 and the desert locust invasion have only amplified the prevailing sensitivity to shocks in the agriculture sector, creating an emphasis on the need to strengthen local agricultural production to reduce reliance on imports. This paper seeks to assess the opportunities for improving agriculture adaptation and resilience based on future expected changes in climate, length of the growing period and agro-ecologies. The study uses 2020 as the baseline year and explores changes in agro-ecological zones (AEZs) in near future 2040 through two representative concentration pathways, 4.5 and 8.5, representing a medium carbon emissions and a dire emissions future, respectively. Google Earth Engine and R Statistics are used in data-processing. Down-scaled climate projections from CIMP5 are used for future analyses combined with static soil suitability and drainage data. Fuzzy logic is used to normalize inputs and compute the agro-ecological zones (AEZ). Interesting results emerge from the study that validate the hypothesis that the seasons and production potential are shifting. Lowland drylands will experience an increasingly long growing period, creating the potential for diversifying production systems from rangelands to agro-pastoral systems, with the capacity to grow more drought-resistant crops and the potential to take advantage of increased runoff for water harvesting. Midland highland areas, which form part of the food basket areas, have already started experiencing a reduction in the length of the growing period and agricultural potential. In these areas, resilience mechanisms will need to consider the expected future reduction in rain-fed agricultural potential, gendered preferences, convergence of technology and indigenous coping mechanisms, and drought-resilience-focused diversification.","[Ndungu, Lilian Wangui; Kiema, John Bosco Kyalo; Siriba, David Nyangau] Univ Nairobi, Dept Geospatial & Space Technol, POB 30197, Nairobi, Kenya; [Muthike, Denis Macharia] Univ Colorado, Mortenson Ctr Global Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Ndungu, Samuel Wamathai] Kenyatta Univ, Sch Pure & Appl Sci, POB 43844 00100, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Nairobi; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Kenyatta University,"Ndungu, LW (corresponding author), Univ Nairobi, Dept Geospatial & Space Technol, POB 30197, Nairobi, Kenya.",lw_ndungu@students.uonbi.ac.ke,"Macharia, Denis/AAU-6073-2020","Macharia, Denis/0000-0002-1964-7301",,,,,28,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,DEC,2022,11,12,,,,,,,2172,10.3390/land11122172,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11122172,,,14,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,7E5XP,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000901240800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Iranian farmers are extremely vulnerable to unexpected drought. Despite the undesirable impacts of climate change on their vulnerability, farmers have not sufficiently used adaptive strategies; accordingly, we investigated factors affecting farmers' choice of adaptive strategies to lessen the consequences of climate change in Iran. We propose a framework that covers household, farm, socio-economic, social-capital, and psychological characteristics. Farmers (n = 366) in Fars province, Iran, were selected using a multistage, stratified random sampling method, and data were collected through questionnaires during 2018-2019. Considering the adaptive strategies of changing crop varieties, crop patterns, and irrigation technologies, a multinomial logit model was used. The results showed that off-farm income and access to credit had a significant positive effect on adopting costly and efficient strategies, including changing crop varieties and irrigation technologies. Moreover, our results indicated that when farmers actively participate in social groups, their beliefs and risk perception of climate change become stronger, providing greater incentives to employ adaptive strategies. This study revealed the effective role of social-capital and psychological characteristics in the adaptive behavior of farmers in Iran.","[Mirzaei, Abbas; Najafabadi, Mostafa Mardani] Agr Sci & Nat Resources Univ Khuzestan, Dept Agr Econ, Mollasani 6341773637, Iran; [Azarm, Hassan] Shiraz Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Shiraz 7144113131, Iran; [Yazdanpanah, Masoud] Agr Sci & Nat Resources Univ Khuzestan, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Mollasani 6341773637, Iran",Shiraz University,"Mirzaei, A (corresponding author), Agr Sci & Nat Resources Univ Khuzestan, Dept Agr Econ, Mollasani 6341773637, Iran.",amirzaei@asnrukh.ac.ir,"Yazdanpanah, Masoud/V-5353-2018","Yazdanpanah, Masoud/0000-0001-8610-0173; Mirzaei, Abbas/0000-0003-3161-3099; Azarm, Hassan/0000-0002-3329-6579; Mardani Najafabadi, Mostafa/0000-0001-6181-3505",,,,,96,1,1,12,15,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0936-577X,1616-1572,,CLIM RES,Clim.

Insights from Burkina Faso,CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; adaptation; science-policy interface; Burkina Faso; policy formulation,AFRICA; KNOWLEDGE,"Burkina Faso is highly vulnerable to the increasing impacts of climate change and currently has large adaptation deficits. To improve adaptation planning at the national level, policies must, among other things, be informed by the current observed state of the environment as well as the best available projections of future climate change impacts. Scientific information has gradually been making its way into policies since 2007 but barriers still hinder the climate science-adaptation policy interface. A systematic policy document analysis, semi-structured interviews and participant observations were undertaken to explore how scientific information makes its way into national adaptation policy documents from its production to its inclusion into policies. The results suggest that overall, national adaptation policies are only to a limited extent informed by scientific information, due to insufficient availability of information, limited human and technical capacity and lack of finance. This highlights the need to build up national technical capacities to produce the required scientific information, by inter alia prioritizing it within ministerial budgets, reducing the dependency on international technical and financial partners. Further policy recommendations include capacity building and continuous formal collaboration protocols between producers and users, to ensure that usable scientific information is structurally integrated into policy-making processes..","[Theokritoff, Emily; D'haen, Sarah Ann Lise] Climate Analyitcs, Berlin, Germany; [Theokritoff, Emily; D'haen, Sarah Ann Lise] Humbolt Univ, IRI THESys, Berlin, Germany; [Theokritoff, Emily; D'haen, Sarah Ann Lise] Humbolt Univ, Geog Dept, Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Theokritoff, E (corresponding author), Climate Analyitcs, Berlin, Germany.;Theokritoff, E (corresponding author), Humbolt Univ, IRI THESys, Berlin, Germany.;Theokritoff, E (corresponding author), Humbolt Univ, Geog Dept, Berlin, Germany.",emily.theokritoff@climateanalytics.org,,,,,,,42,0,0,2,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Nearly a third of the households in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) are engaged in agriculture as one livelihood strategy to cope with the multiple shocks experienced over the past three decades, resulting in economic decline and loss of income opportunities. Based on a household survey, we analyzed the livelihoods of households in three agricultural regions in BH: how they are affected by climate change, their perceptions of climatic change, as well as various household adaptation strategies. The results were discussed in the context of the sustainable livelihoods approach. Our results indicate that rural households are relatively asset poor and highly dependent on agriculture, irrespective of geographical location or wealth. Their access to assets is further constrained by the ongoing changes in economic and political structures and processes. Negative effects of climate change were reported in terms of yield decline and reduced quality of products. On a positive note, the level of adoption of different agricultural practices and technologies indicates signs of an overall intensification strategy of agricultural production in BH, as well as adaptation to the perceived changes in climate and climate variability using the available asset base.","[Zurovec, Ognjen; Vedeld, Pal Olav] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Land & Soc, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragr, N-1432 As, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Zurovec, O (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Land & Soc, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragr, N-1432 As, Norway.",ognjen.zurovec@teagasc.ie; pal.vedeld@nmbu.no,"Žurovec, Ognjen/I-3082-2019","Žurovec, Ognjen/0000-0002-5155-6274","project Agricultural Adaptation to Climate Change-Networking, Education, Research, and Extension in theWest Balkans - HERD, the Programme for Higher Education, Research and Development 2010-2014","project Agricultural Adaptation to Climate Change-Networking, Education, Research, and Extension in theWest Balkans - HERD, the Programme for Higher Education, Research and Development 2010-2014","This study was supported by the project Agricultural Adaptation to Climate Change-Networking, Education, Research, and Extension in theWest Balkans, funded by HERD, the Programme for Higher Education, Research and Development 2010-2014.",,81,15,15,3,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2019,11,21,,,,,,,6079,10.3390/su11216079,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11216079,,,27,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JT7ZZ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000501205200206,View Full Record in Web of Science

The focus is on addressing growth uncertainty through a range of climate scenarios so that an adaptive capacity may be possible and the vulnerability of the stand to climate change may be reduced. The optimization encompasses finding both the harvest age in each cycle and the number of coppice cycles within a full rotation that maximize net present revenue. The innovation lies in the combination of the process-based model (Glob3PG) with two dynamic programming (DP) approaches. The former is able to project growth of eucalypt stands under climate change scenarios. The innovative approaches are thus influential to define the management policy (e.g., stool thinning, number of coppice cycles, and cycle length) that maximizes net present revenue taking into account uncertainty in forest growth due to climate change. In both approaches, the state of the system is defined by the number of years since plantation, whereas DP stages are defined by the cumulative number of harvests. The first approach proposes the optimal policy under each climate change scenario at each state. The second approach addresses further situations when the climate scenario is unknown at the beginning of the planning horizon. Both help address uncertainty in an adaptive framework, as a set of readily available options is proposed for each scenario. Results of an application to a typical Eucalyptus globulus Labill. stand in central Portugal are discussed.","[Ferreira, L.] Polytech Inst Leiria, Sch Technol & Management, Campus 2,Apartado 4163, P-2411901 Leiria, Portugal; [Ferreira, L.; Constantino, M.] Ctr Matemat Aplicacoes Fundamentais & Invest Oper, Lisbon, Portugal; [Constantino, M.] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, DEIO, Lisbon, Portugal; [Constantino, M.; Borges, J.

Block-level weather forecasting is a new-fangled dimension of agrometeorological services (AAS) in the country and is getting popularized as a climate-smart farming strategy. Studies on the economic impact of these microlevel advisories are uncommon. Agromet advisory services (AAS) play a critical role as an early warning service and preparedness among the maize farmers in the Parambikulam-Aliyar Basin, as this area still needs to widen and deepen its AWS network to reach the village level. In this article, the responses of the maize farmers of Parambikulam-Aliyar Basin on AAS were analyzed. AAS were provided to early and late Rabi farmers during the year 2020-2022. An automatic weather station was installed at the farmers' field to understand the real-time weather. Forecast data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) were used to provide agromet advisory services. Therefore, the present study deserves special focus. Social media and other ICT tools were used for AAS dissemination purposes. A crop simulation model (CSM), DSSAT4.7cereal maize, was used for assessing maize yield in the present scenario and under the elevated GHGs scenario under climate change. Our findings suggest that the AAS significantly supported the farmers in sustaining production. The AAS were helpful for the farmers during the dry spells in the late samba (2021-2022) to provide critical irrigation and during heavy rainfall events at the events of harvest during early and late Rabi (2021-22). Published research articles on the verification of weather forecasts from South India are scanty. This article also tries to understand the reliability of forecasts. Findings from the verification suggest that rainfall represented a fairly good forecast for the season, though erratic, with an accuracy score or HI score of 0.77 and an HK score of 0.60, and the probability of detection (PoD) of hits was found to be 0.91. Verification shows that the forecasted relative humidity observed showed a fairly good correlation, with an R-2 value of 0.52. These findings suggest that enhancing model forecast accuracy can enhance the reliability and utility of AAS as a climate-smart adaptation option. This study recommends that AAS can act as a valuable input to alleviate the impacts of hydrometeorological disasters on maize crop production in the basin. There is a huge demand for quality weather forecasts with respect to accuracy, resolution, and lead time, which is increasing across the country. Externally funded research studies such as ours are an added advantage to bridge the gap in AAS dissemination to a great extent.","[Dhanya, Punnoli; Geethalakshmi, Vellingiri; Ramanathan, Subbiah; Bhuvaneshwari, Kulanthaisamy; Dheebakaran, Ganesan; Kokilavani, Sembanan; Sathyamoorthy, Nagaranai Karuppasamy] Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Agro Climate Res Ctr, Coimbatore 641003, India; [Senthilraja, Kandasamy; Karthikeyan, Ramasamy] Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Directorate Crop Management, Coimbatore 641003, India; [Sreeraj, Punnoli] Thangal Kunju Musaliar Coll Engn TKMCE, Kollam 691005, India; [Pradipa, Chinnasamy] Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Salem 636203, India; [Vengateswari, Mahalingam] Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Ramanathapuram 623536, India",Tamil Nadu Agricultural University; Tamil Nadu Agricultural University; Tamil Nadu Agricultural University; Tamil Nadu Agricultural University,"Dhanya, P; Geethalakshmi, V (corresponding author), Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Agro Climate Res Ctr, Coimbatore 641003, India.",dhanyapunnoli@gmail.com; geetha@tnau.ac.in,"Ganesan, Dheebakaran/ABI-5571-2020","Ganesan, Dheebakaran/0000-0002-0603-192X; P, Dr. Dhanya/0000-0001-9957-8766","Department of Science and Technology, KIRAN-WISE Division of Government of India, under the Women Scientist for Societal Benefit Schem","Department of Science and Technology, KIRAN-WISE Division of Government of India, under the Women Scientist for Societal Benefit Schem","This research was funded by the Department of Science and Technology, KIRAN-WISE Division of Government of India, under the Women Scientist for Societal Benefit Scheme. https://dst.gov.in/sites/default/files/Result%20AAS%20WOS%20-B%202018-19%20%28101%20proposals%29.pdf (accessed on 3 October 2019).",,43,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2624-7402,,AGRIENGINEERING,AgriEngineering,DEC,2022,4,4,,,,,1030,1053,,10.3390/agriengineering4040065,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriengineering4040065,,,24,Agricultural Engineering,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Agriculture,7F7ZD,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000902059900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thirty-two records were included in the review, with the majority of studies published after 2015. Findings indicate that BGI effectively controls urban runoff and mitigates urban heat, with the literature being slightly more focused on stormwater management than urban heat island mitigation. Among BGI, the studies on blue- and blue-green roofs focused on one benefit at a time (i.e. thermal or hydrologic performance) and did not consider promoting multiple benefits simultaneously. Two-thirds of the selected studies were performed on a large urban scale, with computer modelling and sensor monitoring being the predominant assessment methods. Compared with typical Green Infrastructure (GI), and from a design perspective, many crucial questions on BGI performance, particularly on smaller urban scales, remain unanswered.

This should make risk analysis a natural framework for climate adaptation in infrastructure systems. However, many aspects of climate change, such as weak background knowledge and societal controversy, make it an emerging risk where traditional approaches for risk assessment and management cannot be confidently employed. A number of research developments aimed at addressing these issues have emerged in recent years, such as the development of probabilistic climate projections, climate services, and robust decision frameworks. However, additional research is needed to improve the suitability of these methods for infrastructure planning. In this perspective, we outline some of the challenges in addressing climate change risks to infrastructure and summarize new developments aimed at meeting these challenges.

With climate projections suggesting large increases in hot spells in desert regions and more extremes in rainfall in other areas of the north, direct and indirect impacts resulting from these changes are likely to further entrench this health and well-being disparity. This paper argues that it is time to explicitly draw on Indigenous definitions of health, which directly address the need to connect individual and community health to the health of their country, in order to develop effective climate adaptation and health strategies. We detail how current health policies overlook this 'missing' dimension of Indigenous connection to country, and why that is likely to be detrimental to the health and well-being of people living in remote communities in a climate-changed future.","[Green, Donna; Minchin, Liz] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia; [Green, Donna] Univ New S Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Green, D (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia.",donna.green@unsw.edu.au,,"green, donna/0000-0003-4521-8735",NHMRC [1011599],NHMRC(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),"The authors appreciate comments on this paper from P.

However, near-term climate predictions up to 10 years into the future carried out recently with these models can be rigorously verified against observations. Near-term climate prediction is a new information tool for the climate adaptation and service communities, which often make decisions on near-term time scales, and for which the most basic information is unfortunately very scarce. The Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project set of co-ordinated climate-model experiments includes a set of near-term predictions in which several modelling groups participated and whose forecast quality we illustrate here. We show that climate forecast systems have skill in predicting the Earth's temperature at regional scales over the past 50 years and illustrate the trustworthiness of their predictions.

In many areas, climate change impacts have affected the availability of basic necessities including freshwater, food security, and energy. Developing countries are more adversely impacted by climate change and are less prepared to cope with its impacts. Over the years, local communities in these countries have been using their local based knowledge commonly known as indigenous knowledge (IK) to adapt to any form of uncertainty including climate change. This article assesses the IK used by the mixed farmers in Tanzania to adapt to the impacts of climate change. The study that informed this article was conducted in Missenyi and Muleba Districts, Kagera Region along the Ngono River Basin in Tanzania. It employed different techniques and methods to gather information from both primary and secondary sources including focus group discussions, key informant interviews, observation and desk reviews. The findings revealed that local communities within the basin have developed a sophisticated body of knowledge to withstand impacts of climate change. This knowledge is socially constructed and embedded within the socio-cultural context of the local communities. The findings further established that IK is mostly used in a situation of long drought season, infestation of diseases and pests for both livestock and crops as well as during occurrence of strong winds. In such circumstances, most oft-cited adaptation practices used include farming and grazing in wetlands, growing of drought resistant crops, using locally made pesticides, and grain storage, to mention but a few. The article recommends that despite the fact that some IK seems to be helpful at the local level, it is necessary that local communities are assisted in their adaptive strategies so that they can respond to climate change effectively and enhance their resilience.","[Theodory, Theobald Frank] Mzumbe Univ, Inst Dev Studies, Ctr Environm Poverty & Sustainable Dev, Morogoro, Tanzania",,"Theodory, TF (corresponding author), Mzumbe Univ, Inst Dev Studies, Ctr Environm Poverty & Sustainable Dev, Morogoro, Tanzania.",fttheodory@mzumbe.ac.tz,"Theodory, Theobald Frank/HDM-7029-2022",,German Academic Exchange Service,German Academic Exchange Service(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),I am grateful for the financial support from the German Academic Exchange Service that helped me to conduct this study successfully.

There remains a persistent disconnect between the production of (physical) climate science and the implementation of practical, local, and context-specific adaptation actions. We argue for a need to incorporate subaltern'' knowledge (i.e., that which is typically labeled local, traditional, or indigenous knowledge) in climate adaptation science and practice. Building on recent comparative assessment studies, we identify limitations of current local adaptation action in its typical application of scientific knowledge and illustrate key pathways through which the subaltern can be integrated to better inform current approaches. We argue that subaltern knowledge can be a critical source of innovation and can help to broaden the adaptation solution space by enhancing both the effectiveness and the social legitimacy of actions.","[Olazabal, Marta] Basque Ctr Climate Change, Leioa, Bizkaia, Spain; [Chu, Eric] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Human Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Broto, Vanesa Castan] Univ Sheffield, Interdisciplinary Ctr Social Sci ICOSS, Sheffield Urban Inst, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Patterson, James] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Sheffield; Utrecht University,"Olazabal, M (corresponding author), Basque Ctr Climate Change, Leioa, Bizkaia, Spain.",marta.olazabal@bc3research.org,"Olazabal, Marta/AFT-6957-2022; Chu, Eric/O-6464-2015","Olazabal, Marta/0000-0002-3381-0654; Chu, Eric/0000-0002-5648-6615; Castan Broto, Vanesa/0000-0002-3175-9859; Patterson, James/0000-0002-4849-7613",AXA Research Fund [4771]; Maria de Maeztu program (Spanish State Research Agency) [MDM-2017-0714]; BERC 2018-2021 program (Basque Government); USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (Hatch Project) [1023967]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [804051-LO-ACT-ERC-2018-STG],AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund); Maria de Maeztu program (Spanish State Research Agency); BERC 2018-2021 program (Basque Government)(Basque Government); USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (Hatch Project); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program(European Research Council (ERC)),"M.O. has received funding from the AXA Research Fund under grant agreement 4771 and through the Maria de Maeztu program (MDM-2017-0714, Spanish State Research Agency) and the BERC 2018-2021 program (Basque Government).

The strategic importance of ground water for global water and food security will probably intensify under climate change as more frequent and intense climate extremes (droughts and floods) increase variability in precipitation, soil moisture and surface water. Here we critically review recent research assessing the impacts of climate on ground water through natural and human-induced processes as well as through groundwater-driven feedbacks on the climate system. Furthermore, we examine the possible opportunities and challenges of using and sustaining groundwater resources in climate adaptation strategies, and highlight the lack of groundwater observations, which, at present, limits our understanding of the dynamic relationship between ground water and climate.","[Taylor, Richard G.] UCL, Dept Geog, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Scanlon, Bridget] Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Bur Econ Geol, Austin, TX 78758 USA; [Doell, Petra] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Phys Geog, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany; [Rodell, Matt] NASA, Hydrol Sci Branch, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [van Beek, Rens; Wada, Yoshihide; Bierkens, Marc F.

We present a crop simulation ensemble for a location in India, perturbing the response of both crop and climate under both baseline (12 720 simulations) and doubled-CO2 (171720 simulations) climates. Some simulations used parameter values representing genotypic adaptation to mean temperature change. Firstly, observed and simulated yields in the baseline climate were compared. Secondly, the response of yield to changes in mean temperature was examined and compared to that found in the literature. No consistent response to temperature change was found across studies. Thirdly, the relative contribution of uncertainty in crop and climate simulation to the total uncertainty in projected yield changes was examined. In simulations without genotypic adaptation, most of the uncertainty came from the climate model parameters. Comparison with the simulations with genotypic adaptation and with a previous study suggested that the relatively low crop parameter uncertainty derives from the observational constraints on the crop parameters used in this study. Fourthly, the simulations were used, together with an observed dataset and a simple analysis of crop cardinal temperatures and thermal time, to estimate the potential for adaptation using existing cultivars. The results suggest that the germplasm for complete adaptation of groundnut cultivation in western India to a doubled-CO2 environment may not exist.

Three regions, characterised by changing onset and timing of rains, rainfall frequencies and intensities, in Limpopo, North West and KwaZulu Natal provinces, were selected to investigate farmer perceptions of, and responses to, rainfall parameter changes. Village and household level analyses demonstrate that the trends and variabilities in precipitation parameters differentiated by the SOM analysis were clearly recognised by people living in the areas in which they occurred. A range of specific coping and adaptation strategies are employed by farmers to respond to climate shifts, some generic across regions and some facilitated by specific local factors.

Using a qualitative case study of local climate adaptation to sea level rise, we show how climate change science is translated into a self-referential theory focused on property prices. Our analysis develops two mechanisms - enablement and theorization - to explain the relationship between theory performativity and power within a process of translation. This contributes to (1) the performativity debate by showing how the constitution of power relations shapes theory performativity; (2) theories of power, by tracing the ways in which certain actors are able to enrol others and impact the authority of particular theories, and (3) processes of translation by developing mechanisms for following the ways in which power and theory performativity interact. We conclude by arguing that a performative understanding of how power shapes beliefs is central to combating the failure to address climate change.","[Bowden, Vanessa] Univ Newcastle, Business Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Nyberg, Daniel] Univ Newcastle, Business Sch, Management, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Gond, Jean-Pascal] City Univ London, Corp Social Responsibil, London, England; [Wright, Christopher] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Newcastle University - UK; Newcastle University - UK; City University London; University of Sydney,"Bowden, V (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, NEWSpace Univ Newcastle, CNR Hunter & Auckland St, Newcastle, NSW 2300, Australia.",vanessa.bowden@newcastle.edu.au,"Nyberg, Daniel/ABE-2371-2021","Nyberg, Daniel/0000-0002-7144-1343; Bowden, Vanessa/0000-0002-6642-2826; Wright, Christopher/0000-0001-8624-9605",,,,,60,3,3,1,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0170-8406,1741-3044,,ORGAN STUD,Organ.

Adaptation costs also influence a country's decision to abate and join international environmental agreements (IEAs). In this paper, the authors study how these cost differences affect participation incentives. Their model identifies two channels through which adaptation affects free-riding incentives: carbon leakage and cost asymmetry in adaptation. In contrast with the common view, the authors find that the presence of adaptation is not necessarily an impediment to cooperation on abatement. They also present conditions under which adaptation can strengthen or weaken free-riding incentives. The results serve as a cautionary tale to policy makers and suggest that policies directed at reducing carbon leakage and/or cost differences between developed and developing countries may also affect the success and failure of IEAs.","[Lazkano, Itziar] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Econ, POB 413,Bolton Hall,Room 840, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Lazkano, Itziar] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Helleveien 40, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Marrouch, Walid] Lebanese Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Lebanon, NH USA; [Marrouch, Walid] CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Nkuiya, Bruno] Univ Alberta, Campus St Jean, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Lebanese American University; Universite de Montreal; University of Alberta,"Lazkano, I (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Econ, POB 413,Bolton Hall,Room 840, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.;Lazkano, I (corresponding author), Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Helleveien 40, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",lazkano@uwm.edu; walid.marrouch@lau.edu.lb; nkuiyamb@ualberta.ca,"Nkuiya, Bruno/AAE-5896-2022; Marrouch, Walid/D-5597-2019; Nkuiya, Bruno/AAB-2497-2020","Marrouch, Walid/0000-0001-8488-6555; Lazkano, Itziar/0000-0002-9432-0616; Nkuiya, Bruno/0000-0001-6268-3001",,,,,33,20,20,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

This study aims to analyzing the risks, ranking the vulnerability and suggesting adaptation measures to mitigate the impact of the SLR along the Mediterranean coast of Egypt. Although the prominent features of Egypt's Mediterranean coastal zone are the low lying coast of the Nile Delta, associated with land subsidence, tectonic activities and erosion; the contiguous coastal sectors are backed by shore-parallel carbonate ridges and Plateau (the western coast) and sand dune belts (Sinai coast). The coastal zone is ranked as high, moderate, and low vulnerable to the SLR. The social and biophysical vulnerabilities demonstrate the asymmetrical impacts of the SLR on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt. Areas at risk in the Alexandria region are Mandara and El Tarh whereas in the Nile Delta region, they are the Manzala Lagoon barrier, east and west of the Rosetta City, Gamil, and the Tineh plain.

It affects the resources available for adaptation, and in turn enables or constrains the choices available to populations pursuing adaptation. In this article, we introduce a novel adaptation framework that supports the analysis of adaptation planning documents to identify patterns and trends in priorities among adaptation strategies. In turn, the framework can be applied to evaluate alignment with adaptation plan objectives and to compare plans across multiple scales of government. We apply this framework to analyse adaptation plans in coastal Louisiana, a region experiencing severe environmental change that threatens biodiversity and local livelihoods. Through our adaptation framework, we examine how the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority of Louisiana shapes the trajectory of environmental change adaptation in coastal Louisiana across scales of government. We find that techno-managerial solutions dominate the adaptation strategies proposed in the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority's 2017 State of Louisiana's Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast, and that the agency's main adaptation strategies neglect to support of socio-economic and cultural adaptation approaches despite listing them as major objectives.","[Molloy, Michael] Univ Missouri, Dept Nat Resources, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Joslin, Audrey] Kansas State Univ, Dept Geog & Geospatial Sci, Manhattan, KS USA; [Molloy, Michael] Univ Missouri, Dept Nat Resources, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",,"Molloy, M (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Dept Nat Resources, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",Mm7g5@umsystem.edu,,,Kansas State University Department of Geography; Geospatial Sciences Geography Graduate Research Grant,Kansas State University Department of Geography; Geospatial Sciences Geography Graduate Research Grant,This work was supported by the Kansas State University Department of Geography and Geospatial Sciences Geography Graduate Research Grant.,,57,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1747-7891,1878-0059,,ENVIRON HAZARDS-UK,Environ.

In fisheries, in particular, the effects of climate change are reflected in the decline of fishing yield and loss of lives during extreme weather events in the sea. This study analyzed the perception of climate variability and change by fisher-folks, the attitude of fisher-folks toward the weather forecast and the adoption rate of the use of the weather forecast as well as the factors determining its use in Senegal. To this end, 576 fisher-folks belonging to 41 local fishing committees along the coastal areas were surveyed and focus group discussions were organized with key informants. The adoption rate was identified using the method of the average treatment effect (ATE) and the test of independency (chi-square) was used to analyze the perceptions of and beliefs on climate change. The results showed that 96% of fisher-folks perceive the change in the climate, though the effects are differently appreciated across the coastline. The most frequently observed effects are: coastal erosion, change in wind direction, increase in extreme swells and sea level rise. Nearly half of fisher-folks confirm that they noticed these changes over the past five years. In the Southern Coast in particular, 40% of fisher-folks stated that these changes happened 10 years ago. This statement is confirmed by the qualitative data. More than 90% of the respondents ascertain the weather forecast before going to fish, 63% regularly receive the weather forecast and 53% avoid going to sea during extreme events. In addition, the results showed that if the weather forecast was made accessible to the majority of fisher-folks, more than 83% would avoid going to sea during periods of extreme weather extreme events, thus reducing significantly the number of fatalities. The best way to protect the fisher-folks from the harmful effects of climate change is to ensure large-scale access to and use of accurate weather forecasts.","[Diouf, Ndeye Seynabou; Ouedraogo, Issa; Zougmore, Robert B.] CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, ICRISAT West & Cent Africa Reg Off, BP 320, Bamako, Mali; [Niang, Madicke] Initiat Prospect Agr & Rurale IPAR, BP 16788, Ouest Foire Dakar, Senegal",CGIAR,"Diouf, NS (corresponding author), CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, ICRISAT West & Cent Africa Reg Off, BP 320, Bamako, Mali.",S.Diouf@cgiar.org; i.ouedraogo@cgiar.org; r.zougmore@cgiar.org; madickee@yahoo.fr,,"Zougmore, Robert/0000-0002-6215-4852; Ouedraogo, Issa/0000-0002-5675-6769",USAID; CGIAR,USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); CGIAR(CGIAR),"The authors acknowledge the USAID funding support to the CINSERE project in Senegal and we are thankful to the IPAR for data collection and the community (fisher-folks and key informants) for their collaboration.

Mulch was the most widely used climate risk adaptation technique in the study area. Age had a positive influence on farmers' adoption of the use of mini ponds for irrigation while negative influence on adoption of suitable saline tolerance varieties. Experience in watermelon farming influenced the adoption of suitable salt-tolerant varieties. Multinominal probit and Propensity Score Matching (PSM) results indicated that 'farmland size owned' is less likely to use the pond for irrigation and suitable salt tolerant varieties. Membership of a farmer association and perception of decreasing rain influenced farmers' adoption of mulching, intercropping, use of mini ponds for irrigation, and suitable salt tolerant varieties as adaptation strategies. Policy focuses on the provision of agricultural services and strengthening strong partnerships with different collaborators and development partners for adaptive capacity of climate adaptation strategies would be of effective.","[Begum, Mst.

However, these studies have not incorporated the voices of those using the term to define their work: the farmers, private companies, researchers, and NGOs giving energy to the movement. In this study, we conducted qualitative interviews with 19 stakeholders from across the United States. Key points of consensus were that regenerative agriculture moves beyond sustainability, is outcomes-based, and, as such, is context-specific: focusing on outcomes provides opportunities to be adaptive to a specific context and that, depending on one's context, different practices may be used to achieve target outcomes. We identified three categories of outcomes: climate adaptation and mitigation, socio-economic benefits, and integrated systems. We also found several opportunities within the energy of the movement. First, regenerative agriculture remains a big tent that is still accessible to a broad range of farmers. Participants also underscore the need to move toward systems-based research as opposed to reductionist research. Finally, we present participants' mixed perspectives on the role of government, the private sector, and third parties in moving regenerative agriculture forward.","[Wilson, Kelly R.; Myers, Robert L.] Univ Missouri, Ctr Regenerat Agr, Coll Agr Food & Nat Resources, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Hendrickson, Mary K.] Univ Missouri, Coll Agr Food & Nat Resources, Div Appl Social Sci DASS, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Heaton, Emily A.] Univ Illinois, Coll Agr Consumer & Environm Sci, Dept Crop Sci, Champaign, IL 61801 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Wilson, KR (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Ctr Regenerat Agr, Coll Agr Food & Nat Resources, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",kellyrwilson@missouri.edu,,"Wilson, Kelly/0000-0002-8462-0586; Hendrickson, Mary/0000-0003-2984-4082",,,,,53,1,1,7,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2022,14,22,,,,,,,15261,10.3390/su142215261,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142215261,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6K7YW,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000887713500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is expressed through concepts such as nature-based solutions (NbS), ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA), and blue-green infrastructure (BGI). Despite their popularity in the international arena, relatively little is known about how these concepts are used and interpreted at the local level, which has implications for policy formulation and actions. This paper examined both direct and indirect references to these concepts, as well as the reasons for their potential omission. By analysing policy documents and interviews with practitioners and activists from four Polish cities (Gdansk, Krakow, Warsaw, Wroclaw), it discussed the uneven and ambivalent uptake of concepts in the urban green and blue space (UGBS) governance. While the reluctance to use new terminology was often explained by accessibility and efficiency concerns, it also revealed some conceptual confusion. The contribution of this study is twofold: 1) providing a more nuanced understanding of the conceptual ambiguity surrounding the NbS, EbA and BGI concepts and the gap between international policy rhetorics and local interpretation; 2) expanding the geography of research on urban climate adaptation and urban green spaces which tends to overlook the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.","[Baravikova, Aliaksandra] Gran Sasso Sci Inst, Dept Social Sci, Viale Francesco Crispi 7, I-67100 Laquila, Italy",Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI),"Baravikova, A (corresponding author), Gran Sasso Sci Inst, Dept Social Sci, Viale Francesco Crispi 7, I-67100 Laquila, Italy.",aliaksandra.baravikova@gssi.it,,,,,,,84,9,9,4,43,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1618-8667,1610-8167,,URBAN FOR URBAN GREE,Urban For.

Correspondingly, the EHE-caused economic losses increased obviously before 2000 followed by a slight decrease; the post-2000 decline could be partially attributed to the decreases in drought and flood-prone area or climate adaptation practices. Spatially, Asia experienced most EHEs (969), corresponding to the largest share of economic losses (approximately $868 billion for floods and $50 billion for droughts, respectively), while Oceania had the least EHEs (102) and the least economic losses (approximately $19 billion for floods and $45 billion for droughts). The five countries with the highest EHE-caused economic losses were China, United States, Canada, Australia, and India. Countries that suffered the highest flood-caused economic losses were China, United States, and Canada.

Local municipal planning mechanisms play a fundamental role in increasing a community's capacity toward long-term resiliency. This study employs the content analysis method to evaluate the 95 selected cities located in the US Federal Emergency Management Agency Region VII and examine how these local plans, including local comprehensive plans (CPs), hazard mitigation plans (HMPs), and local emergency operations plans (EOPs), prepare communities for climate change and possible extreme events. Results indicate that local plans delineated multiple resources and diverse strategies to reduce community climatic risks, where HMPs have medium-level preparation, and CPs and EOPs have limited level preparation. Local HMPs lead in mitigating for impacts from potential extreme events, but both local CPs and EOPs are proactively adapted for climatic risks. Common strengths and weaknesses exist between different planning mechanisms. Large variations exist among plans due to varying jurisdictions among cities. However, the plans score similarly overallhigher on strategies and factual base but are short of clear and detailed goals, objectives, and agendas. Finally, despite the diverse vertical and horizontal outreach, there is inadequate integration among local planning mechanisms to share climate hazard information.","[Hu, Qiao; Tang, Zhenghong] Univ Nebraska, Community & Reg Planning Program, Lincoln, NE USA; [Shulski, Martha; Umphlett, Natalie] UNL, Sch Nat Resources, HARH 153B, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Abdel-Monem, Tarik] Univ Nebraska, Publ Policy Ctr, Lincoln, NE USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Shulski, M (corresponding author), UNL, Sch Nat Resources, HARH 153B, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.",mshulski3@unl.edu,,,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [NA16OAR4210123],National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"This paper is funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (Award Number: NA16OAR4210123).

Aim of the investigation was to study the influence of drought stress on ecophysiological growth parameters and water consumption under field conditions. We measured electron transport rates, effective quantum yield, transpiration and leaf conductance for water vapor under different environmental conditions. The comparison of mean values of these parameters shows not only between but also within different provenances significant differences between the repeats and between the years. In almost all provenances a positive relationship between electron transport rates and leaf conductance could be observed. Furthermore, trees from SE Europe seem to react more sensitively to low air humidity. The reduction of stomata opening minimizes water consumption, especially on hot days with high water vapor pressure deficits. The ecophysiological performance of the trees emphasise the high adaptation and adaptability of the beech to climate conditions on the level of populations. Significant differences between populations can be identified on the basis of the measured variables only occasionally and then usually they affect only the extreme values. Therefore, the use of putative better to future climates adapted provenances is to see critically.","[Kriebitzsch, Wolf-Ulrich] Johann Heinrich Von Thunen Inst, Inst Weltforstwirtschaft, D-21031 Hamburg, Germany; [Veste, Maik] Ctr Energietechnol Brandenburg EV, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Kriebitzsch, WU (corresponding author), Johann Heinrich Von Thunen Inst, Inst Weltforstwirtschaft, Leuschnerstr 91, D-21031 Hamburg, Germany.",ukriebitzsch@kabelmail.de,"Veste, Maik/G-1464-2012","Veste, Maik/0000-0003-2704-2588",,,,,60,8,8,1,16,JOHANN HEINRICH VON THUNEN INST-VTI,BRAUNSCHWEIG,"BUNDESALLEE 50, BRAUNSCHWEIG, 38116, GERMANY",0458-6859,2700-8711,,LANDBAUFORSCHUNG-GER,Landbauforschung-J.

The Myrtleford Floodplain Management Study was the cornerstone of the strategy to address the goal of reducing flood damage in the community. It was found that the most consequential deficiencies in the Myrtleford flood mitigation scheme decision process are related to flaws in four elements of the process: the articulation of goals; the development of appropriate knowledge support; the effectiveness of promotion; and the ability to move from invocation to application. The Alpine Shire can be used as a microcosm that can represent adaptation challenges in other communities to climate change and extreme events.

Farm infrastructure and traditional machinery have been found to be limited when addressing these issues, which include increases in flooding, diffuse pollution and the inability to access land to carry out basic farming operations. This paper reviews reactions to these issues from those tasked with addressing them in the short and long term. Drawing on theories of learning systems, it considers the nature of some of the learning that has taken place and what kinds of social infrastructure can support such learning. Implications for future learning system design are discussed.

Crop productivity is primarily determined by a combination of temperature and precipitation because temperatures have to be in the range for plant growth and precipitation has to supply crop water requirements for a given environment. The question is often asked about the changes in productivity and what we can expect in the future and we evaluated the causes for variation in historical annual statewide wheat grain yields in Oklahoma, Kansas, and North Dakota across the Great Plains of United States. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is adapted to this area and we focused on production in these states from 1950 to 2016. This analysis used a framework for annual yields using yield gaps between attainable and actual yields and found the primary cause of the variation among years were attributable to inadequate precipitation during the grain-filling period. In Oklahoma, wheat yields were reduced when April and May precipitation was limited (r(2) = 0.70), while in Kansas, May precipitation was the dominant factor (r(2) = 0.78), and in North Dakota June-July precipitation was the factor explaining yield variation (r(2) = 0.65). Temperature varied among seasons and at the statewide level did not explain a significant portion of the yield variation. The pattern of increased variation in precipitation will cause further variation in wheat production across the Great Plains. Reducing yield variation among years will require adaptation practices that increase water availability to the crop coupled with the positive impact derived from other management practices, e.g., cultivars, fertilizer management, etc.","[Hatfield, Jerry L.; Dold, Christian] ARS, Natl Lab Agr & Environm, USDA, Ames, IA USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Hatfield, JL (corresponding author), ARS, Natl Lab Agr & Environm, USDA, Ames, IA USA.",jerry.hatfield@ars.usda.gov,"Dold, Christian/AAF-1188-2021","Dold, Christian/0000-0002-6035-5597", [5030-11610-003-00D],,This manuscript is a contribution from Project 5030-11610-003-00D.,,24,28,29,2,23,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Moreover, farmers alter land management practices as a strategy to adjust to climate change and variability. However, to what extent land fragmentation and land management jointly influence the technical efficiency of barley production is unknown. In addition, it is unidentified whether technical efficiency is uniform across multiple separated plots. In this study, we adapted two stochastic frontier panel models on plot-level cross-sectional data to investigate this. The model results indicate that fragmentation influences the effect of land management practices on efficiency. The study found that efficiency was not uniform across different plots and for different farmers and showed the existence of large yield gaps. To close these gaps, policies designed to address the specific components of inefficiency need to be implemented.","[Cholo, Tesfaye C.] Ethiopian Civil Serv Univ, Dept Dev Econ, Addis Ababa 5648, Ethiopia; [Cholo, Tesfaye C.; Fleskens, Luuk] Wageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Soil Phys & Land Management Grp, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Peerlings, Jack] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Cholo, TC (corresponding author), Ethiopian Civil Serv Univ, Dept Dev Econ, Addis Ababa 5648, Ethiopia.;Cholo, TC (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Soil Phys & Land Management Grp, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",Tesfaye.Chofana@ecsu.edu.et; jack.peerlings@wur.nl; luuk.fleskens@wur.nl,"Fleskens, Luuk/B-4004-2009","Fleskens, Luuk/0000-0001-6843-0910; Cholo, Tesfaye Chofana/0000-0001-5094-4710",Netherlands Organization for International Cooperation in Higher Education (Nuffic) [NICHE/ETH/020]; Wageningen University; Research and Tilburg University,Netherlands Organization for International Cooperation in Higher Education (Nuffic); Wageningen University; Research and Tilburg University,"This research was financed by the Netherlands Organization for International Cooperation in Higher Education (Nuffic), under grant no.

This article evaluates the feasibility of double cropping, which has received relatively little consideration yet holds potential as an adaptation strategy. To assess its feasibility, growing seasons and economic profitability as calculated from crop yield and quality are considered. Accordingly, methods are developed for quantifying the determinants of crop yield and quality grade in a simultaneous equation system that directly expresses the ordered and fractional nature of grade shares. An empirical application to rice and wheat production in Japan reveals that, without any adaptation strategy, climate change will decrease revenues of both crops due to the reduction in yield and quality. Adjusting planting dates helps to avoid such negative impacts for rice but not enough for wheat in southern Japan. However, climate change provides an opportunity for another adaptation strategy-double cropping. Warmer climates enable many regions to shift from a single cropping system to a rice-wheat double cropping system by shortening the length of the wheat growing season and by delaying the optimal timing of rice planting. As a consequence, the area suitable for double cropping is nearly tripled, suggesting a strong potential to offset climate-induced production and profit losses.","[Kawasaki, Kentaro] Minist Agr Forestry & Fisheries PRIMAFF, Policy Res Inst, Tokyo, Japan",Ministry of Agriculture Forestry & Fisheries - Japan,"Kawasaki, K (corresponding author), Minist Agr Forestry & Fisheries PRIMAFF, Policy Res Inst, Tokyo, Japan.",kenkawa@affrc.go.jp,,,,,,,58,12,12,3,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

This article lays out the principles of such a strategy and then assesses an actual planning and management process focused on climate change consequences for the Broads wetland on the East coast of England. The management strategy focused on the concept of ecosystem services (stocks and flows) provided by the coastal wetland and the threats and opportunities posed to the area by sea level rise and other climate change impacts. The analysis explores the process by which an adaptive management plan has been formulated and coproduced by a combination of centralized (vertical) and stakeholder social network (horizontal) arrangements. The process values where feasible the ecosystem services under threat and prioritizes response actions. Coastal management needs a careful balance between strategic requirements imposed at a national scale and local schemes that affect regional and/or local communities and social networks. These networks aided by electronic media have allowed groups to engage more rapidly and effectively with policy proposals. However, successful deliberation is conditioned by a range of context specific factors, including the type of social networks present and their relative competitive and/or complementary characteristics. The history of consultation and dialogue between official agencies and stakeholders also plays a part in contemporary deliberation processes and the success of their outcomes. Among the issues highlighted are the multiple dimensions of nature's value; the difficulty of quantifying some ecosystem service changes, especially for cultural services; and the problem of stakeholder fatigue complicating engagement arrangements.

The basic idea is that, if the relation between weather and grape quality is known for each grape type in existing growing areas, then it is possible to predict the quality of grapes that would be produced in other locations, or in the same location with a changed climate. This permits the optimization of grape type selection for a location and also provides an indication of the value that a particular planting should produce. The relation of grape quality to the weather is provided for several well-known viticultural areas, including Burgundy, Bordeaux, Rioja, and the Piedmont.

Temperature data were collected in representative spaces within the hospital, over a two-year period. These revealed overheating in mild conditions relative to an observed 24? threshold for sleep but concealed within the customary 28? threshold marking the upper limit of acceptable conditions. The building was modelled using current climate data to predict 2010 conditions. The model was then calibrated against the observed 2010 data and used to predict the likely internal temperatures in current and 2030s. The results indicated an increase in peak temperatures. Four adaptive intervention schemes were subsequently developed: an enlightened' industry standard Passivhaus'-type option providing superinsulation, sealed glazing and heat recovery; a lower technology-based scheme promoting natural cross-ventilation by providing greater opening glazing area, opening up the plan, sunshading and additional insulation; an enhanced natural ventilation scheme glazing over the courtyards to provide supply air winter gardens, and an advanced natural ventilation option pursuing passive downdraught cooling. All four schemes were modelled using the projected current and 2030s weather data and their performance was compared. The schemes were fully costed to yield relative value for money' guidance to National Health Service Trusts. Practical application: The Heat wave Plan for England 2014 warns National Health Service (NHS) organisations of the risks to patients, particularly the very young, the elderly and the seriously ill, from extreme summer heat events.(1) The Chief Medical Officer in her introduction challenges each NHS locality to plan well in advance of hot spells, as appropriate. This paper describes the likely extent of overheating risk and a series of potential adaptation plans for a recurring NHS hospital building type. As a consequence, estates and facilities decision makers in NHS organisations and Public Health England officers charged with the mitigation of risk resulting from overheating of wards and clinical spaces will benefit directly in their necessary decision making from the findings. Policy makers in the Department of Health and policy advisors in the NHS Sustainable Development Unit and the Climate Change Committee Adaptation Sub-Committee will benefit from the evidence presented in advising the NHS and Department of Health.","[Short, C.

The main objective of this work was, therefore, to simulate the future impacts of foreseen climate change in the context of two pastoral systems in the central Italian Apennines and test different adaptation strategies to cope with these changes. The PaSim simulation model was, therefore, used for this purpose. After calibration by comparison with observed data of aboveground biomass (AGB) and leaf area index (LAI), simulations were able to produce various future outputs, such as length of growing season, AGB, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, for two time windows (i.e., 2011-2040 and 2041-2070) using 14 global climate models (GCMs) for the generation of future climate data, according to RCP (Representative Concentration Pathways) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios under business-as-usual management (BaU). As a result of increasing temperatures, the fertilizing effect of CO2, and a similar trend in water content between present and future, simulations showed a lengthening of the season (i.e., mean increase: +8.5 and 14 days under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, for the period 2011-2040, +19 and 31.5 days under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, for the period 2041-2070) and a rise in forage production (i.e., mean biomass peak increase of the two test sites under BaU: +53.7% and 62.75% for RCP4.5. and RCP8.5, respectively, in the 2011-2040 period, +115.3% and 176.9% in RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 in 2041-2070, respectively,). Subsequently, three different alternative management strategies were tested: a 20% rise in animal stocking rate (+20 GI), a 15% increase in grazing length (+15 GL), and a combination of these two management factors (+20 GI x 15 GL). Simulation results on alternative management strategies suggest that the favorable conditions for forage production could support the increase in animal stocking rate and grazing length of alternative management strategies (i.e., +20 GI, +15 GL, +20 GI x 15 GL). Under future projections, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and nitrogen oxide (N2O) emissions decreased, whereas methane (CH4) rose. The simulated GHG future changes varied in magnitude according to the different adaptation strategies tested. The development and assessment of adaptation strategies for extensive pastures of the Central Apennines provide a basis for appropriate agricultural policy and optimal land management in response to the ongoing climate change.","[Bellini, Edoardo; Argenti, Giovanni; Stagliano, Nicolina; Dibari, Camilla] Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry DAGRI, I-50144 Florence, Italy; [Martin, Raphael; Bellocchi, Gianni] Univ Clermont Auvergne, Unite Mixte Rech Ecosyst Prairial UREP, INRAE, VetAgro Sup,UREP, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Costafreda-Aumedes, Sergi; Moriondo, Marco] Italian Natl Res Council IBE CNR, Inst BioEcon, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy",,"Argenti, G (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry DAGRI, I-50144 Florence, Italy.",giovanni.argenti@unifi.it,,,,,,,106,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,FEB,2023,12,2,,,,,,,351,10.3390/land12020351,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land12020351,,,22,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,9J9NR,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000940504700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We describe an approach designed to characterize certain climate change effects on forests, and estimate the effectiveness of response options ranging from resistance to a realignment of management objectives. Field testing on a 6,300 km(2) area of conifer forest in the northwestern USA shows this decision model to be useful and cost-effective in identifying the highest sensitivities relating to vegetation management, biological diversity, water resources and forest transportation systems, and building consensus for adaptive strategies and actions.

Producers' adaptive decision making takes into account short-term seasonal factors, while seeking to preserve livelihood stability over the long term. This study identifies multiple sources of vulnerability for farmers and ranchers in southeastern Arizona, and the adaptive strategies they have adopted including the use of information such as seasonal climate forecasts (SCFs). Interviews with producers and extension agents in Pima and Cochise Counties reveal that the principal climatic risks are drought, floods and frosts, and that groundwater use remains a crucial strategy despite increasing pumping costs. Low risk tolerance and uncertainty of seasonal production and marketing conditions diminish the utility of SCFs as a decision-making tool. Instead, farmers and ranchers continue to rely on past experience and short-range forecasts, hedging each year instead of taking significant risks. By examining the role of climate information in complex production decisions, the study shows that access to information is not the principal limitation to improving decision making. Comparison to other regions reaffirms common vulnerabilities among producers and highlights research and communication needs that have global relevance.","[Coles, Ashley R.; Scott, Christopher A.] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Coles, Ashley R.; Scott, Christopher A.] Univ Arizona, Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona; University of Arizona,"Coles, AR (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",coles@email.arizona.edu,"mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020","Scott, Christopher A./0000-0002-6767-0450",Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) [SGP-HD 005]; US National Science Foundation [GEO-0642841],Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was carried out with the aid of a grant from the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) SGP-HD #005 which is supported by the US National Science Foundation (Grant GEO-0642841).

Basing the diagnosis on economic welfare theory and an empirical analysis of the current EU and member states' roles in managing disaster risk, we discuss how and where the public sector may intervene for managing climate variability and change. We restrict our analysis to financial disaster management, a domain of adaptation intervention, which is of key concern for the EU adaptation strategy.

Context specific adaptation options thus need to be identified to sustain livelihoods and agroecosystems in this region, and increase the resilience of vulnerable smallholders, and their farming systems, to undesired effects of social-ecological change. This study took a knowledge-based systems approach to explore whether and how tree-based (i.e., agroforestry) options could contribute to meeting these adaptation needs. We analysed local agroecological knowledge of smallholders from the Meknes-Tafilalet region, to (i) characterise existing farming systems at local landscape scale; (ii) identify possible niches for farm-trees within these systems; and (iii) explore locally perceived barriers to tree-based diversification. An iterative cycle of qualitative interviews, with a purposefully selected sample of 32 farmers, revealed that socio-economic constraints and agroecological conditions in the area differed markedly along a relatively short altitudinal gradient. Agroforestry practices were already integral to all farming systems. Yet, many were at risk of degradation, as water scarcity, low profitability of production systems and uncontrolled grazing constituted critical barriers to the maintenance and diversification of farm-trees. We demonstrate the discriminatory power of local knowledge, to characterise farming conditions at the local landscape scale; and unveil adoption barriers and options for tree-based diversification in northern Morocco.","[Kmoch, Laura; Palm, Matilda] Chalmers Univ Technol, Div Phys Resource Theory, Dept Space Earth & Environm, Maskingrand 2, SE-41293 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Pagella, Tim; Sinclair, Fergus] Bangor Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Sinclair, Fergus] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, POB 30677, Nairobi 00100, Kenya",Chalmers University of Technology; Bangor University; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF),"Kmoch, L (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Div Phys Resource Theory, Dept Space Earth & Environm, Maskingrand 2, SE-41293 Gothenburg, Sweden.",kmoch@chalmers.se; t.pagella@bangor.ac.uk; matilda.palm@chalmers.se; F.Sinclair@cgiar.org,"Kmoch, Laura M/I-4286-2016","Kmoch, Laura M/0000-0002-0548-1240; Pagella, Tim/0000-0001-5926-9299","AGFORWARD project, by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration [613520]","AGFORWARD project, by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration","This research was funded through the AGFORWARD project, by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration, under grant agreement number 613520.",,35,15,15,3,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2018,10,10,,,,,,,3719,10.3390/su10103719,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10103719,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GY4UB,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000448559400361,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, first the adaptation-mitigation dichotomy and definitions of adaptation and mitigation are discussed. This is followed by a comprehensive scrutiny of the perceptual overlaps and distinctions between adaptation and mitigation, which include a meta-analysis of synergies and trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation in the agriculture and forestry sectors. The analysis shows that activities greatly depend on their context, design and implementation, so actions have to be tailored to the specific conditions, as few, if any, outcomes are universal. The analysis also indicates that the forestry sector delivers more synergies and has more trade-offs when compared to agriculture, which could be because of the fact that forest areas contain significantly more carbon, but at the same time they also compete with alternative land-uses.

The looming climate change threat has increased the adverse threats to water security in different regions. However, policy solutions to water security vary in different geographical regions and at different scales (local, regional, national, etc.). Understanding the successes and challenges of different policy solutions is critical to scaling-up successful policies and addressing water security holistically. This paper aims to explore the effects of implementing policies at different scales in three different case study contexts: 1. two Counties in California in the USA, 2. the City of Cape Town in South Africa and 3. the Country of Bangladesh. These case studies highlight various implemented policies and their effectiveness in each context. We reviewed relevant research papers consisting of peer-reviewed journal articles, conference proceedings and gray literature using a content analysis approach based on keywords such as water scarcity, water shortage, climate change, policies, interventions and solutions. Based on this cross-case analysis, we present key strategies moving forward, including: reallocation of water based on different community and sector needs, the importance of stakeholders engagement and public awareness, and a need to implement both short and long-term management plans. There is no one-size fits all policy solution to water scarcity. Understanding the context, scale, and cultural environment will be a key to future water security-focused interventions and policies.","[Quandt, Amy; Ololade, Olusola O.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Geog, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [O'Shea, Bethany; Ololade, Olusola O.] Univ San Diego, Environm & Ocean Sci Dept, San Diego, CA 92110 USA; [Oke, Saheed] Cent Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Ololade, Olusola O.] Univ Free State, Ctr Environm Management, Bloemfontein, South Africa",California State University System; San Diego State University; University of San Diego; Central University of Technology; University of the Free State,"Quandt, A (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Geog, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",aquandt@sdsu.edu,"Ololade, Olusola/Y-2309-2019","Ololade, Olusola/0000-0001-7348-5422; oke, saheed/0000-0003-4200-5187",,,,,103,0,0,4,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9375,,FRONT WATER,Front.

This expectation is tied to the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) relation, stating that the maximum water vapour content in the atmosphere increases by 6-7% per degree warming. Scaling rates for the dependency of hourly precipitation extremes on near-surface (dew point) temperature derived from day-to-day variability have been found to exceed this relation (super-CC). However, both the applicability of this approach in a long-term climate change context, and the physical realism of super-CC rates have been questioned. Here, we analyse three different climate change experiments with a convection-permitting model over Western Europe: simple uniform-warming, 11-year pseudo-global warming and 11-year global climate model driven. The uniform-warming experiment results in consistent increases to the intensity of hourly rainfall extremes of approximately 11% per degree for moderate to high extremes. The other two, more realistic, experiments show smaller increases-usually at or below the CC rate-for moderate extremes, mostly resulting from significant decreases to rainfall occurrence. However, changes to the most extreme events are broadly consistent with 1.5-2 times the CC rate (10-14% per degree), as predicted from the present-day scaling rate for the highest percentiles. This result has important implications for climate adaptation.

Although adaptive facade is an emerging subject in architectural design and research, its effectiveness has been rarely addressed in terms of building performance. Thus, in this study, we investigated indoor temperature and daylight illuminance of a thermo-responsive skin actuated by shape-memory alloy (SMA). For comparative analysis in a controlled situation, two identical lab-scale (1:20) building models with kinetic louver shading were designed, representing a south-oriented living mom of 3.4 mx5.2 m. The shadings were climate-adaptively operated by a conventional electromagnetic motor (baseline) and an SMA actuator (test case), respectively, for the same time period. The mechanical characterization and simulation of SMA-bias coil spring actuation were studied, and an artificial neural networks (ANNs) model was employed for the baseline's optimal dynamic control to approximate the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard for thermal comfort (19.4-27.8 degrees C) and a minimum illuminance level of 500 lx. The study's findings indicate that SMA actuation is effective for controlling indoor daylight intensity, thereby improving overall indoor environmental conditions. Nevertheless, the climate-responsive self-shaping was not as instantaneous as the optimal kinetic control. Average performance was probabilistically different; however, a significant correlation was found in illuminance variation.","[Yi, Hwang; Kim, Yuri] Ajou Univ, Architectural Design & Technol Lab, Dept Architecture, Sch Engn, Suwon 16499, South Korea",Ajou University,"Yi, H (corresponding author), Ajou Univ, Architectural Design & Technol Lab, Dept Architecture, Sch Engn, Suwon 16499, South Korea.",hwy@ajou.ac.kr; archiyuri8043@gmail.com,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) [NRF-2018R1C1B5084299, NRF-2019R1A2C100913012]; National Research Foundation of Korea [2019R1A2C1009130, 2018R1C1B5084299] Funding Source: Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI), National Science & Technology Information Service (NTIS)",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)(National Research Foundation of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),"This research was funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), grant number NRF-2018R1C1B5084299 and NRF-2019R1A2C100913012.

Therefore, in this paper we focused on the investigation of the low- and high-flow characteristics of the karst Ljubljanica River catchment. One smaller (51 km(2)) and one larger (1135 km(2)) catchment were selected in order to investigate the projected climate change impact on the hydrological conditions. For the investigation of the hydrological situation in the future, we used a lumped conceptual hydrological model. The model was calibrated using past measured daily data. Using the calibrated model, we investigated the impact of five different climate models outputs for the moderately optimistic scenario (RCP4.5). We investigated the situation in next 30-years periods: 2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100. Several low and high-flow indices were calculated and compared. The results indicate that a summer precipitation decrease (i.e., 2011-2070) could lead to lower low-flow values for the investigated areas, which could increase the vulnerability of karst areas. Thus, additional focus should be given to water resource management in karst areas. On the other hand, mean flow could increase in the future. The same also applies for the high-flows where flood frequency analysis results indicate that a climate adaptation factor could be used for the hydrotechnical engineering design. However, differences among investigated models are large and show large variability among investigated cases.","[Sapac, Klaudija; Rusjan, Simon; Bezak, Nejc] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Civil & Geodet Engn, Jamova 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Medved, Anze] Slovenian Environm Agcy, Vojkova 1b, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Bezak, N (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Fac Civil & Geodet Engn, Jamova 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",klaudija.sapac@fgg.uni-lj.si; Anze.Medved@gov.si; simon.rusjan@fgg.uni-lj.si; nejc.bezak@fgg.uni-lj.si,"Bezak, Nejc/AFN-5317-2022; Bezak, Nejc/AAZ-3653-2021","Lebar, Klaudija/0000-0002-7779-0333","Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS) [J2-7322, P2-0180]; World Federation of Scientists (WFS)",Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS)(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia); World Federation of Scientists (WFS),"The results of the study are part of the research project J2-7322 Modelling hydrologic response of nonhomogeneous catchments, research programme P2-0180 Water Science and Technology, and Geotechnical Engineering: Tools and Methods for Process Analyses and Simulations, and Development of Technologies, and PhD grant of the first author (K.

We examine the linkage between social-ecological resilience and societal adaptation in the Middle Hills of Nepal and, based on this, discuss the prospects of this system for climate adaptation. In doing so, we also discuss the prospects of community forestry for ecosystem-based adaptation in the rural agrarian context, focussing on a few attributes of resilience: diversity, modularity, and flexibility. We find that community forestry provides multiple pathways for both reactive and anticipatory adaptation, often reinforcing community resilience. Our finding also shows that, while ecological processes in community forestry (CF) are being managed by local institutions with an explicit goal to enhance the overall resilience of the SES, the underlying social and political dynamics of CF tend to be neglected in adaptation policy and planning. This prevents local organizations from harnessing the benefits of ecological resilience to enhance their adaptive capacity. The contribution of ecological resilience to societal adaptation has been constrained by large scale social and political drivers, especially bureaucratic structures underpinning the governance of forest in Nepal. Based on these findings, we recommend that ecosystem-based adaptation is fully informed by, and takes account of, local power dynamics. For instance, aligning governance and decision-making with the needs of marginalized groups can increase the resilience and adaptive capacity of social-ecological systems.","[Sapkota, Prativa; Keenan, Rodney J.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Baldwin Spencer Bldg, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Ojha, Hemant R.] Inst Studies & Dev Worldwide IFSD, 427,Level 4,95 Pitt St,Plaza Bldg,Australia Sq, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Sapkota, P (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Baldwin Spencer Bldg, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.",prativasapkota@gmail.com; rkeenan@unimelb.edu.au,"Ojha, Hemant/C-7490-2011","Ojha, Hemant/0000-0003-2654-4092",University of Melbourne and Australia Awards,University of Melbourne and Australia Awards,This research was supported by the University of Melbourne and Australia Awards.,,60,10,10,4,23,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

The author, who won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, argues that single. policies adopted only at a global scale are unlikely to generate sufficient trust among citizens and firms so that collective action can take place in a comprehensive and transparent manner that will effectively reduce global warming. Furthermore, simply recommending a single governmental unit to solve global collective action problems is inherently weak because of free-rider problems. For example, the Carbon Development Mechanism (CDM) can be 'gamed' in ways that hike up prices of natural resources and in some cases can lead to further natural resource exploitation. Some flaws are also noticeable in the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD) program. Both the CDM and REDD are vulnerable to the free-rider problem. As an alternative, the paper proposes a polycentric approach at various levels with active oversight of local, regional, and national stakeholders. Efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions are a classic collective action problem that is best addressed at multiple scales and levels. Given the slowness and conflict involved in achieving a global solution to climate change, recognizing the potential for building a more effective way of reducing green house gas emissions at multiple levels is an important step forward. A polycentric approach has the main advantage of encouraging experimental efforts at multiple levels, leading to the development of methods for assessing the benefits and costs of particular strategies adopted in one type of ecosystem and compared to results obtained in other ecosystems. Building a strong commitment to find ways of reducing individual emissions is an important element for coping with this problem, and having others also take responsibility can be more effectively undertaken in small- to medium-scale governance units that are linked together through information networks and monitoring at all levels.

However, previous studies of the thermal environment using LCZs mainly focused on the meso- to-micro-scale or a single time, and the changes in the regional thermal environment were less considered. Thus, we selected the Xi'an urban spatial agglomeration and used remote sensing images from 2008, 2013, and 2019 to determine the spatial and temporal variations in the thermal environment for statistical analysis and contrast. The results confirmed that: (1) The proportions of low-rise types decreased significantly, and the land use for agglomerations and compacts shows an upward trend. (2) The built-up LCZs had higher land surface temperatures (LST), LCZ 10 (heavy industry) was the highest in all years. (3) The LCZs with LCZ A (dense trees), and LCZ G (water) were associated with slightly lower LSTs, and they helped to cool the city. (4) The LSTs tended to increase from natural to urban areas, before gradually decreasing with distance from the city center to rural areas. These findings may provide reference values for quantitative studies of LCZ classification maps and analyzing dynamic changes in urban surface thermal environments, thereby facilitating the UHI analysis and climate-adapted urban planning.","[Han, Bing; Luo, Zhixing; Liu, Yan; Zhang, Tengyue; Yang, Liu] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, State Key Lab Green Bldg Western China, Xian 710055, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Han, Bing; Luo, Zhixing; Liu, Yan; Zhang, Tengyue; Yang, Liu] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Architecture, Xian 710055, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an University of Architecture & Technology; Xi'an University of Architecture & Technology,"Liu, Y; Yang, L (corresponding author), Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, State Key Lab Green Bldg Western China, Xian 710055, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Liu, Y; Yang, L (corresponding author), Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Architecture, Xian 710055, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",cherrybing_2020@126.com; luozhixing@xauat.edu.cn; liuyan@xauat.edu.cn; yangliu@xauat.edu.cn,"liu, yang/HQY-7531-2023; liu, yang/HHY-8583-2022; Liu, Yan/Q-2284-2015; liu, yang/HIU-0559-2022; Liu, Yang/HNJ-6693-2023; yang, liu/GVU-8760-2022","Liu, Yan/0000-0002-3108-3721; ",,,,,60,11,11,29,45,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

If the required temperature change is within seasonal temperature changes, the transmittance change would consume low energy or be autonomous. Here, a solid-state thermoresponsive phase-changing copolymer (TPCC) film has been demonstrated, with a large transmittance modulation between room and hot temperatures (>28 degrees C). The polymer film comprises a hydrophilic poly-(hydroxyethyl acrylate) (HEA) cross-linked with a hydrophobic phase-changing poly(hexadecyl acrylate-co-tetradecyl acrylate) (HDA-TA). The TPCC was designed such that the HEA and HDA-TA moieties produce micrometer-scale phase separation, the HDA-TA moiety undergoes reversible crystalline-to-amorphous transition at 28-32 degrees C, and the refractive indices of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic phases are matched at ambient temperature but are mismatched when the temperature is above the transition. The TPCC film showed high modulations of transmittance in the visible (390-780 nm), solar (300-2500 nm), and infrared (780-2500 nm) spectrum of 68.8, 62.7, and 55.8%, respectively.

They also have the opportunity to lead and model pro-environmental behavior, yet often have large carbon budgets, partly caused by staff travel. This paper explores this topic via an institutional case study of what factors motivate the academic community to undertake plane travel and the implications this has for wielding wider societal influence in terms of pro-environmental behavior. We report on a year-long qualitative social science study of academic plane travel at the University of Adelaide, South Australia where we investigated the tension between academic requirements to travel and the institution's formal commitment to sustainability within the Campus Sustainability Plan. We found that, while many academics were worried about climate change, very few were willing to change their current practice and travel less because they are not institutionally incentivized to do so. There is a fear of not flying: plane travel is perceived as a key driver for career progression and this is an ongoing barrier to pro-environmental behavior. We conclude that institutional and political change will be required for individual change to occur and sustainable agendas to be met within academic communities.","[Nursey-Bray, Melissa; Meyer-Mclean, Bridie] Univ Adelaide, Sch Social Sci, Dept Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Palmer, Robert] Univ Adelaide, Sch Humanities, Dept Media, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Wanner, Thomas] Univ Adelaide, Sch Social Sci, Dept Anthropol & Dev Studies, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Birzer, Cris] Univ Adelaide, Sch Mech Engn, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide,"Nursey-Bray, M (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Social Sci, Dept Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",melissa.nursey-bray@adelaide.edu.au; robertpalmer2006@gmail.com; bridie.meyer-mclean@adelaide.edu.au; thomas.wanner@adelaide.edu.au; cristian.birzer@adelaide.edu.au,"Birzer, Cris/I-3955-2013","Birzer, Cristian/0000-0002-7051-9137; Meyer-McLean, Catriona Bridie/0000-0001-6478-1756; Nursey-Bray, Melissa/0000-0002-4121-5177","Green Project Fund, of the University of Adelaide - University of Adelaide","Green Project Fund, of the University of Adelaide - University of Adelaide","This research was funded by the Green Project Fund, of the University of Adelaide as part of the 2017 round.

This study assessed the marine cooling effect (MCE) on coastal cities in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region during spring, summer, and autumn. Then, the hetero-geneous effect of landscape composition, socio-economic development, and meteorological conditions on the MCE was investigated by using geographically weighted regression (GWR) models. The results show that the MCE has significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity, with the strongest marine cooling intensity (MCI) in spring (8.95-22.92 degrees C), followed by summer (0.48-15.88 degrees C) and autumn (-1.43-9.98 degrees C). The marine influence is greatest in the 5 km area near the coastline, and the cooling range is shorter in summer. Furthermore, high vegetation cover, diversity of land types, and complexity of the landscape shape contribute to the increased cooling range (MCD) and mitigation LST. Although areas with intensive and connected impervious surfaces increase the LST and obtain higher MCI, they prevent cold air from penetrating deeper inland. To be noticed, MCE is better in areas with better economic development and higher population density. These findings provide new perspectives for climate adaptation planning and design practices in urban coastal areas.","[Chen, Lisu; Qi, Qiuyu; Feng, Daolun] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Ocean Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wu, Huafeng] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Merchant Marine Coll, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Enyan] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Enyan] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, 1500 Haigang Rd, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China",Shanghai Maritime University; Shanghai Maritime University; Shanghai Maritime University; Shanghai Maritime University,"Zhu, EY (corresponding author), Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, 1500 Haigang Rd, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.",eyzhu@shmtu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Founda- tion of China;  [72104139];  [52071200];  [31801255],National Natural Science Founda- tion of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); ; ; ,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Founda- tion of China (Nos.72104139, 52071200, and 31801255) .",,34,0,0,28,28,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

This work aims to shed light on factors that help to explain the transformative behavior of small-scale fishers when faced with climate change impacts. Using primary survey data from 404 small-scale fishers across 9 communities in Galicia, NW Spain, we examined how different aspects of fishers' adaptive capacities relate to their stated decisions to engage in livelihood diversification when faced with hypothetical climate change scenarios. The results of our multinomial multilevel mixed-effect logit model show that flexibility (current income diversification level and diversity of target fishery resources) has a strong, positive relationship with livelihood diversification responses. In contrast, learning, social organization, and competing concerns played a complex role. Specifically, we found that social-ecological system knowledge, communication with different fishing groups (bridging communication), trust in institutional actors, and gender (female) were positively related to livelihood diversification when faced with climate impacts. Fishing experience, communication within fishing groups (bonding communication), and trust in other fishing groups (bridging trust) were negatively related to diversification. Our results provide new empirical evidence on the factors associated with fisher's decisions to engage in livelihood diversification when faced with climate impacts on fishery resources, lending critical insight for climate adaptation programs and policies.","[Salgueiro-Otero, Diego; Ojea, Elena] Univ Vigo, Ctr Invest Marina, Future Oceans Lab, Vigo, Spain; [Barnes, Michele L.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Re, Townsville, Qld, Australia",Universidade de Vigo; CIM UVIGO; James Cook University,"Salgueiro-Otero, D (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Ctr Invest Marina, Future Oceans Lab, Vigo, Spain.",dsalgueiro@uvigo.es,,,"European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, ERC Starting Grant [679812]; Xunta de Galicia; Conselleria de Educacion; Xunta de Galicia, Conselleria de Cultura, Educacion e Ordenacion Universitaria; Australian Research Council [DE190101583]; Australian Research Council [DE190101583] Funding Source: Australian Research Council","European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, ERC Starting Grant; Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia); Conselleria de Educacion; Xunta de Galicia, Conselleria de Cultura, Educacion e Ordenacion Universitaria(Xunta de Galicia); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","We acknowledge all of the small-scale fishers and institutional members who participated in social surveys and contributed to this study sharing their knowledge and experience.

While there is a wealth of guidance on scenario-based climate adaptation planning, this guidance typically assumes the selection and use of decadal to century-long time segments of downscaled climate model projections, rather than the creation of a customized scenario depicting a specific extreme event. We address this gap by synthesizing a variety of data sources and analytical techniques for constructing climate scenarios for stress tests that are customized to address specific end-users' needs. We then illustrate the development and application of climate scenarios with a case study that explores water sustainability under changing climate in the Truckee and Carson River basins of California and Nevada. Finally, we assess the potential advantages and disadvantages of the different data sources and analytical techniques described to provide guidance on which are best suited for an intended application based on the system of study, the stakeholders involved, and the resources available. Ultimately, this work is intended to provide the building blocks with which scientist-stakeholder teams can produce their own stress test scenarios to explore place-based weather and climate risks.","[Albano, Christine M.; McCarthy, Maureen I.] Desert Res Inst, Reno, NV 89512 USA; [McCarthy, Maureen I.] Univ Nevada, Dept Phys, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Dettinger, Michael D.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Calif Nevada Climate Applicat Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [McAfee, Stephanie A.] Univ Nevada, Dept Geog, Extens & Nevada State Climate Off, Reno, NV 89557 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); Desert Research Institute NSHE; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Albano, CM (corresponding author), Desert Res Inst, Reno, NV 89512 USA.",christine.albano@dri.edu,,"Dettinger, Michael/0000-0002-7509-7332","Science Applications for Risk Reduction (SAFRR) program in the U.S. Geological Survey's Natural Hazards Mission Area [G16AC00304, G18-00405]; National Science Foundation; U.S. Department of Agriculture [1360505/1360506]",Science Applications for Risk Reduction (SAFRR) program in the U.S. Geological Survey's Natural Hazards Mission Area; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),This material is based upon work supported by the Science Applications for Risk Reduction (SAFRR) program in the U.S. Geological Survey's Natural Hazards Mission Area under Grant Nos.

In order to limit heat transmission losses this is very useful, however, the thermal insulation is static in comparison to the dynamically changing outdoor climate. Adapting the insulation effect to the respective ambient conditions can contribute to a decrease in heating energy demands of buildings on the one hand, as well as to a reduction of overheating in summer on the other hand. In the first case, a reduced insulation of external building components is useful if there is a high outdoor temperature or high solar radiation onto the facade during the heating period. In the second case, during cool summer nights the reduced insulation leads to an emission of surplus heat from the building interior by heat transmission into the environment. In this work, various methods of switchable thermal insulation are presented and discussed. The potential capacity of switchable thermal insulation for heating as well as for a reduction of overheating in summer is investigated using simulation calculations. To this end, an idealised switchable thermal insulation was examined for which both effects could be established. The saving in heating energy is in the single digits. To evaluate the magnitude of the reduction of overheating in summer it was compared to increased night ventilation.","[Schilly, Tobias; Kornadt, Oliver] Tech Univ Kaiserslautern, Fachgebiet Bauphys Energet Gebaudeoptimierung, Paul Ehrlich Str 29, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Carrigan, Svenja] Tech Univ Kaiserslautern, Fachgebiet Bauphys Modellierung, Paul Ehrlich Str 29, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany",University of Kaiserslautern; University of Kaiserslautern,"Schilly, T (corresponding author), Tech Univ Kaiserslautern, Fachgebiet Bauphys Energet Gebaudeoptimierung, Paul Ehrlich Str 29, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany.",tobias.schilly@bauing.uni-kl.de; svenja.carrigan@bauing.uni-kl.de; oliver.kornadt@bauing.uni-kl.de,,,,,,,18,3,3,5,11,ERNST & SOHN,BERLIN,"ROTHERSTRASSE 21, BERLIN, DEUTSCHLAND 10245, GERMANY",0171-5445,1437-0980,,BAUPHYSIK,Bauphysik,FEB,2018,40,1,,,,,1,+,,10.1002/bapi.201810001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bapi.201810001,,,8,Construction & Building Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology,FV3TC,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000424490800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Including diverse disciplines in science projects enables a range of different views which often facilitate the creation of innovative solutions. Supporting multiple views and options requires a different way of worldng beyond traditional reductionist approaches to science, communication and decision-making. To embrace diversity in scientific project teams in order to tackle complex, integrated and urgent issues but to expect singular and linear pathways forward is paradoxical. Much has been written about the need for the scientific community to embrace uncertainty (e.g. Popper, Lempert & Bankes 2005; Lempert et al., 2004; Nelson, Howden & Hayman 2013; Bammer & Smithson 2008). We argue that this in itself will not suffice, and that there is also a need to embrace ambiguity in certain. situations. Thus, in this article we explore: (1) what ambiguity is, including the benefits it can offer to climate adaptation in particular, using existing approaches to ambiguity in the arts and humanities as examples (2), we discuss practical meanings of ambiguity in relation to climate change, (3) we propose possible next steps for bringing ambiguity into interdisciplinary practice, and (4) we identify some challenges and necessary preconditions to successfully and appropriately embracing ambiguity.

Here, I present an hypothesis (Endothermic Pulses Hypothesis) which argues that the evolution of the scrotum was driven by Cenozoic pulses in endothermy, that is, increases in normothermic body temperature, which occurred in Boreotheria (rodents, primates, lagomorphs, carnivores, bats, lipotyphylans and ungulates) in response to factors such as cursoriality and climate adaptation. The model argues that stabilizing selection maintained an optimum temperature for spermatogenesis and sperm storage throughout the Cenozoic at the lower plesiomorphic levels of body temperature that prevailed in ancestral mammals for at least 163million years. Evolutionary stasis may have been driven by reduced rates of germ-cell mutations at lower body temperatures. Following the extinction of the dinosaurs at the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary 65.5mya, immediate pulses in endothermy occurred associated with the dramatic radiation of the modern placental mammal orders. The fitness advantages of an optimum temperature of spermatogenesis outweighed the potential costs of testes externalization and paved the way for the evolution of the scrotum. The scrotum evolved within several hundred thousand years of the K-Pg extinction, probably associated initially with the evolution of cursoriality, and arguably facilitated mid- and late Cenozoic metabolic adaptations to factors such as climate, flight in bats and sociality in primates.","Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Lovegrove, BG (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa.",lovegrove@ukzn.ac.za,"Lovegrove, Barry G/D-1320-2009",,NRF; UKZN Research Office,NRF; UKZN Research Office,"This research was financed by NRF competitive and incentive grants, and UKZN Research Office incentive awards.

Some scholars are concerned that policy discussions on adaptation might present climate change as a more manageable problem, and therefore crowd out mitigation efforts. On the other hand, providing information on adaptation costs may sensitize citizens to these costs, thereby increasing their willingness to support mitigation. To assess these conflicting predictions, we fielded a web-based survey experiment using a sample of 2,000 US-based respondents. We presented the respondents with a hypothetical newspaper article regarding a proposed gasoline tax (a mitigation strategy) and measured the support for this proposal across different treatment groups. In the control group, the respondents were told that failure to mitigate climate change could result in a potentially catastrophic outcome, whereas in each of the treatment groups the respondents were provided with information concerning possible adaptation costs. The respondents were then asked about their willingness to support a gasoline tax. Our key finding is that the provision of information about adaptation costs leads to a small increase in the respondents' willingness to support mitigation efforts. Furthermore, we find that this effect becomes larger when the information regarding adaptation costs is made more specific.","[Greenhill, Brian] SUNY Albany, Dept Polit Sci, 135 Western Ave,Milne 212, Albany, NY 12203 USA; [Dolsak, Nives] Univ Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Prakash, Aseem] Univ Washington, Dept Polit Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Greenhill, B (corresponding author), SUNY Albany, Dept Polit Sci, 135 Western Ave,Milne 212, Albany, NY 12203 USA.",bgreenhill@albany.edu,,"Dolsak, Nives/0000-0002-8325-3155",Dartmouth College,Dartmouth College,This work was supported by Dartmouth College [Junior faculty start-up funds].,,81,8,8,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1752-4032,1752-4040,,ENVIRON COMMUN,Environ.

This reflection on island futuring and defuturing offers a critical analysis of Caribbean disaster recovery and climate adaptation based on an understanding of the disjuncture between three uneven spatio-temporal realities: (1) the decelerating islanding effects of debt, foreign aid, and austerity; (2) the accelerating mobilities of the offshore and extended operational landscapes of planetary urbanization; and (3) the durational im/mobilities of Amerindian survival, Maroon escape, and Black/Indigenous cultural endurance of alternative ontologies.","[Sheller, Mimi] Drexel Univ, Sociol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Sheller, Mimi] Drexel Univ, Ctr Mobil Res & Policy, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Drexel University; Drexel University,"Sheller, M (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",mimi.sheller@drexel.edu,"Sheller, Mimi/ABC-5466-2020; Sheller, Mimi/X-3023-2019","Sheller, Mimi/0000-0001-9097-9563",,,,,57,15,15,3,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0263-7758,1472-3433,,ENVIRON PLANN D,Environ.

The Local Climate Zone (LCZ) framework is a well-developed typomorphological classification used to capture the variation that characterises neighbourhood microclimates. However, it does not include detailed morphological parameters within neighbourhoods that have synergistic effects on microclimates. It is thus essential to develop neighbourhood typologies with detailed spatial descriptions. This study first identifies the LCZ in Amsterdam, London and Paris with the highest Land Surface Temperature (hereinafter referred to as the most heat-prone areas). Subsequently, parameters which are not covered by the LCZs were analysed, including building block's floor area ratio and shape factor, street canyon's orientation and Height-to-Width ratio, street total length, green space area, and tree cover ratio. The results show that LCZ 2-compact mid-rise areas are the most heat-prone. Employing K-means cluster analysis, four neighbourhood typologies are distinguished within the LCZ 2: mainly wide streets with N-S and E-W orientations, mainly narrow streets with N-S and E-W orien-tations, mainly narrow streets with NE-SW and NW-SE orientations, mainly wide streets with four orientations divided by 45 degrees. These generalised neighbourhood typologies can be used as the basis for design interventions aiming at climate adaptation in heat-prone urban areas.","[Wu, Yehan; Mashhoodi, Bardia; Patuano, Agnes; Lenzholzer, Sanda] Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Environm Sci, Landscape Architecture & Spatial Planning Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Wu, Yehan; Zertuche, Laura Narvaez; Acred, Andy] Foster Partners, London, England; [Wu, Yehan] Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Environm Sci, Landscape Architecture & Spatial Planning Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Wu, YH (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Environm Sci, Landscape Architecture & Spatial Planning Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",yehan.wu@wur.nl,,"Patuano, Agnes/0000-0002-1888-855X; Wu, Yehan/0000-0003-4063-7535",European Union [861119],European Union(European Commission),"This work received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie SklodowskaCurie grant agreement No 861119.

Here, we evaluate a modified version of SWAT2012 (referred to as SWAT-EC hereafter), which integrates an energy balanced soil temperature module (STM) and the CENTRUY-based soil organic matter algorithm, for simulating water quality parameters in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB), and compare it against the original SWAT2012. Model evaluation was performed for simulating streamflow, sediment, and nitrate-N (NO3-N) and total nitrogen (TN) loadings at three stations near the outlets of UMRB. The model comparison was conducted without parameter calibration in order to assess their performance under ungauged conditions. The results indicate that SWAT-EC outperformed SWAT2012 for stream flow and NO3-N and TN loading simulation on both monthly and annual scales. For sediment, SWAT-EC performed better than SWAT2012 on a monthly time step basis, but no noticeable improvement was found at the annual scale. In addition, the performance of the uncalibrated SWAT-EC was comparable to other calibrated SWAT models reported in previous publications with respect to sediment and NO3-N loadings. These findings highlight the importance of advancing process representation in physically-based models to improve model credibility, particularly in ungauged basins.","[Qi, Junyu; Zhang, Xuesong] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Zhang, Xuesong; Waldholf, Stephanie T.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Zhang, Xuesong; Waldholf, Stephanie T.] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Yang, Qichuan] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Srinivasan, R.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Srinivasan, R.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Arnold, Jeffrey G.] USDA ARS, Grassland Soil & Water Res Lab, Temple, TX 76502 USA; [Li, Jia; Cole, Jefferson] US EPA, 1200 Penn Ave,NW 6207 A, Washington, DC 20460 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Melbourne; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Zhang, XS (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.;Zhang, XS (corresponding author), Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.;Zhang, XS (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",xzhang14@umd.edu,"Qi, Junyu/AAT-5231-2020; zhang, xuesong/B-7907-2009; Zhang, Xuesong/AAR-2455-2020","Qi, Junyu/0000-0001-5316-4226; zhang, xuesong/0000-0003-4711-7751; ","National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NNH13ZDA001N, NNX17AE66G, 18-CMS18-0052]; United States Department of Agriculture [2017-67003-26485, 2017-67003-26484]; National Science Foundation [1639327]; United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service - Conservation Effects Assessment Project (NRCS-CEAP)",National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); United States Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service - Conservation Effects Assessment Project (NRCS-CEAP),"The funding support for this project was provided by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NNH13ZDA001N, NNX17AE66G and 18-CMS18-0052), and United States Department of Agriculture (2017-67003-26485 and 2017-67003-26484), and National Science Foundation (1639327).

With episodes of extreme climate becoming increasingly frequent, buffering crop production against these stresses is a critical aspect of climate adaptation. In India, where grain production and diets are closely linked, national food supply is sensitive to the effect of climate variability on monsoon grain production. Here we quantitatively examine the historical (1966-2011) relationship between interannual variations in temperature and rainfall and rainfed yield variability for five monsoon crops-rice and four alternative grains (finger millet, maize, pearl millet, and sorghum). Compared to rice, we find that alternative grains are significantly less sensitive to climate variation and generally experience smaller declines in yield under climate extremes. However, maximizing harvested area allocations to coarse grains (i.e. holding maize production constant) reduced grain production by 12.0 Mtonnes (-17.2%) under drought conditions and 12.8 Mtonnes (-18.0%) during non-drought years (non-drought). Increasing the harvested area allocated to all alternative grains (i.e. including maize) can enhance production by +39.6% (drought) and by +37.0% (non-drought). These alternative grains therefore offer promise for reducing variations in Indian grain production in response to climate shocks, but avoiding grain production shortfalls from increased alternative grains will require yield improvements that do not compromise their superior climate resilience.","[Davis, Kyle Frankel] Univ Delaware, Dept Geog, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Davis, Kyle Frankel] Univ Delaware, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Davis, Kyle Frankel] Columbia Univ, Data Sci Inst, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Chhatre, Ashwini] Indian Sch Business, Hyderabad, Telangana, India; [Rao, Narasimha D.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Rao, Narasimha D.] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria; [Singh, Deepti] Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Vancouver, WA 99164 USA; [DeFries, Ruth] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Delaware; University of Delaware; Columbia University; Indian School of Business (ISB); Yale University; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Washington State University; Columbia University,"Davis, KF (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Geog, Newark, DE 19716 USA.;Davis, KF (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Newark, DE 19716 USA.;Davis, KF (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Data Sci Inst, New York, NY 10025 USA.",kd2620@columbia.edu,"Davis, Kyle/AEI-8432-2022","Davis, Kyle/0000-0003-4504-1407; Chhatre, Ashwini/0000-0002-5374-7867; Rao, Narasimha/0000-0003-1888-5292",Nature Conservancy's NatureNet Science Fellows program; Columbia University's Data Science Institute Fellows program; European Research Council [637462],Nature Conservancy's NatureNet Science Fellows program; Columbia University's Data Science Institute Fellows program; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),KFD was supported by The Nature Conservancy's NatureNet Science Fellows program and Columbia University's Data Science Institute Fellows program.

Accurate perceptions of climate variability and change can help farmers take effective measures to protect their livelihoods against threats from local environmental change; conversely, understanding how farmers perceive threats from climate change (or not) can help policy-makers anticipate the diversity of strategies and behaviors that will ultimately shape the vulnerability of agriculture in the coming decades. Nevertheless, perceptions of climatic variability and change are influenced by far more than direct experience with and observations of weather and climate; thus, farmers' perceptions may not always accurately reflect observed climatic trends. We analyzed Mexican maize farmers' perceptions of change in drought frequency as a proxy for their perceptions of climate variability and change. Through statistical analyses of survey data collected from 1092 maize-producing households in Sinaloa, Chiapas, and the state of Mexico, we identified factors associated with the perception of change in drought frequency. Results showed that indigenous identity and receipt of credits or loans were the variables that most strongly influenced, either positively or negatively, perceptions of change in drought frequency. These results suggest that climate adaptation policies will need to go beyond focusing on agronomic options to consider the social and institutional contexts of farmers' decision-making as important influences on their risk perception and adaptation strategies.","[Rodriguez, Natalia; Eakin, Hallie] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Dewes, Candida de Freitas] Univ Colorado Boulder, CIRES, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Dewes, Candida de Freitas] NOAA ESRL, Phys Sci Div, Boulder, CO 80305 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Rodriguez, N (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",narodri2@asu.edu,,"Eakin, Hallie/0000-0001-8253-1320; DEWES, CANDIDA/0000-0003-1882-3710",National Science Foundation [0826871]; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This paper is derived from data collected under the National Science Foundation Grant No. 0826871 and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship to N.

With increasing threats from climate change, it is essential that the effectiveness of such measures is evaluated and limitations are addressed. The State of Odisha in Eastern India had witnessed nearly 10years of such capacity building for cyclone management when it was hit by the severe cyclone Phailin in 2013. The public response to the evacuation order was overwhelming. In some areas, as many as 95% of the residents evacuated, and they were aware of the precautions to be taken before a storm strikes whereas some other areas showed as low as 33% evacuation and least interest in training and capacity building programs and maintenance of critical infrastructure like cyclone shelters. Analyzing evacuation responses with logistic regression, social economic issues like unemployment, prevalence of theft, and no provision for the evacuation of livestock to safety explained the evacuation failure significantly. In the future, such extreme events are predicted to hit coastal areas with more intensity due to climate change, and this necessitates that governments address such socio-economic problems along with cyclone adaptation programs to make disaster management more effective.","[Das, Saudamini] Inst Econ Growth, Delhi, India; [Das, Saudamini] Natl Bank Agr & Rural Dev, Dept Econ Anal & Res, Mumbai, India",,"Das, S (corresponding author), Inst Econ Growth, Delhi, India.;Das, S (corresponding author), Natl Bank Agr & Rural Dev, Dept Econ Anal & Res, Mumbai, India.",sdas_28@yahoo.co.in,"Das, Saudamini/R-6956-2019","das, saudamini/0000-0002-4070-8447",Government of Odisha,Government of Odisha,This study was undertaken under the Government Of India-United Nations Development Programme project Enhancing Institutional and Community Resilience to Disaster and Climate Change and financial help from the Government of Odisha is sincerely acknowledged.

This article builds on urban climate governance research and organizational change theory to focus on how city planners' partnerships with boundary organizations influence adaptation planning. At the root of effective urban climate governance is the integration of science and policy. Boundary organizations offer a governance approach that disseminates knowledge, builds capacity, and engages more participants in the adaptation planning process. However, little is known about how these partnerships foster adaptation at the local scale. Using a case study in Metro Vancouver, this study investigated how boundary organizations can better influence municipal adaptation action. The results of this study demonstrated that boundary organizations were perceived as more influential when they were credible, legitimate, and salient as well as when they provided action-oriented support. Ultimately, this paper contributes to the literature by illustrating how boundary organizations operate at the sub-regional scale to foster adaptation and proposing tangible practices to improve the effectiveness of partnerships.","[Graham, Alexandra; Mitchell, Carrie L.] Univ Waterloo, Sch Planning, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Graham, A (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Sch Planning, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",a29graha@uwaterloo.ca; carrie.mitchell@uwaterloo.ca,,,International Development Research Centre; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,International Development Research Centre; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"This paper was prepared with the financial support of the International Development Research Centre and Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council funded project, Coastal Cities at Risk (CCaR): Building Adaptive Capacity for Managing Climate Change in Coastal Megacities.

However, the current mitigation agenda has not yet produced the carbon emission reductions needed implying that some level of adaptation will be required. For buildings this is likely to mean either drastic changes to architecture, occupant behaviour or the increased use of artificial cooling to maintain thermal comfort in the future. The capital cost of sustainable buildings is often perceived to be higher than for conventional buildings and there is little incentive to employ sustainable building adaptations over air-conditioning type solutions, making future reductions in carbon emissions unlikely. In this paper we investigate contributing factors to worker productivity in an attempt to justify the perceived cost of sustainable adaptations. Then as a proof of concept we estimate the potential savings that could be achieved by applying two simple adaptations to an office building to produce a more comfortable environment. It is hoped that this consideration of loss of productivity and its causes will aid not only in the choice of useful adaptation decisions, but also a consideration of payback periods will help persuade building commissioners of their value and overcome the perceptions about sustainable buildings.

Using a policy sciences approach, the objective was to identify factors that influence existing vulnerabilities and that might consequently act as barriers to effective adaptation. To do this, a particular focus was placed on identifying the underlying values embedded in social and decision processes and their role in shaping preferred adaptation outcomes. Analyses of social processes suggest that many threats, including the effects climate change, compete for the resources, strategy, and direction of local tourism management bodies. Many complex and interacting factors define the vulnerability and adaptive capacity of the shire's tourism sector to the challenges of global change, including local socioeconomic issues as well as exposure to external factors of macroscale. These issues represent more immediate concerns than future climate change scenarios, revealing an approximation of the common interest in working toward adaptation and sustainability.","[Roman, Carolina E.; Lynch, Amanda H.] Monash Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Dominey-Howes, Dale] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Monash University; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Roman, CE (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",carolina.e.roman@gmail.com,"Adler, Carolina E/B-7823-2012; Adler, Carolina/P-6132-2019; Lynch, Amanda/B-4278-2011","Adler, Carolina E/0000-0002-8787-2797; Adler, Carolina/0000-0002-8787-2797; Dominey-Howes, Dale/0000-0003-2677-2837; Lynch, Amanda/0000-0003-2990-1016",Alpine Shire in northeast Victoria; Australian Research Council [FF0348550]; Monash University through the Monash Graduate Research School; Sustainable Tourism Cooperative Research Centre; Australian Commonwealth Government; Australian Research Council [FF0348550] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Alpine Shire in northeast Victoria; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Monash University through the Monash Graduate Research School; Sustainable Tourism Cooperative Research Centre; Australian Commonwealth Government(Australian Government); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This research would not be possible without the participation, support, and interest of the people of the Alpine Shire in northeast Victoria.

If the effects of future extreme weather events or climate shifts are not addressed, energy systems will be highly vulnerable to extreme weather events or shifts in weather patterns, such as changes in precipitation. Because of the deep uncertainties involved in climate projections and response strategies, any strategy implementation should perform adequately regardless of which scenario actually materialises. In this paper, we analyse the effects of drought and heat wave in the French nuclear energy sector using the Strategy Robustness Visualisation Method. The key feature of the method is the modelling of uncertainty of the quantitative indicators by (min, max) values plotted on radar plots such that each strategy option's performance can be visually inspected for robustness. The method can be utilised as a module of its own in different uncertainty management approaches. Based on the case study, the presented adaptation strategies Maintaining industrial production and final demand and Smart grid infrastructure were more robust than the No planned or automatic adaptation.","[Hanski, Jyri; Rosqvist, Tony] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland Ltd, Tekniikankatu 1, Tampere 33101, Finland; [Crawford-Brown, Douglas] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge Ctr Climate Change Mitigat Res, Cambridge, England",VTT Technical Research Center Finland; University of Cambridge,"Hanski, J (corresponding author), VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland Ltd, Tekniikankatu 1, Tampere 33101, Finland.",jyri.hanski@vtt.fi; tony.rosqvist@vtt.fi; djc77@cam.ac.uk,,"Hanski, Jyri/0000-0002-8146-280X",EU Framework 7 project Tool-support policy-development for regional adaptation (ToPDAd),EU Framework 7 project Tool-support policy-development for regional adaptation (ToPDAd),The research presented in this paper was funded by the EU Framework 7 project Tool-support policy-development for regional adaptation (ToPDAd) (www.topdad.eu).,,34,5,5,2,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Infrequent inspections, inadequate data on foundation depths, and the lack of consideration of hydrologic and climate parameters often result in un-certainties within current scour risk assessments. This paper presents an approach for assessing the risk progression of local scour in peak flow conditions that consider uncertainties associated with location, downscaling of climate predictions, and hydrologic, hydraulic and scour prediction models. A rational scour risk rating based on warning time to failure is introduced that can provide a useful addition to the existing bridge condition indexes. The case study on a set of railway bridges in Southeast England shows that climate change could accelerate the scour risk progression, even in the low-emission scenario.

The influence of global warming and geoclimatic variations on zoonotic disease epidemiology is evident by alterations in the host, vector, and pathogen dynamics and their interactions. The objective of this article is to review the current literature on the observed impacts of climate change on zoonoses and discuss future trends. We evaluated several climate models to assess the projections of various zoonoses driven by the predicted climate variations. Many climate projections revealed potential geographical expansion and the severity of vector-borne, waterborne, foodborne, rodent-borne, and airborne zoonoses. However, there are still some knowledge gaps, and further research needs to be conducted to fully understand the magnitude and consequences of some of these changes. Certainly, by understanding the impact of climate change on zoonosis emergence and distribution, we could better plan for climate mitigation and climate adaptation strategies.","[Rupasinghe, Ruwini; Martinez-Lopez, Beatriz] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Med & Epidemiol, Ctr Anim Dis Modeling & Surveillance CADMS, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Chomel, Bruno B.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Vet Med, Dept Populat Hlth & Reprod, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Rupasinghe, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Med & Epidemiol, Ctr Anim Dis Modeling & Surveillance CADMS, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rkrupasinghe@ucdavis.edu; beamartinezlopez@ucdavis.edu,,"Rupasinghe, Ruwini/0000-0001-9470-2668","Fellowship of the Graduate Group in Epidemiology, University of California, Davis, USA; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Formula Funds project [CALV-AH-392]","Fellowship of the Graduate Group in Epidemiology, University of California, Davis, USA; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Formula Funds project","This work was supported by the Fellowship of the Graduate Group in Epidemiology, University of California, Davis, USA and USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Formula Funds project CALV-AH-392.",,132,10,10,23,77,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0001-706X,1873-6254,,ACTA TROP,Acta Trop.,FEB,2022,226,,,,,,,,106225,10.1016/j.actatropica.2021.106225,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2021.106225,,NOV 2021,13,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,XC4RQ,34758355,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000722002200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate scenarios were obtained after statistical downscaling by applying a quantile-perturbation approach on ensembles of 170 global and 20 regional climate models. Flood impact analysis was based on the 1D-2D dual drainage modelling approach. Extreme daily rainfall intensities are projected to increase by 5 to 20%, whereas wet day frequency will decrease with some uncertainty. Larger changes in rainfall intensities were obtained for the finer scale climate models. Under the 95% upper limit scenario for future rainfall intensities (2071-2100), a 20-year intensity in the current climate would become a 2-year storm in the future and the flood extent is projected to increase by 30-40%. This indicates a need for climate adaptation measures and sustainable future urban planning.","[Le, T. T.

It is crucial to understand the risks, vulnerabilities, and opportunities that climate change brings to this region. We analyzed the increasing tension between agribusiness models and smallholder models, the risks, opportunities, and main adaptation measures that can be adopted in the agricultural sector of the South American countries facing climate change. This study is a review of adaptation actions in the agricultural sector for the different regions of South America. Vulnerability exists, firstly, because rural populations are exposed in many of the countries, often with high rates of poverty and low rates of socioeconomic development. Concerning the adaptation measures already taken, there are numerous cases of interventions by national, provincial, and municipal states for planned measures. Farmers are very active in adopting autonomous measures. Many adaptation measures show co-benefits with climate change mitigation or the prevention of land degradation and desertification, but other adaptation measures do not go in this direction. In the forthcoming times, the region's rich natural resources are going to be subjected to strong market pressures and climate change threats. It is key to generate strategies for the care of these resources for their permanence for future generations.","[Taboada, Miguel Angel; Costantini, Alejandro Oscar] Inst Nacl Tecnol Agr, Inst Suelos Hurlingham, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Taboada, Miguel Angel] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Costantini, Alejandro Oscar; Busto, Mercedes] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Bonatti, Michelle; Sieber, Stefan] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res, Muncheberg, Germany",Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF),"Costantini, AO (corresponding author), Inst Nacl Tecnol Agr, Inst Suelos Hurlingham, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Costantini, AO (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",costantini.alejandro@inta.gob.ar,,"Taboada, Miguel Angel/0000-0003-3952-0583; Costantini, Alejandro/0000-0001-6355-5271; BONATTI, MICHELLE/0000-0001-8511-5365",,,,,90,2,2,1,4,SOC BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO,VICOSA,"C P 231, BR-36571-000 VICOSA, MG, BRAZIL",0100-0683,,,REV BRAS CIENC SOLO,Rev.

Exemplified on Austrian cropland, we aim at (i) quantifying climate change impacts on agricultural vulnerability which is approximated by the indicators crop yields and gross margins, (ii) developing robust crop production portfolios for adaptation, and (iii) analyzing the effect of agricultural policies and risk aversion on the choice of crop production portfolios. We have employed a spatially explicit, integrated framework to assess agricultural vulnerability and adaptation. It combines a statistical climate change model for Austria and the period 2010-2040, a crop rotation model, the bio-physical process model EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate), and a portfolio optimization model. We find that under climate change, crop production portfolios include higher shares of intensive crop management practices, increasing average crop yields by 2-15% and expected gross margins by 3-18%, respectively. The results depend on the choice of adaptation measures and on the level of risk aversion and vary by region. In the semi-arid eastern parts of Austria, average dry matter crop yields are lower but gross margins are higher than in western Austria due to bio-physical and agronomic heterogeneities. An abolishment of decoupled farm payments and a threefold increase in agri-environmental premiums would reduce nitrogen inputs by 23-33%, but also crop yields and gross margins by 18-37%, on average. From a policy perspective, a twofold increase in agri-environmental premiums could effectively reduce the trade-offs between crop production and environmental impacts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on data collected from 810 randomly selected households in central Ethiopia, this study investigates the impacts of adaptation strategies on the sustainability of the livelihoods of farmers. The economic, social, and environmental outcomes were integrated to construct the Livelihood Sustainability Index. The endogenous switching regression model, which accounts for unobserved heterogeneity and possible endogeneity, was used to examine the impact of using adaptation strategies. With a mean score of 41, the farmers had lower levels of livelihood sustainability. Farmers switching crop type, diversifying crops, planting improved seeds, engaging in land management activities, and using irrigation had a higher livelihood sustainability index compared to the counterfactual case in which they did not use them. Non-farm employment and migration significantly increased livelihood sustainability for the using households. However, had these factors been used by the non-users, it would have resulted in reduced livelihood sustainability. Farmers using more than four adaptation strategies had more sustainable livelihoods than using fewer strategies. The findings affirm that adaptation contributes to livelihood improvement. However, since the farmers are far from achieving a higher level of sustainable livelihoods, policies shall focus on maximizing the returns to be obtained from using adaptation strategies. This includes improving access to ecosystem services through environmental protection measures, increasing production efficiency through improved access to and proper utilization of farm inputs, expanding irrigation facilities, creating decent employment opportunities, and enhancing farmers' skills through entrepreneurial training.","[Etana, Dula] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Etana, Dula; Buning, Tjard de Cock] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Athena Inst Res, De Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Snelder, Denyse J.

Building on these past accomplishments, this paper argues that geographers must continue their interdisciplinary endeavors and engage now-even more so than before-in practice-relevant research, particularly in the area of the human dimensions of climate change. The paper points to a range of critical research needs in the area of vulnerability and adaptation, particularly focused on the US, and argues for rapid capacity building and far-reaching changes in the incentive structure for geographers to engage in practice-relevant research and in interaction with policy-makers and resource managers at the science-practice interface.

It analyses how interventions address these challenges to identify how to reduce vulnerability to floods. Data are examined from disaster database entries from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, Emergency Database, and scientific articles and other literature. Results show that development interventions and OAR are not keeping pace with the vulnerability of the population affected by flood events, as humanitarian interventions seem to dominate. The article highlights the significant role played by international humanitarian agencies, the challenges posed by inadequate preparedness and weak collaboration, the exclusion of the vulnerable from active participation, and the frequent declaration of states of emergency. If these challenges are not addressed, climate change will exacerbate humanitarian crises and competition for humanitarian aid resources. Changes in social factors that do not require finance can improve flood disaster risk management. Accessing funding for adaptation for use in DRR can further alleviate the severity of flood impacts, but development interventions remain crucial for addressing the underlying causes of vulnerability.","German Dev Inst DIE, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE),"Speranza, CI (corresponding author), German Dev Inst DIE, Tulpenfeld 6, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",Ifejika.speranza@die-gdi.de,"Speranza, Chinwe Ifejika/B-2408-2012","Speranza, Chinwe Ifejika/0000-0003-1927-7635",,,,,44,6,6,1,42,EARTHSCAN,LONDON,"14A ST CROSS STREET, LONDON, EC1N 8XA, ENGLAND",1756-5529,,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Yet today, climate science approaches are increasingly accounting for the roles of diverse social perceptions, experiences, cultural norms, and worldviews. In support of this shift, we developed a research program on Hawai'i Island that utilizes knowledge coproduction to integrate the diverse worldviews of natural and cultural resource managers, policy professionals, and researchers within actionable science products. Through their work, local field managers regularly experience discrete land and waterscapes. Additionally, in highly interconnected rural communities, such as Hawai'i Island, managers often participate in the social norms and values of communities that utilize these ecosystems. Such local manager networks offer powerful frameworks within which to co-develop and implement actionable science. We interviewed a diverse set of local managers with the aim of incorporating their perspectives into the development of a collaborative climate change research agenda that builds upon existing professional networks utilized by managers and scientists while developing new research products. We report our manager needs assessment, the development process of our climate change program, our interactive forums, and our ongoing research products. Our needs assessment showed that the managers' primary source of information were other professional colleagues, and our in-person forums informed us that local managers are very interested in interacting with a wider range of networks to build upon their management capacities. Our initial programmatic progress suggests that co-created research products and in-person forums strengthen the capacities of local managers to adapt to change.","[Laursen, Scott; Genz, Ayesha S.; Nash, Sarah A.

However, high uncertainties remain in the projections of sea level rise from different climate scenarios and sea level rise prediction models. Quantification and integration of these uncertainties are essential to better inform coastal planning and decision making for climate adaptation, critical for infrastructure sustainability and resilience. This paper advances knowledge cross-cutting structural engineering and climate change in the face of multihazards via a novel framework termed the Probabilistic Sea Level Rise Hazard Analysis (PSLRHA). This study uses the current generation of models and protocols from the climate science research community to better portray the future climate and project sea level rise. The aggregation process produces the probability of exceeding a specific sea level rise threshold at a certain location and facilitates the creation of the global sea level rise hazard map. The relative importance of each climate scenario and sea level rise contributing models are demonstrated via the deaggregation process. We identify the models that have most contribution to extreme sea level rise thresholds, with large fluctuations in the high thresholds among ice sheet models. Finally, we show the practical implementation of PSLRHA results via compound flooding analyses using Houston as an illustrative example.","[Luo, Xiao; Lin, Ting] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Lin, T (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",xiao.luo@ttu.edu; ting.lin@ttu.edu,,,"Edward E.

However, these declines only translate as impacts when cultivar winter chilling requirements are not satisfied. This study presents a methodology to evaluate future impacts of declining winter chill through a cultivarspecific approach which is useful for growers, industry and policy-makers to develop adaptation strategies. A risk based system was applied to represent the likelihood of meeting cultivar chilling requirements using low, medium, medium-high and high risk ratings based on percentiles. This was combined with climate projection uncertainty graphically at 16 Australian growing districts historically (1981-2010) and for 2030, 2050 and 2090. The results demonstrated that impacts and likely adaptation options differed between cultivars, some recording limited risk at all sites out to 2090 ('Nonpareil' almond) whilst others recorded greater risk both historically and into the future ('Chandler' walnut). Notably, risk differed across sites and with the future time period. These results highlight which cultivars are susceptible to low winter chill conditions, where this risk does and does not manifest and the different time horizons at which the risk will materialise across Australia's main growing districts. Using this approach, changes in winter chill conditions are presented in a useable form which allows for appropriate climate adaptation strategies to be developed, securing the industries into the future.","[Darbyshire, R.; Goodwin, I.] Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Measham, P.] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Goodwin, I.] Victorian Govt, Dept Econ Dev Jobs Transport & Resources, Tatura, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Tasmania,"Darbyshire, R (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",rebecca.darbyshire@dpi.nsw.gov.au,"Darbyshire, Rebecca/AAI-3945-2021",", Penelope/0000-0001-8037-6144; Darbyshire, Rebecca/0000-0003-4712-8514",Australian Department of Agriculture and Water Resources,Australian Department of Agriculture and Water Resources(Australian Government),"The authors thank Mark O'Connell, Jennifer Whitney and Walnuts Australia for advice on cultivar selection and Australian growing regions.

Over five decades it has worked to increase food abundance, reduce hunger and poverty rates, and lower the geographical footprint of agriculture in lower- and middle-income countries. CGIAR's first formalised research program on climate change was set up in 2009. Here we report on an analysis of 300 outcomes generated over the lifetime of this program, which ran until 2021. Outcomes were characterised in relation to the climate objective, geography, thematic scope, and contribution to global goals. More than half of the outcomes analysed were related to policies for agriculture development under climate change. Twenty-six percent of outcomes related to climate, information and financial services, and 22 percent were related to organisational programming. Most outcomes analysed were at an early stage of maturity, focusing on design and planning stages of policies, strategies, and investments. Fewer than five percent of outcomes had evidence of impact at scale. Outcomes were facilitated by a wide network of partners and contributed to more than ten Sustainable Development Goals. The results of the analysis show the value of outcome-oriented science in being able to harness diversity, balance strategy with opportunism, plan flexibly, work across multiple vulnerability contexts, and allocate resources towards outcomes. These elements have played a significant role in fostering change across contexts, in adjusting research to emerging needs and context changes, in creating conditions for spillovers, and in ensuring global relevance. To transform the food system, the research for development agenda needs to be bolder. It will require more outcomes of various types, achieved through diverse partnerships, spanning a diversity of geographies, vulnerable contexts, and priorities. Significant and intentional investments in strengthening monitoring, evaluation, reporting and learning capacity will be required to further realize the potential for outcome-oriented research.","[Nowak, Andreea C.

To date, most research has focused on qualitative statements and broad findings or on location-specific case studies. This study details a quantitative, engineering-based analysis of the impacts of specific climate stressors on types of road infrastructure. The results are designed to be utilized by transportation planners to understand the vulnerability, risk, and adaptation options for creating a climate-resilient road network by providing specific design changes and fiscal cost analysis. The current study aims to build on previous work and addresses several gaps: use of all climate models approved by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to provide guidance despite uncertainty, provision of results similar to existing risk and vulnerability analyses to allow for implementation in existing planning processes, and introduction of a methodology requiring only routinely available road network information to allow for replicability across the United States. California is used as an illustrative case study that helps identify the existing vulnerabilities of the road network to climate change and the fiscal savings possible through pro-active adaptation strategies. Findings show that for the higher-impact model (95th percentile), California could save $1.9 billion between 2015 and 2050 by proactive adaptation.

These assessments are derived from a rich vulnerability literature and are helpful in modeling complex ecosystem interactions, yet their policy relevance and impact has been limited. We argue this is due to structural-functional logic underpinning these assessments in which governance is treated as a procedural black box and policy-making as an undifferentiated and unproblematic output of a political system responding to input changes and/or system prerequisites. Like an earlier generation of systems or cybernetic thinking about political processes, the focus in these assessments on macro system-level variables and relationships fails to account for the multi-level or polycentric nature of governance and the possibility of policy processes resulting in the nonperformance of critical tasks.","[Wellstead, Adam M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Howlett, Michael] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Howlett, Michael] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Rayner, Jeremy] Univ Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada",Michigan Technological University; Simon Fraser University; National University of Singapore; University of Saskatchewan,"Wellstead, AM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",,"Howlett, Michael P/I-4947-2015; Howlett, Michael/W-7544-2019","Howlett, Michael/0000-0003-4689-740X",,,,,113,38,38,3,30,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

In this study, we modified winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) sowing date employing the root zone water quality model (RZWQM2) on the semiarid Loess Plateau of China, and mainly aimed to (i) investigate how the adapted sowing date affects winter wheat production and water use efficiency (WUE) under global warming and (ii) explore the optimal sowing date under different precipitation patterns (i.e., wet, medium, and dry years). Results showed that the RZWQM2 model could efficiently simulate crop development, water movement, and final crop yields on the Loess Plateau. The properly delayed sowing date efficiently maintained wheat yield, reduced evapotranspiration, increased WUE, and minimized the decreasing rate of wheat yield and WUE under global warming from the 1950s. To maintain a high level of yield under global warming, the wheat sowing date could be delayed by 10 to 20 d in the wet and medium years, and by 20 to 25 d in the dry year compared with the current sowing date. Therefore, a delayed sowing date could be used on the Loess Plateau and even similar semiarid environments in the world to cope with climate change for farmers.","[Ding, D.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate climate-adaptive building envelopes and related biomimetic solutions, providing a critical review of the state of the art. Various examples of the adaptive envelopes are analysed and compared with examples of biomimetic envelopes. This paper demonstrates the potential of the broad database of nature to provide solutions that can be implemented in architecture to achieve design solutions that are sustainable, energy efficient, and able to adapt to environmental changes. After an initial critical review of nature's adaptation strategies, a methodological approach has been proposed: the bio-adaptive model (bio-AM). Starting from the definition of the context and the relative abiotic factors, the bio-AM identifies the essential phases to transfer the functions of plants to building technologies, using adaptive materials capable of self-activation in response to environmental factors, thus potentially emulating the adaptation of plants in technological solutions for the future of sustainable buildings.","[Sommese, Francesco; Ausiello, Gigliola] Fed II Univ Naples, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, DICEA, Naples, Italy; [Badarnah, Lidia] Univ West England, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Bristol, Gloucestershire, England",University of West England,"Sommese, F (corresponding author), Fed II Univ Naples, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, DICEA, Naples, Italy.",francesco.sommese@unina.it,,"Sommese, Francesco/0000-0002-9720-7520",,,,,85,0,0,11,11,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

Mitigation behaviors can reduce the rate of climate change, while adaptation behaviors can reduce the vulnerability to climate change. In this study, we focused on the factors influencing farmers' behavioral preferences and explored the differences in their behaviors in response to climate change in different types of regions. A structural equation model was constructed to describe the relationship between trust, risk perception, psychological distance and risk severity, and farmer behaviors. The results indicate that the factors affecting climate adaptation vary greatly in different regions. In agricultural areas, risk salience, psychological distance and mitigation behaviors had an important influence on farmer adaptation behavior, while risk perception only affects farmers' mitigation behaviors. Trust can not only predict farmers' adaptability, but also explain farmers' choice of mitigation behaviors. For farmers in farming and pastoral areas, belief, risk severity level and trust have positive driving effects on both adaptation and mitigation behaviors. The findings provide suggestions for the development of public policy and risk management approaches to deal with climate change, which could encourage active behavior among farmers.","[Peng, Yufang] Henan Univ Econ & Law, HuangHe Business Sch, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China; [Xu, Zhengzhong] China Natl Acad Governance, Econ Teaching & Res Dept, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wei, Pengbang] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Management, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Linyi] Henan Univ Econ & Law, Accounting Inst, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China",Henan University of Economics & Law; Zhengzhou University; Henan University of Economics & Law,"Wei, PB (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Management, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China.",p_wei@zzu.edu.cn,,,Philosophy and Social Science Planning Youth Project of Henan Province,Philosophy and Social Science Planning Youth Project of Henan Province,The authors sincerely acknowledge the financial support from the Philosophy and Social Science Planning Youth Project of Henan Province (Research on the influence mechanism of factor flow on county economic development in Henan Province under the new development pattern).,,34,0,0,14,14,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-6463,,FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ,Front.

The selection of sample households was through a multistage sampling technique, and the population was all households in the sorghum-producing regions of Central, Northern, and Northwestern Tanzania. Before data collection, enumerators took part in a 1-week training workshop and later collected data from 822 respondents using a structured questionnaire. The main results from the study show that the adoption of improved sorghum seeds has a positive effect on both household and women dietary diversity scores. Access to quality food groups improves nutritional status, food security adequacy, and general welfare of small-scale farmers in developing countries.

This study adapted the social, economic and demographic indicator approach. The data used were obtained from a survey of 186 randomly sampled farm households and direct field measurements of 738 farm plots belonging to the same sampled farm households. Information from the literature, expert judgement and principal component analysis were useful for computing and analysing the SoVI. The variables were normalized, weighted and subsequently recombined to determine the index of the three locations towards climate change. Although the SoVI to climate change was highest (0.77) for the upper part of the catchment, the mid- and lower parts of the catchment show a high SoVI of 0.72 each. The overall SoVI for the catchment is 0.73. The study re-emphasizes the high vulnerability level of dry areas to climate change. Moreover, it shows there is variability at micro-scale. There is a need to put appropriate measures to address the vulnerability of households to climate change in the semi-arid areas of West Africa. Factors aggravating dry land's vulnerability towards climate change should be prevented with implementable policies. Furthermore, it is important to identify conditions that have made some areas less vulnerable to climate change, and then, we can work out the possibility of adapting such to the vulnerable places.","[Badmos, Biola K.] Kwara State Univ, Dept Environm Management & Toxicol, Malete, Nigeria; [Adenle, Ademola A.] Fed Univ Technol, Dept Geog, Minna, Nigeria; [Agodzo, Sampson K.] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Agr Engn, Kumasi, Ghana; [Villamor, Grace B.] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res, Dept Ecol & Nat Resources Management, Bonn, Germany; [Asare-Kyei, Daniel K.] United Nations Univ, EHS, UN Campus, Bonn, Germany; [Amadou, Laouali M.] AGRHTMET Reg Ctr, Niamey, Niger; [Odai, Samuel N.] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Kumasi, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Bonn; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Badmos, BK (corresponding author), Kwara State Univ, Dept Environm Management & Toxicol, Malete, Nigeria.",biolakz@yahoo.com; ade.adenle@gmail.com; skagodzo7@usa.net; gracev@uni-bonn.de; daniel@busylab.com; laouali@gmail.com; snodai@yahoo.com,"A.A, Adenle/R-4687-2018","A.A, Adenle/0000-0002-4887-7333",West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use,West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use,Funding was provided by West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use.,,38,3,3,3,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

The latter describes a negotiated and contested fitness terrain. Individual and corporate actors simultaneously adapt to and actively manipulate this terrain by using alternative collective action frames, mobilizing resources, and creating or exploiting political opportunities in order to legitimate or delegitimate social structures and their associated technologies at various levels of analysis. Adaptation is conceptualized as occurring through homeostatic, developmental, rational choice, and populational mechanisms. Vulnerability results from the adaptive failure of social structures sustaining individual and collective health, livelihood, and well-being. This framework combines organizational sociologists' insights into structure-environment interaction; constructionists' attention to agency, language, culture, and values; and political ecologists' concerns with power, inequality, and processes of marginalization.","SUNY Coll Geneseo, Dept Sociol, Geneseo, NY 14454 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Geneseo,"McLaughlin, P (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Geneseo, Dept Sociol, 121D Sturges Hall,1 Coll Circle, Geneseo, NY 14454 USA.",mclaughp@geneseo.edu,,,,,,,151,37,37,3,66,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1086-0266,1552-7417,,ORGAN ENVIRON,Organ.

Under accelerating climate change, snowmaking is projected to increase at most destinations - some substantially. Snowmaking has come under increasing criticism in recent years and branded by some scholars and ski industry observers as unsustainable and maladaptive as a climate change response. Using data on snowmaking from across the diverse US ski market, this study assesses snowmaking against multiple established criteria that define maladaptation. The analysis demonstrates that snowmaking is highly place-context specific, varying at the individual operator and regional market scales, and represents a continuum from successful (and sustainable) adaptation to maladaptation. Regions of the US where snowmaking is most likely to be maladaptive are identified (water insecure and carbon intense electricity grids). The framework highlights the importance of scale and a tourism system perspective when assessing (mal)adaptation and provides decision-makers with a tool to evaluate the compatibility of snowmaking with climate action plans at the destination and regional scale.","[Scott, Daniel; Knowles, Natalie] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Scott, Daniel] Univ Surrey, Sch Hospitality & Tourism Management, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Steiger, Robert] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Publ Finance, Innsbruck, Austria",University of Waterloo; University of Surrey; University of Innsbruck,"Scott, D (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",daniel.scott@uwaterloo.ca,"; Steiger, Robert/N-5724-2014","Scott, Daniel/0000-0001-7825-9301; Steiger, Robert/0000-0002-1752-6450; Knowles, Natalie/0000-0002-5605-5954",,,,,116,3,3,15,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-9582,1747-7646,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

To reveal its climate adaptation, the effect of temperature on life traits of Aenasius arizonensis, a parasitoid of Phenacoccus solenopsis was studied. The results showed that both the highest parasitism and emergence rates of A. arizonensis were observed at 31 degrees C. The parasitism and emergence rates of the parasitoid significantly increased with the increasing temperature from 19 degrees C to 31 degrees C, but dropped when the temperature exceeded 31 degrees C. Female ratio reached a higher value at 19, 22, 31, 34 or 37 degrees C. The minimum threshold temperatures for female and male parasitoids were 11.5 and 11.2 degrees C, respectively. The effective accumulative temperatures for the parasitoid to develop from eggs to both female and male adults were 222.2 day-degrees. Since the highest parasitism rate, the highest emergence rate and a higher female ratio were observed at 31 degrees C, we conclude that the optimum temperature for mass rearing of A. arizonensis is 31 degrees C in the insectary based on the results of our study.","[He, Lang-Fen; Li, Pan; Xu, Zai-Fu] South China Agr Univ, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, Dept Entomol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Zhong-Shi] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, State Key Lab Biol Plant Dis & Insect Pests, Beijing, Peoples R China","South China Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Plant Protection, CAAS","Xu, ZF (corresponding author), South China Agr Univ, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, Dept Entomol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Zhou, ZS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, State Key Lab Biol Plant Dis & Insect Pests, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhongshizhou@yahoo.com; xuzaifu@scau.edu.cn,,,,,,,39,4,6,3,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-0874,1366-5863,,INT J PEST MANAGE,Int.

The traditional approach attempts to manage the flooding system with the use of predictive/optimisation methods. These use the 'most likely' or average future projection to identify a singular optimal adaptation strategy. Because the planning and risk management in this method is often decoupled from the dynamics and uncertainty of the flooding system, this is a rather risky approach. This paper argues that responsible climate adaptation requires an alternative approach that attempts to assess and manage the resiliency of the flooding system for long-term future change. The aim of such an approach is to keep the system within a configuration of states that gives at least acceptable functioning despite the occurrence of possible changes. The paper proposes an options planning and assessment process for managing the resiliency of the flooding system to climate change. This process explicitly acknowledges the uncertainty in future climate conditions by introducing and implementing flexibility (real options) into the designed components of the flooding system.","[Gersonius, B.; Ashley, R.; Zevenbergen, C.] UNESCO, IHE Inst Water Educ, Dept Water Engn, Delft, Netherlands; [Pathirana, A.] UNESCO, IHE Inst Water Educ, Dept Urban Water & Sanitat, Delft, Netherlands; [Zevenbergen, C.] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Hydraul Engn, Delft, Netherlands",IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; Delft University of Technology,"Gersonius, B (corresponding author), UNESCO, IHE Inst Water Educ, Dept Water Engn, Delft, Netherlands.",,"Pathirana, Assela/B-5189-2011; Gersonius, Berry/C-7724-2009","Pathirana, Assela/0000-0003-0907-1764; Gersonius, Berry/0000-0002-2681-9474",EU,EU(European Commission),The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the EU's Interreg IVB project MARE.,,24,15,16,0,24,THOMAS TELFORD PUBLISHING,LONDON,"THOMAS TELFORD HOUSE, 1 HERON QUAY, LONDON E14 4JD, ENGLAND",1478-4629,,,P I CIVIL ENG-ENG SU,Proc.

From 1995 to 2000, a decrease in the vegetation density and an increase in ground-level thermodynamic activity has been documented by multiple data sources in Northwest China, including meteorological, reanalysis from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) satellite remote sensing data. As the ground-level thermodynamic activity increases, humid air from the surrounding regions converge toward desert (and semi-desert) regions, causing areas with high vegetation cover to become gradually more arid. Furthermore, land surface changes in Northwest China are responsible for a decrease in total cloud cover, a decline in the fraction of low and middle clouds, an increase in high cloud cover (due to thermodynamic activity) and other regional climatic adaptations. It is proposed that, beginning in 1995, these cloud cover changes contributed to a greenhouse effect, leading to the rapid air temperature increases and other regional climate impacts that have been observed over Northwest China.","Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; Western Washington Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Huxley Coll Environm, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Western Washington University","Xu, XK (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",xkxu@mail.iap.ac.cn,,,,,,,29,5,5,0,14,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",0256-1530,1861-9533,,ADV ATMOS SCI,Adv.

To this end, this study proposes an integrated hydrological-water transfer and supply (HWTS) framework including a coupled SWAT-Bi level programming model to investigate future optimal water supply between different sectors with regard to transaction right. Indeed, Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is applied to project the rate of streamflow under Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios of RCP2.6&RCP4.5 and future periods (2020-2040 & 204(Abbas et al. 2015)2060). In addition, a case study of the Hamoun wetland in southeastern of Iran is considered for calibration and validation of real historical data (2000-2016) and then simulation of future streamflow patterns (2020-2060). Next, simulated streamflow data extracted by SWAT is entered as the input of market based bi-level optimization model so that upper-level manager seeks optimization of the available water level in the reservoirs while the lower-level decision maker tries to minimize the economic loss due to water shortage between different sectors regarding transaction right. However, after solving the model with the Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IBPSO) technique, the final results show that although not much economic profit will be made, but considering specific management strategies such as demand reduction schemes to conserve more water, the imbalance between supply and demand can be significantly improved.","[He, Yuan; Mahdi, Moudi; Huang, Ping] Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Coll Management, Chengdu 610103, Peoples R China; [He, Yuan] State Stat Bur, Key Lab Stat Informat Technol & Data Min, Chengdu 610103, Peoples R China; [Xie, Guangming] Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Coll Logist, Chengdu 610103, Peoples R China; [Galoie, Majid] Imam Khomeini Int Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Qazvin, Iran; [Shafi, Mohsin] Leshan Normal Univ, Ctr Trans Himalaya Studies, Leshan, Peoples R China",Chengdu University of Information Technology; Chengdu University of Information Technology; Imam Khomeini International University; Leshan Normal University,"Mahdi, M (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Coll Management, Chengdu 610103, Peoples R China.",moudi@cuit.edu.cn,"Moudi, Mahdi/GNP-2919-2022; Galoie, Majid/AAR-4349-2021; Shafi, Mohsin/F-8191-2015","Moudi, Mahdi/0000-0001-5129-203X; Galoie, Majid/0000-0002-9175-3002; Shafi, Mohsin/0000-0002-4517-6099",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71672013]; Key Laboratory of Statistical information technology and data mining [SDL201901]; Statistical Science Research Program of Sichuan Provincial Statistics Bureau [2019SC15]; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [20YJC630165],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Laboratory of Statistical information technology and data mining; Statistical Science Research Program of Sichuan Provincial Statistics Bureau; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences,"This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71672013), Key Laboratory of Statistical information technology and data mining (Grant No. SDL201901), Statistical Science Research Program of Sichuan Provincial Statistics Bureau (Grant No: 2019SC15), MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (Grant No. 20YJC630165).",,58,2,2,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0277-5212,1943-6246,,WETLANDS,Wetlands,FEB 28,2021,41,3,,,,,,,36,10.1007/s13157-021-01434-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-021-01434-5,,,18,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QQ4IM,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000624486900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Farmers face substantial challenges from climate change, from changes in the average temperatures and the precipitation regime to an increased variability of weather conditions and the frequency of extreme events. Such changes can have dramatic consequences for many types of agricultural production systems such as grassland -based livestock systems for which climate change influences the seasonality and productivity of fodder production. We present a participatory design method called FARMORE (FARM Oriented REdesign) that allows farmers to design and evaluate adaptations of livestock systems to future climatic conditions. It explicitly considers three climate features in the design and evaluation processes: climate change, climate variability and the limited predictability of weather. FARMORE consists of a sequence of three workshops for which a pre-existing game -like platform was adapted. Various yearround forage production and animal feeding requirements must be assembled by participants with a computerized support system. In workshop 1, farmers aim to produce a configuration that satisfies an average future weather scenario. They refine or revise the previous configuration by considering a sample of the between -year variability of weather in workshop 2. In workshop 3, they explicitly take the limited predictability of weather into account. We present the practical aspects of the method based on four case studies involving twelve farmers from Aveyron (France), and illustrate it through an in-depth description of one of these case studies with three dairy farmers. The case studies shows and discusses how workshop sequencing (1) supports a design process that progressively accommodates complexity of real management contexts by enlarging considerations of climate change to climate variability and low weather predictability, and (2) increases the credibility and salience of the design method. Further enhancements of the method are outlined, especially the selection of pertinent weather scenarios. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper assesses how smallholder oilseed farmers' adaptive capacity in Limpopo is enhanced through various institutional support schemes within the context of increased climate extremes and their need to sustain production. Six hundred farmers were interviewed across three agro-ecological zones of Limpopo Province. Results show that some of the institutions' current operations aimed at providing support to farmers do not adequately satisfy the farmers' needs. A strong linear relationship was observed between the number of support types received by farmers and grain yield, suggesting that farmers who received more support types were relatively less vulnerable. Educational support is ranked as the most significant contributor to enhancing farmers' adaptive capacity. This emphasizes the need for proper linkages between farmers' choices of adaptive methods and the types of support needed. Therefore, this study provided a diagnosis of the gaps in essential types of institutional support needed to increase farmers' resilience, which can be used as an input to beef up the policy and positioning to improve the adaptive capacity.","[Kephe, Priscilla Ntuchu; Petja, Brilliant Mareme] Univ Limpopo, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Polokwane, South Africa; [Kephe, Priscilla Ntuchu; Petja, Brilliant Mareme; Ayisi, Kingsley Kwabena] Univ Limpopo, Risk & Vulnerabil Sci Ctr, Sovenga, South Africa; [Petja, Brilliant Mareme] Water Res Commiss, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Limpopo; University of Limpopo,"Kephe, PN (corresponding author), Univ Limpopo, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Polokwane, South Africa.;Kephe, PN (corresponding author), Univ Limpopo, Risk & Vulnerabil Sci Ctr, Sovenga, South Africa.",kprissy@gmail.com,,"Petja, Brilliant/0000-0003-3151-0137",University of Limpopo (UL); VLIR-UOS collaboration,University of Limpopo (UL); VLIR-UOS collaboration,This work was funded through the University of Limpopo (UL) and the VLIR-UOS collaboration.,,42,0,0,1,1,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",2272-6977,2257-6614,,OCL OILS FAT CROP LI,OCL Oilseed.Fats Crops Lipids,FEB 19,2021,28,,,,,,,,14,10.1051/ocl/2021004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/ocl/2021004,,,9,Agronomy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Agriculture,QJ3XQ,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000619626100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Nature Futures Framework (NFF) was developed by the Task Force on scenarios and models of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services as a heuristic approach that appreciates the diverse positive values of nature and its contribution to people. In this overview, we convene a group of experts to discuss the NFF as a tool to inform management in social-ecological systems facing climate change. We focus on three illustrative case studies from the global south across a range of climate change impacts at different ecological levels. We find that the NFF can facilitate the identification of trade-offs between alternative climate adaptation pathways based on different perspectives on the values of nature they emphasize. However, we also identify challenges in adopting the NFF, including how outputs can be translated into modeling frameworks. We conclude that using the NFF to unpack diverse management options under climate change is useful, but that there are still gaps where more work needs to be done to make it fully operational. A key conclusion is that a range of multiple perspectives of people's values on nature could result in adaptive decision-making and policy that is resilient in responding to climate change impacts in social-ecological systems.","[Palacios-Abrantes, Juliano] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Limnol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Palacios-Abrantes, Juliano; Cheung, William W.

Although the equifinality of hydrological modeling has been discussed for a long time, its influence on the hydrological analysis of climate change has not been studied enough to provide a definite idea about the relative contributions of uncertainty contained in both multiple general circulation models (GCMs) and multi-parameter ensembles to hydrological projections. This study demonstrated that the impact of multi-GCM ensemble uncertainty on direct runoff projections for headwater watersheds could be an order of magnitude larger than that of multi-parameter ensemble uncertainty. The finding suggests that the selection of appropriate GCMs should be much more emphasized than that of a parameter set among behavioral ones. When projecting soil moisture and groundwater, on the other hand, the hydrological modeling equifinality was more influential than the multi-GCM ensemble uncertainty. Overall, the uncertainty of GCM projections was dominant for relatively rapid hydrological components while the uncertainty of hydrological model parameterization was more significant for slow components. In addition, uncertainty in hydrological projections was much more closely associated with uncertainty in the ensemble projections of precipitation than temperature, indicating a need to pay closer attention to precipitation data for improved modeling reliability. Uncertainty in hydrological component ensemble projections showed unique responses to uncertainty in the precipitation and temperature ensembles.","[Her, Younggu] Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Ctr Trop Res & Educ, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Homestead, FL 33031 USA; [Yoo, Seung-Hwan] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Rural & Biosyst Engn, Gwangju, South Korea; [Cho, Jaepil] APEC Climate Ctr, Climate Serv & Res Dept, Busan, South Korea; [Hwang, Syewoon] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Inst Agr & Life Sci, Dept Agr Engn, Jinju, South Korea; [Jeong, Jaehak] Texas A&M Univ, Texas A&M AgriLife Res, Temple, TX USA; [Seong, Chounghyun] St Johns River Water Management Dist, Bur Watershed Management & Modeling, Palatka, FL USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Chonnam National University; Gyeongsang National University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M AgriLife Research,"Yoo, SH (corresponding author), Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Rural & Biosyst Engn, Gwangju, South Korea.",yoosh15@jnu.ac.kr,"Jeong, Jaehak/AAQ-6940-2021; HER, YOUNGGU/Q-7975-2018","HER, YOUNGGU/0000-0003-3700-5115","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project [FLA-TRC-005551]","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project","This work was supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project FLA-TRC-005551.",,104,90,91,8,47,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,MAR 21,2019,9,,,,,,,,4974,10.1038/s41598-019-41334-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41334-7,,,22,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,HP7RH,30899064,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000461885900014,View Full Record in Web of Science

This raises the question of how, if at all, locally bound tourism stakeholders, such as accommodation suppliers, consider climate change risks and if they already invest in adaptation measures. The nature of the concepts of adaptation and adaptation finance, with a lack of universally accepted metrics for its monitoring, allow a theoretical inquiry if mobilized finance can be labeled being climate finance. Against this background, this study investigates to what extent accommodation owner-managers do recognize climate change in their strategic investment decisions. A survey with 112 respondents and in-depth interviews with 16 interviewees were conducted on Koh Tao, Thailand. The findings reveal that most businesses (private sector) already invest in adaptation, whereas it appears to be a rather reactive (unconscious) form of adaptation. This shows that the private sector has an interest in addressing business risks, including climate change. The accommodation suppliers themself, however, likely do not bother how actions that reduce their business risks in regard to natural hazards are being labeled. The findings also show that adaptation behavior of accommodation suppliers appears to be influenced by power dynamics on Koh Tao. There is a concentration of power among a few families. This can hinder a sustainable and climate risk-informed development pathway and investment decisions of individual accommodation businesses.","[Hess, Janto S.] Univ Coll London UCL, Inst Risk & Disaster Reduct IRDR, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Hess, JS (corresponding author), Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",janto84@icloud.com,,"Hess, Janto S./0000-0002-9823-9890",IRDR at UCL,IRDR at UCL,"The study was developed as part of my PhD research for which I received a partial scholarship from my institute, IRDR at UCL.",,70,1,1,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1022-5706,2158-1762,,ASIAN GEOGR,Asian Geogr.,JAN 2,2023,40,1,,,,,81,98,,10.1080/10225706.2021.1981956,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10225706.2021.1981956,,OCT 2021,18,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,8C7JZ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000703428800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our findings confirm that innovation has a positive impact on firms' productivity (technical efficiency). While agricultural firms located in Germany and Sweden are more efficient compared to those in southern countries, all the European countries considered are distant from the maximum production frontier.

In this viewpoint, the themes of human mobility, adaptation and climate change are explored from a political ecology perspective. A framework of political ecology of human mobility in relation to climate change is applied to the context of Vietnam's Mekong Delta (MKD). The Vietnamese government, popular media and academic studies often present the MKD in dystopian ways in which there is sometimes no more place for poor and landless farmers as a direct result of climate change. In 2019 and 2020, the MKD faced one of its most severe droughts in recent history largely tied to upstream hydropower development. In this viewpoint article, we contend that future studies can no longer establish a direct and causal relationship between climate change and human mobility, especially in light of these recent events. The underlying drivers as well as the broader context, which are shaped by political economy, market structures and forces, power relations, government policy, geopolitics, and transboundary water issues deserve a more prominent role in the analysis of human mobility patterns in the MKD and beyond.","[Bayrak, Mucahid Mustafa] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Geog, Rm 922,Cin Bldg,162,Sect 1,Heping E Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Marks, Danny] Dublin City Univ, Sch Law & Govt, Dublin, Ireland; [Hauser, Leon T.] Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Leiden, Netherlands",National Taiwan Normal University; Dublin City University; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Bayrak, MM (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Geog, Rm 922,Cin Bldg,162,Sect 1,Heping E Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",mmbayrak@ntnu.edu.tw,,"Marks, Danny/0000-0003-0833-880X; Hauser, Leon T./0000-0003-1408-9942","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST 110-2636-H-003-007]; Utrecht University's Water, Climate and Future Deltas Hub","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Utrecht University's Water, Climate and Future Deltas Hub","This study was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (MOST 110-2636-H-003-007) and a seed grant from Utrecht University's Water, Climate and Future Deltas Hub (entitled: 'Human costs of shrinking deltas: Adaptation pathways of vulnerable groups to sea-level rise in three Asian deltas').",,83,1,1,6,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

These smallholder systems are characterized by high greenhouse gas emission rates, but could play a role in their mitigation. Although the impact of climate change is projected to be large, many uncertainties persist, in particular with respect to impacts on livestock and grazing components, whole-farm dynamics and heterogeneous farm populations. We summarize the current understanding on impacts and vulnerability and highlight key knowledge gaps for the separate system components and the mixed farming systems as a whole. Numerous adaptation and mitigation options exist for crop-livestock systems. We provide an overview by distinguishing risk management, diversification and sustainable intensification strategies, and by focusing on the contribution to the three pillars of climate-smart agriculture. Despite the potential solutions, smallholders face major constraints at various scales, including small farm sizes, the lack of response to the proposed measures and the multi-functionality of the livestock herd. Major institutional barriers include poor access to markets and relevant knowledge, land tenure insecurity and the common property status of most grazing resources. These limit the adoption potential and hence the potential impact on resilience and mitigation. In order to effectively inform decision-making, we therefore call for integrated, system-oriented impact assessments and a realistic consideration of the adoption constraints in smallholder systems. Building on agricultural system model development, integrated impact assessments and scenario analyses can inform the co-design and implementation of adaptation and mitigation strategies.F.","[Descheemaeker, Katrien; Falconnier, Gatien N.; Giller, Ken E.] Wageningen Univ, Plant Prod Syst, POB 430, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Oosting, Simon J.] Wageningen Univ, Anim Prod Syst, POB 338, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Tui, Sabine Homann-Kee] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, POB 776, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe; [Masikati, Patricia] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Lusaka, Zambia",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT),"Descheemaeker, K (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Plant Prod Syst, POB 430, Wageningen, Netherlands.",katrien.descheemaeker@wur.nl; simon.oosting@wur.nl; shomannkeetui@gmail.com; pmasikatihlanguyo@gmail.com; gatien.falconnier@wur.nl; ken.giller@wur.nl,"descheemaeker, katrien/P-6605-2014; Falconnier, Gatien/AAA-3403-2022; Giller, Ken E/K-2799-2012; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","descheemaeker, katrien/0000-0003-0184-2034; Giller, Ken E/0000-0002-5998-4652; Oosting, Simon/0000-0003-2080-1879",DFID; McKnight Foundation,DFID; McKnight Foundation,"We would like to thank the support of DFID for the AgMIP Regional Integrated Assessment project in southern Africa, and of the McKnight Foundation for the project on Pathways to agro-ecological intensification in southern Mali.",,77,66,66,7,105,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

However, in many circumstances, this does not adequately address the potential risks to supply security for towns, industry, irrigators, and the environment. This is because the Australian climate varies markedly due to natural cycles that operate over periods of several years to several decades. There is also serious concern about how anthropogenic climate change may exacerbate drought risk in the future. In this paper, the frequency and severity of droughts are analyzed during a range of climate states'' (e.g., different phases of the Pacific, Indian, and/or Southern Oceans) to demonstrate that drought risk varies markedly over interannual through to multidecadal time scales. Importantly, by accounting for climate variability and change on multitemporal scales (e.g., interdecadal, multidecadal, and the palaeo scale), it is demonstrated that the risk of failure of current drought management practices may be better assessed and more robust climate adaptation responses developed.","[Verdon-Kidd, Danielle C.; Kiem, Anthony S.] Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Environm & Climate Change Res Grp, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Verdon-Kidd, DC (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Environm & Climate Change Res Grp, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",danielle.verdon@newcastle.edu.au,"VERDON-KIDD, DANIELLE CHERIE/G-7688-2013; Kiem, Anthony/D-9307-2013","VERDON-KIDD, DANIELLE CHERIE/0000-0001-5334-4251; Kiem, Anthony/0000-0002-3994-6958",,,,,51,58,58,1,18,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

These communities rely heavily, but not solely, on natural resources and agriculture for their livelihoods. Household data were collected for a representative sample of 138 households in the Nariva and Caroni communities. This included data on household adaptive capacity including socio-demographics, livelihood strategies, and social networks; exposure to climate change and climate-induced extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts; and sensitivity factors related to local access to services and infrastructure. Using ordinary least-squares regression analyses, we investigate influences of adaptive capacity to climate change on household food security in these 'at-risk' communities. The results suggest that household socio-demographics and livelihood strategies are strongly related to food security and that the level of food security provided by those two factors is reduced in the face of climate variability and disaster. Social network capacity of households does not have a statistically significant influence in the context studied. This is a valuable insight for community and national planners and policy makers both in this and in similar country circumstances that must consider food security in light of climate variability and related weather-induced impacts.","[Shah, Kalim U.] Indiana Univ Northwest, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Gary, IN 46408 USA; [Dulal, Hari Bansha] Abt Associates Inc, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Northwest; ABT Associates,"Shah, KU (corresponding author), Indiana Univ Northwest, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 3400 Broadway, Gary, IN 46408 USA.",kalim_shah@hotmail.com; hari_dulal@abtassoc.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Shah, Kalim/0000-0002-3318-0170",,,,,60,20,21,0,55,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Green space planning aims to transform cities towards urban sustainability and resilience. In a longitudinal study, representatives from eleven European municipalities that had previously been interviewed in 2014 were re-interviewed in 2020-2021 on changes in urban greening and related practices. The interviewees reported mainly advancements in dealing with ecological issues, such as new plans, strategies, regulations or funding programmes for climate adaptation or biodiversity support, as well as some progress in co-governance with non-governmental stakeholders. Promising developments include breaking professional silos by creating new units that can better deal with complex urban issues. In a few cases, high-level local politicians induced profound changes. These changes stimulated the development of new planning and governance cultures, resulting in more co-creation of urban green spaces. However, from a transformation studies perspective, incremental strategies dominate, and even when municipal representatives are aware that substantive changes are needed, they often lack the means to act. For more radical system change, significant extra efforts are needed.","[Hansen, Rieke] Hsch Geisenheim, Geisenheim, Germany; [Buizer, Marleen] Wageningen Univ, Strateg Commun Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Buijs, Arjen; van der Jagt, Alexander; Havik, Gilles] Wageningen Univ, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Pauleit, Stephan; Erlwein, Sabrina; Rolf, Werner] Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany; [Mattijssen, Thomas] Wageningen Univ, Econ Res, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Fors, Hanna] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Landscape Architecture Planning & Management, Alnarp Campus, Lomma, Sweden; [van der Jagt, Alexander] Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Energy Geosci Infrastruct & Soc, Urban Inst, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Kabisch, Nadja] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Phys Geog & Landscape Ecol, Hannover, Germany; [Kabisch, Nadja] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Berlin, Germany; [Cook, Mandy; Ambrose-Oji, Bianca] Forest Res Northern Res Stn, Roslin, Midlothian, Scotland; [Delshammar, Tim] VA SYD, Malmo, Sweden; [Vierikko, Kati; Nieminen, Hanna] Finnish Environm Ctr, Helsinki, Finland; [Langemeyer, Johannes; Texereau, Camille Soson] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, Barcelona, Spain; [Luz, Ana Catarina] ISEG Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, Lisbon, Portugal; [Nastran, Mojca] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Forestry & Renewable Forest Resources, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Olafsson, Anton Stahl; Moller, Maja Steen] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Sect Landscape Architecture & Planning, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Haase, Dagmar] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Leipzig, Germany; [Branquinho, Cristina] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, cE3c Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes, Lisbon, Portugal; [Branquinho, Cristina] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, CHANGE Global Change & Sustainabil Inst, Lisbon, Portugal; [Kronenberg, Jakub] Univ Lodz, Social Ecol Syst Anal Lab, Lodz, Poland; [Konijnendijk, Cecil] Nat Based Solut Inst, Barcelona, Spain; [Buijs, Arjen] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen Environm Res, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; Technical University of Munich; Wageningen University & Research; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Heriot Watt University; Leibniz University Hannover; Humboldt University of Berlin; Finnish Environment Institute; Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Ljubljana; University of Copenhagen; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; University of Lodz; Wageningen University & Research,"Hansen, R (corresponding author), Hsch Geisenheim Univ, Inst Freiraumentwicklung, DE-65366 Hessen, Germany.",rieke.hansen@hs-gm.de,"Kronenberg, Jakub/ABD-9941-2021; Rolf, Werner/AAS-2669-2020; Rolf, Werner/HDM-7973-2022; Buijs, Arjen/C-6412-2011; B.

One prominent example of this increasing focus on anticipation is the rapid growth of Forecast-based Financing (FbF), in particular within Red Cross and Red Crescent (RCRC). To evaluate how anticipatory efforts managed multiple compounding risks during the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine how 14 RCRC Societies adapted their Early Action Protocols to COVID-19. Though many National Societies successfully adapted to the onset of the additional hazard of COVID-19, we find that multi-hazard risk management can be improved by: proactively developing guidelines that enable rapid adaptation of existing plans; more flexible funding mechanisms; surge capacity to provide additional human resources; and increasing local capacity and ownership for implementation to ensure supplies, skills, and decision-making authority are available when communication or travel is restricted. These findings align with wider recommendations for improving development, humanitarian, and climate adaptation practice towards local capacity and agency. They also add urgency to broader calls for more flexible disaster financing and more practitioner-oriented investment in climate risk and multi-hazard management.","[Tozier de la Poterie, Arielle] German Red Cross, Anticipat Hub, Berlin, Germany; [Clatworthy, Yolanda] Anticipat Hub, Berlin, Germany; [Easton-Calabria, Evan] Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev, Refugee Studies Ctr, Oxford, England; [Coughlan de Perez, Erin; van Aalst, Maarten] Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Ctr, The Hague, Netherlands; [Coughlan de Perez, Erin; van Aalst, Maarten] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, New York, NY USA; [Lux, Stefanie] German Red Cross, Berlin, Germany; [van Aalst, Maarten] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, Enschede, Netherlands",University of Oxford; Columbia University; University of Twente,"de la Poterie, AT (corresponding author), DRK Generalsekretariat Team Knowledge & Innovat z, Arielle Tozier Poterie Carstennstr 58, D-12205 Berlin, Germany.",arielle.tozierdelapoterie@germanredcross.de,"van Aalst, Maarten/X-2017-2018","van Aalst, Maarten/0000-0003-0319-5627; Easton-Calabria, Evan/0000-0001-9417-181X; Coughlan de Perez, Erin/0000-0001-7645-5720",German Federal Foreign Office,German Federal Foreign Office,We gratefully acknowledge the support of German Federal Foreign Office who provided the funding backing to make this research possible.,,49,10,10,1,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

In the past decades, it became a symbol of current climate change, held up by its dramatic shrinkage in the 1980s. Despites a partial recovery in response to increased Sahelian precipitation in the 1990s, Lake Chad is still facing major threats and its contemporary variability under climate change remains highly uncertain. Here, using a new multi-satellite approach, we show that Lake Chad extent has remained stable during the last two decades, despite a slight decrease of its northern pool. Moreover, since the 2000s, groundwater, which contributes to similar to 70% of Lake Chad's annual water storage change, is increasing due to water supply provided by its two main tributaries. Our results indicate that in tandem with groundwater and tropical origin of water supply, over the last two decades, Lake Chad is not shrinking and recovers seasonally its surface water extent and volume. This study provides a robust regional understanding of current hydrology and changes in the Lake Chad region, giving a basis for developing future climate adaptation strategies.","[Pham-Duc, Binh; Sylvestre, Florence] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRD, Coll France,INRAE,CEREGE,Europole Arbois, Aix En Provence, France; [Pham-Duc, Binh] Univ Sci & Technol Hanoi, Vietnam Acad Sci & Technol, Dept Space & Applicat, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Papa, Fabrice; Frappart, Frederic; Cretaux, Jean-Francois] Univ Toulouse, UPS, CNRS, CNES,IRD,LEGOS, Toulouse, France; [Papa, Fabrice] Univ Brasilia, Inst Geosci, Campus Univ Darcy Ribeiro, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Bouchez, Camille] Univ Rennes, Geosci Rennes, CNRS, UMR 6118, Rennes, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); INRAE; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Universite PSL; College de France; Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology (VAST); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire d'Etudes en Geophysique et oceanographie spatiales; Universidade de Brasilia; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Universite de Rennes,"Pham-Duc, B; Sylvestre, F (corresponding author), Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRD, Coll France,INRAE,CEREGE,Europole Arbois, Aix En Provence, France.;Pham-Duc, B (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol Hanoi, Vietnam Acad Sci & Technol, Dept Space & Applicat, Hanoi, Vietnam.",pham@cerege.fr; sylvestre@cerege.fr,"Bouchez, Camille/AAC-3015-2021; Papa, Fabrice/D-3695-2009","Bouchez, Camille/0000-0002-3094-6070; Papa, Fabrice/0000-0001-6305-6253; Frappart, Frederic/0000-0002-4661-8274","United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); Adelphi (Berlin); Federal Foreign Office of Germany; Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands; French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD, France); Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) through the TOSCA project; Adelphi","United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); Adelphi (Berlin); Federal Foreign Office of Germany; Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands; French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD, France); Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) through the TOSCA project; Adelphi","This study was funded by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Adelphi (Berlin), the Federal Foreign Office of Germany, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD, France), and the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) through the TOSCA project.

This raises fundamental questions concerning how governing arrangements support or constrain climate hazard management. The paper assesses existing approaches to adapting to climate hazards in Calabar metropolis in Nigeria, where flooding is a major hazard. The governance systems adopted in the context of flood adaptation and their implication for practice is further investigated, and the strategies necessary for an improved implementation of climate hazard adaptation at the local governance level examined. Data for the study is collected from a stakeholder workshop and document analysis. Despite calls for decentralized governance and prevalence of a hierarchical system, other forms of governing coexist alongside these systems in Calabar. Five key strategies which should form the basis of urban climate hazard adaptation in practice, as identified by stakeholders, are synergy of activities among stakeholders; enforcement devoid of politics and bureaucracy, capacity building and information/data availability; increased focus on international cooperation and funding; and consideration of connections between flooding and other urban processes.","[Adekola, Olalekan; Lamond, Jessica] Univ West England, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Bristol, Avon, England; [Adekola, Olalekan] York St John Univ, Dept Geog, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Adelekan, Ibidun] Univ Ibadan, Dept Geog, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Eze, Eze Bassey] Univ Calabar, Dept Geog & Reg Planning, Calabar, Nigeria",University of West England; York Saint John University; University of Ibadan; University of Calabar,"Adekola, O (corresponding author), Univ West England, Architecture & Built Environm, Fac Environm & Technol, Frenchay Campus,Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",lekan.adekola@uwe.ac.uk,"Adekola, Olalekan/AAR-7864-2021; Adelekan, Ibidun O./H-3735-2019","Adelekan, Ibidun O./0000-0002-3407-8549; Lamond, Jessica/0000-0001-8931-0192; Adekola, Olalekan/0000-0001-9747-0583",,,,,79,6,6,1,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

But, it is interesting to note that they also illustrate how a proportion of the population will survive every sequence/combination of climate change that can be envisaged. For example, if climate change brings about longer, warmer autumns in the UK, then more seeds are likely to germinate before winter, and if the subsequent winter is also warmer, shorter or both, then these seedlings will thrive into the next spring. But even if a spell of sub-zero winter temperatures kills the delicate seedlings, there will always be a few seeds that remain dormant into the winter, benefit from the cold snap and emerge the following spring.","[Gosling, Peter G.; McCartan, Shelagh A.; Peace, Andrew J.] Forestry Commiss Res Agcy, Alice Holt Lodge, Wrecclesham, Farnham GU10 4LH, Surrey, England",,"McCartan, SA (corresponding author), Forestry Commiss Res Agcy, Alice Holt Lodge, Wrecclesham, Farnham GU10 4LH, Surrey, England.",shelagh.mccartan@forestry.gsi.gov.uk,,,,,,,25,18,19,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0015-752X,1464-3626,,FORESTRY,Forestry,DEC,2009,82,5,,,,,573,582,,10.1093/forestry/cpp024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/forestry/cpp024,,,10,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,534WU,,Bronze,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000272929000008,View Full Record in Web of Science

As warnings of catastrophic damage become louder, however, the urgency to find bipartisan solutions will increase. Using a novel survey of California adults, our research assesses the current level of disagreement over adaptive measures to sea level rise between Democrats and Republicans, and asks whether there are conditions under which partisans can come to closer agreement on them. Specifically, we consider the role of personal experiences in lessening the degree of polarization on how partisans think about and prioritize climate adaptation. We find that experiencing extreme events does lessen the partisan gap in many instances, offering hope that communities can find bipartisan solutions to climate change threats.","[Cain, Bruce E.; Hui, Iris] Stanford Univ, Bill Lane Ctr Amer West, Room 172,Y2E2,473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Gerber, Elisabeth R.] Univ Michigan, Gerald R Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Stanford University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Hui, I (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Bill Lane Ctr Amer West, Room 172,Y2E2,473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",irishui@stanford.edu,,,,,,,90,2,2,1,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,NOV 1,2020,197,,,,,,,,105298,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105298,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105298,,,12,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Oceanography; Water Resources,OA1KV,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000577554400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, it aims to (1) assess the descriptive quality of the framework for adaptation planning and (2) reflect on its value in supporting method selection. The paper focuses on the research commissioned for adaptation policymaking by the Dutch Delta Programme in the Wadden region. It compares the research methods used in the Delta Programme with those suggested by the diagnostic framework. It concludes that the selection of methods in the adaptation planning process can be described quite well by the decision trees of the diagnostic framework. Deviations occurred mostly for pragmatic reasons when the selection is informed by practical limitations of the policymaking process, such as available resources, time constraints and experience of the involved experts. It is recommended to enrich the diagnostic framework with methods from adaptation practice and consult it in climate adaptation studies at an early stage.","[Werners, Saskia Elisabeth; van Loon-Steensma, Jantsje Mintsje] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Oost, Albert Peter] Deltares, Delft, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Deltares,"Werners, SE (corresponding author), Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",werners@mungo.nl; Jantsje.vanLoon@wur.nl; AlbertPeter.Oost@deltares.nl,,"werners, saskia/0000-0002-1705-4318; van Loon-Steensma, Jantsje M./0000-0002-6181-7829",European Commission; Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs,"European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs(Ministry of Economic Affairs, Netherlands)","Work on this paper has been kindly supported by a grant from the European Commission through the research project MEDIATION and from the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs.

WaterSim is a hierarchical model that represents supply from surface and groundwater sources and demand from residential, commercial, and agricultural user sectors, incorporating the rules that govern reservoirs, aquifer use, and land-use change. In this paper we: (1) report on the imperative for exploratory modeling in water-resource management, given the deep uncertainties of climate change, (2) describe the geographic context for the Phoenix case study, (3) outline the objectives and structure of WaterSim, (4) report on testing the model with sensitivity analyses and history matching, (5) demonstrate the application of the model through a series of simulation experiments, and (6) discuss the model's use for scenario planning and climate adaptation. Simulation results show there are significant challenges to Phoenix's water sustainability from climate change and rapid growth. Policies to address these challenges require difficult tradeoffs among lifestyles, groundwater sustainability, the pace of growth, and what is considered to be an appropriate level of risk of climate-induced shortage.","[Gober, Patricia] Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Decis Ctr Desert City, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Gober, Patricia] Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Wentz, Elizabeth A.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Tschudi, Michael K.] Arizona State Univ, Decis Ctr Desert City, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Kirkwood, Craig W.] Arizona State Univ, Dept Supply Chain Management, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Gober, P (corresponding author), Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Decis Ctr Desert City, POB 878209, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",gober@asu.edu; wentz@asu.edu; tim.lant@asu.edu; tschudi@asu.edu; Craig.Kirkwood@asu.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0951366] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,26,46,47,0,32,PION LTD,LONDON,"207 BRONDESBURY PARK, LONDON NW2 5JN, ENGLAND",0265-8135,,,ENVIRON PLANN B,Environ.

The climate-induced risk assessment of coastal areas subject to flooding plays an essential role in planning effective measures for adaptation plans. However, in European legislation, as well as in the regional plans adopted by the member states, there is no clear reference to urban settlement, as this concept is variable and difficult to categorise from the policy perspective. This lack of knowledge makes it complicated to implement efficient adaptation plans. This research examines the presence of the issue in Portugal's coastal settlements, the European coastal area most vulnerable to rising sea levels, using the case of seashore streets as the most exposed waterfront public urban areas. Using the morphometric classification of the urban fabric, we analyse the relationship between urban typology and legislative macro-areas aimed at providing integrated adaptation plans. The study suggests that there is only a minimal relationship between the proposed classification and the geographical zones currently identified in coastal planning policies. Such incongruence suggests the need for change, as the policy should be able to provide a response plan tailored to the specificities of urban areas.","[Dal Cin, Francesca] Univ Lisbon, Lisbon Sch Architecture, CIAUD Res Ctr Architecture Urbanism & Design, Formaurbis LAB, P-1349063 Lisbon, Portugal; [Fleischmann, Martin] Univ Liverpool, Dept Geog & Planning, Geog Data Sci Lab, Liverpool L69 7ZT, Merseyside, England; [Fleischmann, Martin; Romice, Ombretta] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Architecture, Urban Design Studies Unit, Glasgow G1 1XJ, Lanark, Scotland; [Costa, Joao Pedro] Univ Lisbon, Lisbon Sch Architecture, CIAUD Res Ctr Architecture Urbanism & Design, URBinLAB, P-1349063 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; University of Liverpool; University of Strathclyde; Universidade de Lisboa,"Dal Cin, F (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Lisbon Sch Architecture, CIAUD Res Ctr Architecture Urbanism & Design, Formaurbis LAB, P-1349063 Lisbon, Portugal.;Fleischmann, M (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Dept Geog & Planning, Geog Data Sci Lab, Liverpool L69 7ZT, Merseyside, England.;Fleischmann, M (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Dept Architecture, Urban Design Studies Unit, Glasgow G1 1XJ, Lanark, Scotland.",francescadalcin@fa.ulisboa.pt; m.fleischmann@liverpool.ac.uk; ombretta.r.romice@strath.ac.uk; jpc@fa.ulisboa.pt,"Dal Cin, Francesca/AAP-1219-2021; Romice, Ombretta/AHD-3090-2022; Fleischmann, Martin/HKN-7973-2023","Fleischmann, Martin/0000-0003-3319-3366; Dal Cin, Francesca/0000-0001-8413-0838; Costa, Joao Pedro/0000-0002-6069-7052; Romice, Ombretta/0000-0002-5776-5632",,,,,53,2,2,5,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2020,12,20,,,,,,,8559,10.3390/su12208559,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12208559,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OI1SW,,"Green Accepted, gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000583068300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, their implementation is still being curbed by several barriers, for example, a lack of examples, a lack of finance, and a lack of business cases. Therefore, there is an urgent need to facilitate the construction of business models and business cases that identify the elements required to capture value. These are necessary to catalyze investments for the implementation of NBS. This article presents a tool called a Natural Assurance Schemes (NAS) canvas and explains how it can be applied to identify business models for NBS strategies providing climate adaptation services, showing an eye-shot summary of critical information to attract funding. The framework is applied in three case studies covering different contexts, scales, and climate-related risks (floods and droughts). Finally, a reflective analysis is done, comparing the tool with other similar approaches while highlighting the differential characteristics that define the usefulness, replicability, and flexibility of the tool for the target users, namely policymakers, developers, scientists, or entrepreneurs aiming to promote and implement NAS and NBS projects.","[Mayor, Beatriz; Zorrilla-Miras, Pedro; Lopez-Gunn, Elena] I CATALIST SL, Madrid 28232, Spain; [Le Coent, Philippe] Univ Montpellier, BGRM, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Biffin, Thomas; Dartee, Kieran; Pena, Karina] Field Factors, NL-2628 CS Delft, Netherlands; [Graveline, Nina] INRAE, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Marchal, Roxane] Caisse Cent Reassurance, F-75008 Paris, France; [Nanu, Florentina] Business Dev Grp, Bucharest 10638, Romania; [Scrieciu, Albert] Geoecomar, Bucharest 030167, Romania; [Calatrava, Javier] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Business Econ, Cartagena 30202, Spain; [Manzano, Marisol] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Min & Civil Engn, Cartagena 30202, Spain",Universite de Montpellier; INRAE; National Institute of Marine Geology & Geoecology of Romania (GeoEcoMar); Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Mayor, B (corresponding author), I CATALIST SL, Madrid 28232, Spain.",bmayor@icatalist.eu; pzorillamiras@icatalist.eu; p.lecoent@brgm.fr; thomas@fieldfactors.com; kieran@fieldfactors.com; kp@fieldfactors.com; nina.graveline@inra.fr; rmarchal@ccr.fr; florentina.nanu@bdgroup.ro; albert.scrieciu@geoecomar.ro; j.calatrava@upct.es; marisol.manzano@upct.es; elopopezgunn@icatalist.eu,"Albert, Scrieciu/AAD-8193-2021","Albert, Scrieciu/0000-0001-6297-8635; Graveline, Nina/0000-0002-7976-0007; Marchal, Roxane/0000-0002-1389-5611; LE COENT, Philippe/0000-0003-3694-3628; Mayor, Beatriz/0000-0002-6649-8097",H2020 project Nature Insurance value: Assessment and Demonstration-NAIAD [Nffi730497]; European Commission,H2020 project Nature Insurance value: Assessment and Demonstration-NAIAD; European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"This research received funding from the H2020 project Nature Insurance value: Assessment and Demonstration-NAIAD, grant agreement Nffi730497 from the European Commission.",,33,2,2,2,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2021,13,3,,,,,,,1291,10.3390/su13031291,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13031291,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QD6IM,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000615619300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Quantifying the controls on soil moisture is highly valuable for effective management of water resources and climatic adaptation. In this study, we quantified the effects of precipitation, temperature, and vegetation on monthly soil moisture variability in an arid area, China. A non-linear Granger causality framework was applied to examine the causal effects based on multi-decadal reanalysis data records. Results indicate that precipitation had effects on soil moisture in about 91% of the study area and explained up to 40% of soil moisture variability during 1982-2015. Temperature and vegetation explained up to 8.2% and 3.3% of soil moisture variability, respectively. Climatic extremes were responsible for up to 10% of soil moisture variability, and the importance of climatic extremes was low compared to that of the general climate dynamics. The time-lagged analysis shows that the effects of precipitation and temperature on soil moisture were immediate and dissipated shortly. In addition, the effects of precipitation on soil moisture decreased with the increase of precipitation, soil moisture, and elevation.

Slightly less than half (52) were identified as positive co-impacts (38 for carbon removal, 14 for solar geoengineering), whereas slightly more than half (55) were identified as negative co-impacts (31 for carbon removal, 24 for solar geoengineering). We then discuss 20 of these co-impacts in more depth, including positive co-impacts for naturebased protection, the expansion of industry, and reduction of poverty or heat stress as well as negative coimpacts for water insecurity, moral hazard, limited social acceptance and path dependence. After presenting this body of evidence, the paper then discusses and theorizes these co-impacts more deeply in terms of four areas: relationality and risk-risk trade-offs, co-deployment and coupling, intentional or unintentional implications, and expert consensus and dissensus.

The multilateral development banks (MDBs) have responded by devising a suite of sustainable, green, and resilient (SGR) city advisory services and lending products to prepare cities for future climate change impacts. Purpose The article comparatively analyses SGR city action plans and companion projects drafted by the MDBs. It thus evaluates the translation of analytical work into investments, reviewing what the MDBs are prioritizing and what this means for development and climate change. Methods and approach The article qualitatively analyses 124 SGR city action plans and 65 companion lending operations approved by four MDBs between 2014 and 2021, evaluating action plan documents and project appraisal, implementation, and results reports. Findings The article finds that while the SGR city action plans propose comprehensive recommendations, the companion projects narrowly focus on infrastructural upgrades that are uncertain to adequately prepare cities for future climate change impacts. Policy implications Multilateral interventions targeting climate change expanded considerably during the 2010s. The MDBs, however, continue to prioritize project-based infrastructural investments financing climate mitigation and resilience actions over more substantive climate adaptation initiatives. This article thus shows that SGR city action plans hold great potential to enact robust and inclusive climate responses but have so far been stymied by the conservatism of project-based investment lending.","[Bazbauers, Adrian Robert] UNSW Canberra, Int Publ Sect Management, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Bazbauers, AR (corresponding author), UNSW Canberra, Int Publ Sect Management, Sch Business, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",a.bazbauers@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,96,1,1,3,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-6764,1467-7679,,DEV POLICY REV,Dev.

The use of global indicators has not been a sustainable solution, thus the need for local indicators. Besides, current sustainability assessment tools lack the integration of climate, making assessments in a climate change context impossible. In this paper, we present management and sustainability assessment in a climate change context using sustainability indicators. We modeled a change in the climate using normal, moderate, and extreme climate conditions defined by Standardized Precipitation Indices (SPI) values. Out of 36 years analyzed, 24 years fall in the near-normal climate regime, and the remaining 12 years in moderate and extreme conditions, making near-normal climate regime the basis for managing the Taabo Dam. The impact of climate, techno-economic, and socio-environmental indicators on sustainability were investigated, and the results were analyzed according to scenarios. Climate adaptation shows higher sustainability indices than techno-economic and socio-environmental scenarios. Probability matrices show high and low values, respectively, for environmental and flooding indicators. Risk matrices, on the other hand, show that even with small probability values, risks still exist, and such small probabilities should not be taken as an absence of risk. The study reveals that sustainability can be improved by integrating climate into existing assessment methods.","[Mortey, Eric Mensah; Diedhiou, Arona] Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, LAPAMF African Ctr Excellence Climate Change, Biodivers & Sustainable Dev, 22 BP 582, Abidjan 22, Cote Ivoire; [Kouassi, Kouakou Lazare] Univ Jean Lorougnon GUEDE, UFR Environm, BP 150, Daloa, Cote Ivoire; [Diedhiou, Arona; Anquetin, Sandrine; Hingray, Benoit] Univ Grenoble Alpes, IRD, CNRS, IGE,Grenoble INP Inst Engn, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Genoud, Mathieu] Ecole Cent Lyon, 36 Ave Guy de Collongue, F-69134 Lyon, France; [Kouame, Didier Guy Marcel] Ivory Coast Natl Co Elect CIE, 01 BP 6923, Abidjan 01, Cote Ivoire",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Ecole Centrale de Lyon,"Mortey, EM (corresponding author), Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, LAPAMF African Ctr Excellence Climate Change, Biodivers & Sustainable Dev, 22 BP 582, Abidjan 22, Cote Ivoire.",morteyeric@gmail.com,"DIEDHIOU, Arona/D-2719-2009; Mortey, Eric/AAW-6567-2020","DIEDHIOU, Arona/0000-0003-3841-1027; Mortey, Eric/0000-0003-2199-7340; Anquetin, Sandrine/0000-0001-5127-1650; Hingray, Benoit/0000-0001-6991-0975","NERC/DFID Future Climate for Africa program under the AMMA-2050 project [NE/M019969/1]; IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement; France) [UMR IGE Imputation 252RA5]; NERC [NE/M020428/1, NE/M019969/1] Funding Source: UKRI",NERC/DFID Future Climate for Africa program under the AMMA-2050 project; IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement; France); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The research leading to this publication is co-funded by the NERC/DFID Future Climate for Africa program under the AMMA-2050 project, grant number NE/M019969/1 and by IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement; France) grant number UMR IGE Imputation 252RA5.",,61,4,4,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2019,11,18,,,,,,,4846,10.3390/su11184846,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11184846,,,32,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JC2KA,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000489104700032,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, quantitative knowledge about vulnerability reduction via private precautionary measures is scarce and their effects are hardly considered in loss modeling and risk assessments. However, this is a prerequisite to enable temporally dynamic flood damage and risk modeling, and thus the evaluation of risk management and adaptation strategies. To quantify the average reduction in vulnerability of residential buildings via private precaution empirical vulnerability data (n = 948) is used. Households with and without precautionary measures undertaken before the flood event are classified into treatment and nontreatment groups and matched. Postmatching regression is used to quantify the treatment effect. Additionally, we test state-of-the-art flood loss models regarding their capability to capture this difference in vulnerability. The estimated average treatment effect of implementing private precaution is between 11 and 15 thousand EUR per household, confirming the significant effectiveness of private precautionary measures in reducing flood vulnerability. From all tested flood loss models, the expert Bayesian network-based model BN-FLEMOps and the rule-based loss model FLEMOps perform best in capturing the difference in vulnerability due to private precaution. Thus, the use of such loss models is suggested for flood risk assessments to effectively support evaluations and decision making for adaptable flood risk management.","[Sairam, Nivedita; Schroeter, Kai; Luedtke, Stefan; Merz, Bruno; Kreibich, Heidi] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Hydrol, Potsdam, Germany; [Sairam, Nivedita] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Berlin, Germany; [Merz, Bruno] Univ Potsdam, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, Potsdam, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Potsdam,"Sairam, N (corresponding author), GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Hydrol, Potsdam, Germany.;Sairam, N (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Berlin, Germany.",nivedita@gfz-potsdam.de,"Kreibich, Heidi/HNR-9624-2023; Schröter, Kai/B-1482-2013","Kreibich, Heidi/0000-0001-6274-3625; Schröter, Kai/0000-0002-3173-7019; Ludtke, Stefan/0000-0002-7888-9175; Merz, Bruno/0000-0002-5992-1440; Sairam, Nivedita/0000-0003-4611-9894","European Union [676027]; reinsurance company Deutsche Ruckversicherung; German Research Network Natural Disasters (German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)) [01SFR9969/5]; MEDIS project (BMBF) [0330688]; project Hochwasser 2013 (BMBF) [13N13017]; German Research Centre for Geosciences GFZ; University of Potsdam; Deutsche Ruckversicherung AG, Dusseldorf","European Union(European Commission); reinsurance company Deutsche Ruckversicherung; German Research Network Natural Disasters (German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF))(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); MEDIS project (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); project Hochwasser 2013 (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Research Centre for Geosciences GFZ; University of Potsdam; Deutsche Ruckversicherung AG, Dusseldorf","This research has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement 676027 MSCA ETN System-Risk.

The experimental spill was repeated in two consecutive years in the period July-September. The rate and extent of hydrocarbon removal and the accompanying bacterial response were monitored for 79 days (2002) and 78 days (2003). The bulk of added kerosene, i.e. 94-98%, was lost from the upper 5 cm. layer by putatively abiotic processes within 2 days and a residual fraction in the range 0.6-1.2 mg per g dry sediment was stably retained. Concomitant addition of oleophilic fertilizer led to higher initial retention, as 24% of the kerosene remained after 2 days in the presence of a modified, cold-climate adapted version of the well-known Inipol EAP 22 bioremediation agent. In these enclosures, which showed an increase in hydrocarbon-degrader counts from 6.5 x 10(3) to 4. 1 X 10(7) per g dry sediment within 8 days, a 17% contribution by biodegradation to subsequent hydrocarbon removal was estimated. Stimulation in hydrocarbon-degrader counts in fertilizer-alone control enclosures was indistinguishable from the stimulation observed with both kerosene and fertilizer present, suggesting that the dynamics in numbers of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria was primarily impacted by the bioremediation agent.

In the US, adoption of many NBMP practices is voluntary and insufficient to achieve local and downstream conservation objectives. Despite evidence that both social-psychological factors and socio-economic factors influence farmer decision making, very few studies of farmers' decision-making related to NBMP adoption combine these two factor groups in a theoretically rigorous way. To better understand farmers' management decisions, we test the social psychological Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to determine the relative influence of attitudes, perceived social norms, and perceived behavioral control on adoption of nine NBMPs. A survey was designed by the research team and implemented by the U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDANASS) in 2013, and replicated in 2016, on a stratified sample of 129 farmers (including panel data on 56 farmers). Farmers were located in the Missisquoi, and Lamoille River watersheds of the Lake Champlain Basin in the Northeast region of the United States. Survey responses revealed variation in past adoption of NBMPs was sensitive to practice type and farm size. We developed nine weighted structural equation models to test endogenous (social-psychological) and exogenous (policy, economic and demographic) predictors of farmer intention to adopt NBMPs. We found that perceived behavioral control had the largest effect size and strongest statistical significance on the farmers' expressed intentions to adopt NBMPs in the future. For a subset of NBMPs, perceived social norms and farmer attitudes toward these NBMPs were each also significant drivers of intention to adopt individual practices. Among the exogenous variables, we found that large farm size, college education, and having a conservation easement all had a positive influence on farmers' intention to adopt NBMPs. This study suggests that for widespread adoption of NBMPs, environmental managers, policy makers, and program developers should be attentive to farmers' perceived behavioral control, and support the design and execution of outreach and technical assistance programs that build on drivers of farmers' decision making.","[Doran, Elizabeth M.

Past efforts in understanding whether, and to what extent, adaptation improves household welfare have faced some key challenges including: 1) endogeneity of adaptation; 2) localized results that are difficult to generalize; and 3) understanding whether the efficacy of adaptation depends on the reasons for adaptation (e.g. market conditions vs climate change). In this study we estimate effects of smallholder agricultural adaptation on food security, while addressing each of these three challenges. First, we identify and test instrumental variables based on neighbor networks. Second, we use a dataset that contains information from 5159 households located across 15 countries in Africa, Asia, and Central America. Third, we investigate whether adaptation that is motivated by changes in market conditions influences the efficacy of adaptation differently than adaptation motivated by climate change. Across our global sample, an average household made almost 10 adaptive changes, which are responsible for approximately 47 days of food security yearly; an amount nearly 4 times larger than is indicated if endogeneity is not addressed. But these effects vary depending on what is motivating adaptation. Adaptation in response to climate change alone is not found to significantly affect food security. When climate adaptation is paired with adaptation in response to changing market conditions, the resulting impact is 96 food secure days. These results suggest the need for further work on the careful design of climate change interventions to complement adaptive activities.","[Lim, Krisha] Int Care Minist, Monitoring & Evaluat, Manila, Philippines; [Wichmann, Bruno; Luckert, Martin K.] Univ Alberta, Fac Agr Life & Environm Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Laderach, Peter] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, DAPA, Rome, Italy",University of Alberta; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT,"Laderach, P (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, DAPA, Rome, Italy.",p.laderach@cgiar.org,,"Laderach, Peter/0000-0001-8708-6318",,,,,51,3,3,4,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1876-4517,1876-4525,,FOOD SECUR,Food Secur.,FEB,2020,12,1,,,,,21,35,,10.1007/s12571-019-00993-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-019-00993-0,,,15,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Food Science & Technology,KI7YY,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000511572300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

We find that, overall, women exposed to above-average temperatures report lower ideal family size and reduced probability of desiring a first or additional child. Results indicate that exposure to precipitation anomalies during the 12 months prior to the DHS survey is associated with a significant reduction in ideal family size, but longer 60-month spells of above-average precipitation are associated with increases in ideal family size, Effects of unusual precipitation are null for women's fertility preferences at both shorter- and longer-term periods. Additional analyses show that this association varies across sub-populations defined by parity, education, residence in rural or urban areas, and region. In general, our results suggest that women exposed to adverse environmental conditions-namely abnormally hot or dry spells-will reduce their ideal family size and their preferences for having another child. In some cases, however, fertility goals may also decline during spells of favorable environmental conditions, possibly due to increased labor demands among women and their spouses. One implication of the observed links between climate variability and reproductive goals is that policymakers concerned with climate adaptation should work to ensure women have access to the necessary family planning resources needed to realize dynamic reproductive goals in a changing climate.","[Eissler, Sarah; Thiede, Brian C.; Strube, Johann] Penn State Univ, 111A Armsby Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Thiede, BC (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, 111A Armsby Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",bct11@psu.edu,,"Strube, Johann/0000-0002-6565-5070",Population Research Institute at the Pennsylvania State University; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P2CHD0410251]; Joan Luerssen Faculty Enhancement Fund,Population Research Institute at the Pennsylvania State University; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); Joan Luerssen Faculty Enhancement Fund,This research was supported by the Population Research Institute at the Pennsylvania State University (partly funded through the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P2CHD0410251) and by the Joan Luerssen Faculty Enhancement Fund.

This study focuses on the Bogota Humana development plan (2012-2016) in which Bogota, a regional leader in resilience planning, first tied its resettlement policy to a broader adaptation strategy. Specifically, the study analyzes the creation of a new municipal subsidy to finance resettlements in the context of Bogota's complex and uneven geography of risk. Data for the study was collected through a household survey of program participants, interviews of city officials, site visits in Bogota and a review of Colombian census data. The study finds that despite the unprecedented size of the city's investment in resettlements during this period, it largely failed to meet the plan's goals. Its uniform financing and large-scale resettlement strategy failed to account for varying levels of risk produced by informal development. Consequently, Bogota Humana's climate resettlements resulted in an inconsistent process generating resistance among residents.","[Sarmiento, Hugo] Univ Illinois, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, 611 Lorado Taft Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Sarmiento, H (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, 611 Lorado Taft Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",hugos@illinois.edu,,,United Nation's Development Program (UNDP),United Nation's Development Program (UNDP),"The city relied on technical analysis in a United Nation's Development Program (UNDP) sponsored project, the Integrated Regional Plan for Climate Change (PRICC), which presents climate model scenarios for the Bogota metropolitan area.",,33,1,1,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0735-2166,1467-9906,,J URBAN AFF,J.

Institutional designs are central when improving water quality for downstream users, for instance, and when reallocating water quantifies including for climate adaptation. Views differ on which institutions are best states; markets; or informal institutions. For transfers of ecosystem services, we compare informal trust-based institutions to enforced contracts, both being institutional types we observe commonly in the field. The trust-based institutions lack binding promises, thus ecosystem-services suppliers are unsure about the compensation they will receive for transferring services to users. We employ decision experiments given the shortcomings of the alternative methods for empirical study of institutions, as well as the limits on theoretical prediction about behaviors under trust. In our bargaining game that decouples equity and efficiency, we find that enforced contracts increased efficiency as well as all measures of equity. This informs the design of institutions to manage transfers of ecosystem services, as equity in surplus sharing is important in of itself and in permitting efficient allocation.","[Pfaff, Alexander] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Alejandra Velez, Maria] Los Andes Univ, Sch Management, Bogota, Colombia; [Broad, Kenneth] Univ Miami, Abess Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Policy, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Broad, Kenneth] Columbia Univ, Ctr Res Environm Decis, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Hamoudi, Amar] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Demog & Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Taddei, Renzo] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Grad Program Social Sci, Anthropol, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Taddei, Renzo] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Inst Sea Studies, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil",Duke University; University of Miami; Columbia University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP); Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP),"Pfaff, A (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",alex.pfaff@duke.edu,"Taddei, Renzo/I-9090-2012","Taddei, Renzo/0000-0002-9935-6183","Center for Research on Environmental Decisions (CRED); National Science Foundation (NSF) Decision Making Under Uncertainty (DMUU) center at Columbia University [SES-0345840, SES-0435622]; National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Global Programs (OGP); Tinker Foundation; NOAA [NA06GP0308]; Sao Paulo State Research Foundation (FAPESP)",Center for Research on Environmental Decisions (CRED); National Science Foundation (NSF) Decision Making Under Uncertainty (DMUU) center at Columbia University(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Global Programs (OGP); Tinker Foundation; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Sao Paulo State Research Foundation (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),"This work received financial support from the Center for Research on Environmental Decisions (CRED), a National Science Foundation (NSF) Decision Making Under Uncertainty (DMUU) center at Columbia University (SES-0345840 and SES-0435622).

Growth in marine protected areas, fisheries management, the blue economy, and marine spatial planning initiatives are occurring both within and beyond national jurisdictions. This mounting activity has coincided with increasing concerns about sustainability and international attention to ocean governance. Yet, despite growing concerns about exclusionary decision-making processes and social injustices, there remains inadequate attention to issues of social justice and inclusion in ocean science, management, governance and funding. In a rapidly changing and progressively busier ocean, we need to learn from past mistakes and identify ways to navigate a just and inclusive path towards sustainability. Proactive attention to inclusive decision-making and social justice is needed across key ocean policy realms including marine conservation, fisheries management, marine spatial planning, the blue economy, climate adaptation and global ocean governance for both ethical and instrumental reasons. This discussion paper aims to stimulate greater engagement with these critical topics.

This study provides valuable insights into the conditions that can promote farmers' acceptance of regulated deficit irrigation and a new water pricing policy to address CC impacts on the semi-arid irrigated region which will allow for a sustainable irrigation regime and the conservation of water resources at regional scale. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze data collected from 100 farmers in the citrus regions of Beni Khalled and Menzel Bouzelfa, to identify determining factors for farmers' willingness to accept the proposed water management strategies. Empirical findings reveal that the significant explanatory variables are essentially linked to farmer satisfaction about the current irrigation management in relation to water supply reliability, rather than the social criteria and farmers' awareness of water scarcity. More efforts are needed to improve the transparency of water allocation systems to motivate the willingness of water users to adopt new technologies or policies. The different stakeholders should agree to take action now about strategic extension and communication plans to enhance awareness on ensuing environmental problems, to take advantage of long-term profitability of the water restriction.","[Lasram, Asma] Higher Inst Agron Chott Mariem, POB 47, Chott Mariem 4042, Sousse, Tunisia; [Dellagi, Hatem] Univ Econ & Management Sci Tunis, POB 248,El Manar 2, Tunis 2092, Tunisia; [Dessalegn, Bezaiet] ICARDA, IWLMP, El Rawaby Neighborhood Abdallah Abu Ghosheh St, Amman, Jordan; [Dhehibi, Boubaker] ICARDA, SIRPSP, Abdallah Abu Ghosheh St, Amman, Jordan; [Ben Mechlia, Netij] Natl Agron Inst Tunis, 43 Av Charles Nicole, Tunis Mahrajene 1082, Tunisia",Universite de Sousse; CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA); CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA); Universite de Carthage,"Dhehibi, B (corresponding author), ICARDA, SIRPSP, Abdallah Abu Ghosheh St, Amman, Jordan.",b.dhehibi@cgiar.org,,"Dhehibi, Boubaker/0000-0003-3854-6669; Dessalegn, Bezaiet/0000-0001-9406-1389",Middle East and North Africa Water Livelihoods Initiative (WLI-USAID); Modernizing Extension and Agricultural Systems (MEAS); Office for Global Research Engagement (University of Florida),Middle East and North Africa Water Livelihoods Initiative (WLI-USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Modernizing Extension and Agricultural Systems (MEAS); Office for Global Research Engagement (University of Florida),"The authors are grateful to GDA and CTV agents who assisted with the primary data collection process.

Dangerous wildfire events such as these could potentially be influenced by anthropogenic climate change, however, there are large knowledge gaps on how these events might change in the future. The McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) is used to represent near-surface weather conditions and the Continuous Haines index (CH) is used here to represent lower to mid-tropospheric vertical atmospheric stability and humidity measures relevant to dangerous wildfires and pyroconvective processes. Projected changes in extreme measures of CH and FFDI are examined using a multi-method approach, including an ensemble of global climate models together with two ensembles of regional climate models. The projections show a clear trend towards more dangerous near-surface fire weather conditions for Australia based on the FFDI, as well as increased pyroconvection risk factors for some regions of southern Australia based on the CH. These results have implications for fields such as disaster risk reduction, climate adaptation, ecology, policy and planning, noting that improved knowledge on how climate change can influence extreme wildfires can help reduce future impacts of these events.","[Dowdy, Andrew J.; Ye, Hua; Pepler, Acacia] Bur Meteorol, Climate Res Sect, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Thatcher, Marcus; Osbrough, Stacey L.] CSIRO, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Evans, Jason P.; Di Virgilio, Giovanni] Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Evans, Jason P.] Univ New South Wales, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Climate Ext, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [McCarthy, Nicholas] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Bureau of Meteorology - Australia; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Queensland,"Dowdy, AJ (corresponding author), Bur Meteorol, Climate Res Sect, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",andrew.dowdy@bom.gov.au,"Thatcher, Marcus J/G-4010-2011; Evans, Jason P./F-3716-2011; Pepler, Acacia/ABC-6565-2020; Dowdy, Andrew/AAI-6395-2020","Thatcher, Marcus J/0000-0003-4139-5515; Evans, Jason P./0000-0003-1776-3429; Pepler, Acacia/0000-0002-1478-2512; Dowdy, Andrew/0000-0003-0720-4471; Di Virgilio, Giovanni/0000-0001-7014-8412",National Environmental Science Program of the Australian Government,National Environmental Science Program of the Australian Government,This research was funded by the National Environmental Science Program of the Australian Government.,,40,72,72,5,43,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,JUL 11,2019,9,,,,,,,,10073,10.1038/s41598-019-46362-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46362-x,,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,IH9IW,31296883,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000474821000019,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, the APEC Climate Center one-tier multimodel ensemble (MME) was downscaled for predicting the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) over 60 stations in South Korea. SPEI depends on both precipitation and temperature, and can incorporate the effect of global warming on the balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration. It was found that the one-tier MME has difficulty in capturing the local temperature and rainfall variations over extratropical land areas, and has no skill in predicting SPEI during boreal winter and spring. On the other hand, temperature and precipitation predictions were substantially improved in the downscaled MME. In conjunction with variance inflation, downscaled MME can give reasonably skillful 6 month-lead forecasts of SPEI for the winter to spring period. Our results could lead to more reliable hydrological extreme predictions for policymakers and stakeholders in the water management sector, and for better mitigation and climate adaptations.

Persistent inundation drowns vegetation and contributes to open water conversion in salt marsh interiors. Runnels are shallow channels originally developed in Australia to control mosquitoes by draining standing water, but recently used to restore marsh vegetation in the USA. Documentation on runnel efficacy is not widely available; yet over the past 10 years dozens of coastal adaptation projects in the northeastern USA have incorporated runnels. To better understand the efficacy of runnels used for restoration, we organized a workshop of 70 experts and stakeholders in coastal resource management. Through the workshop we developed a collective understanding of how runnels might be used to slow or reverse open water conversion, and identified unresolved questions. In this paper we present a synthesis of workshop discussions and results from a promising case study in which vegetation was restored at a degraded marsh within a few years of runnel construction. Despite case study outcomes, key questions remain on long-term runnel efficacy in marshes differing in elevation, tidal range, and management history. Runnel construction is unlikely to improve long-term marsh resilience alone, as it cannot address underlying causes of open water conversion. As a part of holistic climate planning that includes other management interventions, runnels may buy time for salt marshes to respond to management action, or adapt to sea level rise.","[Besterman, Alice F.] Buzzards Bay Coalit, New Bedford, MA 02740 USA; [Besterman, Alice F.; Jakuba, Rachel W.; Deegan, Linda A.] Woodwell Climate Res Ctr, Falmouth, MA 02540 USA; [Ferguson, Wenley] Save Bay, Providence, RI USA; [Brennan, Diana] Bristol Country Mosquito Control Project, Attleboro, MA USA; [Costa, Joseph E.] Buzzards Bay Natl Estuary Program, Mattapoisett, MA USA",,"Besterman, AF (corresponding author), Buzzards Bay Coalit, New Bedford, MA 02740 USA.;Besterman, AF (corresponding author), Woodwell Climate Res Ctr, Falmouth, MA 02540 USA.",abesterman@woodwellclimate.org,,"Besterman, Alice/0000-0003-2311-4281","Woodwell Climate Research Center; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Coastal Program; RI Coastal and Estuarine Habitat Restoration Trust Fund; Southeast New England Program (SNEP) Watershed Grant - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); National Science Foundation [DEB-1902712]; EPA [CE-00A00515, CE-00A00623]; U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center (NE CASC) [G21AC10192-00]",Woodwell Climate Research Center; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Coastal Program; RI Coastal and Estuarine Habitat Restoration Trust Fund; Southeast New England Program (SNEP) Watershed Grant - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency); U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center (NE CASC),"We thank all participants in our Evaluating runnels for Salt Marsh Adaptation workshop who provided invaluable perspective and knowledge.

It combines data from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit (CRU), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on 28 LAC countries for a 54-year period (1961-2014) in order to inform policy makers of the cost of output losses in the absence of viable climate adaptation strategies. We use estimates of a random-parameter stochastic production frontier (SPF) model specification to capture heterogeneity in technology and partial output elasticities across countries and unobserved environmental characteristics. Results show that change in output is mainly driven by an average annual TFP growth rate of .95%. Climate change induces significant reductions (9.03-12.7%) in productivity over the 2015-2050 period.

To effectively reduce heat health risk, a better understanding of where and what risk factors should be targeted for intervention is necessary. However, little research has examined how different risk factors for heat-related mortality operate at varying spatial scales. Here, we present a novel application of the multiscale geographically weighted regression (GWR) approach to explore the scale of effect of each underlying risk factor using Hong Kong as a case study. We find that a hybrid of global and local processes via multiscale GWR yields a better fit of heat-related mortality risk than models using GWR and ordinary least squares (OLS) approaches. Predictor variables are categorized by the scale of effect into global variables (i.e., age and education attainment, socioeconomic status), intermediate variables (i.e., work place, birth place and language), and local variables (i.e., thermal environment, low in-come). These findings enrich our understanding of the spatial scale-dependent risk factors for heat-related mortality and shed light on the importance of hierarchical policy-making and site-specific planning processes in effective heat hazard mitigation and climate adaptation strategies.","[Song, Jinglu] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Sch Design, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Suzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yu, Hanchen] Harvard Univ, Ctr Geog Anal, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lu, Yi] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University; Harvard University; City University of Hong Kong,"Song, JL (corresponding author), Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Sch Design, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Suzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",viptanghulu@hotmail.com; hanchenyu@pku.edu.cn; yilu24@cityu.edu.hk,"LU, Yi/AAD-7750-2020; Song, Diva/AGZ-8138-2022","LU, Yi/0000-0001-7614-6661; Song, Diva/0000-0002-5220-6364; Yu, Hanchen/0000-0002-3246-8586","National Natural Science Foundation of China [42007421]; National Social Science Foundation of China [17ZDA055]; General Research Project Fund of Hong Kong Research Grants Council [11207520]; Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety (Fudan University), Ministry of Ed-ucation, China [GW2019-7]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China; General Research Project Fund of Hong Kong Research Grants Council; Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety (Fudan University), Ministry of Ed-ucation, China","This study is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [Project no. 42007421] , National Social Science Foundation of China [Project no. 17ZDA055] , General Research Project Fund of Hong Kong Research Grants Council [Project no. 11207520] and the Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety (Fudan University) , Ministry of Ed-ucation, China [Project no.

Jatropha seeds have potential to fit these roles in view of their multipurpose uses, broad climatic adaptability features, and high oil and protein contents. During the past five years many large-scale cultivation projects have been undertaken to produce jatropha seed oil as a feedstock for the biodiesel industry. The present review aims at providing biological significance of jatropha proteins and peptides along with their nutritional and therapeutic applications. The nutritional qualities of the kernel meal and protein concentrates or isolates prepared from seed cake are presented, enabling their efficient use in animal nutrition. In addition, (a) biologically active proteins involved in plant protection, for example, aquaporin and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase, which have roles in drought resistance, and p-glucanase, which has antifungal activity, as well as those having pharmaceutical properties, and (b) cyclic peptides with various biological activities such as antiproliferative, immunomodulatory, antifungal, and antimalarial activity are discussed. It is expected that the information collated will open avenues for new applications of proteins present in jatropha plant, thereby contributing to enhance the financial viability and sustainability of a jatropha-based biodiesel industry.","[Devappa, Rakshit K.; Makkar, Harinder P.

Little is known, however, about how fluctuations in weather contribute to the experience of place and the connection to mental wellness in Inuit communities. This study aimed to characterize the importance of changes in weather among Inuit, and how these changes influence mental health and wellness in the context of climate change. Data were drawn from a community-driven and Inuit-led study in the Nunatsiavut region of Labrador, Canada. In-depth interviews (n = 116 people) were conducted between November 2012 to May 2013 in the five Nunatsiavut communities. Qualitative data were thematically analyzed using a constant comparative method. Results indicated that weather impacted mental wellness through three key pathways: 1) shaping daily lived experiences including connection to place and other determinants of wellbeing; 2) altering mood and emotion on a transient basis; and 3) seasonally influencing individual and community health and wellbeing. These results demonstrate the immediate role weather has in shaping mental wellness in Nunatsiavut. In turn, this understanding of the climate-mental wellness relationship points to multiple pathways for action on climate adaptation policy and programming, and underscores the need for more culturally-specific and place-based investigations to appropriately respond to the mental health impacts of climate change.","[Middleton, Jacqueline; Jones-Bitton, Andria; Harper, Sherilee L.] Univ Guelph, Dept Populat Med, 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Middleton, Jacqueline; Pollock, Nathaniel; Harper, Sherilee L.] Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, 116 St & 85 Ave, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada; [Cunsolo, Ashlee] Mem Univ, Labrador Inst, 219 Hamilton River Rd,POB 490,Stn B, Happy Valley Goose Bay, NF A0P 1E0, Canada; [Cunsolo, Ashlee; Pollock, Nathaniel] Mem Univ, Fac Med, Div Community Hlth & Humanities, 300 Prince Philip Dr, St John, NF A1B 3V6, Canada; [Shiwak, Inez; Flowers, Charlie] Torngat Wildlife Plants & Fisheries Secretariat, 217 Hamilton River Rd, Happy Valley Goose Bay, NF A0P 1C0, Canada; [Wood, Michele] Nunatsiavut Govt, Dept Hlth & Social Dev, 218 Kelland Dr,POB 496,Stn C, Happy Valley Goose Bay, NF A0P 1C0, Canada",University of Guelph; University of Alberta; Memorial University Newfoundland; Memorial University Newfoundland,"Middleton, J (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Populat Med, 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.;Cunsolo, A (corresponding author), Mem Univ, Labrador Inst, 219 Hamilton River Rd,POB 490,Stn B, Happy Valley Goose Bay, NF A0P 1E0, Canada.;Harper, SL (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, 11405-87 Ave, Edmonton, AB T6G 1C9, Canada.",jmiddl03@uoguelph.ca; ashlee.cunsolo@mun.ca; sherilee.harper@ualberta.ca,,,"Health Canada's First Nations and Inuit Health Branch; Nasivvik Centre for Inuit Health and Changing Environments, Polar Knowledge Canada; CIHR (Rigolet Inuit Community Government); CIHR, Ontario Graduate Scholarship Program; Arthur D.

We modeled these using information from the American Housing Survey for 2003-2013 and 140 US core-based statistical areas employing variables that would be present in publicly available parcel records. We present random-intercept logistic regression models with either cenAC, rmAC or home was uncomfortably cold for 24 h or more (tooCold) as outcome variables and housing value, rented vs. owned, age, and multi- vs. single-family, each interacted with cooling- or heating-degree days as predictors. The out-of-sample predicted probabilities for years 2015-2017 were compared with corresponding American Housing Survey values (0 or 1). Using a 0.5 probability threshold, the model had 63% specificity (true negative rate), and 91% sensitivity (true positive rate) for cenAC, while specificity and sensitivity for rmAC were 94% and 34%, respectively. Area-specific sensitivities and specificities varied widely. For tooCold, the overall sensitivity was effectively 0%. Future epidemiologic studies, heat vulnerability maps, and intervention screenings may reliably use these or similar AC models with parcel-level data to improve understanding of health risk and the spatial patterning of homes without AC.","[Gronlund, Carina J.] Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Survey Res Ctr, Social Environm & Hlth Program, 426 Thompson St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Berrocal, Veronica J.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Stat, Irvine, CA USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Gronlund, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Survey Res Ctr, Social Environm & Hlth Program, 426 Thompson St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",gronlund@umich.edu,,"Gronlund, Carina/0000-0002-0533-745X","National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health [P30ES017885, K99ES026198, R00ES026198]; National Science Foundation [1520803]","National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We thank our Heatwaves, Housing, and Health community-academic partnership, which includes Marie O'Neill, Larissa Larsen, and Tony Reames of the University of Michigan, Guy Williams and Wibke Heymach of Detroiters Working for Environmental Justice, Justin Schott of EcoWorks, Sara Clark of Southwest Detroit Environmental Vision, Michelle Lee and Rebecca Nikodem of Jefferson East, Inc., and Zachary Rowe of Friends of Parkside for providing the research hypotheses and feedback on preliminary results.

More emphasis is given on the impacts of extreme weather events on rural communities of less developed regions. The results are often interpreted in a qualitative manner through policy measures that may reduce gender inequalities. However, the interpretation of the qualitative results to more crisp and measurable outputs is often not attained while the validation of the findings is rarely ensured. The current study suggests a gender-differentiated impact framework based on qualitative and quantitative components for the assessment of climate variability effects on rural communities in South India. Fifteen villages mostly practicing rice farming in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states were selected as representative drought-prone case studies. The study results advocate that the qualitative outcomes were validated from the quantitative approach but for a few cases which could be attributed to methodological and case-specific differentiations. Policy recommendations are made on common gender trainings in water-resistant crops and livestock activities for the alleviation of drought impact and abatement of gender inequalities. Also, entrepreneurship workshops for women could enhance gender balance and diverse family income from the current sole dependence on farming revenues. Regional climate adaptation programs could be better implemented when the specific features and capacities of local communities are taken into consideration.","[Xenarios, Stefanos] Univ Cent Asia, MSRI, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; [Xenarios, Stefanos; Nagothu, Udaya Sekhar] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res NIBIO, As, Norway; [Nagothu, Udaya Sekhar] IWMI, Hyderabad Off, ICRISAT Campus, Patancheru, Telangana, India; [Kotapati, Gurava Reddy] ANGRAU, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India",University of Central Asia; Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research; CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT); International Water Management Institute (IWMI); Acharya N.

The reduction in stand density is currently debated as a potential tool to face increasing summer drought risk by improving forest resistance to climate change-induced tree mortality. However, few studies have yet assessed the impacts of this management change on soil biodiversity. We conducted a large-scale, multi-site assessment of the response of soil macro-detritivore assemblages and soil functioning to experimental manipulations of stand density. A total of 33 stands were studied covering a wide gradient of stand density, that is stand basal area from 25 to 437m(2)ha(-1), stand age, that is 18-171years old, and local abiotic context. We observed contrasting responses as a function of both taxonomic and functional groupings. Exploratory analysis using causal diagrams, that is path analysis, highlights that these changes were mainly related to alterations in understorey vegetation, microclimatic and soil pH conditions. The response of soil macro-detritivore assemblages to stand density manipulation was consistent over the gradient of stand ages. Among the litter-dwelling macro-detritivores, millipede abundance and diversity decreased with stand density reduction, while woodlice and epigeic earthworms were unaffected. Further, a shift in soil-dwelling earthworm community composition was observed in mull stands. Endogeic earthworm abundance showed a sharp increase with stand density reduction, which translated into an increase in soil respiration. In contrast, anecic earthworm abundance decreased and was strongly associated with a decline of the rate of forest floor turnover.Synthesis and applications. Our study provides strong evidence that reductions of stand density will have substantial impacts on soil macro-detritivore assemblages and cascading effects on soil functioning, particularly in mull stands. Managing stand density of oak forests at an intermediate level, that is 25m(2)ha(-1), appears to be best to optimize the trade-off between improving forest resistance to climate change and ensuring the conservation of functional diversity to preserve forest ecosystem functioning and stability.

Despite frequent occurrences in recent years, a quantitative understanding of the compound weather events' impacts remains elusive. Here, we use Synthetic Aperture Radar data from Sentinel-1 and normalized difference vegetation index data from MODIS satellites to map the spring 2019 U.S. Midwest flood extent and evaluate its impact on crop loss. We find a statistically significant association between flooded counties and those with plant greenup delay, while the correlation between flood area percent and amount of green-up delay remains weak, albeit reliable. An analysis of the stream gage time series and crop loss records shows that during the past similar to 70 years, similar to 43% of spring large discharges are associated with widespread crop loss. We also find an increase in streams' discharge frequency and magnitude across the Midwest, indicating the possibility of a future increase in crop loss due to spring flooding. This study highlights the importance of Earth-observing satellite data for developing climate adaptation and resilience plans.","[Shirzaei, Manoochehr; Werth, Susanna; Carlson, Grace; Sherpa, Sonam Futi; Zhai, Guang; Lee, Jui-Chi] Virginia Tech, Dept Geosci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Khoshmanesh, Mostafa] CALTECH, Dept Mech & Civil Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Ojha, Chandrakanta] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Mohali, India; [Kerner, Hannah] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Zhai, Guang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Seismol Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhai, Guang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; California Institute of Technology; Indian Institute of Science Education & Research (IISER) - Mohali; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Shirzaei, M (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Geosci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",shirzaei@vt.edu; chandrakanta.ojha@ga.gov.au; swerth@vt.edu; hkerner@umd.edu; gacarls1@asu.edu; sfsherpa@vt.edu; gzhai@vt.edu; jclee.vickie@asu.edu,"Lee, Jui-Chi/ABG-8244-2021","Sherpa, Sonam/0000-0002-3415-576X; Khoshmanesh, Mostafa/0000-0001-8724-5737; Lee, Jui-Chi/0000-0001-6686-546X; Ojha, Chandrakanta/0000-0002-5025-4485","National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) [80NSSC170567]; NASA [NNX17AD98G, 80NSSC18M0039]; National Science Foundation [EAR-1735630]; Department of Energy [DE-SC0019307]; NASA [1002781, NNX17AD98G] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"M.S. and S.S. are supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant 80NSSC170567.

As part of this study, we developed a method for transforming downscaled climate information from the publicly available Cal-Adapt database into useful and useable climate projections for vineyard managers and advisors in the Paso Robles American Viticultural Area. We shared vineyard-specific projections during interviews of 20 managers and advisors. Overall, interviewees expressed trust in the projections and found them helpful in reducing their psychological distance from climate change. The projections prompted consideration of strategies for managing future climate risk and planning adaptation, with the majority of adaptations associated with long-term decisions such as row orientation, variety selection, dry farming, crop diversification and relocation. Agri-climatic decision support tools such as the one prototyped here may prove especially helpful for incorporating climate adaptation into the long-term business planning and vineyard redevelopment decisions facing managers and advisors in the near future. This approach could be extended to other California wine grape regions or to other perennial crops with expected vulnerabilities to climate change.","[Babin, Nicholas; Guerrero, Jazlyn; Rivera, Diego] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Nat Resources Management & Environm Sci Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Singh, Ajay] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Environm Studies, Sacramento, CA USA",California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo; California State University System; California State University Sacramento,"Babin, N (corresponding author), Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Nat Resources Management & Environm Sci Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.",,,"Singh, Ajay/0000-0002-5576-8178",USDA McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Research Program; Agricultural Research Institute of the California State University,USDA McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Research Program; Agricultural Research Institute of the California State University,This research was supported by funding from the USDA McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Research Program and the Agricultural Research Institute of the California State University.,,26,1,1,2,4,"UNIV CALIFORNIA, OAKLAND, DIVISION AGRICULTURE & NATURAL RESOURCES",RICHMOND,"1301 S 46 ST, RICHMOND, CA 94804 USA",0008-0845,2160-8091,,CALIF AGR,Calif.

However, climate adaptation efforts are often hindered due to the inadequate assessment of coupled human-environment interactions. In this study, we propose a novel unified country-level framework to quantify the decadal agricultural risks derived from multiple hydro-meteorological exposures and adaptive consequences. We identify, for the first time, that rice and wheat risks have increased in the recent decade, with wheat at a twofold higher magnitude than rice. Increasing crops risk is found to be predominantly driven by the decreasing number of cultivators; in particular, the wheat risk is also attributed to increasing minimum temperatures during the crop growing season. We provide convincing evidence indicating that the hydro-climatic hazards related to precipitation extremes and droughts are specifically alarming the crops risk as compared to temperature extremes. These observation-based results highlight the sensitivity of India's agriculture and the risk associated with multiple agro-ecological and climatic components. We recommend these findings to facilitate the informed planning of adaptive measures and ensure sustainable food security of the nation.","[Sharma, Tarul; Karmakar, Subhankar; Ghosh, Subimal] Indian Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Programme Climate Studies, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Vittal, H.; Karmakar, Subhankar] Indian Inst Technol, Environm Sci & Engn Dept, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Vittal, H.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Vittal, H.] Univ Iowa, IIHR Hydrosci & Engn, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Karmakar, Subhankar; Ghosh, Subimal] Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Urban Sci & Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Ghosh, Subimal] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); University of Iowa; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Karmakar, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Programme Climate Studies, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India.;Karmakar, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Environm Sci & Engn Dept, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India.;Karmakar, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Urban Sci & Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India.",skarmakar@iitb.ac.in,"Hari, Vittal/AAS-4759-2020","Hari, Vittal/0000-0001-8754-0488; Karmakar, Subhankar/0000-0002-1132-1403; Sharma, Tarul/0000-0002-9574-4170; Ghosh, Subimal/0000-0002-5722-1440","Department of Science & Technology (SPLICE -Climate Change Programme), GoI [DST/CCP/CoE/140/2018, 00000000000010013072 (UCID: 18192442)]","Department of Science & Technology (SPLICE -Climate Change Programme), GoI(Department of Science & Technology (India)Department of Science & Technology (DOST), Philippines)","This work is supported by the Department of Science & Technology (SPLICE -Climate Change Programme), GoI, Project reference numbers DST/CCP/CoE/140/2018, Grant Number: 00000000000010013072 (UCID: 18192442).",,57,15,15,2,27,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

Despite chronic flooding problems throughout the history of the city, local authorities and state authorities have given little attention to vulnerability to climate variability and climate change. This is the first assessment of vulnerability to flooding carried out in Tijuana. Research results show that over 10 percent of the total population in the city (over 153,000 inhabitants) lives in areas with high vulnerability to flooding, and an additional 18 percent (277,000 inhabitants) are in areas with what we classify as medium-high vulnerability. Results by census track identified specific areas and social groups in these categories, as well as the underlying drivers of vulnerability associated with the biophysical conditions of the landscape that have been modified by urban growth and through social processes (namely, deficiencies in local urban planning and its enforcement along with deficient social policies).

Two climate scenarios and nine policy scenarios are combined to assess sustainable development using a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach. Results show that, through pursuing challenging goals in agricultural, potable water, energy, and industrial sectors, sustainable development will be achieved. In this scenario, the Lake Urmia water level will reach its ecological water level in 2040. However, social, technical, and political challenges are considered obstacles to implementing the goals of this scenario.

In particular, the article tests a number of knowledge brokering strategies described and theorised in the literature, but seldom empirically tested. The article finds that while the policy context can be used to identify a theoretically informed knowledge brokering strategy, in practice a strategy's 'success' is more informed by practical considerations, such as whether the tool development process is knowledge or demand driven. In addition, in practice the knowledge brokering process is found to be dynamic and messy, which is not always apparent in the literature. The article goes on to question the perception that there is always a need (or a desire) to bridge the gap between researchers and policy makers in the tool development process. Rather than a problem of design and communication, the science policy interface may be characterised more by a high level of competition between researchers and research organisations to have their tool legitimised by its use in the policy making process.

Recent research has shown the potential for application of material stock (MS) accounts for informing disaster risk planning. In this research, we present a methodological approach to analyze the vulnerability of the material stock in buildings to extreme weather events and sea-level rise (SLR) due to climate change. The main island of Grenada, a Small Island Developing State (SIDS) in the Caribbean region, was used as a case study. A bottom-up approach based on a geographic information system (GIS) is used to calculate the total MS of aggregate, timber, concrete, and steel in buildings. The total MS in buildings in 2014 was calculated to be 11.9 million tonnes (Mt), which is equivalent to 112 tonnes per capita. Material gross addition to stock (GAS) between 1993 to 2009 was 6.8 Mt and the average value over the time period was 4.0 tonnes per capita per year. In the year following Hurricane Ivan (2004), the per capita GAS for timber increased by 172%, while for other metals, GAS spiked by 103% (compared to average growth rates of 11% and 8%, respectively, between 1993 and 2009). We also ran a future Ivan-II scenario and estimated a hypothetical loss of between 135 and 216 kilotonnes (kt) of timber from the building stock. The potential impact of SLR is also assessed, with an estimated 1.6 Mt of building material stock exposed under a 2-m scenario. We argue that spatial material stock accounts have an important application in planning for resilience and provide indication of the link between natural disaster recovery and resource use patterns.","[Symmes, Rob; Singh, Simron J.] Univ Waterloo, Sch Environm Enterprise & Dev, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Fishman, Tomer] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT USA; [Telesford, John N.] TA Marryshow Community Coll, Sch Continuing Educ, Tanteen, St Georges, Grenada; [Tan, Su-Yin; De Kroon, Kristen] Univ Waterloo, Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo; Yale University; University of Waterloo,"Symmes, R (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Sch Environm Enterprise & Dev, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",rjsymmes@uwaterloo.ca,"; Fishman, Tomer/C-9772-2015","Telesford, John/0000-0001-7260-0708; Symmes, Rob/0000-0002-5970-3101; Fishman, Tomer/0000-0003-4405-2382; Singh, Simron/0000-0001-7012-893X",,,,,54,17,17,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

They contain opportunities for agriculture, forestry, pastureland and mining. The production systems in these zones are characterised by crop diversification. However, these areas have become vulnerable to the effects of climate change. To understand these effects in relation to the population living in these areas, a study was carried out in the zone of Taliouine, in the Anti-Atlas. The vulnerability of crop productions to climate change was analysed and the different ways of adaptation adopted by farmers were identified. The work was done on saffron, the most profitable crop in the target area even though it requires much water. Our results show that the majority of the farmers surveyed had noticed variations in the climate of the region: irregularity of precipitation leading to a decrease in quantity and an uneven distribution throughout the year; rise in temperature; reduction in the cold period and less snow. These variations had impacts on the cropping system of saffron and its productivity. To cope with these effects, the farmers adopted various strategies: better management and use of water; diversification of agricultural activities; increase in the contribution of non-agricultural activities to their gross income; and seasonal migration.","[Aziz, Larbi; Sadok, Widad] Ecole Natl Agr Meknes, Rabat, Morocco",,"Aziz, L (corresponding author), Ecole Natl Agr Meknes, Rabat, Morocco.",,,,,,,,0,4,4,4,15,IGA-ASSOC DIFFUSION RECHERCHE ALPINE,GRENOBLE,"14 BIS AVENUE MARIE REYNOARD, GRENOBLE, 38100, FRANCE",0035-1121,,,REV GEOGR ALP,Rev.

In this paper, we presented a systematic approach for adaptation stocktaking, combining a systematic mapping and an outcome-oriented and evidence-based assessment, illustrated using the case of The Gambia. This study systematically mapped 24 adaptation options that can potentially inform adaptation planning in The Gambia agriculture and food systems and assessed how the identified options contribute to the pillars of Climate-Smart Agriculture. Because of the paucity of evidence sources from The Gambia, we collated evidence from both The Gambia and the West Africa region. We found that many of the documented options, such as climate-resilient crop varieties, crop diversification, climate information use, and weather indexed-based insurance have the potential to increase agricultural productivity and income while building resilience to climate change. While several options, such as soil and water conservation practices can positively contribute to climate change mitigation, others such as manure and inorganic fertilizers can have no or negative impacts on mitigation. Agroforestry practices and System of Rice Intensification have the potential to make a triple impact. The paucity of evidence from The Gambia and the highly contextual and differential impacts of the identified adaptation options underscore the importance of careful consideration of barriers and enablers when developing and deploying policy and interventions to sustainably increase productivity and income while building resilience to climate risks and reducing GHGs emissions. Stakeholder engagement and participatory research action are crucial in selecting and testing the priority adaptation options which can maximize their potentials in specific agricultural and food system contexts, such as in The Gambia. Because of the heterogeneity in household vulnerability and socioecological circumstances, targeting options to the right contexts will also be crucial to avoid maladaptation. We highlighted key knowledge gaps in the understanding of the effectiveness and feasibility of the identified adaptation options in The Gambia. Beyond The Gambia, the approach can also be useful for and replicated in other least developed countries in the West African region, that are currently developing their National Adaptation Plan.","[Segnon, Alcade C.; Zougmore, Robert B.; Houessionon, Prosper] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Bamako, Mali; [Segnon, Alcade C.; Zougmore, Robert B.] Alliance Biovers Int & Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Dakar, Senegal; [Segnon, Alcade C.] Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Agron Sci, Cotonou, Benin; [Green, Rosemary; Carr, Tony W.; Scheelbeek, Pauline F.

These are capable of contributing to the realization of sustainable development goals through averting food and nutritional insecurity,increasing and sustaining yields that translate into increased incomes and later reduced poverty. This is because CSAPs enable farmers to adapt and mitigate climate change effects. However, due to inappropriate communication of CSAPs to the farmers, to date, some farmers still see no escape route from the frightening effects of climate change and they are currently adopting a rather fatalistic attitude. This study investigated the information dissemination pathways used by different categories of smallholder potato farmers for and practice of CSAPs. It found a difference between information sources and practice of CSAPs at a 5% level of significance (chi(2) = 100.12139, df = 2, p < 0.05, Cramer's V = 1.0), and a difference in the use of the three information dissemination pathways between men and women at a 5% level of significance (chi(2) = 6.05949, df = 2, p < 0.05, Cramer's V = 0.17406). The three information dissemination pathways included media, neighbors and friends, and extension officers.

Identification of technical, institutional and policy interventions as coping and adaptation strategies and exploring risks of their adoption for smallholder farms are the important areas to consider. The aim of the present study was to carry out an in-depth analysis of adaptation strategies followed and the associated risk premium in technology adoption. Design/methodology/approach - The study was carried out in the dryland systems of three Indian states - Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Rajasthan - and was based on a survey of 1,019 households in 2013. The flexible moment-based approach was used for estimating the stochastic production function, which allowed estimation of the relative risk premium that farmers are willing to pay while adopting the technologies to avoid crop production risks. Findings - In all the three states, the risk premium (INR ha(-1)) was higher for farm mechanization compared to supplemental irrigation, except in the case of Andhra Pradesh. The higher the level of technology adoption, the higher the risk premium that households have to pay. This can be estimated by the higher investment needed to build infrastructure for farm mechanization and supplemental irrigation in the regions. The key determinants of technology adoption in the context of smallholder farmers were climatic shocks, investment in farm infrastructure, location of the farm, farm size, household health status, level of education, married years, expected profit and livestock ownership. Originality/value - Quantification of the risk premium in technology adoption and conducting associated awareness programs for farmers and decision-makers are important to strengthen evidence-based adoption decisions in the dryland systems of India.","[Kakumanu, Krishna Reddy; Kuppanan, Palanisami] Int Water Management Inst, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Ranganathan, C.

(Environ Manag 51(2):474-491, 2013) argue that grazing by large ungulates (both native and domestic) should be eliminated or greatly reduced on western public lands to reduce potential climate change impacts. The authors did not present a balanced synthesis of the scientific literature, and their publication is more of an opinion article. Their conclusions do not reflect the complexities associated with herbivore grazing. Because grazing is a complex ecological process, synthesis of the scientific literature can be a challenge. Legacy effects of uncontrolled grazing during the homestead era further complicate analysis of current grazing impacts. Interactions of climate change and grazing will depend on the specific situation. For example, increasing atmospheric CO2 and temperatures may increase accumulation of fine fuels (primarily grasses) and thus increase wildfire risk. Prescribed grazing by livestock is one of the few management tools available for reducing fine fuel accumulation. While there are certainly points on the landscape where herbivore impacts can be identified, there are also vast grazed areas where impacts are minimal. Broad scale reduction of domestic and wild herbivores to help native plant communities cope with climate change will be unnecessary because over the past 20-50 years land managers have actively sought to bring populations of native and domestic herbivores in balance with the potential of vegetation and soils. To cope with a changing climate, land managers will need access to all available vegetation management tools, including grazing.","[Svejcar, Tony; Boyd, Chad; Davies, Kirk; Madsen, Matthew; Bates, Jon; Sheley, Roger] ARS, USDA, Burns, OR 97720 USA; [Marlow, Clayton] Montana State Univ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Bohnert, David] Oregon State Univ, Burns, OR 97720 USA; [Borman, Mike; Mata-Gonzalez, Ricardo; Buckhouse, John] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Stringham, Tamzen; Perryman, Barry; Swanson, Sherman] Univ Nevada, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Tate, Kenneth; George, Mel] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Ruyle, George] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Roundy, Bruce] Brigham Young Univ, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Call, Chris] Utah State Univ, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Jensen, Kevin] Utah State Univ, ARS, USDA, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Launchbaugh, Karen] Univ Idaho, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Gearhart, Amanda] Univ Idaho, Twin Falls, ID 83303 USA; [Vermeire, Lance] ARS, USDA, Miles City, MT 59301 USA; [Tanaka, John] Univ Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Derner, Justin] ARS, USDA, Cheyenne, WY 82009 USA; [Frasier, Gary] ARS, USDA, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Havstad, Kris] ARS, USDA, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; Oregon State University; Oregon State University; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Arizona; Brigham Young University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Idaho; University of Idaho; Idaho; University of Idaho; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Wyoming; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Svejcar, T (corresponding author), ARS, USDA, 67826-A Hwy 205, Burns, OR 97720 USA.",tony.svejcar@oregonstate.edu; cmarlow@montana.edu,"Madsen, Matthew/AAV-7493-2020","Madsen, Matthew/0000-0003-1398-8655; Vermeire, Lance/0000-0001-9147-0099; Derner, Justin/0000-0001-8076-0736","ARS [ARS-0422620, 813252] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",ARS(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service),,,21,15,15,0,42,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0364-152X,1432-1009,,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

This article is addressing learning-knowledge-action processes within and between local (municipal) and central (national and regional) government levels, thereby filling a gap in the literature. The analysis is using empirical data from Norway; a country commonly considered as having a well-developed multi-level governance system, with a strong bottom-up component, thereby apparently meeting a core condition for developing and implementing transformational changes. The study finds that single and double-loop learning are dominating, fostering incremental changes, but combined incremental changes related to technically handling surface water are approaching transitional change. As a first step, the study suggests it is necessary to formulate policies that explicitly combe incremental changes in order to achieve transitional and transformational change. Moreover, policies for fostering oppositional knowledge networks as part of vertical-horizontal governance may be necessary for pushing the system in the direction of transition and transformation.","[Orderud, G.

In the Iberian Peninsula rice was introduced in the 10th Century. Today Iberian rice accounts for about one quarter of the total rice production of the European Union, almost exclusively cultivated in the coastal wetlands of Spain, with permanent flooding. The intensive water management required to produce rice stands at a crucial point since freshwater supply is deteriorating at an unprecedented rate. Here we explore flexible adaptation options to climate change in the Doana wetlands - a world heritage and biodiversity site - from two points of view: What are the policy options for agricultural water management in view of climate change? How can informed stakeholders contribute to better adaptation? The first question is addressed by simulating water availability to farmers with the WAAPA model under a range of adaptation policy options derived from the view of the local communities. The second question was addressed by means of participatory research. Adaptation options are framed according to the local environmental, social and policy context. Results suggest that perception on the potential role of new water infrastructure and farming subsidies dominates the view of local communities. The choices of the stakeholders that could be simulated with the hydrological model, were quantified in terms of additional water availability for the rice farming, therefore providing a quantitative measure to the qualitative solutions. Information provided during the study shaped the final adaptation options developed.

Households feel the effects of changing rainfall patterns, droughts, cyclones, floods and increased temperatures, and draw on a wide range of resources to adapt but some households are better equipped than others. We explore the extent to which smallholder rural households might be able to adapt to the processes of increased climate variability or climate change through assessing their adaptive capacity using elements of the rural livelihoods framework. We involved almost 600 participants in discussions and interviews in India, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Lao PDR to explore the factors that condition their ability to adapt. We identified 36 key indicators of adaptive capacity, half were specifically related to climate change or climate variability, with others recognized as important in terms of overall livelihoods. Experience, health and labour (Human capital), access to market and farmer networks/groups (Social capital) were considered strongly enabling of adaptation, whereas lack of training (Human capital) and soil quality/condition (Natural capital) constrained adaptation. It takes time for households to recover from climatic events, but, households with better access to diverse resources, and a more balanced livelihood portfolio were better able to cope. Mechanisms to support adaptation involved supporting farmer groups, novel information networks, better access to markets and value chains, land ownership, improved financial and economic management, and credit options.","[Brown, Peter R.] CSIRO Agr & Food, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Afroz, Sharmin; Khan, Iqbal] Socio Econ Res & Dev Initiat, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Chialue, Lytoua; Sacklokham, Silinthone] Natl Univ Laos, Viangchan, Laos; [Chiranjeevi, T.; Reddy, V.

Reducing the vulnerability and increasing the resilience of these systems has thus becomes a focus of research, disaster planning, and policy-making. Seaports, located in environmentally sensitive, high-risk locations, are particularly vulnerable to severe storms and the increased sea levels resulting from such climate changes. Planning and policy making for seaports must therefore consider the human factor, that is the population potentially vulnerable to climate change induced events and also the complex network of stakeholders that depend on their functionality. An increasing body of literature suggests that, for planners to be effective in increasing resiliency of social-environmental systems to climate change-related events and other hazards, they must understand and incorporate the perceptions and concerns of the stakeholders in their assessment and planning processes. This study uses empirical evidence collected through case studies of two particularly exposed ports in the US: Gulfport (Mississippi) and Providence (Rhode Island), in order to examine how port stakeholders such as port operators, municipal planners, port tenants, and coastal managers, perceive storm impacts and the seaport's vulnerability, and how their planning and policy making address these perceived concerns. Results suggest the following: (1) Port stakeholders of Gulfport (MS) and Providence (RI) identified a wide range of direct damages, indirect costs, and intangible consequences of a hurricane hitting the port; (2) these impacts would result in costs that would be borne by all port stakeholders as well as society as a whole; and (3) in Providence and Gulfport, plans and policies that address storm resilience for the ports did not include the concerns of many stakeholders.

This study focuses on the Bogota Humana development plan (2012-2016) in which Bogota, a regional leader in resilience planning, first tied its resettlement policy to a broader adaptation strategy. Specifically, the study analyzes the creation of a new municipal subsidy to finance resettlements in the context of Bogota's complex and uneven geography of risk. Data for the study was collected through a household survey of program participants, interviews of city officials, site visits in Bogota and a review of Colombian census data. The study finds that despite the unprecedented size of the city's investment in resettlements during this period, it largely failed to meet the plan's goals. Its uniform financing and large-scale resettlement strategy failed to account for varying levels of risk produced by informal development. Consequently, Bogota Humana's climate resettlements resulted in an inconsistent process generating resistance among residents.","[Sarmiento, Hugo] Univ Illinois, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, 611 Lorado Taft Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Sarmiento, H (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, 611 Lorado Taft Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",hugos@illinois.edu,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0735-2166,1467-9906,,J URBAN AFF,J.

In this study, we explored how the removal of federal subsidies impacts coastal development patterns by measuring the causal effect of the US Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) on building activity. Implemented in 1982, CBRA withdrew eligibility for federal funding for infrastructure, post-disaster assistance, and subsidized flood insurance along designated sections of coastal barriers (CBRA units). Using a novel built-structures dataset, we employed a spatial regression discontinuity design to compare development rates within and outside of CBRA units in 1980 and 2016. We found that enactment of the CBRA has resulted in significant reductions in development activity: indeed, development rates were reduced by more than 75% in CBRA areas as compared to non-CBRA areas. Our findings suggest that policies like CBRA can be effective at slowing development in other sensitive or hazardous areas, and could help to preserve natural environments for habitat conservation and climate adaptation purposes.","[Branham, Jordan; Kaza, Nikhil; BenDor, Todd K.] Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Salvesen, David] Univ N Carolina, Inst Environm, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Onda, Kyle] Lincoln Inst Land Policy, Ctr Geospatial Solut, Cambridge, MA USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Branham, J (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.",jordan.branham@unc.edu,,,"US National Science Foundation [1660450, 1427188]",US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This paper is based upon work supported by the US National Science Foundation under Dgrant #1660450 and Coastal SEES grant #1427188.

We provide high resolution estimates of the economic value of mangroves forests for flood risk reduction every 20 km worldwide. We develop a probabilistic, process-based valuation of the effects of mangroves on averting damages to people and property. We couple spatially-explicit 2-D hydrodynamic analyses with economic models, and find that mangroves provide flood protection benefits exceeding $US 65 billion per year. If mangroves were lost, 15 million more people would be flooded annually across the world. Some of the nations that receive the greatest economic benefits include the USA, China, India and Mexico. Vietnam, India and Bangladesh receive the greatest benefits in terms of people protected. Many (>45) 20-km coastal stretches particularly those near cities receive more than $US 250 million annually in flood protection benefits from mangroves. These results demonstrate the value of mangroves as natural coastal defenses at global, national and local scales, which can inform incentives for mangrove conservation and restoration in development, climate adaptation, disaster risk reduction and insurance.","[Menendez, Pelayo; Losada, Inigo J.; Torres-Ortega, Saul] Univ Cantabria, IHCantabria Inst Hidraul Ambiental, Santander 39011, Spain; [Menendez, Pelayo; Narayan, Siddharth; Beck, Michael W.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95062 USA; [Beck, Michael W.] Nature Conservancy, Santa Cruz, CA 95062 USA; [Narayan, Siddharth] East Carolina Univ, Dept Coastal Studies, 850-NC 345, Wanchese, NC 27959 USA",Universidad de Cantabria; IHCantabria - Instituto de Hidraulica Ambiental de la Universidad de Cantabria; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Nature Conservancy; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University,"Menendez, P (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, IHCantabria Inst Hidraul Ambiental, Santander 39011, Spain.;Menendez, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95062 USA.",pemenend@ucsc.edu,"Torres-Ortega, Saúl/J-4947-2019","Torres-Ortega, Saúl/0000-0003-0619-2608; Menendez Fernandez, Pelayo/0000-0003-4761-3069; Beck, Michael/0000-0002-5107-9973","World Bank; Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Innovation [BIA2014-59718-R, BES-2015-074343]; National Plan RISKOADAPT from the Spanish Ministry of Sciences, Innovation and Universities [BIA2017-89401-R]","World Bank(The World Bank India); Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Innovation(Spanish Government); National Plan RISKOADAPT from the Spanish Ministry of Sciences, Innovation and Universities","We thank the supporting provided by the World Bank and the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) on the basis of a decision adopted by the German Bundestag.

However, wider governance regimes consistently attempt to upscale Indigenous initiatives into their own culturally governed frameworks - or ignore them totally as they don't fit within neoliberal policy regimes.

We did the household level survey (n = 1346) in the 77 representative villages of Beas, Bhagirathi and Teesta basin of the IHR. We found that although 80% of the surveyed household had access to Liquidified Petroleum Gas (LPG), their dependency on common pool resources for energy security still exists, depending on the altitude, size of the family, dependent members, education and occupation of the family members and adult cattle unit present with the household. The fuelwood and fodder harvest varied between the three basins and also increases along the altitudinal gradient. The biomass harvest is linked with the forest degradation and attributed to more carbon emission along with the rural health. Most of the surveyed villages of Beas and Teesta basin lacked sufficient forest cover for sustainable harvesting of fuel-wood and fodder.

The approach used here illustrates the importance of considering uncertainty in future climate projections, at the same time providing robust and simple to interpret information for decision-makers. By quantifying current and future exposure of Royal Gala apple to damaging temperature extremes across ten important pome fruit-growing locations in Australia, differences in impact to ripening fruit are highlighted, with, by the end of the twenty-first century, some locations maintaining no sunburn browning risk, while others potentially experiencing the risk for the majority of the January ripening period. Installation of over-tree netting can reduce the impact of sunburn browning. The benefits from employing this management option varied across the ten study locations. The two approaches explored to assist decision-makers assess this information (a) using sunburn browning risk analogues and (b) through identifying hypothetical sunburn browning risk thresholds, resulted in varying recommendations for introducing over-tree netting. These recommendations were location and future time period dependent with some sites showing no benefit for sunburn protection from nets even by the end of the twenty-first century and others already deriving benefits from employing this adaptation option. Potential best and worst cases of sunburn browning risk and its potential reduction through introduction of over-tree nets were explored. The range of results presented highlights the importance of addressing uncertainty in climate projections that result from different global climate models and possible future emission pathways.","[Webb, Leanne; Darbyshire, Rebecca] Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Erwin, Tim] CSIRO, Oceans & Atmosphere, PMB 1, Aspendale, Vic, Australia; [Goodwin, Ian] Dept Econ Dev Jobs Transport & Resources, Tatura, Australia",University of Melbourne; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Darbyshire, R (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia.",rebecca.darbyshire@dpi.nsw.gov.au,"Darbyshire, Rebecca/AAI-3945-2021; Erwin, Tim A/C-7416-2016","Erwin, Tim A/0000-0002-4479-6878; Darbyshire, Rebecca/0000-0003-4712-8514",Australian Department of Agriculture and Water Resources,Australian Department of Agriculture and Water Resources(Australian Government),Funding for this research was provided by the Australian Department of Agriculture and Water Resources.,,50,4,5,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0020-7128,1432-1254,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

We synthesize existing literature to identify three fundamental questions that correspond to three distinct areas of knowledge necessary to understand farmer behaviour: 1) decision-making model; 2) cross-scale and cross-level pressures; and 3) temporal dynamics. We use this framework to compare five interdisciplinary case studies of agricultural systems in distinct geographical contexts across the globe. We find that these three areas of knowledge are important to understanding farmer behaviour, and can be used to guide the interdisciplinary design and interpretation of studies in the future. Most importantly, we find that these three areas need to be addressed simultaneously in order to understand farmer behaviour. We also identify three methodological challenges hindering this understanding: the suitability of theoretical frameworks, the trade-offs among methods and the limited timeframe of typical research projects. We propose that a triangulation research strategy that makes use of mixed methods, or collaborations between researchers across mixed disciplines, can be used to successfully address all three areas simultaneously and show how this strategy has been achieved in the case studies. The framework facilitates interdisciplinary research on farmer behaviour by opening up spaces of structured dialogue on assumptions, research questions and methods employed in investigation.

The temporal sequence of the first few milliseconds of visual stimulus processing sheds light on the historically ambiguous topic of aesthetic experience. Automatic fractal processing triggers initial attraction/avoidance evaluations of an environment's salubriousness, and its potentially positive or negative impacts upon an individual. As repeated cycles of visual perception occur, the attractiveness of urban form affects the user experience much more than had been previously suspected. These perceptual mechanisms promote walkability and intuitive navigation, and so they support the urban and civic interactions for which we establish communities and cities in the first place. Therefore, the use of multiple fractals needs to reintegrate with biophilic and traditional architecture in urban design for their proven positive effects on health and well-being. Such benefits include striking reductions in observers' stress and mental fatigue. Due to their costs to individual well-being, urban performance, environmental quality, and climatic adaptation, this paper recommends that nontraditional styles should be hereafter applied judiciously to the built environment.","[Brielmann, Aenne A.] Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Dept Computat Neurosci, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Buras, Nir H.] Class Planning Inst, Washington, DC 20007 USA; [Salingaros, Nikos A.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Math, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Taylor, Richard P.] Univ Oregon, Phys Dept, Eugene, OR 97405 USA",Max Planck Society; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); University of Oregon,"Salingaros, NA (corresponding author), Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Math, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",aenne.brielmann@tuebingen.mpg.de; nburas@classicplanning.com; salingar@gmail.com; rpt@uoregon.edu,,"Salingaros, Nikos/0000-0002-8856-9175","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [461354985]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This research received no external funding A.B. was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) #461354985.",,235,6,6,17,36,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2413-8851,,URBAN SCI,Urban Sci.,MAR,2022,6,1,,,,,,,3,10.3390/urbansci6010003,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/urbansci6010003,,,35,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,0B0AZ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000774307900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the individual influences remain unclear, leaving a great gap for understanding the mechanism of air pollution evolution and supporting the environment management. We estimate the annual variation using statistical methods and satellite observations at global scale from 2001 to 2016 Results show that significant variation of annual aerosol occurs over 13.6% of land areas, in which a perturbation of aerosol may cause 0.58 +/- 0.45 times change in the next phase. Initial aerosol and climate influences contribute 48.4-51.6% of the total variation, respectively. Specifically, the influences of precipitation, air temperature and surface temperature represent 0.1, 18.3 and 33.2% of the total variation. Physically, the observed variation is strongly correlated with fine mode aerosols, radiative scattering and warm/hot summers in temperate and cold zones. The environmental management therefore should implement cause-oriented strategies for emission control or climatic adaption.","[Feng, Huihui; Ding, Ying; Zou, Bin] Cent South Univ, Sch Geosci & Infophys, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Feng, Huihui; Zou, Bin] Chinese Minist Educ, Key Lab Metallogen Predict Nonferrous Met & Geol, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Chuanfeng] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central South University; Beijing Normal University,"Zou, B (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Geosci & Infophys, Changsha, Peoples R China.;Zou, B (corresponding author), Chinese Minist Educ, Key Lab Metallogen Predict Nonferrous Met & Geol, Changsha, Peoples R China.;Zhao, CF (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",210010@csu.edu.cn; czhao@bnu.edu.cn,,"Ding, Ying/0000-0002-3532-7260",National Natural Science Foundation of China [42071378]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2020JJ3045],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province),Funding This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42071378) and the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (No. 2020JJ3045).,,32,0,0,6,20,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

It is argued that the co-creation process comprises various interlinked stages, corresponding stakeholders, and subsequent methods and tools that need to be mapped and integrated across all stages. In this study, a Life Cycle Co-Creation Process (LCCCP) for NBS is developed, building on continuous improvement cycles and Design Thinking methodologies, and for which the stages and substages, involved stakeholders and engagement methods and tools are mapped and defined. For stakeholders, the actors of an Urban Living Lab (ULL) are adapted to the LCCCP; for the engagement methods and tools, the goals of stakeholder engagement are used as a guide to select examples of co-creation methods and tools.

To learn from the Ethiopian approach, this paper examines to what extent health has been integrated into the CRGE. We found that the early years of the CRGE prioritized developing the financial basis of the green economy, while the health impacts of climate change have only been tentatively considered to date and remain detached from broader health strategies.

Global climate change raises the concern of public health under future extreme events, yet spatiotemporal population dynamics have been long overlooked in health risk assessments. Here, we show that the diurnal intra-urban movement alters residents' exposure to extreme temperatures during cold and heat waves. To do so, we incorporate weather simulations with commute-adjusted population profiles over 16 major U.S. metropolitan areas. Urban residents' exposure to heat waves is intensified by 1.9 degrees +/- 0.7 degrees C (mean +/- SD among cities), and their exposure to cold waves is attenuated by 0.6 degrees +/- 0.8 degrees C. The higher than expected exposure to heat waves significantly correlates with the spatial temperature variability and requires serious attention. The essential role of population dynamics should be emphasized in temperature-related climate adaptation strategies for effective and successful interventions.","[Yang, Jiachuan] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Hu, Leiqiu] Univ Alabama, Dept Atmospher & Earth Sci, Huntsville, AL 35805 USA; [Wang, Chenghao] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainable Engn & Built Environm, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Huntsville; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Yang, JC (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Hu, LQ (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Atmospher & Earth Sci, Huntsville, AL 35805 USA.",cejcyang@ust.hk; leiqiu.hu@uah.edu,"Jiachuan, Yang/ABE-5045-2020; Wang, Chenghao/O-7961-2017","Wang, Chenghao/0000-0001-8846-4130; yang, jiachuan/0000-0002-3890-5628; Hu, Leiqiu/0000-0002-1867-2521","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; New Faculty Research Program at The University of Alabama in Huntsville, USA","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; New Faculty Research Program at The University of Alabama in Huntsville, USA","This work was supported by the initiation grant from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the New Faculty Research Program at The University of Alabama in Huntsville, USA.",,35,28,28,9,43,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA",2375-2548,,,SCI ADV,Sci.

This is likely to lead to misrepresentation of impacts, and consequently to poor decisions about climate adaptation. However, no published research assesses the differences between impacts simulated by single-sector and integrated models. Here we compare 14 indicators derived from a set of impact models run within single-sector and integrated frameworks across a range of climate and socio-economic scenarios in Europe. We show that single-sector studies misrepresent the spatial pattern, direction and magnitude of most impacts because they omit the complex interdependencies within human and environmental systems. The discrepancies are particularly pronounced for indicators such as food production and water exploitation, which are highly influenced by other sectors through changes in demand, land suitability and resource competition. Furthermore, the discrepancies are greater under different socio-economic scenarios than different climate scenarios, and at the sub-regional rather than Europe-wide scale.","[Harrison, Paula A.; Dunford, Robert W.] Lancaster Environm Ctr, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Lib Ave, Lancaster LA1 4AP, England; [Harrison, Paula A.; Dunford, Robert W.] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Holman, Ian P.] Cranfield Univ, Cranfield Water Sci Inst, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England; [Rounsevell, Mark D.

Results indicate that citizens of wealthier countries tend to see climate change as the most important problem, but are less likely to rank it as a highly dangerous threat. We find that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita correlates positively with perceived importance of climate change, but negatively with perceived risk. Also, climate change is less likely to be seen as highly dangerous in those countries that are better prepared for climate change. These findings have important implications for climate adaptation. The relatively weaker sense of danger among the wealthiest societies may eventually lead to maladaptation to climate change. Adequate economic resources provide people collective security and protection from impending crises, but could elevate a self-assuring attitude that might prematurely reduce their caution toward the impending threat and capacity for dealing with climate uncertainties.","[Lo, Alex Y.] Univ Hong Kong, Kadoorie Inst, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chow, Alex T.] Clemson Univ, Baruch Inst Coastal Ecol & Forest Sci, Georgetown, SC 29442 USA",University of Hong Kong; Clemson University,"Lo, AY (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Kadoorie Inst, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",alexloyh@hku.hk,"Chow, Alex/S-8737-2016; Lo, Alex/B-7948-2008","Chow, Alex/0000-0001-7441-8934; Lo, Alex/0000-0002-5953-4176",Griffith Climate Change Response Program at Griffith University; NIFA/USDA [SC-1700489],Griffith Climate Change Response Program at Griffith University; NIFA/USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),The authors thank the editors and the four anonymous reviewers of Climatic Change for their useful comments and suggestions.

It now raises fundamental interdisciplinary issues of risk and uncertainty analysis and communication. The growing scientific consensus over the anthropogenic causes of climate change appears to sit at odds with the increasing use of risk discourses in policy: for example, to aid in climate adaptation decision making. All of this points to a need for a fundamental revision of our conceptualization of what it is to do climate risk communication. This Special Collection comprises seven papers stimulated by a workshop on Climate Risk Perceptions and Communication held at Cumberland Lodge Windsor in 2010. Topics addressed include climate uncertainties, images and the media, communication and public engagement, uncertainty transfer in climate communication, the role of emotions, localization of hazard impacts, and longitudinal analyses of climate perceptions. Climate change risk perceptions and communication work is critical for future climate policy and decisions.","[Pidgeon, Nick] Cardiff Univ, Tyndall Ctr Cardiff, Understanding Risk Res Grp, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales; [Pidgeon, Nick] Cardiff Univ, Climate Change Consortium C3W Wales, Sch Psychol, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University; Cardiff University,"Pidgeon, N (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Tyndall Ctr Cardiff, Understanding Risk Res Grp, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales.",PidgeonN@cardiff.ac.uk,,,"Economic and Social Research Council [RES-066-27-0013]; Leverhulme Trust [F/00407/AG]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F037511/1, not_applicable] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G007748/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/F037511/1, not_applicable] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [NE/G007748/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This editorial, Special Collection, and the associated Cumberland Lodge workshop were supported by an Economic and Social Research Council Climate Leader Professorial Fellowship to Nick Pidgeon (RES-066-27-0013), with additional support coming from the Leverhulme Trust (F/00407/AG).

The present research aims to understand how the effects of climate change in coastal areas have been addressed in the Brazilian policies and normative framework. A thorough review was carried out to identify and evaluate the main legislative documents and proposed management instruments available. Although only about half of the documents include detailed and explicit coastal guidelines, the analyzed normative framework presented a comprehensive scope that enables managers to tailor actions to their particular needs on the littoral. Policies addressing climate challenges are concentrated on a national scale. For instance, financial support actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions stand out, such as the economic resources presented by the National Climate Change Fund. Along the same lines, both the National Disaster Protection Policy and the Sectoral Plan for Sea Resources point out how the process of climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction is fundamentally related to financial investment in Marine Sciences and the permanent ocean and meteorological monitoring. Regarding the management instruments, only 13 are currently implemented, of which 10 explicitly address climate change. As an example, the Federal Coastal Zone Action Plan aims to establish future scenarios and subsidize adaptation strategies. In the state of Santa Catarina, the State Policy on Climate Change stands out as one of the most comprehensive available pieces of legislation, even though not specifically designed for the coastal zone.","[de Lima, Andre de Souza; Scherer, Marinez Eymael Garcia; Bonetti, Jarbas] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Ctr Filosofia & Ciencias Humanas, Dept Geociencias, Programa Posgrad Geog, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Scherer, Marinez Eymael Garcia; Bonetti, Jarbas] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Ctr Ciencias Fis & Matemat, Coordenadoria Especial Oceanog, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Gandra, Tiago Borges Ribeiro] Inst Fed Educ Ciencia & Tecnol Rio Grande, Rio Grande, SC, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC),"de Lima, AD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Ctr Filosofia & Ciencias Humanas, Dept Geociencias, Programa Posgrad Geog, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",geoandrelima@gmail.com,"Scherer, Marinez/HIU-0273-2022; Bonetti, Jarbas/M-4140-2019; de Lima, Andre de Souza/T-9130-2017; Gandra, Tiago/O-6251-2017","Bonetti, Jarbas/0000-0003-4564-251X; Scherer, Marinez/0000-0002-3059-0019; de Lima, Andre de Souza/0000-0002-3771-3181; Gandra, Tiago/0000-0002-7165-770X",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES) [001]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) [306633/2019-1],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),This study was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES) -Finance Code 001 and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) -Grant 306633/2019-1.,,69,1,1,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

This research theme has gained prominence due to the realisation that climatic changes will likely compromise human welfare and community stability, with significant implications for governments' security agendas. The Indo-Pacific region is an important case study for understanding climate security given its ongoing environmental and developmental challenges and the cultural, political and economic tensions existing within and between neighbouring countries. This paper presents a systematic review and synthesis of academic and grey literatures that address climate adaptation, disaster management or regional security in the Indo-Pacific. From this review, we identify four key themes that arise prominently in discussion and analysis prepared by academic scholars, governments and non-government organisations alike. The ubiquity of these themes speaks to the interdependent nature of the adaptation, disaster management and security challenges. The literature is in agreement that maintaining and enhancing climate security in the Indo-Pacific will depend on the region's capacity to strategically coordinate between the activities of governments, industry and communities; the willingness of governments to meaningfully cooperate with communities and each other despite existing tensions; governments' ability to manage limited resources efficiently; and their capacity to identify and address climate-maladaptive path dependencies. We highlight the most popular prescriptions for addressing these concurrent challenges at the current time. We argue that these prescriptions warrant further research and will likely have broader applicability for addressing climate security challenges in other regions of the world.","[Tangney, Peter; Nettle, Claire; Clarke, Beverley; Star, Cassandra] Flinders Univ S Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Newman, Joshua] Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Flinders University South Australia; Monash University,"Tangney, P (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",peter.tangney@flinders.edu.au,"; Tangney, Peter/O-2153-2015; Clarke, Beverley/E-8999-2015","Star, Cassandra/0000-0003-2648-6603; Tangney, Peter/0000-0003-3878-4034; Clarke, Beverley/0000-0001-5904-6845; Nettle, Claire/0000-0003-0024-1165","Australian Federal Government, Department of Defence","Australian Federal Government, Department of Defence","The research described in this paper was funded by the Australian Federal Government, Department of Defence.",,164,3,3,5,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

When evaluating policies using such models, the costs and benefits are typically aggregated across all actors in the system, and over the entire planning horizon. While a policy may be beneficial when considering the aggregate outcome, it can be harmful to some people, somewhere, at some point in time. The practice of aggregating over all actors and over time thus gives rise to problems of justice; it could also exacerbate existing injustices. While the literature discusses some of these injustices in ad-hoc and case specific manner, a systematic approach for considering distributive justice in model-based climate change planning is lacking. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing 11 requirements that an Integrated Assessment Model should meet in order to enable the assessment of distributive justice in climate mitigation and adaptation policies. We derive the requirements from various ethical imperatives stemming from the theory of distributive justice. More specifically, we consider both intra-generational (among people within one generation) and intergenerational (between generations) distributive justice. We investigate to what extent the 11 requirements are being met in recent model-based climate planning studies, and highlight several directions for future research to advance the accounting for distributive justice in model-based support for climate change planning.

Multivariate probit model was adopted for data analysis. The most perceived climate risks include rising temperature, prolonged dry season, and unpredictability of rainfall. Reliance on climate information, storing of (paddy and milled) rice, selling-off purchased (paddy and milled) rice, buying (paddy and milled) rice for sale in small quantities and livelihood diversification were the climate adaptation strategies adopted by rice sellers. We found that socio-economic characteristics and government support influenced choice of adaptation. The main barriers of adaptation include inadequate capital, inadequate storage facilities, price fluctuation and high transportation cost. Government should intensify efforts in providing basic infrastructure in rural areas. Also, efforts should be made to initiate effective climate and market information networks, encourage formation of cooperatives and provision of loans to rice traders.","[Onyeneke, Robert Ugochukwu; Amadi, Mark Umunna; Njoku, Chukwudi Loveday] Alex Ekwueme Fed Univ Ndufu Alike, Dept Agr, Agr Econ & Extens Programme, Abakaliki, Nigeria",,"Onyeneke, RU (corresponding author), Alex Ekwueme Fed Univ Ndufu Alike, Dept Agr, Agr Econ & Extens Programme, Abakaliki, Nigeria.",robertonyeneke@yahoo.com; mikkmore@yahoo.com; chukzy4now1980@gmail.com,,,Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TET Fund) of the Federal Republic of Nigeria [FUNAI/FA/BI/ 18/002]; TET Fund,Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TET Fund) of the Federal Republic of Nigeria; TET Fund,This paper is part of the output of the research funded by the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TET Fund) of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

First, we investigate ethnographic approaches to climate science knowledge production, particularly around epistemic authority, visioning of futures, and engagements with the material world. Second, we consider climate adaptation studies that critically examine discourses and activities surrounding concepts of vulnerability, subjectivities, and resilience. Third, we analyze climate mitigation, including energy transitions, technological optimism, market-based solutions, and other ways of living in a carbon-constrained world.

We develop modelling steps to i) simulate observation of a multi-dimensional climate system, ii) apply updating rules for beliefs about climate trends, iii) evaluate the performance of adaptive strategies, and iv) apply (i)-(iii) at the local and forest landscape scale to find and compare individual versus joint adaptive decisions. We search for optimal forest management decisions maximizing total biomass production as a measure of management performance. The results illustrate the benefits of updating beliefs to eventually utilize the positive effects and limit negative impacts of climate change on forest biomass production. We find that adaptive decision-making results in switching decisions over time and mostly differ from deterministic decisions ignoring any change in climate. Moreover, we find that the adaptation strategies are indispensable not only because of climate change but also because of the development of the forest biological system over time and the need to revisit decisions.

Differences make comparisons in environmental risk perceptions and responses particularly interesting and valuable, with obtained similarities being in many ways more interesting than found differences, which might be readily expected in places with remarkable geographical and demographic differences. People's perception of climatic risks and hazards appears to be important to understand the context in which adaptation strategies to climate change emerge. Our intention, rather than compare the two case studies at the local scale, one in Mexico and one in Spain, is to identify existing common mechanisms to perceive climate change and to address adaptation among two very different geographical and cultural contexts. The study aims first to explore people's perceptions of climate change and its outcomes; second to analyse the adaptation measures that they have developed and develop some preliminary ideas about their strategies; and third to consider the capacity of people to cope and adapt endogenously, in terms of the measures that people think that their governments should take to enhance/strengthen them at the local scale.","[Campos, Minerva; Gonzalez-Puente, Marc] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientales, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [McCall, Michael K.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Invest Geog, Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico; [McCall, Michael K.] Univ Twente, ITC Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; University of Twente,"Campos, M (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientales, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",mine.campos.sanchez@gmail.com,"González-Puente, Marc/Z-5218-2019; McCall, Michael Keith/A-9050-2012; Michael, Keith/GPK-2534-2022","González-Puente, Marc/0000-0002-7734-9548; McCall, Michael Keith/0000-0002-6405-3369; Campos, Minerva/0000-0001-5929-2827",Support Programme for Research and Technological Innovation Projects (Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica-PAPIIT) DGAPA-IN [307710]; postdoctoral fellowship from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM),Support Programme for Research and Technological Innovation Projects (Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica-PAPIIT) DGAPA-IN; postdoctoral fellowship from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM),"The authors want to thank Marti Boada and Joana Barber for their help and support during fieldwork and workshop in Fogars de Montclus, and to Tito Morales Pinzon and Sara Angrill Toledo for their support to do the statistical analysis.

The main purpose of this research being to determine how policy intervention can most effectively increase adoption. This paper aims to synthesise this past research in order to scale up uptake of farm-level adaptation strategies through a composite index of potential adoption in Africa. In doing so, we review the estimated coefficients of econometric regressions in 42 case studies published in peer-review journals to identify the factors that regularly explain adoption. We find that these common factors can be grouped into seven components, that is human capital, financial resources, infrastructure and technology, social interaction and governance, food security, dependence on agriculture and attitudes towards the environment. Using national-level indicators of these seven categories, we develop a composite index to inform potential adoption and test the robustness of the index in an in-depth sensitivity analysis. The results show that the highest likelihood of adoption of farm-level adaptation strategies is in Northern African countries namely Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria and Morocco and in Southern African countries such as South Africa and Botswana. Conversely, they indicate that the lowest likelihood of adoption is situated in nations of the Sahel and Horn of Africa and in nations that have recently experienced conflict. We conclude that adoption is associated predominantly with governance, civil rights, financial resources and education. However, it is not necessarily driven by the magnitude of climate change impacts on agricultural production.","[Garcia de Jalon, Silvestre; Iglesias, Ana] Tech Univ Madrid, Dept Agr Econ & Social Sci, Ave Complutense S-N,Ciudad Univ, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Barnes, Andrew P.] Innovat & Behav Change Scotlands Rural Coll SRUC, West Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"de Jalon, SG (corresponding author), Tech Univ Madrid, Dept Agr Econ & Social Sci, Ave Complutense S-N,Ciudad Univ, Madrid 28040, Spain.",silvestre.jalon@upm.es; ana.iglesias@upm.es; Andrew.Barnes@sruc.ac.uk,"Iglesias, Ana/AEN-3261-2022","Barnes, Andrew/0000-0001-9368-148X",European Commission [KBBE-266018],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),We acknowledge the financial support of the European Commission Animal Change project (contract no.

The Index of Usefulness of Practices for Adaptation (IUPA) allows the user to assign weights and scores to a set of user-defined evaluation criteria. Individual criterion scores are aggregated into a final index value. Both the final value and the individual parameter scores provide useful information for improved decision making in the context of climate change. An innovative aspect of IUPA is that guidance is given to the user through the inclusion of recommendations on evaluation criteria and criterion-specific weight factors. These have been defined by a panel of experts from the Latin-American and Caribbean Region (LAC). Application of the index is demonstrated for an existing adaptation practice from the Coquimbo Region, Chile. The IUPA tool is recommended for use in the evaluation of adaptation practices in their design, implementation and post-implementation phase. It is practical for a quick first assessment or when limited financial resources are available, making the tool especially useful for practitioners in the developing world. The index is flexible both from the perspective of its construction and use. Additional expert opinions can easily be included in the future versions of the tool.","[Debels, P.] Univ Concepcion, Ctr Ciencias Ambientales EULA CHILE, Concepcion, Chile; [Debels, P.] Univ Nacl Ingn, CIEMA, Managua, Nicaragua; [Szlafsztein, C.] Fed Univ Para, Ctr Geociencias, BR-66059 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Aldunce, P.] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Agron, Dept Ciencias Ambientales & Recursos Nat Renovabl, Santiago, Chile; [Neri, C.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Atmosfera, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Carvajal, Y.; Quintero-Angel, M.] Univ Valle, Escuela Ingn Recursos Nat & Ambiente EIDENAR, Cali, Colombia; [Celis, A.] Ctr Estudios Sociales & Ambientales, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Bezanilla, A.] Ctr Fis Atmosfera INSMET, Havana, Cuba; [Martinez, D.] Autoridad Nacl Ambiente Panama, Panama City, Panama; [Martinez, D.] CATHALAC, Panama City, Panama",Universidad de Concepcion; Universidade Federal do Para; Universidad de Chile; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad del Valle,"Debels, P (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Ctr Ciencias Ambientales EULA CHILE, Barrio Univ S-N,POB 160-C, Concepcion, Chile.",pdebels@udec.cl,"szlafsztein, claudio/F-4767-2019; Quintero-Angel, Mauricio/HGU-4435-2022; Szlafsztein, Claudio/G-2153-2011; Aldunce, Paulina/T-2125-2017","szlafsztein, claudio/0000-0002-2855-2056; Aldunce, Paulina/0000-0002-1159-9333; Bezanilla-Morlot, Arnoldo/0000-0001-8586-9116; Quintero-Angel, Mauricio/0000-0003-3680-7458",,,,,51,22,26,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0921-030X,,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

Although fisheries reforms and advances in offshore aquaculture (hereafter 'mariculture') could increase production(2), the true future of seafood depends on human responses to climate change(3). Here we investigated whether coordinated reforms in fisheries and mariculture could increase seafood production per capita under climate change. We find that climate-adaptive fisheries reforms will be necessary but insufficient to maintain global seafood production per capita, even with aggressive reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions. However, the potential for sustainable mariculture to increase seafood per capita is vast and could increase seafood production per capita under all but the most severe emissions scenario. These increases are contingent on fisheries reforms, continued advances in feed technology and the establishment of effective mariculture governance and best practices. Furthermore, dramatically curbing emissions is essential for reducing inequities, increasing reform efficacy and mitigating risks unaccounted for in our analysis. Although climate change will challenge the ocean's ability to meet growing food demands, the ocean could produce more food than it does currently through swift and ambitious action to reduce emissions, reform capture fisheries and expand sustainable mariculture operations.","[Free, Christopher M.; Cabral, Reniel B.; O'Reilly, Erin; Gaines, Steven D.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Free, Christopher M.; Cabral, Reniel B.; O'Reilly, Erin] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Cabral, Reniel B.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Froehlich, Halley E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Environm Studies, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Froehlich, Halley E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Battista, Willow] Environm Def Fund, Oceans Program, San Francisco, CA USA; [Ojea, Elena] CIM Univ Vigo, Future Oceans Lab, Vigo, Spain; [O'Reilly, Erin] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Environm Markets Lab, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Palardy, James E.] Pew Charitable Trusts, Washington, DC USA; [Garcia Molinos, Jorge] Hokkaido Univ, Res Ctr, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Garcia Molinos, Jorge] Hokkaido Univ, Sch Environm Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Garcia Molinos, Jorge] Hokkaido Univ, Global Inst Collaborat Res & Educ, Global Stn Arct Res, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Siegel, Katherine J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Arnason, Ragnar] Univ Iceland, Fac Econ, Reykjavik, Iceland; [Juinio-Menez, Marie Antonette] Univ Philippines Diliman, Inst Marine Sci, Coll Sci, Quezon City, Philippines; [Fabricius, Katharina] Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Turley, Carol] Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth, Devon, England",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; James Cook University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Environmental Defense Fund; Universidade de Vigo; CIM UVIGO; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Hokkaido University; Hokkaido University; Hokkaido University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Iceland; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman; Plymouth Marine Laboratory,"Free, CM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.;Free, CM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",cfree14@gmail.com,"; Garcia Molinos, Jorge/C-9252-2015; Free, Christopher/N-2813-2013","Cabral, Reniel/0000-0002-1137-381X; Froehlich, Halley/0000-0001-7322-1523; Palardy, James/0000-0002-8347-7108; Battista, Willow/0000-0002-2616-2740; Garcia Molinos, Jorge/0000-0001-7516-1835; Free, Christopher/0000-0002-2557-8920",High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy; Food and Land Use Coalition; Environmental Defense Fund; European Research Council project CLOCK [679812]; GAIN-Xunta de Galicia Oportunius programme,High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy; Food and Land Use Coalition; Environmental Defense Fund; European Research Council project CLOCK; GAIN-Xunta de Galicia Oportunius programme,"We thank Z.

The relationship is observed to be valid in mid-latitudes; however, the debate persists in tropical monsoon regions, with the extremes of the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) being a prime example. Here, we present a comprehensive study on the dependence of ISMR extremes on both the 2 m surface air temperature over India and on the sea surface temperature over the tropical Indian Ocean. Remarkably, the ISMR extremes exhibit no significant association with temperature at either spatial scale: neither aggregated over the entire India/Tropical Indian Ocean area nor at the grid levels. We find that the theoretical C-C relation overestimates the positive changes in precipitation extremes, which is also reflected in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) simulations. We emphasize that the changing patterns of extremes over the Indian subcontinent need a scientific re-evaluation, which is possible due to availability of the unique long-term in-situ data. This can aid bias correction of model projections of extremes whose value for climate adaptation can hardly be overemphasized, especially for the developing tropical countries.","[Vittal, H.; Karmakar, Subhankar] Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Ghosh, Subimal; Pathak, Amey] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Ghosh, Subimal; Karmakar, Subhankar; Murtugudde, Raghu] Indian Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Program Climate Studies, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Murtugudde, Raghu] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, DOAS, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Karmakar, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India.;Karmakar, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Program Climate Studies, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India.",skarmakar@iitb.ac.in,"amey, pathak/E-8809-2017; Hari, Vittal/AAS-4759-2020; , Nobody/M-9571-2019","amey, pathak/0000-0002-1141-911X; Hari, Vittal/0000-0001-8754-0488; ","Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Government of India [MoES/PAMC/HC/35/2013-PC-II, MoES/PAMC/HC/36/2013-PC-II]","Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Government of India(Ministry of Earth Science (MoES), Government of India)","The work presented here is supported financially by Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Government of India, Project reference numbers MoES/PAMC/H&C/35/2013-PC-II and MoES/PAMC/H&C/36/2013-PC-II.

This work provides an examination of two hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that the correlation between basicranial breadth and ambient temperature is stronger than the correlation between temperature and other neurocranial variables, such as maximum cranial breadth, maximum neurocranial length, and the endocranial volume. The second hypothesis is that the correlation between the breadth of the cranial base and the ambient temperature is significant even when other neurocranial features used in this study (including the size of the neurocranium) are constant. For the sake of this research, the necessary neurocranial variables for fourteen human populations living in diverse environments were obtained from Howells' data (except for endocranial volume which was obtained by means of estimation). The ambient temperature (more precisely, the mean yearly temperature) of the environments inhabited by these populations was used as a major climatic factor. Data were analysed using Pearson correlation coefficients, linear regression and partial correlation analyses. The results supported the two hypotheses, thus suggesting that ambient temperature may contribute to the observed differences in the breadth of the cranial base in the studied modern humans.","[Nowaczewska, Wioletta; Dabrowski, Pawel] Univ Wroclaw, Dept Anthropol, PL-50138 Wroclaw, Poland; [Kuzminski, Lukasz] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Inst Econ Sci, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",University of Wroclaw; Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Nowaczewska, W (corresponding author), Univ Wroclaw, Dept Anthropol, Kuznicza 35, PL-50138 Wroclaw, Poland.",nowacz@antropo.uni.wroc.pl,"Nowaczewska, Wioletta/AFV-3344-2022","Nowaczewska, Wioletta/0000-0003-1907-554X",,,,,49,5,5,0,13,COLLEGIUM ANTROPOLOGICUM,ZAGREB,"INST ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH, GAJEVA 32, PO BOX 290, HR-10000 ZAGREB, CROATIA",0350-6134,,,COLLEGIUM ANTROPOL,Coll.

Ecosystem-scale water-use strategy is increasingly recognized as a key factor in regulating drought-related ecosystem responses. However, the link between water-use strategy and ecosystem vulnerability to meteorological droughts is poorly established. Using the global flux observations, historic hydroclimatic data, remote-sensing products, and plant functional-trait archive, we identified potentially vulnerable ecosystems, examining how ecosystem water-use strategy, quantified by the percentage bias (delta) of the empirical canopy conductance sensitivity to VPD relative to the theoretical value, mediated ecosystem responses to droughts. We found that prevailing soil water availability substantially impacted delta in dryland regions where ecosystems with insufficient soil moisture usually showed conservative water-use strategy, while ecosystems in humid regions exhibited more pronounced climatic adaptability. Hyposensitive and hypersensitive ecosystems, classified based on delta falling below or above the theoretical sensitivity, respectively, achieved similar net ecosystem productivity during droughts, employing different structural and functional strategies. However, hyposensitive ecosystems, risking their hydraulic system with a permissive water-use strategy, were unable to recover from droughts as quickly as hypersensitive ones. Our findings highlight that processed-based models predicting current functions and future performance of vegetation should account for the greater vulnerability of hyposensitive ecosystems to intensifying atmospheric and soil droughts.","[Xu, Hang; Zhang, Zhiqiang; Wu, Xiaoyun] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Jixian Natl Forest Ecosyst Observat & Res Stn, CNERN, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Hang; Zhang, Zhiqiang; Wu, Xiaoyun] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Soil & Water Conservat & Desertificat Comb, State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Oren, Ram] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Oren, Ram] Duke Univ, Pratt Sch Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Oren, Ram] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Helsinki, Finland",Beijing Forestry University; Beijing Forestry University; Duke University; Duke University; University of Helsinki,"Zhang, ZQ (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Jixian Natl Forest Ecosyst Observat & Res Stn, CNERN, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Oren, R (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA.;Oren, R (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Pratt Sch Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",zhqzhang@bjfu.edu.cn; ramoren@duke.edu,"Oren, Ram/AAC-5326-2019","Oren, Ram/0000-0002-5654-1733; Xu, Hang/0000-0002-6661-3139",Academy of Finland [337549]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2022M710407]; Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative [2016VBA036]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [BLX202108]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2022YFF1302501]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31872711],Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Academy of Finland, Grant/Award Number: 337549; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 2022M710407; Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative, Grant/Award Number: 2016VBA036; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant/Award Number: BLX202108; National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2022YFF1302501; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31872711",,101,0,0,20,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

It has been widely suggested that a mechanism for unlocking those benefits is to promote active community involvement in governance. However, this practice is not widely adopted despite a common intention to do so. In this article, we review the evidence around such practices and why there is an intention-implementation gap. The review is based on analysis of 51 peer-reviewed scholarly works using a conceptual framework (Values, Rules, Knowledge) that has previously been applied to understand inertia in the adoption of climate adaptation practices. This framework provides an analytical lens to identify critical knowledge gaps by focusing firmly on factors that influence decision contexts. The review has revealed that whilst there are many academic papers outlining the hypothesised benefits of community involvement in urban waterways governance, there is much less detail about practices, risks, costs, or the lived experience of decision-makers. Nor is there much advice on the methods that can be used to implement the practice in a manner that effectively unlocks co-benefits. We argue that such evidence is urgently needed as it will allow the practice to be more widely adopted.","[Perera, Ethamadalage Dineth; Moglia, Magnus; Glackin, Stephen] Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Urban Transit, Melbourne, Australia; [Woodcock, Ian] Univ Sydney, Sydney Sch Architecture Design & Planning, Camperdown, Australia",Swinburne University of Technology; University of Sydney,"Perera, ED (corresponding author), Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Urban Transit, Melbourne, Australia.",eperera@swin.edu.au,"Moglia, Magnus Mikael/C-8575-2011","Moglia, Magnus Mikael/0000-0002-8290-610X; Glackin, Stephen/0000-0002-6791-2229; Perera, Ethmadalage Dineth Jeewanka/0000-0001-8555-1319",,,,,94,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/13549839.2022.2155941,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2022.2155941,,DEC 2022,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,7C0JR,,Green Submitted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000899509400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The performance of different bias correction techniques was evaluated using several statistical metrics. The bias correction methods performance under climate condition different from the current climate was also evaluated using the differential split sample testing (DSST) and reveals that the distribution mapping technique is valid under climate condition different from the current climate. All bias correction methods were effective in adjusting mean monthly and annual RCM simulations of rainfall and temperature to the observed rainfall and temperature values. However, distribution mapping method was better in capturing the 90th percentile of observed rainfall and temperature and wet day probability of observed rainfall than other methods. As a result, we use the future (2021-2100) simulation of RCMs which are bias corrected using distribution mapping technique. The output of bias-adjusted RCMs unfolds a decline of rainfall, a persistent increase of temperature and an increase of extremes of rainfall and temperature in the future climate under emission scenarios of Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5, 8.5 and 2.6 (RCP4.5, RCP8.5 and RCP2.6).

There is a robust scientific consensus that human-induced climate change is occurring not only in the Western Cape but around the world. The objective of this research was to assess the impact of climate change on primary agriculture and food security. The paper is based on a literature review. A variety of literature reviews, for example, 11 government reports and 21 journal articles including experience outside Western Cape, were consulted to enrich the local experience regarding the impact of climate change on agriculture. The results indicated that many dams had low water levels (40%) during 2016/2017, which reduced crop yields including grapes. Droughts, which affected both smallholder and commercial farmers, are now a common phenomenon. Livestock production has declined over time, with small stock, the beef and dairy industry being the most affected. The paper concludes by highlighting climate adaptation and mitigation interventions and strategies for both crops and livestock production in the Western Cape. The major recommendations included scaling up on the use of organic matter to avoid burning and creating gas emissions to the atmosphere, the effective use of livestock manure and the use of appropriate and adaptable seed varieties, managing the manure of the livestock to assist in mulching to reduce water loss through evaporation and using adaptable seeds.","[Zwane, Elliot M.] Univ Limpopo, Ctr Rural Community Empowerment, Dept Agr Extens & Anim Prod, Sovenga, South Africa",University of Limpopo,"Zwane, EM (corresponding author), Univ Limpopo, Ctr Rural Community Empowerment, Dept Agr Extens & Anim Prod, Sovenga, South Africa.",zwanefrank@gmail.com,"Zwane, Elliot/AAW-3556-2020","Zwane, Elliot/0000-0002-5933-2910",,,,,35,24,24,6,30,AFRICAN CENTRE DISASTER STUDIES,POTCHEFSTROOM,"INTERNAL BOX 265, NORTH-WEST UNIV, PRIVATE BAG X6001, POTCHEFSTROOM, 2520, SOUTH AFRICA",1996-1421,2072-845X,,JAMBA-J DISASTER RIS,Jamba-J.

However, NAC studies are generally inadequate and partial. Specifically, systematic comparisons between the future and the past are generally lacking, and hydraulic NACs tend to be underemphasized. In the present study, by adopting a frequency distributionbased method that facilitates the procedures of contributions parsing and conducting multiple comparisons, we provide a global overview of multidimensional NACs for both the past and the future within a unified framework. We show that NACs are globally prevalent, covering roughly half of the land area across the time-periods under investigation, and have a high degree of spatial structure. Patterns of NACs differ dramatically between the past and the future. Hydraulic NACs are more complex both in spatial patterns and in major contributions of variables than are thermal NACs. However, hydraulic NACs are more predictable than originally thought. Generally, hydraulic NACs in the future (2100 AD) exhibit comparable predictability to thermal NACs in the last glacial maximum (LGM) (21k BP). Identifying these NAC patterns has potential implications on climate-adaptive managements and preparing in advance to possibly frequent novel ecosystems. However, a learning-fromthe- past strategy might be of limited utility for management under present circumstances.","[Li, Qin; Kou, Xiaojun; Ge, Jianping] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Qin] Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Kou, Xiaojun] Beijing Normal Univ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Beierkuhnlein, Carl] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Biogeog, BayCEER, GIB, Bayreuth, Germany; [Liu, Shirong] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Key Lab Chinas State Forestry Adm Forest Ecol & E, Beijing, Peoples R China","Beijing Normal University; University of British Columbia; Beijing Normal University; University of Bayreuth; Chinese Academy of Forestry; Research Institute of Forest Ecology, Environment and Protection, CAF","Kou, XJ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xj_kou@bnu.edu.cn,"Beierkuhnlein, Carl/ABF-8797-2021; Beierkuhnlein, Carl/ABF-9693-2021","Beierkuhnlein, Carl/0000-0002-6456-4628; Li, Qin/0000-0001-9976-8236",National Natural Science Foundation of China [31370486]; Special Research Program for Public-Welfare Forestry [201404201],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special Research Program for Public-Welfare Forestry,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31370486; Special Research Program for Public-Welfare Forestry, Grant/Award Number: 201404201",,63,6,6,2,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

In this context, city governments' engagement in transdisciplinarity is generally seen as a key condition for societal transformation towards sustainability. However, empirical evidence is rare. This paper presents a self-assessment of a joint research project on ecosystem services and climate adaptation planning (ECOSIMP) undertaken by four universities and seven Swedish municipalities. We apply a set of design principles and guiding questions for transdisciplinary sustainability projects and, on this basis, identify key aspects for supporting university-municipality collaboration. We show that: (1) selecting the number and type of project stakeholders requires more explicit consideration of the purpose of societal actors' participation; (2) concrete, interim benefits for participating practitioners and organisations need to be continuously discussed; (3) promoting the 'inter', i.e., interdisciplinary and inter-city learning, can support transdisciplinarity and, ultimately, urban sustainability and long-term change. In this context, we found that design principles for transdisciplinarity have the potential to (4) mitigate project shortcomings, even when transdisciplinarity is not an explicit aim, and (5) address differences and allow new voices to be heard. We propose additional guiding questions to address shortcomings and inspire reflexivity in transdisciplinary projects.","[Brink, Ebba; Wamsler, Christine; Ness, Barry; Stalhammar, Sanna] Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, POB 170, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Brink, Ebba; Stalhammar, Sanna] Lund Univ Ctr Excellence Integrat Social & Nat Di, POB 170, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Adolfsson, Maria] Trelleborg Municipal, Dept Sustainable Dev, Algatan 13, S-23183 Trelleborg, Sweden; [Axelsson, Monica] Kristianstad Municipal, Dept Environm & Urban Planning, S-29180 Kristianstad, Sweden; [Beery, Thomas; Jonsson, K.

These techniques, which do not explicitly model ice dynamics, generate upper bounds on twenty-first century SLR that are up to three times higher than Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates(7). However, the physical basis underlying these projections, and their likelihood of occurrence, remain unclear(8-10). Here, we develop mass-balance projections for the Antarctic ice sheet within a Bayesian probabilistic framework(10), integrating numerical model output(11) and updating projections with an observational synthesis(12). Without abrupt, sustained, changes in ice discharge (collapse), we project a 95th percentile mass loss equivalent to similar to 13 cm SLR by 2100, lower than previous upper-bound projections. Substantially higher mass loss requires regional collapse, invoking dynamics that are likely to be inconsistent with the underlying assumptions of SEMs. In this probabilistic framework, the pronounced sensitivity of upper-bound SLR projections to the poorly known likelihood of collapse is lessened with constraints on the persistence and magnitude of subsequent discharge. More realistic, fully probabilistic, estimates of the ice-sheet contribution to SLR may thus be obtained by assimilating additional observations and numerical models(11,13).","[Little, Christopher M.; Oppenheimer, Michael; Urban, Nathan M.] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Oppenheimer, Michael] Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Urban, Nathan M.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Computat Phys & Methods CCS 2, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA",Princeton University; Princeton University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory,"Little, CM (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",cmlittle@princeton.edu,,"Oppenheimer, Michael/0000-0002-9708-5914; Urban, Nathan/0000-0002-2264-3512","Science, Technology and Environmental Policy programme in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University; Carbon Mitigation Initiative in the Princeton Environmental Institute","Science, Technology and Environmental Policy programme in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University; Carbon Mitigation Initiative in the Princeton Environmental Institute","C.M.L. is grateful for financial support from the Science, Technology and Environmental Policy programme in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University and the Carbon Mitigation Initiative in the Princeton Environmental Institute.

The climate crisis is a multifaceted reality and, against this background, many pressing priorities compete with each other. The disruptive effect of climate variability and change on food systems is particularly acute and constitutes a direct and tangible threat to livelihoods globally. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate and discuss the importance of food systems under a climate crisis in exacerbating conflicts in the Sahelian region and propose interventions beyond and complementary to the usual military and security solutions. We demonstrate for the Sahel that (i) climate hazards are frequent and exposure to climate variability is high, (ii) hotspots of high climate variability and conflict exist, and (iii) impact pathways by which climate exacerbates food systems that can lead to conflicts are documented in the literature. While these three findings suggest clear links between conflict and climate, we find that (iv) current peace indices do not include climate and food systems indicators and therefore provide an uncomplete picture, and (v) food systems programming for climate adaptation has so far not explicitly considered peace and security outcomes. Furthermore, we propose that food systems programming that truly tackles the climate crisis should take more explicit account of peace and security outcomes in conflict-affected areas.","[Laderach, Peter] CGIAR & coleads CGIAR FOCUS Climate Security, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Ramirez-Villegas, Julian] Wageningen Univ & Res, CGIAR & Prof Agr Climate Impacts & Adaptat, Plant Prod Syst Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Prager, Steven D.] Alliance Biovers Int, Climate Resilient Food Syst, Alliance, OH USA; [Prager, Steven D.] Ctr Int Agr Trop, Columbia, MD USA; [Osorio, Diego] Global Affairs Canada, CASCOE & Climate & Secur, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Krendelsberger, Alexandra] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Sch Social Sci, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Krendelsberger, Alexandra] CGIAR FOCUS Climate Secur, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Zougmore, Robert B.] Accelerating Impact CGIAR Climate Res Africa AICC, Leads West Africa Program, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Zougmore, Robert B.] Alliance Biovers Int & CIAT, Dakar, Senegal; [Charbonneau, Bruno] Royal Mil Coll St Jean, Ctr Secur & Crisis Governance CRITIC, London, ON, Canada; [van Dijk, Han] Wageningen Univ & Res, Sociol Dev & Change Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Madurga-Lopez, Ignacio] CGIAR Focus Climate Secur Latin Amer & Caribbean, Climate secur specialist CGIAR, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Pacillo, Grazia] CGIAR & co leads CGIAR FOCUS Climate Secur, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Laderach, P (corresponding author), CGIAR & coleads CGIAR FOCUS Climate Security, Wageningen, Netherlands.",p.laderach@cgiar.org,,"Zougmore, Robert/0000-0002-6215-4852",,,,,141,0,0,7,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1816-3831,1607-5889,,INT REV RED CROSS,Int.

This balance is especially difficult in many coastal communities where planners must grapple with significant growth projections, the persistent threat of extreme events (e.g., hurricanes), and climate-change-driven sea level rise that not only presents a chronic hazard but also alters the spatial extent of sudden-onset hazards such as hurricanes. We examine these stressors on coastal, long-term land-use planning by reporting the results of a one-day community workshop held in Sarasota County, Florida that included focus groups and participatory mapping exercises. Workshop participants reflected various political agendas and socioeconomic interests of five local knowledge domains: business, environment, emergency management and infrastructure, government, and planning. Through a series of alternating domain-specific focus groups and interactive plenary sessions, participants compared the county 2050 comprehensive land-use plan to maps of contemporary hurricane storm-surge hazard zones and projected storm-surge hazard zones enlarged by sea level rise scenarios. This interactive, collaborative approach provided each group of domain experts the opportunity to combine geographically-specific, scientific knowledge on natural hazards and climate change with local viewpoints and concerns. Despite different agendas, interests, and proposed adaptation strategies, there was common agreement among participants for the need to increase community resilience to contemporary hurricane storm-surge hazards and to explore adaptation strategies to combat the projected, enlarged storm-surge hazard zones.

The climate is projected to continue on this trajectory for the foreseeable future, even under the most modest warming scenarios. Such changes will have a significant impact on livestock farming, both directly through effects on the animals themselves, and indirectly through changing exposure to pests and pathogens. Adaptation options aimed at taking advantage of new opportunities and/or minimising the risks of negative impacts will, in themselves, have implications for animal health and welfare. In this review, we consider the potential consequences of future intensification of animal production, challenges associated with indoor and outdoor rearing of animals and aspects of animal transportation as key examples. We investigate the direct and indirect effects of climate change on the epidemiology of important livestock pathogens, with a particular focus on parasitic infections, and the likely animal health consequences associated with selected adaptation options.

Climate change, however, dramatically changes freshwater systems and reduces water quality, poses a risk to drinking water availability and has severe impacts on aquatic ecosystems and their biodiversity. The direct effects of climate change, such as increased temperatures and higher frequency of extreme meteorological events, interact with human responses to climate change, which we refer to here as 'indirect effects'. The latter possibly have even greater impact than the direct effects of climate change. Specifically, changes in land-use practices as responses to climate change, such as adjusted cropping regimes or a shift to renewable hydroelectricity to mitigate climate change, can very strongly affect freshwater ecosystems. Hitherto, these indirect effects and the possibility of idiosyncratic outcomes are under-recognized. Here, we synthesize knowledge and identify threats to freshwater environments in alpine and pre-alpine regions, which are particularly affected by climate change. We focus on the effects of adapted agriculture and hydropower production on freshwater quality and ecological status, as these examples have strong indirect effects that interact with direct effects of climate change (e.g., water temperature, droughts, isolation of populations). We outline how failure to effectively account for indirect effects associated with human responses to climate change may exacerbate direct climate change impacts on aquatic ecosystems. If managed properly, however, human responses to indirect effects offer potential for rapid and implementable leverage to mitigate some of the direct climate change effects on aquatic ecosystems. To better address looming risks, policy- and decisionmakers must account for indirect effects and incorporate them into restoration planning and the respective sectorial policies.","[Brosse, Morgane; Benateau, Simon; Altermatt, Florian] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Eawag, Dept Aquat Ecol, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Brosse, Morgane; Benateau, Simon; Altermatt, Florian] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Benateau, Simon] CNRS, MNHN, Ctr Ecol & Sci Conservat CESCO, UMR7204, Paris, France; [Gaudard, Adrien; Stamm, Christian] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Chem, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Altermatt, Florian] Univ Zurich, Univ Res Prior Programme URPP Global Change & Bio, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); University of Zurich; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); University of Zurich,"Altermatt, F (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Eawag, Dept Aquat Ecol, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",florian.altermatt@eawag.ch,"Stamm, Christian/ABF-9581-2021","Stamm, Christian/0000-0001-5888-6535; Altermatt, Florian/0000-0002-4831-6958","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung derWissenschaftlichen Forschung [31003A_173074, PP00P3_179089]; Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (BAFU/FOEN) within the Hydro-CH2018 project",Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung derWissenschaftlichen Forschung(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (BAFU/FOEN) within the Hydro-CH2018 project,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung derWissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Numbers: 31003A_173074, PP00P3_179089; Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (BAFU/FOEN) within the Hydro-CH2018 project",,55,2,2,3,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,2688-8319,,ECOL SOLUT EVID,Ecol.

Meanwhile, in cities, the intensity and frequency of heat waves and heavy precipitation events have further increased as the urban climate has additionally been affected by rapid land surface change, enhanced anthropogenic heat release, and massive aerosol emissions. These enhanced aerosol emissions also deteriorate the air quality, often causing severe air quality problems in cities. The added urbanization effect on global and regional climate change has imposed increasingly serious impacts on the dense population, heavy traffic, vast infrastructure, and economic assets of urban areas. China has experienced much faster warming than the global average from the late of 20st century, especially since 1990. The average warming rate in the seven largest cities (Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Chongqing) is higher than the average for China as a whole during the most recent 60 years. The number of hot days with maximum surface air temperatures over 35 degrees C has increased markedly since 1990. In the past two decades, many cities, such as Beijing, Jinan, and Chongqing have experienced extremely heavy precipitation events, causing dozens of fatalities. During the past 50 years, severe air pollution conditions have frequently occurred in many cities over eastern China. In South China, the Huanghe-Huaihe River Basin and North China, increasing trends in the number of haze days are evident. Influenced by global warming, cities in low-lying coastal areas are highly susceptible to sea level rise and the related impacts of sea water encroachment, especially during tropical cyclone and storm surge periods. In cities in northern China and inland areas, climate change-related drought frequently significantly impacts water resources and ecosystem services. In recent years, the issue of urban climate change has received considerable attention in China. Many climate change adaptation strategies have been put into action in cities. Also, urban areas account for about 75% of energy-related CO2 emissions worldwide, and thus play a dominant role in the mitigation of global greenhouse gases. Meanwhile, increased urban climate change and its impacts greatly challenge the social, economic and ecological sustainable development of China's cities. In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, at the heart of which are 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Goal 11, on making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, directly targets dealing with the challenges brought by urbanization. Many other goals, such as Goal 13 on taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, Goal 3 on ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing, Goal 6 on ensuring access to water and sanitation, and Goal 15 on protecting, restoring and promoting the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, are all related to tackling climate change issues from the perspectives of human security and health, more resilient economies, and ecosystems. Obviously, implementation of these United Nations SDGs brings immediate impetus and new opportunities for climate change responses in cities. In the future, the impacts of global climate change and urbanization are expected to further increase. Cities will face more serious and complicated climate change risks to human health, economic development, and ecosystem services as our expectation of more hazards, higher exposure and vulnerability unfolds. For China, climate change and sustainable development in cities is an extremely prominent issue. However, systematic studies on climate change in cities are very limited, especially in terms of the interactions and mechanisms between global/regional climate change and urbanization processes, high-resolution climate change projections under the consideration of future urban development pathways, impact and risk assessments of climate change in combination with high exposure and vulnerability, and a portfolio of response options and measures for climate change in cities. Effective climate change actions rely on understanding the complexity and uncertainties of future climate change and related risks in cities. Under the framework of sustainable development, following related national green development strategies and polices, taking advantages of science, technology, finance and governance in cities, to actively tackle urban climate change issues, such as enhanced adaptation and mitigation measures, properly selecting development pathways will greatly enhance climate resilience in cities. A series of national actions, such as implementing low carbon cities and sponge cities, and the Action Plan on Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution, will have co-benefits for climate change responses and sustainable development in cities.","[Zhai, Panmao; Yu, Rong; Guo, Jianping] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Yufeng] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Zhai, PM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",pmzhai@cma.gov.cn,"Guo, Jianping/K-1497-2017; Zhai, Panmao/AGR-2765-2022","Guo, Jianping/0000-0001-8530-8976; ",,,,,39,20,20,28,98,SCIENCE PRESS,EPHRATA,"300 WEST CHESNUT ST, EPHRATA, PA 17522 USA",0023-074X,2095-9419,,CHIN SCI B-CHIN,Chin.

Approaching the design of estuary cities in the Climate Century demands a form of estuary urbanism and new paradigms in design, which embrace the constant presence of water. Water becomes the instrument of change to re-think the design of the city and its relationship with the non-built environment since the climate crisis is also a water crisis. Adaptation and mitigation strategies are still emerging fields in design and planning disciplines. Design disciplines can strongly contribute to generating site-specific climate-adaptative responses while re-establishing the connection between built and natural environments, improving ecological balance and spatial quality, and promoting well-being and cultural values. The methodology involves both analytical and projective-explorative methods promoting a site-specific approach, working across scales and disciplines to understand urban estuaries within larger catchments and as complex hydrological and ecological systems. A fundamental goal is the creation of site-specific design strategies to operate in low to medium-density precincts, leveraging water and nature as design tools to improve urban resilience and liveability. There is capacity here to establish design methods and principles that inform future practices through urbanism responding to dynamic ecological and water systems and the unpredictability effects of climate change.","[Lopez, Irene Perez] Univ Newcastle Australia UoN, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Martin, Daniel Jan] Univ Western Australia UWA, Sch Design, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Lopez, IP (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle Australia UoN, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.;Martin, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia UWA, Sch Design, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia.",irene.perezlopez@newcastle.edu.au; daniel.martin@uwa.edu.au,,"Martin, Daniel Jan/0000-0003-3280-5754",University of Newcastle 2022 Research Advantage Women in Research,University of Newcastle 2022 Research Advantage Women in Research,This research was funded by the University of Newcastle 2022 Research Advantage Women in Research.,,106,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2023,15,2,,,,,,,962,10.3390/su15020962,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15020962,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,8R2NW,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000927734200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To study the regional hydroclimatic history beyond instrumental records, the first tree-ring hydroclimate reconstruction, based on Pinus tabuliformis, was conducted in the southern Min Mountains, which is situated close to the areas affected by the Jiuzhaigou earthquake. The reconstruction, spanning from 1684 to 2017, explained 59% of the variance for May-August standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index at a 12-month scale during 1962-2017. The recent drought, which occurred from 1992 to 2017 was the longest in duration, largest in magnitude, and had the second highest intensity. The most severe single year drought occurred in 1824, which was lower than the long-term mean by 4 sigma and affected several regions in and around the Northeast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The drought reconstruction was consistent with other moisture reconstructions, but dissimilar were also exist during some periods. There was a significant correlation between drought reconstruction and sea surface temperature over many oceans. However, the correlations were unstable over time. This study suggests the importance of developing a density tree-ring network to identify the spatial and temporal drought variability, as well as long-term record for understanding regional climate dynamics.","[Yan, Xiaoya; Deng, Yang; Fan, Haowen; Su, Jiajia; Gao, Linlin; Gou, Xiaohua] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth Environm Sci, MOE Key Lab Western Chinas Environm Syst, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University,"Deng, Y (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, MOE Key Lab Western Chinas Environm Syst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",dengy@lzu.edu.cn,"Su, Jiajia/HGA-4440-2022; Deng, Yang/HLG-9800-2023; Fan, Haowen/GPT-4634-2022","Deng, Yang/0000-0002-0473-447X; Su, Jiajia/0000-0001-7280-8859; Fan, Haowen/0000-0002-1648-560X; Gao, Linlin/0000-0003-1805-5440","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41701216]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [lzujbky-2017-41, lzujbky2019-30]; Open Foundation of Research Institute of Qilian Mountains",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Open Foundation of Research Institute of Qilian Mountains,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41701216; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant/Award Numbers: lzujbky-2017-41, lzujbky2019-30; Open Foundation of Research Institute of Qilian Mountains",,49,1,1,3,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Projected changes in indices characterizing precipitation extremes of the 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C global warming levels (GWLs) exceeding pre-industrial conditions are analyzed, comparing the reference period (1976-2005) with an ensemble of CORDEX simulations. The results show that projected changes in precipitation extreme indices are significantly amplified over the Indochina Peninsula and the Maritime Continent at both GWLs. The increases of precipitation extremes are essentially affected by enhanced convective precipitation. The number of wet and extremely wet days is increasing more abruptly than both the total and daily average precipitation of all wet days, emphasizing the critical risks linked with extreme precipitation. Additionally, significant changes can also be observed between the GWLs of 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C, especially over the Maritime Continent, suggesting the high sensitivity of precipitation extremes to the additional 0.5 degrees C GWL increase. The present study reveals the potential influence of both 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C GWLs on regional precipitation over SEA, highlights the importance of restricting mean global warming to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial conditions and provides essential information on manageable climate adaptation and mitigation strategies for the developing countries in SEA.","[Ge, Fei; Zhao, Yong] Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Plateau Atmosphere & Environm Key Lab Sichuan Pro, Joint Lab Climate & Environm Change, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Ge, Fei; Zhu, Shoupeng; Peng, Ting; Zhi, Xiefei; Ji, Luying] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ KLME, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, CIC FEMD, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ge, Fei; Zhu, Shoupeng; Fraedrich, Klaus] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Sielmann, Frank] Univ Hamburg, Meteorol Inst, Hamburg, Germany; [Liu, Xiaoran] Chongqing Climate Ctr, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Tang, Weiwei] Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Coll Commun Engn, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Chengdu University of Information Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Max Planck Society; University of Hamburg; Chengdu University of Information Technology,"Zhu, SP (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ KLME, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, CIC FEMD, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Zhu, SP (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany.",spzhu@nuist.edu.cn,"Zhi, Xiefei/AGU-6880-2022","Zhi, Xiefei/0000-0003-4414-0497; Zhu, Shoupeng/0000-0002-4741-1179","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41805056, 41875169, 41875102, 41575104, 91537214]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20060501]; Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning [A1-2048-18-0001]; Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province [KYCX17_0875]; Open Research Fund Program of KLME, NUIST [KLME201809]; Scientific Research Foundation of CUIT [KYTZ201730]; Scientific Research Fund of Sichuan Provincial Education Department [18ZB0112]; China Scholarship Council [201808510009, 201608320193]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning; Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province; Open Research Fund Program of KLME, NUIST; Scientific Research Foundation of CUIT; Scientific Research Fund of Sichuan Provincial Education Department; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council)","The research acknowledges the jointly financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos 41805056, 41875169, 41875102, 41575104 and 91537214), the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant. no.

However, surveys have suggested that only a minority of firms conducts strategic adaptations, which we define as anticipatory and target-oriented action with the purpose of increasing resilience to climate change. While several barrier-centered studies have investigated the causality of non-adaptation in industry, the examined barriers are often not problem-specific. Furthermore, it has been shown that even in cases when managers perceive no barriers to adaptation at all, strategic adaptations may still not be conducted. On this background, the present analysis focuses on the logic of adaptive inaction, which we conceive, in particular, as inaction with regard to strategic adaptations. Adopting an action-theoretical perspective, the study examines (a) which aspects may shape the rationality of adaptive inaction among managers, (b) which more condensed challenges of conducting strategic adaptations emerge for managers, and (c) how the theoretical propositions can be tested. For this purpose, the study employs an exploratory approach. Thus, hypotheses on such aspects are explored, which may shape the rationality of adaptive inaction among managers. Subsequently, predictions are inferred from the theoretical propositions, which allow testing their empirical relevance. Methodologically, the hypotheses are explored by reexamining existing explanatory approaches from literature based on a set of pretheoretical assumptions, which include notions of bounded rationality. As a result, the study proposes 13 aspects which may constrain managers in conducting adaptations in such a way, which serves the economic utility of the firm. By condensing these aspects, 4 major challenges for managers are suggested: the challenges of (a) conducting long-term adaptations, of (b) conducting adaptations at an early point in time, of (c) conducting adaptations despite uncertain effects of the measures, and of (d) conducting adaptations despite cross-tier dependencies in supply chains. Finally, the study shows how the propositions can be tested and outlines a research agenda based on the developed theoretical suggestions.","[Meinel, Ulrike] AlpS Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, Grabenweg 68, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Meinel, Ulrike] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Geog, Innrain 52f, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Meinel, Ulrike; Schuele, Ralf] Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, Doppersberg 19, D-42103 Wuppertal, Germany",University of Innsbruck,"Meinel, U (corresponding author), AlpS Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, Grabenweg 68, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.;Meinel, U (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Geog, Innrain 52f, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.;Meinel, U (corresponding author), Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, Doppersberg 19, D-42103 Wuppertal, Germany.",ulrike.meinel@wupperinst.org; ralf.schuele@wupperinst.org,,"Schule, Ralf/0000-0002-4490-4648; Meinel, Ulrike/0000-0001-6869-2961","COMET funding program of the Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology [T2B-CCA]; Austrian Ministry of Science, Research and Economy; state of Tyrol; state Vorarlberg; University of Innsbruck","COMET funding program of the Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology; Austrian Ministry of Science, Research and Economy; state of Tyrol; state Vorarlberg; University of Innsbruck","This work was conducted within the project T2B-CCA, which is supported by the COMET funding program of the Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology, the Austrian Ministry of Science, Research and Economy, the state of Tyrol, and the state Vorarlberg; the COMET program is processed by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG).

However, this is becoming less reliable with climatic changes. Meteorological forecasting based on numerical prediction provides an alternative that is also now widely available to enable adaptation. However, this climate information has constraints including uncertainty and a broad spatial and temporal scale. The use of these two sources of forecast information is also affected by farmer perceptions of its advantages and disadvantages as well as beliefs and social norms. This study uses the case of Bobirwa subdistrict in Botswana to investigate the role of traditional norms and religious beliefs in the use of place-based and national meteorological forecast information to inform adaptation. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 82 farmers from 8 different communities. We found that whilst some farmers use national meteorological information, others use place-based forecast information only and some combine the two. We also found that certain religious beliefs and traditional norms prevent the use of national meteorological forecast information by some farmers. An integrated climate information system that is credible and accessible to farmers from different belief systems will provide opportunity for farmers to use this climate information to adapt better to climate variability and change.","[Spear, Dian; Selato, Janet C.; Mosime, Bonolo; Nyamwanza, Admire M.] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Geol Sci Bldg,Univ Ave South, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Selato, Janet C.] Minist Environm Nat Resources Conservat & Tourism, Dept Meteorol Serv, Corner Maaloso Rd & Metsimotlhaba Rd,Plot 54216, Gaborone, Botswana; [Nyamwanza, Admire M.] Human Sci Res Council, 118 Buitengracht St, ZA-8000 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town; Human Sciences Research Council-South Africa,"Spear, D (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Geol Sci Bldg,Univ Ave South, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.",dian.spear@gmail.com,"Spear, Dian/B-2469-2009","Spear, Dian/0000-0002-2417-3980; Mosime, Bonolo/0000-0001-9955-0640","Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA); UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada; South African Department of Science and Technology","Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA); UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada(CGIAR); South African Department of Science and Technology","This work was carried out under the Adaptation at Scale in SemiArid Regions project (ASSAR).

Yet, in many regions, a paucity of weather and climate data has prevented rigorous assessment of recent climate trends and their causes, thereby limiting the effectiveness of forecasts and other services for climate adaptation. In rainfed systems, farmer perceptions of changing rainfall and weather patterns are important precursors for annual cropping decisions. Here, we propose that combining such farmer perceptions of trends in seasonal rainfall with satellite-based rainfall estimates and climate station data can reduce uncertainties regarding regional climatic trends. In western Uganda, a rural and climatically complex transition zone between eastern and central equatorial Africa, data from 980 smallholder households suggest distinct changes in seasonal bimodal rainfall over recent decades, specifically wetter rainy seasons and drier dry seasons. Data from three satellite-based rainfall products beginning in 1983 largely corroborate respondent perceptions over the last 10-20years, particularly in the southernmost sites near Queen Elizabeth National Park. In addition, combining all three information sources suggests an increasing trend in annual rainfall, most prominently in the north near Murchison Falls National Park over the past two decades; this runs counter to recent research asserting the presence of a drying trend in the region. Our study is unique in evaluating and cross-validating these multiple data sources to identify climatic change affecting people in a poorly understood region, while providing insights into regional-scale climate controls.","[Salerno, Jonathan] Colorado State Univ, Dept Human Dimens Nat Resources, 1480 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Diem, Jeremy E.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Geosci, 24 Peachtree Ctr Ave, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Konecky, Bronwen L.] Washington Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Campus Box 1169,One Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Hartter, Joel] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, 4001 Discovery Dr, Boulder, CO 80303 USA",Colorado State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Washington University (WUSTL); University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Salerno, J (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Human Dimens Nat Resources, 1480 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",jonathan.salerno@colostate.edu,,"Konecky, Bronwen/0000-0003-1647-2865; HARTTER, JOEL/0000-0002-2255-1845",U.S. National Science Foundation [CNH- 1114977]; National Geographic Committee for Research and Exploration,U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Geographic Committee for Research and Exploration(National Geographic Society),Funding was provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation (CNH- 1114977) and National Geographic Committee for Research and Exploration.,,65,19,19,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

In this paper, we present insights from a novel Agent Based Model (ABM), applied to a London case study of surface water flood risk, designed to assess the interplay between different adaptation options; how risk reduction could be achieved by homeowners and government; and the role of flood insurance and the new flood insurance pool, Flood Re, in the context of climate change. The analysis highlights that while combined investment in property-level flood protection and sustainable urban drainage systems reduce surface water flood risk, the benefits can be outweighed by continued development in high risk areas and the effects of climate change. In our simulations, Flood Re is beneficial in its function to provide affordable insurance, even under climate change. However, the scheme does face increasing financial pressure due to rising surface water flood damages. If the intended transition to risk-based pricing is to take place then a determined and coordinated strategy will be needed to manage flood risk, which utilises insurance incentives, limits new development, and supports resilience measures.

This study aims to make a comprehensive spatio-temporal analysis of trends in extreme indices related to precipitation and temperature for the Zanzan region of Cote d'Ivoire over the period of 1981-2020. The statistical significance of the calculated trends was assessed using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test, while Sen's slope estimation was used to define the amount of change. For extreme precipitations, the results showed a decreasing trend in annual total precipitations estimated at 112.37 mm and in daily precipitations intensity indices. Furthermore, the consecutive dry days' index showed an increasing trend estimated at 18.67 days. Unlike the trends in precipitation extremes, which showed statistically non-significant trends, the trends in temperature extremes were mostly significant over the entire study area. The cold spells indices all show decreasing trends, while the warm spells show increasing trends. Drawing inferences from the results, it becomes clear that the study area may be threatened by food insecurity and water scarcity.

Widespread uptake in practice of such guidelines can be promoted by visualizations of the principles on which they are based. The Really cooling water bodies in cities research project developed and tested the required knowledge on visual communication. Evidence-based design guidelines assisting designers with creating cooler urban water environments were developed and communicated with 3D animations. The animations were shaped according to three core theoretical criteria about visual representations: visual clarity, trust and interest. We assessed in how far these criteria were met in an inquiry with design professionals, the target group of the design guidelines. The article concludes with recommendations for developing visual design guidelines in climate-responsive urban design: to weigh the level of detail, components and balance between site-specificity/abstraction (visual clarity); to make microclimatic processes visible without distorting them (trust); and to keep timing short and visual attractiveness high (interest). It is argued that taking these aspects into account and setting a clear correspondence between theoretical concepts, representation objectives and options, can largely benefit visual design guidelines communicating climate -responsive urban design knowledge.","[Cortesao, Joao; Lenzholzer, Sanda] Wageningen Univ, Landscape Architecture & Spatial Planning Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Neth Antilles; [Muelder, Jochen] Lenne3D GmbH, Meisenstr 65, D-33607 Bielefeld, Germany; [Klok, Lisette; Kluck, Jeroen] Univ Appl Sci Amsterdam, Urban Technol, Weesperzijde 190, NL-1097 DZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Jacobs, Cor] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen Environm Res Alterra, Droevendaalsesteeg 3,POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Cortesao, J (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Landscape Architecture & Spatial Planning Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Neth Antilles.",joao.cortesao@wur.nl,,"Cortesao, Joao/0000-0002-4855-6281",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [14589]; Taskforce for Applied Research SIA; AMS Institute,Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Taskforce for Applied Research SIA; AMS Institute,"The REALCOOL Project was part of the research programme Research through Design with project number 14589, which was financed by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), the Taskforce for Applied Research SIA and the AMS Institute.",,28,6,6,8,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

Crop diversification, as an agricultural practice, could lead to climate adaptation and mitigation. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of climatic variability on categories of crop diversification so as to understand its role as an adaptive measure in response to climate change. An ordered probit model which allows for the separation of different categories of crop diversification was used for the 2006 period. The results showed that increases in temperature and precipitation did not affect each category in the same way. However, diversification intensity increases with climate variability: the greater the climate variability, the greater the likelihood of a municipality being in the very diversified category. Therefore, crop diversification appears as an adaptation strategy because it is influenced by climatic shocks. These results could be used to recommend Rural Extension programs to promote diversified systems as a resilient and cleaner type of agricultural production to improve climate risk management in Brazilian agriculture.

Although these are likely to increase in future due to climate change, households are also taking up various coping measures to deal with these extreme climatic shocks from their past experience. Hence, assessing the impact of these covariate shocks and identifying the determinants of various adaptation options have relevant policy implications in the context of designing a disaster mitigation policy. This study aims to assess farmers' vulnerability to climatic variability and climate change taking both irrigated and rain-fed regions of the country. Vulnerability analysis was done using an econometric method of 'vulnerability as exposure to uninsured risk' (VER) in order to test the determinants of household income loss due to covariate and idiosyncratic risk. Based on a survey of 400 farmers in Odisha, India, results show that households that access weather-related information reduce their level of vulnerability to climate change and improve their overall adaptive capacity. To address climatic vulnerability, policymakers need to emphasize farmers' responses in different regions and can plan climate adaptation strategies based on the vulnerability assessment of entire regions.","[Senapati, Asis Kumar] Ravenshaw Univ, PG Dept Econ, Cuttack 753003, Odisha, India",Ravenshaw University,"Senapati, AK (corresponding author), Ravenshaw Univ, PG Dept Econ, Cuttack 753003, Odisha, India.",asiseco@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,2,2,2,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

We propose a decision-making model to incorporate the probability of rainfall disasters and recommend investing time when evaluating projects related to climate adaptation. We use a hydrological statistical model and economic and technical factors to estimate the expected economic losses in several rainfall disaster scenarios, and the value of the adaptation infrastructures is calculated using a real options pricing approach. Then the decision-making model is applied to a case study involving a campus rainfall disaster prevention facility at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing, China. We established three submerged scenarios with different rainfall intensities, then we evaluated the premium of holding an option to defer and pointed out the optimal investing time in each scenario. This model is expected to provide guidance for the development of adaptation infrastructure for relatively small areas such as communities and universities. And we proved that using real options-based approach could provide more managerial flexibility for investors.","[Wang, Tao; Liu, Bingsheng] Chongqing Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China; [Liu, Bingsheng] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jiaming; Li, Guijun] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Li, Guijun] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Global Econ & Sustainable Dev, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Chongqing University; Tianjin University; Central University of Finance & Economics; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Liu, BS (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China.;Liu, BS (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",wangtaothu@163.com; bluesea_boy_1979@163.com; jemma1002@hotmail.com; ligj@cufe.edu.cn,"Li, Guijun/AAZ-6202-2021",,,,,,59,7,7,15,120,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1059-1478,1937-5956,,PROD OPER MANAG,Prod.

Past and present social and economic forces shaping the midwestern agricultural landscape have fundamentally transformed its natural systems, impacting food security, biodiversity, and community and ecosystem resilience to climate change. However, the lack of specific knowledge concerning these socioecological and economic forces and their feedback loops constitutes an information barrier to stakeholders new to the decision-making frameworks that shape this complex socioagricultural landscape. This article presents a serious socioecological gaming simulation case study as a framework for familiarizing landscape architecture students with the complex interactive characteristics of these systems. The Climate BufferNet study immersed students in an interactive, co-learning visual media environment that confronted them with real-world challenges of balancing economic priorities with the degraded ecological feedback loops now prevalent in this multifunctional landscape. The results of student evaluations from initial playtesting, presented here, revealed that the simulation accurately demonstrates the difficulty in balancing environmental and economic goals. Further, qualitative coding of student responses shows that players were using the simulation to actively experiment with spatial configurations of conservation practices and decipher rules for targeting their actions. The results of these initial pilot tests, documented here, demonstrate both the potential for engaging landscape architects in rural landscape planning and the need for greater attention to the complexities of environmental and economic tensions between biodiversity, climate change, and ecosystem services.","[Thompson, Aaron William] Purdue Univ, Hort & Landscape Architecture, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Thompson, Aaron William] Purdue Univ, Ctr Community & Environm Design, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Marzec, Robert] Purdue Univ, Coll Liberal Arts, English, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Burniske, Gary] Purdue Univ, Coll Agr, Int Programs Agr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Thompson, AW (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Hort & Landscape Architecture, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.;Thompson, AW (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Ctr Community & Environm Design, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,"Thompson, Aaron/0000-0003-0693-4763",,,,,77,0,0,1,1,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0277-2426,1553-2704,,LANDSC J,Landsc.

The study used a propensity score matching approach to evaluate the impact of adaptation options on household food security. Results: Results show that the decision to adopt adaptation options is found to be positively influenced by male household heads, family size, access to extension service, the size of landholding, and frequency of drought and floods over the past many years. The results further reveal that farmers adopting any of the adaptation options had higher food calorie intake per day per adult equivalent than those who did not. Conclusions: A policy that promotes the adoption of soil and water conservation measures, small-scale irrigation, agronomic practices, and livelihood diversification strategies should be central to food security strategy in the study area.","[Amare, Abayineh; Simane, Belay] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Amare, A (corresponding author), Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",abaytana82@gmail.com,"Amare, Abayineh/GQA-4216-2022",,Addis Ababa University; DAAD in-country scholarship program; African Climate Change Fellowship Program,Addis Ababa University; DAAD in-country scholarship program; African Climate Change Fellowship Program,"All data collection, data analysis, and write-up of the study were supported by Addis Ababa University, African Climate Change Fellowship Program, and DAAD in-country scholarship program.",,48,18,18,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,2192-1709,,ECOL PROCESS,Ecol.

This paper combined regional and field data with modeling to analyze the changes in the climate in the last 40 years, and to investigate the influence of changes in crop varieties and management options to crop yield. In particular, we examined the impact of a planned adaptation strategy to climate change -Double-Delay technology, i.e., delay both the sowing time of wheat and the harvesting time of maize, on both wheat and maize yield. The results show that improved crop varieties and management options not only compensated some negative impact of reduced crop growth period on crop yield due to the increase in temperature, they have contributed significantly to crop yield increase. The increase in temperature before over-wintering stage enabled late sowing of winter wheat and late harvesting of maize, leading to overall 4-6% increase in total grain yield of the wheat-maize system. Increased use of farming machines and minimum tillage technology also shortened the time for field preparation from harvest time of summer maize to sowing time of winter wheat, which facilitated the later harvest of summer maize.","[Wang, Jing; Yang, Xiaoguang; Zhang, Fusuo] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Wang, Enli] CSIRO Land & Water, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Yin, Hong] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); China Meteorological Administration,"Wang, J (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",wangj@cau.edu.cn; Enli.Wang@csiro.au; yangxg@cau.edu.cn,"Wang, Enli/K-7478-2012; yang, xiao/HJI-7815-2023; Yin, Hong/AAF-4261-2019; Wang, Jing/AFK-1683-2022; Zhong, Hong Lin/C-2633-2012; Zhang, Fusuo/AAV-4517-2021","Wang, Enli/0000-0002-6653-5791; ","Special Fund for agriculture profession [201103003]; National Basic Research Program of China [2009CB118608, 2005CB121106]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41101046]; National Science Foundation of China [30821003]",Special Fund for agriculture profession; National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We sincerely acknowledge the Special Fund for agriculture profession (201103003), National Basic Research Program of China (2009CB118608) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41101046).

Climate change vulnerability assessment (CCVA) integrates biophysical and socioeconomic information to support policy decisions. We present a CCVA of agricultural livelihoods of four countries in Central America, at the municipality level. We use the IPCC definition of vulnerability, and address the potential impact of climate change on suitability for major crops and adaptive capacity using indicators of basic human needs, as well as resources for innovation and action framed in a livelihoods approach. Adaptive capacity was estimated using ranking techniques for municipalities and descriptive multivariate analysis. Projected changes in climate suitability for crops show a wide variation between Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, and within each country. Cluster analysis of adaptive capacity values shows a gradient between higher values close to urban areas and lower values in agricultural frontier areas and in those prone to drought. Municipalities with a high proportional area under subsistence crops tend to have less resources to promote innovation and action for adaptation. Our results suggest that a full spectrum of adaptation levels and strategies must be considered in the region to achieve different adaptation goals. They also show that the adaptive capacity ranking and characterization are complementary and support geographical prioritization and identification of adaptation strategies, respectively.","[Bouroncle, Claudia; Imbach, Pablo; Medellin, Claudia] Trop Agr Res & Higher Educ Ctr CATIE, Climate Change Program, CATIE 7170 Apartado 56, Turrialba 30501, Cartago, Costa Rica; [Rodriguez-Sanchez, Beatriz; Martinez-Valle, Armando; Laderach, Peter] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Decis & Policy Anal Res Area DAPA, Cali, Colombia",CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT,"Bouroncle, C (corresponding author), Trop Agr Res & Higher Educ Ctr CATIE, Climate Change Program, CATIE 7170 Apartado 56, Turrialba 30501, Cartago, Costa Rica.",cbouron@catie.ac.cr,,,"CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); UNEP Regional Gateway for Technology Transfer and Climate Change Action in Latin America and the Caribbean (REGATTA); CASCADE project; Betty and Gordon Moore Center for Science at Conservation International","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); UNEP Regional Gateway for Technology Transfer and Climate Change Action in Latin America and the Caribbean (REGATTA); CASCADE project; Betty and Gordon Moore Center for Science at Conservation International","This work was co-funded by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) and the UNEP Regional Gateway for Technology Transfer and Climate Change Action in Latin America and the Caribbean (REGATTA).

By the example of three neighbouring Alpine regions (Switzerland, Southern Germany and Austria), the study strives to shed further light on how flood risk governance regimes embrace the possible impacts of climate change. It builds on the assumption that flood risk management, as a technical' policy field, is strongly influenced by scientific evidence and that differences in how countries incorporate climate change can be explained by the way science and policy are brought together in the respective national arenas. We structure the empirical analysis along three dimensions: (i) dynamics of knowledge creation; (ii) institutionalization of the science-policy interface; and (iii) pathways of influence of expertise on policy development. We find that there is a mixed, though increasing influence of climate change on flood risk governance in the three selected Alpine regions.

We assess stress with flood-specific health scores and the GHQ-12 General Health Questionnaire. Our findings show that the combination of water depth and flood velocity measured via a Hazard Class Index is an important stressor; and that mental health resilience can be significantly improved by providing the population with adequate information. More specifically, the paper shows that psychological distress can be reduced by (i) coordinating awareness of flood risks and flood protection and prevention behavior; (ii) developing the ability to protect oneself from physical, material and intangible damage; (iii) designing simple insurance procedures and protocols for fast recovery; and (iv) learning from previous experiences.","[Foudi, Sebastien; Galarraga, Ibon] Basque Ctr Climate Change, Leioa, Spain; [Oses-Eraso, Nuria] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona, Spain",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Foudi, S (corresponding author), Basque Ctr Climate Change, Leioa, Spain.",sebastien.foudi@bc3research.org,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Foudi, Sébastien/I-3466-2013","Foudi, Sébastien/0000-0002-8013-7853; Oses-Eraso, Nuria/0000-0002-2669-4691",European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovations programme [653522],European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovations programme,"The authors acknowledge support from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovations programme under grant agreement 653522, Project: Climate Resilient Cities and Infrastructures.''

The indoor physical parameters were measured, while the participants answered the online questionnaires about their thermal sensation and thermal comfort, adaptive methods, etc. The results show that the mean thermal sensation votes (MTS) were always greater than PMV predictions. And the deviations between MTS and PMV were evidently discrepant in different seasons. Meanwhile, the thermal neutral temperatures varied in different seasons. As a long-lasting thermal exposure to the artificial heating environment, the participants' thermal adaptability to cold climate had been gradually undermined. Moreover, the participants were sensitive to the indoor temperature fluctuations, especially to the indoor temperature reduction after they had adapted to the indoor heating condition.

Batch tests were conducted at 22 and 2degreesC in both simple binary systems and more complex multi-component systems. Results show that cold temperatures decrease copper uptake by clinoptilolite and appear to slow reaction kinetics.

It comprises diverse connotations in value, scientific and economic dimensions. Epistemologically, it comes from the Chinese traditional philosophy of harmonious coexistence of heaven, earth and man, and conforms to the Western ecological ethics, complex system science and environmental value theory. Methodologically, as a complex socio-ecological system in which man and nature interact and coexist, the life community of the MRFFLG should be governed coordinately from both narrow and broad views. At the policy level, from the perspectives of narrow synergy among ecological subsystems and broad synergy among the complex socio-ecological system, this paper evaluates the performance indicators of 16 pilot projects of the MRFFLG, and points out that the design of most pilot projects well reflects the narrow synergy of multiple ecological elements, but is short of attention to the broad synergy of green development and ecological civilization. There are two practical ways to promote the systemic governance of the MRFFLG. First, it needs to focus on the coordinated governance of watershed and ecological environment restoration against the background of global climate and environmental change. The goal is to restore and improve the service functions of ecological subsystems and enhance their climate adaptability. Second, in the context of new urbanization and green development transition, it requires a collaborative planning focusing on natural capital and green infrastructure investment, which is aimed at cultivating ecological dividends and realizing ecological economy.","[Zheng Yan] Univ Chinese Acad Social Sci, 11 Changyu St, Beijing 102488, Peoples R China; Chinese Acad Social Sci, Res Inst Ecocivilizat, 27 Wangfujing St, Beijing 100710, Peoples R China",University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Zheng, Y (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Social Sci, 11 Changyu St, Beijing 102488, Peoples R China.",zhengy_cass@163.com; zhuang_gy@aliyun.com,,,National Social Science Fund of China [18BJY060]; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences [2017YCXZD007],National Social Science Fund of China; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"This research is supported by Study on Multi-objective Coordinated Governance Model and Path of Climate-resilient Cities (Grant No. 18BJY060), the National Social Science Fund of China; and Strategies of Promoting Ecological Civilization Construction and Green Development with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era (Grant No. 2017YCXZD007), one of the key innovation projects of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

Stemborers and poor soil fertility are among the main factors that contribute to this poor maize productivity. A novel cropping strategy, such as the use of push-pull technology, is one of the methods known to solve both challenges at once. A push-pull technology targeting the management of maize stemborers was implemented in the Hawassa district of Ethiopia with the ultimate goal of increased food security among smallholder farmers. This study evaluated farmers' perception of push-pull technology based on their experiences and observations of the demonstration plots that were established on-farm in Dore Bafano, Jara Gelelcha and Lebu Koremo village of the Hawasa district in 2016 and 2017. This study examined farmers' perception of the importance of push-pull technology in controlling stemborers and improving soil fertility and access to livestock feed. In both cropping seasons, except for Jara Gelelcha, the maize grain yields were significantly higher in the climate-adapted push-pull plots compared to the maize monocrop plots. The majority (89%) of push-pull technology-practising farmers rated the technology better than their maize production methods on attributes such as access to new livestock feed and the control of stemborer damage. As a result, approximately 96% of the interviewed farmers were interested in adopting the technology starting in the upcoming crop season. Awareness through training and effective dissemination strategies should be strengthened among stakeholders and policymakers for the sustainable use and scaling-up of push-pull technology.","[Kumela, Teshome; Enchalew, Bayu; Tefera, Tadele] ICIPE, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Mendesil, Esayas] Jimma Univ, Dept Hort & Plant Sci, Coll Agr & Vet Med, POB 307, Jimma, Ethiopia; [Kassie, Menale] ICIPE, POB 30772-00100, Nairobi, Kenya",Jimma University; International Centre of Insect Physiology & Ecology (ICIPE),"Tefera, T (corresponding author), ICIPE, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",ttefera@icipe.org,"Kassie, Menale/ADT-2906-2022",", Menale Kassie/0000-0002-6754-2432",USAID Feed the Future IPM Innovation Lab through Virginia Tech.

This is based on the method of channelizing the air discharged from its cavity layer, either by using a total heat enthalpy exchanger and choosing to exchange heat or otherwise. It has a certain thickness owing to the blinds that are installed in its cavity layer. The purpose of this research is to develop a window system that uses electrochromic (EC) glass, instead of blinds, as a solar-shielding device. This study also provides the specifications of the window system of reduced thickness. The performance of the window system is assessed by CFD analysis. The solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) of the proposed window system is found to range from 0.083 to 0.268 and its solar radiation properties can be controlled in a flexible manner.

Cooperation on transboundary water management is critical, particularly because it concerns issues across multiple states, SDGs and targets regarding agriculture, energy, ecosystems, climate adaptation, health, and peace and security. The percentage of transboundary basin area within a country that has an operational arrangement for water cooperation is used as the main indicator of such cooperation in the SDGs for equitable and reasonable use of water resources (SDG 6.5.2). However, no clear criteria and explanation are available for what exactly constitutes an equitable and reasonable use in any such operational arrangements. Furthermore, it is understandable that any such arrangements may be shaped by differences in historical, legal, and political contexts and hence may be inherently unjust. Here, we highlight the limitations of SDG indicators, particularly SDG 6.5.2, to monitor equity of resource sharing in transboundary river systems. Using Walzer's theory of morality of the state and cosmopolitanism as a framework, we examine the Nile basin as a case study to demonstrate the shortcomings of current SDG criteria and indicators.

Cooperative production of knowledge and action is designed to enhance the likelihood that the findings, models, simulations, and decision support tools developed are scientifically credible, solutions-oriented, and relevant to management needs and stakeholders' perspectives. To explore how interdisciplinary science and sustainable water management can be co-developed in practice, the experiences of an international collaboration are drawn on to improve local capacity to manage existing and future water resources efficiently, sustainably, and equitably in the State of Pernambuco in northeastern Brazil. Systems are developed to model and simulate rainfall, reservoir management, and flood forecasting that allow users to create, save, and compare future scenarios. A web-enabled decision support system is also designed to integrate models to inform water management and climate adaptation. The challenges and lessons learned from this project, the transferability of this approach, and strategies for evaluating the impacts on management decisions and sustainability outcomes are discussed.","[White, Dave D.; Lawless, Krista L.; Vivoni, Enrique R.; Mascaro, Giuseppe; Pahle, Robert] Arizona State Univ, Decis Ctr Desert City, 21 E 6th St,Suite 126B, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Kumar, Ipsita] Columbia Water Ctr, 842 SW Mudd,4711,500 West 120th St, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Coli, Pedro; Castillo, Raul Munoz] Interamer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA; [Moreda, Fekadu] Res Triangle Inst, POB 12194, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Asfora, Marcelo] Agencia Pernambucana Aguas & Clima, Ave Cruz Cabuga 1111, BR-5040000 Recife, PE, Brazil",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Inter-American Development Bank; Research Triangle Institute,"White, DD (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Decis Ctr Desert City, 21 E 6th St,Suite 126B, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",dave.white@asu.edu,"White, Dave/AAF-8898-2020; Vivoni, Enrique/E-1202-2012; Mascaro, Giuseppe/K-5504-2013","White, Dave/0000-0002-5518-1596; Vivoni, Enrique/0000-0002-2659-9459; Mascaro, Giuseppe/0000-0003-4516-1206; Lawless, Krista L./0000-0002-4215-1793","Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) under IDB Technical Cooperation [BR-T1305, C0112-15]",Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) under IDB Technical Cooperation,"This material was based upon work supported by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) under IDB Technical Cooperation BR-T1305 (IADB Contract No C0112-15), A Water Resources Decision Support System to Reduce Drought Vulnerability and Enable Adaptation to Climate Change in Pernambuco.

The study has been carried out in Glasgow, UK, a shrinking city with a maritime temperate climate type, and findings could guide future climate adaptation plans in terms of morphology and services provided by the municipality to overcome thermal discomfort in outdoor settings. In this case, SVF has been used as an indicator of urban morphology. The modified Pasquill-Gifford-Turner (PGT) classification system was adopted for classifying the temperature monitoring periods according to atmospheric stability conditions. Thirty two locations were selected on the basis of SVF with a wide variety of urban shapes (narrow streets, neighbourhood green spaces, urban parks, street canyons and public squares) and compared to a reference weather station during a total of twenty three transects during late spring and summer in 2013. Maximum daytime intra-urban temperature differences were found to be strongly correlated with atmospheric stability classes. Furthermore, differences in air temperature are noticeable in urban canyons, with a direct correlation to the site's SVF (or sky openness) and with an inverse trend under open-air conditions.

Watershed models are generally used to evaluate the effectiveness of BMP performance in improving water quality as the basis for watershed management recommendations. This study evaluates 171 management practice combinations that incorporate nutrient management, vegetated filter strips (VFS) and grazing management for their performances in improving water quality in a pasture-dominated watershed with dynamic land use changes during 1992-2007 by using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). These selected BMPs were further examined with future climate conditions (2010-2069) downscaled from three general circulation models (GCMs) for understanding how climate change may impact BMP performance. Simulation results indicate that total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) losses increase with increasing litter application rates. Alum-treated litter applications resulted in greater TN losses, and fewer TP losses than the losses from untreated poultry litter applications. For the same litter application rates, sediment and TP losses are greater for summer applications than fall and spring applications, while TN losses are greater for fall applications. Overgrazing management resulted in the greatest sediment and phosphorus losses, and VFS is the most influential management practice in reducing pollutant losses. Simulations also indicate that climate change impacts TSS losses the most, resulting in a larger magnitude of TSS losses. However, the performance of selected BMPs in reducing TN and TP losses was more stable in future climate change conditions than in the BMP performance in the historical climate condition. We recommend that selection of BMPs to reduce TSS losses should be a priority concern when multiple uses of BMPs that benefit nutrient reductions are considered in a watershed. Therefore, the BMP combination of spring litter application, optimum grazing management and filter strip with a VFS ratio of 42 could be a promising alternative for use in mitigating future climate change.","[Chiang, Li-Chi; Lin, Yu-Pin; Huang, Tao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioenvironm Syst Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Chaubey, Indrajeet] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Hong, Nien-Ming] Overseas Chinese Univ, Environm & Energy Management Ctr, Taichung 407, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Lin, YP (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioenvironm Syst Engn, 1,Sect 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",lchiang@ntu.edu.tw; ichaubey@purdue.edu; hong@ocu.edu.tw; yplin@ntu.edu.tw; jay7753@hotmail.com,"Hong, Nien-Ming/AAU-9369-2021","Lin, Yu-Pin/0000-0003-1954-334X; Chaubey, Indrajeet/0000-0001-8217-1089","USDA-CSREES under the Conservation Effects Assessment Program (CEAP) [2005-48619-03334]; NSF-TeraGrid program; National Science Council of the Republic of China, Taiwan [NSC101-2811-H-002-039]","USDA-CSREES under the Conservation Effects Assessment Program (CEAP); NSF-TeraGrid program; National Science Council of the Republic of China, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This study was supported by the USDA-CSREES under the Conservation Effects Assessment Program (CEAP) (project number 2005-48619-03334).

Climate change can alter terroir features. While several studies already addressed the effects of climate change on wine terroirs, little attention has been paid to agri-food GIs so far. Taking Veneto Region (Italy) as a case study and based on the Disaster Risk Reduction framework, this work aims to highlight the territorial hotspots of agri-food GIs exposure to climate disaster risk. The adopted approach combines two strategies: first, a cluster analysis on municipality level data (covering physical, social and production characteristics) is performed; second, the returned clusters are analysed under the light of climate change hazards, adopting nonparametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests) to pinpoint significant differences. The study elucidates region heterogeneity in terms of GI systems and the ter-ritories where they couple with local-level climate change hazards.

Four vegetation types were studied during the period 1979 to 2011: cropland, grassland, forest, and shrubland. The results indicated that: (1) The climate data showed that Central Asia experienced a rise in annual mean temperature and a decline in precipitation from 1979 to 2011; (2) the mean NPP for Central Asia in 1979-2011 was 281.79 gC m(-2) yr(-1), and the cropland had the highest NPP compared with the other vegetation types, with a value of 646.25 gC m(-2) yr(-1); (3) grassland presented as a carbon source (-0.21 gC m(-2) yr(-1)), whereas the other three types were carbon sinks; (4) the four vegetation types showed similar responses to climate variation during the past 30 years, and grassland is the most sensitive ecosystem in Central Asia.

The IPCC Fourth Assessment emphasizes that adaptation strategies are essential. Addressing adaptation in the context of small-scale, semi-subsistence agriculture raises special challenges. High data demands including site-specific bio-physical and economic data are an important constraint. This paper applies a new approach to impact assessment, the Tradeoff Analysis model for Multi-Dimensional Impact Assessment (TOA-MD), which simulates technology adoption and associated economic, environmental and social outcomes in a heterogeneous farm population for a regional impact assessment. The methodology uses the kinds of survey, experimental and modeled data that are typically available in countries where semi-subsistence systems are important, combined with future socio-economic scenarios based on new scenario pathway concepts being developed by the climate change and impact assessment modeling communities. Characteristics of current and future agricultural systems, including land use, output, output price, cost of production, and farm and household size are analyzed and compared for both current and projected future climate (2030), with and without adaptation, and for different socio-economic scenarios. The methodology is applied to two study areas in Kenya. These case studies show the potential of this approach to provide a flexible, generic framework that can use available and modeled data to evaluate climate impact and adaptation strategies under a range of socio-economic scenarios.

We use discrete stochastic programming models of three Italian farming areas to simulate the adaptation paths of their farm types to changes in yields and irrigation needs of crops that climate change could generate at 2030. This is done in a context of progressive decrease of water availability. We condense the adaptation choices attributed by the optimization process to the farm types by means of indicators of value produced per water cubic meter and per hectare. We use those indicators in a quadratic regression analysis to explain the change in the hourly wages of family labour, which represents the farm resources' profitability. The examination of the resulting elasticity indices outlines the adaptation paths impact on farm profitability. This integrated analysis of optimization models and econometric regression shows that the core of Italian cow milk production, based on medium-high intensity forage systems, adapts better. Instead, available technologies and structural features provide much narrower margins to livestock farms based on intensive forage production and, conversely, to more extensive livestock systems. Crop farms adapt by reducing labour use in less profitable activities, which boosts family hourly wages but increases unemployment. Furthermore, the surface of some crops can be expanded because their cycle takes place in months in which the availability of water decreases less and their irrigation requirement increases less; however, the low productivity of these crops does not allow to increase wages for family labour. The results on farms overall profitability derive from an integrated analysis of changes in water resources productivity, soil and labor. Mathematical programming outlines the adaptation paths that maximize farming incomes; the econometric analysis indicates whether those paths support profitability, favouring farm economic sustainability.","[Cortignani, Raffaele; Dell'Unto, Davide; Dono, Gabriele] Univ Tuscia, Dept Agr & Forest Sci DAFNE, Viterbo, Italy",Tuscia University,"Dono, G (corresponding author), Univ Tuscia, Dept Agr & Forest Sci DAFNE, Viterbo, Italy.",dono@unitus.it,"Cortignani, Raffaele/ABF-9897-2021","Cortignani, Raffaele/0000-0002-2685-9783; Dell'Unto, Davide/0000-0003-2721-8352","Ministry of Agricultural Policy (MiPAAF) [D.M. 8608/7303/2008, DM 2660/7303/2012]; Department of Excellence by the Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) [232/2016]","Ministry of Agricultural Policy (MiPAAF); Department of Excellence by the Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","The study was supported by the projects AGROSCENARI (D.M. 8608/7303/2008, www.agroscenari.it), MACSUR-JPI-FACCE (DM 2660/7303/2012, www.MACSUR.eu), by the Ministry of Agricultural Policy (MiPAAF), and Department of Excellence, (Law 232/2016, http://www.unitus.it/it/dipartimento/dafne/eccallenza-nella-ricerca-e-nella-didattica/articolo/sintesi-del-progetto), by the Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR).

The EUSF is viewed as a valuable instrument for pooling risk among countries in Europe and potentially as a model for financing loss and damage from climate change in vulnerable countries worldwide. This paper assesses its future prospects taking account of reforms adopted in 2014. Our analysis is based on three recognized aims of the Solidarity Fund: its promotion of solidarity with those countries having the least capacity to cope with major disasters; its contribution to proactive disaster risk reduction and management (climate adaptation); and its robustness with regard to its risk of depletion (stress testing). Using a simulation approach for future disasters, we conclude that the reformed EUSF's risk of depletion, although it is reasonably robust to more frequent disasters, could be reduced by increasing member state contributions and/or engaging in risk transfer. The European Commission has taken important steps in linking the fund to proactive risk reduction; yet, by changing its budgeting practices, the commission could be more proactive in encouraging risk management in member states. In its current form, the EUSF does not embed needs-based solidarity. Lower-income new member states have received disproportionately less compensation in terms of eligible losses, although on average, they have received more disaster aid than what they contribute to the fund. Solidarity could be enhanced by changing the rules for disbursing aid. After briefly describing alternative risk-pooling models in the Caribbean, Africa, and Europe, we suggest how design features of the EUSF as compared to other regional risk pools can inform discussions on the Warsaw International Loss and Damage Mechanism.","[Hochrainer-Stigler, Stefan; Linnerooth-Bayer, Joanne; Lorant, Anna] IIASA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Hochrainer-Stigler, S (corresponding author), IIASA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",hochrain@iiasa.ac.at; bayer@iiasa.ac.at; lorant@iiasa.ac.at,,"Hochrainer-Stigler, Stefan/0000-0002-9929-8171; Bayer, Joanne/0000-0003-3084-2471",InsAdapt (Insurance for Adaptation) - Austrian Climate Research Program,InsAdapt (Insurance for Adaptation) - Austrian Climate Research Program,This work was partly funded through the InsAdapt (Insurance for Adaptation) project funded by the Austrian Climate Research Program.,,38,15,15,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Existing studies have largely focused on crop yield, whereas how CF responds to climate change remains poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the global climate sensitivity of caloric yields and CF at national scale. We find a robust negative association between warming and both caloric yield and CF. By the 2050s, projected CF increases in cold regions are offset by larger decreases in warm regions, resulting in a net global CF reduction (-4.2 +/- 2.5% in high emission scenario), suggesting that climate-driven decline in CF will exacerbate crop production loss and not provide climate adaptation alone. Although irrigation is effective in offsetting the projected production loss, irrigation areas have to be expanded by >5% in warm regions to fully offset climate-induced production losses by the 2050s. Climate change will impact agriculture, and this study shows cropping frequency and caloric yield are negatively impacted on the global scale by warming. While cold regions will increase cropping frequency, warm regions will see greater decreases, resulting in an overall decline in production.","[Zhu, Peng; Ciais, Philippe] CEA, CNRS, UVSQ Orme Merisiers, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Zhu, Peng] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Peng; Xin, Qinchuan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangdong Key Lab Urbanizat & Geosimulat, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Burney, Jennifer] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Global Policy & Strategy, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Chang, Jinfeng] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Jin, Zhenong] Univ Minnesota, Dept Bioprod & Biosyst Engn, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Mueller, Nathaniel D.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Mueller, Nathaniel D.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Xu, Jialu] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Natl Safety & Emergency Management, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Yu, Le] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling,Inst Global Change St, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yu, Le] Minist Educ, Ecol Field Stn East Asian Migratory Birds, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Makowski, David] Univ Paris Saclay, INRAE, AgroParisTech, UMR 518,MIA, Palaiseau, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Hong Kong; Sun Yat Sen University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Zhejiang University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Colorado State University; Colorado State University; Beijing Normal University; Tsinghua University; AgroParisTech; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Zhu, P (corresponding author), CEA, CNRS, UVSQ Orme Merisiers, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, Gif Sur Yvette, France.;Zhu, P (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Zhu, P (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangdong Key Lab Urbanizat & Geosimulat, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",peng.zhu@lsce.ipsl.fr,"CHANG, Jinfeng/A-4603-2019; Xin, Qinchuan/O-3276-2014; Yu, Le/C-3701-2008; Burney, Jennifer/C-6528-2015","CHANG, Jinfeng/0000-0003-4463-7778; Xin, Qinchuan/0000-0003-1146-4874; Yu, Le/0000-0003-3115-2042; Xu, Jialu/0000-0002-7745-2000; Burney, Jennifer/0000-0003-3532-2934","CLAND project [16-CONV-0003]; Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Programme [2021Z11GHX002, 20223080017]; NSF/NIFA [1639318 INFEWS/T1]; National Key Research and Development Programme of China [2017YFA0604300, 2021YFE0114500]; ISIPEDIA: The Open Inter-Sectoral Impacts Encyclopedia [ANR-17-ERA4-0006]; meta-programme CLIMAE-INRAE",CLAND project; Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Programme; NSF/NIFA; National Key Research and Development Programme of China; ISIPEDIA: The Open Inter-Sectoral Impacts Encyclopedia; meta-programme CLIMAE-INRAE,"P.Z. and P.C. are supported by the CLAND project (grant no. 16-CONV-0003) and ISIPEDIA: The Open Inter-Sectoral Impacts Encyclopedia (grant no.

As part of this study, first, various frameworks for approaching biomimicry' in general are discussed and then relevant examples pertaining to architecture are evaluated. Case studies are critiqued with respect to varied levels of sustainability achieved and its causative factors.

However, planning for UGLs is often secondary to other planning categories, and they often remain underutilized. Through an analysis of Master Plans of major urban centres in Serbia and Bulgaria, this paper discusses the conceptualization of UGLs and the integration of ESs in planning and design processes. Based on findings obtained through an Analytical Hierarchy Process, this paper develops a conceptual framework for linking ESs with different UGL types in the course of urban planning, in order to achieve a better application of UGLs in strategies for the amelioration of micro-climatic conditions in urban areas. This paper proposes framework for an ecosystem sensitive conceptualization of UGLs in planning and design process, where UGL typology should replace functional categories, and spatial indicators are defined in relation to UGL types. Such an approach can improve the understanding and ES-sensitive application of UGLs in planning processes and local adaptation strategies.","[Vranic, Petar; Milutinovic, Slobodan] Univ Nisu, Fac Occupat Safety, Environm Protect Dept, Fak Zastite Radu, Nish, Serbia; [Zhiyanski, Miglena] Forest Res Inst, Forest Ecol Dept, Sofia, Bulgaria","Bulgarian Academy of Sciences; Forest Research Institute, Bulgaria","Vranic, P (corresponding author), Univ Nisu, Fac Occupat Safety, Environm Protect Dept, Fak Zastite Radu, Nish, Serbia.",petarvvv@gmail.com,"Zhiyanski, Miglena/O-6671-2017","Vranic, Petar/0000-0002-9671-992X; Milutinovic, Slobodan/0000-0002-4384-3687",,,,,64,1,1,2,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1943-815X,1943-8168,,J INTEGR ENVIRON SCI,J.

To do this, a risk analysis methodology has been developed at the cadastral parcel level in one of the main tourist areas of both the Canary Islands and Spain, the coast of Arona and Adeje. The method based on the approaches of the United Nations Office for Disaster Relief (UNDRO) and applied for floods, has made it possible to define precisely the factors involved in the formulation of risk. The use of the incident records of the Coordinating Center for Emergencies and Security (CECOES) 1-1-2 of the Canary Islands Government, as well as other official sources, has allowed the threat to be characterized. Similarly, for the study of vulnerability, a resulting index between 0 and 1 has been used, derived from the crossing of multiple socio-territorial indicators. The results show how the studied areas have 52.4% of the plots with risk levels between Moderate and Very High, highlighting the towns of Torviscas, Las Americas and Los Cristianos. Finally, the result of the risk analysis is presented through a flood risk mapping, ultimately designed as an adaptation tool for future decision-making by the different local administrations.","[Diez, Abel Lopez; Pacheco, Jaime Diaz; Antequera, Pedro Dorta] Univ La Laguna, San Cristobal de La Lag, Spain; [Suarez, Pablo Mayer] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Diez, AL (corresponding author), Univ La Laguna, San Cristobal de La Lag, Spain.",alopezd@ull.edu.es; jdiazpac@ull.edu.es; pdorta@ull.edu.es; pablo.mayer@ulpgc.es,,,,,,,56,0,0,1,1,CONSEJO SUPERIOR INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS-CSIC,MADRID,"VITRUVIO 8, 28006 MADRID, SPAIN",0014-1496,1988-8546,,ESTUD GEOGR,Estud.

Online focus groups were held with coastal property owners in Nova Scotia to understand how they assess coastal risks and four approaches to nature-based coastal adaptation: living shorelines, accommodation, retreat, and dyke realignment to make space for wetland restoration. Results revealed ongoing trust in traditional hard-line approaches, but also interest in knowing more about nature-based options. There was general support for living shorelines, albeit with scepticism; a concern that accommodation is just a band-aid approach; resistance to retreat, despite general recognition of its future utility; and a lack of understanding of dyke realignment. The successful implementation of nature-based coastal adaptation approaches will require more evidence of their viability, better options for financing them, and engagement with communities around the best-fit alternatives for them.","[Sutton, Krysta; Kerr, Gillian; Sherren, Kate] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Studies, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Tonge, Charlotte] Narrat Res Ltd, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Berglund, Lisa] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Planning, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Kerr, Gillian] Royal Rd Univ, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Sherren, Kate] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Studies, 6100 Univ Ave,Suite 5010,POB 15000, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada",Dalhousie University; Dalhousie University; Dalhousie University,"Sherren, K (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Studies, 6100 Univ Ave,Suite 5010,POB 15000, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",kate.sherren@dal.ca,,"Sherren, Kate/0000-0003-1576-9878",Ocean Frontier Institute; Natural Resources Canada; Natural Sciences andEngineering Research Council of Canada [NSERC NETGP523374-18],Ocean Frontier Institute; Natural Resources Canada(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service); Natural Sciences andEngineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),"Ocean Frontier Institute,Grant/Award Number: Seed Fund Grant;Natural Resources Canada,Grant/Award Number: Climate ChangeAdaptation Fund; Natural Sciences andEngineering Research Council of Canada,Grant/Award Number: NSERC NETGP523374-18",,48,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3658,1541-0064,,CAN GEOGR-GEOGR CAN,Can.

Heatwaves are directly connected to human health through heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Vulnerable people, particularly those without effective cooling in their homes, are at high risk of illness or death during heatwaves. Heat refuges-typically air-conditioned or cooled buildings that have been designated as a site to provide respite and safety during extreme heat-are commonly used in the Northern Hemisphere for vulnerable people during heatwaves but are less prevalent in Australia. In Australia, heat refuges tend to be managed by local councils as part of local planned climate adaptation measures. This article discusses the development of a heat refuge strategy in Blacktown City Local Government Area in western Sydney. Blacktown City has higher summer average temperatures than coastal Sydney, caused by its local geography and urban heat island effects that limit the inflow of cooler coastal winds. The draft Blacktown City heat refuge strategy is based on some of the key components of disaster risk reduction including risk assessment, early warning systems, emergency management planning, evacuation centres and community participation.","[Dufty, Neil] Molino Stewart Pty Ltd, Parramatta, Australia",,"Dufty, N (corresponding author), Molino Stewart Pty Ltd, Parramatta, Australia.",,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,1,AUSTRALIAN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT INST,EAST MELBOURNE,"LEVEL 1, 340 ALBERT ST, EAST MELBOURNE, VIC 3002, AUSTRALIA",1324-1540,,,AUST J EMERG MANAG,Aust.

However, few researches study the climate adaptability of monocrystalline silicon STPV glazing. For the STPV glazing system, this paper develops a multi-physics model including the solar radiation, optical, electrical, and thermal models to analyze its overall performance. The model is validated by experiment. The performance of the STPV glazing system with different solar cell coverage ratios (R) in various climate zones of China (Guangzhou, Changsha, Kunming, Lhasa, and Beijing) is also studied. Among the five cities, the energy output of the STPV glazing system is proportional to the R value, and all follow approximately the same trend as the incident solar radiation. However, the geographic latitude has a greater impact on the electrical performance of the STPV glazing system than solar radiation. The thermal performance is primarily affected by the ambient temperature. The STPV glazing system performs well in the temperate area, with low cooling demand and high annual energy output. Compared with the traditional single clear glazing, the overall performance of the STPV glazing system is better, especially when the large solar cell coverage ratio.

Besides climatic change, current demographic trends, economic development and related land use changes have direct impact on increasing demand for freshwater resources. Taken together, the net effect of these supply and demand changes is affecting the vulnerability of water resources. The concept of 'vulnerability' is not straightforward as there is no universally accepted approach for assessing vulnerability. In this study, we review the evolution of approaches to vulnerability assessment related to water resources. From the current practices, we identify research gaps, and approaches to overcome these gaps a generalized assessment framework is developed. A feasibility study is then presented in the context of the Lower Brahmaputra River Basin (LBRB). The results of the feasibility study identify the current main constraints (e.g., lack of institutional coordination) and opportunities (e.g., adaptation) of LBRB.

In the city of Santiago, Chile, extreme weather that can be associated with a nascent manifestation of climate change has caused high-turbidity events, repeatedly forcing the main water company to interrupt the supply of drinking water, affecting millions of people. This study proposes a transformative response to reduce harm from extreme events due to climate change. The traditional approach of increasing resilience through large infrastructure works can be complemented by one-off reductions in water use during emergencies, in exchange for economic compensation. This alternative seeks to transfer the individual responsibility of water companies to a collective one, where the community is an active agent that reduces damage in the face of extreme events resulting from climate change. In the assessment of this response, we used a choice experiment to estimate the minimum amount users are willing to accept in compensation for water service interruptions. The results show that willingness to accept compensation is significant (close to 0.6 USD/hour) and decreases when users have experienced additional unplanned interruptions. The aggregate cost of the compensation is lower than infrastructure investments required to avoid service interruptions under various future hypothetical hydroclimatic scenarios associated with climate change impacts. Therefore, compensation-based instruments for water service interruptions could be a more flexible and cost-effective alternative to infrastructure-based measures to cope with future climate hazards.","[Undurraga, Rafael; Vicuna, Sebastian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Hydraul & Environm Engn, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Vicuna, Sebastian; Melo, Oscar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Interdisciplinario Cambio Global, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Vicuna, Sebastian] Ctr Invest Gest Integrada Riesgo Desastres, ANID Fondap 15110017, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Melo, Oscar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Agr Econ, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Melo, Oscar] Millennium Nucleus Ctr Socioecon Impact Environm, Santiago 7820436, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Undurraga, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Hydraul & Environm Engn, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",rundurraga1@uc.cl; svicuna@ing.puc.cl; omelo@uc.cl,"Vicuna, Sebastian/M-2747-2016; melo, oscar/N-8872-2014","Vicuna, Sebastian/0000-0001-6971-0068; melo, oscar/0000-0002-9136-5413","Centro de Cambio Global UC; ANID through project FONDECYT [Nffi1171133]; ANID/FONDAP Grant [15110017, 15110020]",Centro de Cambio Global UC; ANID through project FONDECYT; ANID/FONDAP Grant,"The authors are thankful for the funding from Centro de Cambio Global UC, ANID through project FONDECYT Nffi1171133, and ANID/FONDAP Grant Nos. 15110017 (CIGIDEN) and 15110020 (CEDEUS).",,39,6,6,1,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUN,2020,12,6,,,,,,,1540,10.3390/w12061540,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12061540,,,18,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,MR9DX,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000553890300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Infrastructure has historically been designed and used for the single purpose of managing stormwater, but this gray infrastructure typically has negative consequences and fails to address other challenges faced by urban areas. As an alternative, vegetated Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) such as bioretention facilities, constructed stormwater wetlands, and outfall retrofits may be used to capture and treat stormwater, while also contributing other benefits, such as reducing urban heat-island effects, increasing carbon sequestration, improving air quality, climate adaptation, and access to open space, and enhancing mental and physical health and urban biodiversity. To optimize these benefits, the siting of NBS can be crucial. We developed a spatially explicit analytical methodology, Planting Stormwater Solutions, to prioritize the siting of vegetated NBS to benefit biological diversity, social and public health, and water quality. Using Los Angeles as a case study, we demonstrate where benefits spatially converge or diverge. We found that while some of the greatest opportunities to benefit biodiversity occur along waterways, the greatest social and public health benefits may be realized for NBS installed in and around heavily developed areas. NBS sited in areas with a high density of commercial and industrial land uses may provide the greatest water quality benefits. Use of our analytical methodology may allow decision-makers with limited resources and multiple challenges to make more informed siting decisions for vegetated NBS.","[Jessup, Kelsey; Parker, Sophie S.; Randall, John M.; Cohen, Brian S.; Roderick-Jones, Rowan; Ganguly, Shona; Sourial, Jill] Nature Conservancy, 445 S Figueroa St,Suite 1950, Los Angeles, CA 90071 USA",Nature Conservancy,"Jessup, K (corresponding author), Nature Conservancy, 445 S Figueroa St,Suite 1950, Los Angeles, CA 90071 USA.",kelsey.jessup@tnc.org,,"Jessup, Kelsey/0000-0002-8569-7286; Parker, Sophie S./0000-0002-9134-0742; Randall, John/0000-0003-2254-0385",,,,,53,9,9,12,49,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1618-8667,1610-8167,,URBAN FOR URBAN GREE,Urban For.

With resource conflict being increasingly recognised as one significant outcome of climate variability and change, understanding the underlying drivers that shape differential vulnerabilities in areas that are double-exposed to climate and conflict has great significance. Climate change vulnerability frameworks are rarely applied in water conflict research. This article presents a composite climate-water conflict vulnerability index based on a double exposure framework developed from advances in vulnerability and livelihood assessments. We apply the index to assess how the determinants of vulnerability can be useful in understanding climate variability and water conflict interactions and to establish how knowledge of the climate-conflict linked context can shape interventions to reduce vulnerability. We surveyed 240 resource users (farmers, fishermen and pastoralists) in seven villages on the south-eastern shores of Lake Chad in the Republic of Chad to collect data on a range of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity variables. Results suggest that pastoralists are more vulnerable in terms of climate-structured aggressive behaviour within a lake-based livelihoods context where all resource user groups show similar levels of exposure to climate variability. Our approach can be used to understand the human and environmental security components of vulnerability to climate change and to explore ways in which conflict-structured climate adaptation and climate-sensitive conflict management strategies can be integrated to reduce the vulnerability of populations in high-risk, conflict-prone environments.","[Okpara, Uche T.; Stringer, Lindsay C.; Dougill, Andrew J.] Univ Leeds, Fac Environm, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Okpara, UT (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Fac Environm, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",uche4purpose@yahoo.co.uk; l.stringer@leeds.ac.uk; a.j.dougill@leeds.ac.uk,,"Stringer, Lindsay/0000-0003-0017-1654",UK ESRC's Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy [ES/K006576/1]; Nigeria Tertiary Education Trust; Philip Leverhulme Prize; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK ESRC's Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; Nigeria Tertiary Education Trust; Philip Leverhulme Prize; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),We gratefully acknowledge the valuable contributions of the Lake Chad Basin Commission for providing links to the lakeside villages and islands in the Republic of Chad.

Increasingly, associations between drought and mental health and drought and food insecurity have been observed in a number of countries. The impact of drought on the association between food insecurity and mental health has received little attention. Methods: Population-based study using data from a nationally representative panel survey of Australian adults in which participants report behaviour, health, social, economic and demographic information annually. Exposure to drought was modelled using annual rainfall data during Australia's 'Big Dry'. Regression modelling examined associations between drought and three indicative measures of food insecurity and mental health, controlling for confounding factors. Results: People who reported missing meals due to financial stress reported borderline moderate/high distress levels. People who consumed below-average levels of core foods reported more distress than those who consumed above the average level, while people consuming discretionary foods above the average level reported greater distress than those consuming below the threshold. In all drought exposure categories, people missing meals due to cost reported higher psychological distress than those not missing meals. Compared to drought-unadjusted psychological distress levels, in most drought categories, people consuming higher-than-average discretionary food levels reported higher levels of distress. Conclusions: Exposure to drought moderates the association between measures of food insecurity and psychological distress, generally increasing the distress level. Climate adaptation strategies that consider social, nutrition and health impacts are needed.","[Friel, Sharon] Australian Natl Univ, Regulatory Inst Network, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Friel, Sharon; Dinh, Huong; Walls, Helen L.] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Berry, Helen; O'Brien, Lean] Univ Canberra, Fac Hlth, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Dinh, Huong] Univ Canberra, Fac Business Govt & Law, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Walls, Helen L.] Leverhulme Ctr Integrat Res Agr & Hlth, London, England; [Walls, Helen L.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England",Australian National University; Australian National University; University of Canberra; University of Canberra; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Friel, S (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Regulatory Inst Network, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",Sharon.friel@anu.edu.au,,"O'Brien, Lean/0000-0002-8919-3077; Friel, Sharon/0000-0002-8345-5435",Australian National Health and Medical Research Council [585482],Australian National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),This work was partly supported by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Project grant number 585482.

Our objectives were to identify (a) what climate factors have historically affected winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields in eastern Colorado, (b) how management may mitigate climate impacts, and (c) the potential for varietal selection to climate extremes. We paired long-term yield data for wheat in rotations that varied in management (tillage intensity, with and without fallow) with robust on-site weather data. We also used data from colocated variety trials to investigate trade-offs between mean yields and the ability to withstand water and temperature stress. Precipitation in April-June was nearly as predictive of yields as full growing season precipitation. While precipitation and air temperatures are tightly linked in this agroecosystem, temperatures were more predictive of yields than precipitation. Increases in minimum May temperatures positively affected yields, likely because of minimizing freeze damage, but did not offset detrimental effects of warmer daytime spring and summer temperatures. The largest negative temperature effects were caused by extreme maximum temperatures in June. No-till with fallow maximized yields. Lowand high-yielding varieties did not differ in yield responses to high temperatures, suggesting that future advancements in heat stress resistance will not necessarily require yield trade-offs. Climate pressures will likely require producers to balance yield goals with maintaining soil cover, underscoring the difficulty of identifying win-win climate adaptations.","[Miner, Grace L.; Stewart, Catherine E.; Vigil, Merle F.] USDA ARS, Soil Management & Sugar Beet Res, 2150 Ctr Ave, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Poss, David J.] USDA ARS, Cent Great Plains Resources Management Res, Akron, CO 80720 USA; [Haley, Scott D.; Jones-Diamond, Sally M.; Mason, R.

National meteorological agencies supported by global and regional centers are trying to generate climate forecasts tailored to sector-specific operational applications for a wide range of potential users. However, the big challenge is to develop a mechanism that will effectively communicate the information in a language that could be easily understood at different levels to obtain the maximum benefits from the information they receive.The International Research and Applications Project (IRAP) was a research experiment aimed at improving the livelihoods of rural farmers in Bihar, India, by producing and providing them with tailored weather and climate information. Forecast Application for Risk Management in Agriculture (FARM) schools were conducted to improve the awareness of farmers about the need for climate information and climate adaptation interventions which was applied for Kharif crops in summer monsoon 2018. A communication mechanism was established with the support of local partners to disseminate the tailored forecast and advisories to farmers. Assessment results revealed that the climate information is strongly valued by farmers if provided through a mechanism that they trust. More vulnerable farmers have limited access and ability to use the information, thus capacity building efforts like FARM schools are immensely helpful. Farmers recognize the critical role of climate variability in determining livelihood outcomes and actively seek out information to manage variability. This intervention helped trained farmers to better adjust their farming decisions through enhanced uptake of weather and climate information.","[Anshul, Agarwal; Mitesh, Sawant; Srinivasan, G.] Reg Integrated Multihazard Early warning Syst Asia, POB 4, Klongluang 12120, Thailand; [Buizer, J.; Finan, T.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ USA; [Singh, K.

While observations have recently confirmed the presence of flood anomalies in Europe, their exact causes are not clear. Here we analyse streamflow and climate observations during 1960-2010 to show that shifts in flood generation processes contribute more to the occurrence of regional flood anomalies than changes in extreme rainfall. A shift from rain on dry soil to rain on wet soil events by 5% increased the frequency of flood-rich periods in the Atlantic region, and an opposite shift in the Mediterranean region increased the frequency of flood-poor periods, but will likely make singular extreme floods occur more often. Flood anomalies driven by changing flood generation processes in Europe may further intensify in a warming climate and should be considered in flood estimation and management. Changes in the processes that can generate floods, such as rain falling on wet rather than dry soil, affect the occurrence of regional floods more than changes in extreme rainfall, according to an analysis of flood anomalies observed in Europe combined with a flood process typology.","[Tarasova, Larisa; Merz, Ralf; Basso, Stefano; Miniussi, Arianna] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Catchment Hydrol, Halle, Germany; [Lun, David; Bloeschl, Guenter; Bertola, Miriam] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Hydraul Engn & Water Resources Management, Vienna, Austria; [Merz, Ralf] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Geosci & Geog, Halle, Germany; [Basso, Stefano] Norwegian Inst Water Res NIVA, Oslo, Norway; [Rakovec, Oldrich; Samaniego, Luis; Thober, Stephan; Kumar, Rohini] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Hydrosyst, Leipzig, Germany; [Rakovec, Oldrich] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Prague, Czech Republic",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Technische Universitat Wien; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Tarasova, L (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Catchment Hydrol, Halle, Germany.",larisa.tarasova@ufz.de,,,Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL,,76,0,0,0,0,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2662-4435,,COMMUN EARTH ENVIRON,Commun.

The practical cooling EC is relevant to the dynamic thermal performance of cooler air-conditioner. Analyzing the difference in cooling efficiency and energy-saving potential (ESP) of the same equipment is significant to cutting down building EC. Using the concept of thermodynamic perfectness, a thermal model of refrigeration equipment is established to analyze the deviation from the ideal refrigeration cycle. At the same time, to explore the internal connection between its energy conservation and climate adaptability, five typical cities in different thermal climate zones were selected. Dynamic load model of an office building is established and the cooling EC throughout the year of each city is simulated separately. Preliminary research results show that the thermodynamic perfectness does not have a single-valued function relationship with their cooling efficiency; Guangzhou has the highest cooling demand, with a total cooling load 14.3% higher than Wuhan, and its cooling EC is lower than Wuhan. Through the establishment of a thermodynamic model and preliminary application, the calculation of the cooling ESP in different climatic regions in Chinese summer is greatly important to the usage of air conditioner.","[Jin, Zhineng; Zheng, Yanhong; Zhang, Yin] Sichuan Univ, Coll Architecture & Environm, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Sichuan University,"Zhang, Y (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Room 112,Execut Bldg,24,South Sect 1,Yihuan Rd, Chengdu 610043, Peoples R China.",cdzhangyin@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [51706148]; Sichuan Science and Technology Program [2017JY0333],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Sichuan Science and Technology Program,This research is financed by National Natural Science Foundation of China (51706148) and Sichuan Science and Technology Program (2017JY0333).,,41,0,0,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1346-7581,1347-2852,,J ASIAN ARCHIT BUILD,J.

This paper provides an overview of climate risks to energy infrastructures in India and details two case studies - a crude oil importing port and. a western coast railway transporting coal. The climate vulnerability of the port has been mapped using an index while that of the railway has been done through a damage function for RCP 4.5.0 and 8.5 scenarios. Our analysis shows that risk management through adaptation is likely to be very expensive. The system risks can be even greater and might adversely affect energy security and access objectives. Aligning, sustainable development and climate adaptation measures can deliver substantial co-benefits. The key policy recommendations include: i) mandatory vulnerability assessment to future climate risks for energy infrastructures; ii) project and systemic risks in the vulnerability index; iii) adaptation funds for unmitigated climate risks; iv) continuous monitoring of climatic parameters and implementation of adaptation measures, and iv) sustainability actions along energy infrastructures that enhance climate resilience and simultaneously deliver co-benefits to local agents.

We conducted 17 face-to-face semi-structured interviews with landholders in Victoria, Australia who voluntarily participate in biodiverse carbon plantings on their land, focusing in particular on the role of social capital for understanding how 'early adopters' can advocate for programs locally. The interviews revealed the importance of social networks and the profound impact of trusted peers on the diffusion of carbon planting schemes. These social capital dimensions are especially important for shaping ongoing participation and the ways in which participants become active agents in trusted relationships that influence the participation of others. Our results suggest that the positive impact of social networks can counteract doubts about the validity of climate adaptation responses such as carbon planting, and enable landholders to connect the program with their existing stewardship motivations. The ability for early adopters of the program to demonstrate the physical materialisation of their plantings to others was vital to this process. We propose that targeting champions and trusted peers in local communities could accelerate the proliferation of biodiverse carbon planting schemes.","[Torabi, Nooshin; Cooke, Benjamin; Bekessy, Sarah A.] RMIT Univ Melbourne, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Interdisciplinary Conservat Sci Res Grp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Torabi, N (corresponding author), RMIT Univ Melbourne, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Interdisciplinary Conservat Sci Res Grp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",nooshin.torabi@rmit.edu.au,"Cooke, Ben/S-3603-2019; Torabi, Nooshin/AAD-3220-2019","Cooke, Ben/0000-0002-8845-7966; Torabi, Dr Nooshin/0000-0002-5834-4477; Bekessy, Sarah/0000-0002-0503-1979",Australian government's National Environmental Science Program (Threatened Species Recovery Hub); Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions; ARC Future Fellowship,Australian government's National Environmental Science Program (Threatened Species Recovery Hub)(Australian Government); Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions(Australian Research Council); ARC Future Fellowship(Australian Research Council),This research was conducted with the support of funding from the Australian government's National Environmental Science Program (Threatened Species Recovery Hub) and the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions.

However, in the technological dimension, there are technologies that induce opposite effects on the co-benefit of CO2 and LAP in specific industry sectors. Precalcinating line and shaft kiln, two types of technologies adopted in clinker calcinating procedure in cement industry are examples: the former consume less energy but emit more dust and NOx than the later. As a result, the overall co-benefits of LAP reductions for cement industry are uncertain. This study consequently aims at assessing the overall co-benefit (although it may be a negative co-benefit) of CO2 mitigation policy on dust, NOx, SO2 emissions in China's cement industry aggregately by establishing bottom-up optimization model on the basis of all types of technologies which are called technology system in cement production. CO2 mitigation goal, as represented by reduction rate is regarded as constraint input into the model. In order to investigate the evolution of co-benefits and technology paths with the change of CO2 mitigation goal, hundreds of reduction rates are selected randomly between the range 0.5-10.5%. The lower bound 0.5% reveals CO2 emission reduction that can be reached for cement industry under existing political constraints and without any extra CO2 mitigation goal. The upper bound 10.5% is the greatest reduction rate under which the model could derive feasible solution. According to changes of technology penetration rates as CO2 goal tightens, we could evaluate the more cost-effective technologies from the perspective of co-benefit. They are vertical milling, precalcinating line with the scale of 7000-10,000 ton/day, roll-squeezer belonging to Main Production Technology (MPT), utilization of cement grinding aids, multi-channel coal burner belonging to Affiliated Energy-saving technology (AES), combination of bag-filter and electrostatic precipitator and ultra-low NOx burning technology belonging to Pollution Control Technology (PCT). With respect to the evolution of co-benefits on air pollutions, when the CO2 reduction rate is below 2.3%, co-benefit of dust and SO2 reduction exist while that of NOx does not; and when the rate is above 2.3%, co-benefits of all the three pollutants exist. A practically referable goal of CO2 mitigation rate of short/mid-term is approximately 5.5% in view of the following three considerations: a) co-benefits augment as CO2 reduction rate increases; b) total cost increases as the CO2 abatement goal becomes stricter; and c) the majority of emerging technologies normally cannot penetrate to 100% in cement production within a relatively short time.

The research focuses on the contemporary architectural intervention of converting original semi-open spaces, that have been acting as such during all periods of the year, into indoor spaces by adding movable glass dividers. A representative building that reflects the typical arrangement of rural vernacular earth architecture in Cyprus is selected for detailed investigation. In situ measurements and simulation tools are used to investigate the adjustment of airflow through the operation of windows when the dividers are open (heating period) and closed (cooling period). Computational Fluid Dynamics are employed in order to illustrate the temperature distribution of various window operation patterns that are evaluated according to the adaptive thermal comfort. The results argue on the climatic adaptability of vernacular buildings and indicate that the examined window control patterns have a more prominent impact during the heating period. Conclusions confirm the cooling potential of night ventilation and highlight the benefit of having energy-aware and engaged occupants. Key directions regarding conservation practices and occupant's behaviour are brought forth, bringing energy efficiency and comfort into the discussion about cultural heritage.","[Thravalou, Stavroula; Philokyprou, Maria; Michael, Aimilios] Univ Cyprus, Dept Architecture, Nicosia, Cyprus",University of Cyprus,"Thravalou, S (corresponding author), Univ Cyprus, Dept Architecture, Nicosia, Cyprus.",thraval@ucy.ac.cy,,"Michael, Aimilios/0000-0001-8604-1054; Thravalou, Stavroula/0000-0001-6001-0313",,,,,44,8,8,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1355-6207,2326-6384,,J ARCHIT CONSERV,J.

National and regional climate services are responding, but the information they provide may not meet local needs or concerns in an accessible format. Previous anthropological research suggests that integrating different knowledge systems to improve climate services, assist in local decision-making, and strengthen climate models remains problematic. To reduce or avoid some of these problems, a participatory, community-based environmental monitoring project was co-developed with residents of four rural Tanzanian communities. A field team brought in equipment and facilitated the training of local monitors, while communities chose the environmental sectors to monitor, collected and analyzed data, and evaluated the results in light of their local TEK. This interaction between scientists and participating community members highlights the value of knowledge co-production in making sense of environmental changes associated with climate that are observed and experienced at the local level. These activities also empowered communities to explore local climate adaptation and policy creation.","Univ Maryland, Dept Anthropol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Shaffer, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Anthropol, 0110 Woods Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",lshaffe1@umd.edu,"Shaffer, L.

The sustainability of coffee production at the global and regional scale is under threat by climate change, with a major risk of losing near to 50% of today's suitable area for coffee by 2050. Rain-fed coffee production dominates in the region, and under increasing climate variability and climate change impacts, these production areas are under threat due to air temperature increase and changes in rainfall patterns and volumes. Identification, evaluation, and implementation of adaptation strategies for growers to cope with climate variability and change impacts are relevant and high priority. Incremental adaptation strategies, including proper soil and water management, contribute to improved water use efficiency (WUE) and should be the first line of action to adapt the coffee crop to the changing growing conditions. This research's objective was to evaluate at field level over five years the influence of fertilization with calcium (Ca+2) and potassium (K+) on WUE in two coffee arabica varieties: cv. Castillo and cv. Caturra. Castillo has resistance against coffee leaf rust (CLR) (Hemileia vastatrix Verkeley and Brome), while Caturra is not CLR-resistant. WUE was influenced by yield changes during the years by climate variability due to El Nino-ENSO conditions and CLR incidence. Application of Ca+2 and K+ improved the WUE under such variable conditions. The highest WUE values were obtained with an application of 100 kg CaO ha(-1) year(-1) and between 180 to 230 kg K2O ha(-1) year(-1). The results indicate that adequate nutrition with Ca+2 and K+ can improve WUE in the long-term, even underwater deficit conditions and after the substantial incidence. Hence, an optimum application of Ca+2 and K+ in rain-fed coffee plantations can be regarded as an effective strategy to adapt to climate variability and climate change.","[Ramirez-Builes, Victor Hugo; Kusters, Jurgen] Ctr Plant Nutr & Environm Res Hanninghof, D-48249 Yara Int, Dulmen, Germany",,"Ramirez-Builes, VH (corresponding author), Ctr Plant Nutr & Environm Res Hanninghof, D-48249 Yara Int, Dulmen, Germany.",victor.ramirez@yara.com; juergen.kuesters@yara.com,"Ramirez Builes, Victor Hugo/HKE-7910-2023","Ramirez Builes, Victor Hugo/0000-0003-2080-5386",Yara International,Yara International,"The authors declare that this research received funding from Yara International.

This paper attempts to identify the severe water scarcity under climate change and presents possible solutions for sustainable development in Heihe River Basin. Three problems that intervened land use changes, water resource, the relevant policies and institutions in Heihe River basin were identified, including (1) water scarcity along with serious contradiction between water supply and demand, (2) irrational water consumption structure along with low efficiency, and (3) deficient systems and institutions of water resource management along with unreasonable water allocation scheme. In this sense, we focused on reviewing the state of knowledge, institutions, and successful practices to cope with water scarcity at a regional extent.

Thus, there is a disconnect between large-scale scenarios and the top-down management paradigm that decision-makers use, and local scenarios and management actions that deal with familiar landscape features in the context of actually existing ecological disturbances and socioeconomic vulnerabilities. Downscaled visual scenarios developed through image alteration of specific landscapes are a useful way of contextualizing and communicating possible outcomes and educating participants about alternative land management strategies. Furthermore, visual imagery can allow for a greater range of information exchange than written or verbal information alone and is a particularly effective tool for conveying knowledge and gathering public opinions among communities with and without scientific backgrounds. We are therefore interested in how visual preferences for adaptive management align with participant's understandings of functional ecological resiliency and aesthetic form. To investigate this, we detail the development of a visual survey method designed to test community preferences for adaptive management of forest systems in the southern portion of California's Sierra Nevada mountain range. For each site-specific scenario, the survey assessed participant's preferences among three alternative strategies: passive management, traditional restoration practices, and practices that are adaptive to uncertainty and changing outcomes. We asked the following: Does the inclusion of explanatory text with a visual scenario affect management preference? Do preferences differ between respondent professional category? And, how does stated familiarity with place-based landscape management practices affect preferences? Our results show that inclusion of explanatory site background information and narrative text with each strategy image aided in the understanding of and buy-in for adaptive management, which is dependent on place-based context.","[Jenkins, Jeffrey] Univ Calif Merced, Dept Management Complex Syst, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Milligan, Brett] Univ Calif Davis, Landscape Architecture & Environm Design, Dept Human Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Huang, Yiwei] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Human Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Huang, Yiwei] Purdue Univ, Dept Hort & Landscape Architecture, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",University of California System; University of California Merced; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Jenkins, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Merced, Dept Management Complex Syst, Merced, CA 95343 USA.",,"Huang, Yiwei/GNP-5734-2022",,,,,,74,2,2,1,10,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

Climate change and an additional 3 billion mouths to feed by 2050 raise serious concerns over global food security. Crop breeding and land management strategies will need to evolve to maximize the utilization of finite resources in coming years. High-throughput phenotyping and genomics technologies are providing researchers with the information required to guide and inform the breeding of climate smart crops adapted to the environment. Bioinformatics has a fundamental role to play in integrating and exploiting this fast accumulating wealth of data, through association studies to detect genomic targets underlying key adaptive climate-resilient traits. These data provide tools for breeders to tailor crops to their environment and can be introduced using advanced selection or genome editing methods. To effectively translate research into the field, genomic and phenomic information will need to be integrated into comprehensive clade-specific databases and platforms alongside accessible tools that can be used by breeders to inform the selection of climate adaptive traits.

Results showed that capital endowments significantly affect cotton farmers' adoption of water-saving technologies (WST) in all dimensions. Specifically, the scale of cotton planting had a significant positive impact on the willingness and decision of cotton farmers to adopt WST, and it could significantly reduce the adoption wait time. Simultaneously, neighbors' adoption decisions, policy subsidies, and membership of a cooperative could reduce cotton farmers' wait times. Land transfer was one of the livelihood strategies cotton farmers used to adjust household resource allocations or to adapt to arid climate. Land rental also could help reduce the wait time for WST. These results and impacts provided policy optimization direction to reduce the waiting time of farmers to adopt water-saving technology, which was helpful to save agricultural water and for farmers adapt to drought climate change quickly. At the end of the study, combined with the situation of China, from the crop planting structure, land system reform, and effective community governance, we discussed several research directions to improve farmers' drought climate adaptability.","[Mi, Qiao; Gao, Jianzhong] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiandong; Li, Xianmei; Yu, Guoxin] Xinjiang Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Trade, Urumqi 830052, Xinjiang, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; Xinjiang Agricultural University,"Gao, JZ (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Li, XD (corresponding author), Xinjiang Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Trade, Urumqi 830052, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.",miqiao@nwafu.edu.cn; xjxiandong@nwafu.edu.cn; gaojianzhong2003@nwafu.edu.cn,"li, xiandong/GRN-9596-2022","li, xiandong/0000-0002-1876-6114",National Social Science Fund of China (CN); China Social Science Foundation [17CGL028],National Social Science Fund of China (CN); China Social Science Foundation,"The National Social Science Fund of China (CN): We would like to thank the China Social Science Foundation for funding our research (17CGL028), Research on the supply path of productive services for cotton farmers in southern Xinjiang under the supply-side structural reform.",,42,5,6,3,32,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-3774,1873-2283,,AGR WATER MANAGE,Agric.

We develop an approach for updating knowledge and beliefs based on the observation of forest and climate variables and illustrate its application for the adaptive management of an even-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) forest in the Black Forest, Germany. We simulated forest development under a range of climate change scenarios and forest management alternatives. Our analysis used Bayesian updating and Dempster's rule of combination to simulate how observations of climate and forest variables may influence a decision maker's beliefs about climate development and thereby management decisions. While forest managers may be inclined to rely on observed forest variables to infer climate change and impacts, we found that observation of climate state, e.g. temperature or precipitation is superior for updating beliefs and supporting decision-making. However, with little conflict among information sources, the strongest evidence would be offered by a combination of at least two informative variables, e.g., temperature and precipitation. The success of adaptive forest management depends on when managers switch to forward-looking management schemes. Thus, robust climate adaptation policies may depend crucially on a better understanding of what factors influence managers' belief in climate change. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Second generation adults from five laboratory populations were compared with respect to resistance to extreme temperatures and desiccation, and traits relevant to climatic adaptation. Populations were collected along a 2000-km latitudinal gradient ranging from Denmark to southern Italy and reared under the same standard laboratory conditions. Traits investigated were resistance to high and low temperature, desiccation resistance, body size and water loss rate (WLR). Results showed genetically based differences in resistance to high and low temperature, desiccation, WLR, water pool and body size between populations. Individuals from the most northern population had the highest desiccation-and cold shock resistance, and the lowest heat shock resistance. Females were significantly more desiccation resistant than males. The results of cold shock resistance showed a positive increase with lowest environmental temperature recorded at the sites of population origin, whereas heat shock resistance showed a positive increase with highest recorded temperature at the sites of population origin. Desiccation resistance increased towards the most southern and northern population, suggesting that both low and high temperature extremes affect desiccation resistance. Body mass, water pool and WLR showed interpopulation as well as sex specific variation. This provides evidence for geographical variation in stress resistance of springtails related to climatic conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

While knowledge on the interacting pathways of adaptation is expanding, previous studies have focused on complex systems dynamics, and studies that address the human, social, and political forces that drive the cascading of risks between different coupled social-ecological systems are few. This paper aims to examine climate adaptation trade-offs, uncertainties, and maladaptation through an interdisciplinary analysis of two interacting pathways of transformational adaptation in the Philippines: the post 2004 disaster rural transformations in the coconut-producing municipality of Infanta and a state-led urban water resilience strategy for the capital region of Metro Manila. Data were collected from January 2021 to March 2022 through ethnographic field visits, participant observation, focus group discussions, semi-structured interviews, geospatial analysis, multicriteria mapping sessions, and review of planning documents and secondary data sources. Key findings suggest that the pathways of transformation and their entanglement are rooted in historical processes of change and that maladaptation is contingent on the political relations between the central and peripheral pathways. Overall, the paper offers a significant contribution to adaptation research in the agrifood systems of developing countries as it calls for a deeper kind of collective reflexivity and action that can transform narrow notions and practices of resilience and sustainable development.","[Dagli, Winifredo] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Coll Dev Commun, Dept Sci Commun, Banos, Philippines; [Dagli, Winifredo] Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Design & Rural Dev, Guelph, ON, Canada",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos; University of Guelph,"Dagli, W (corresponding author), Univ Philippines Los Banos, Coll Dev Commun, Dept Sci Commun, Banos, Philippines.;Dagli, W (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Design & Rural Dev, Guelph, ON, Canada.",wbdagli1@up.edu.ph,,,University of the Philippines Los Banos Gender Center Research Grants Program; Gelia Castillo Research in Community Engagements (RICE) Grant of the Philippine Sociological Society; University of Guelph Board of Graduate Studies Research Scholarship,University of the Philippines Los Banos Gender Center Research Grants Program; Gelia Castillo Research in Community Engagements (RICE) Grant of the Philippine Sociological Society; University of Guelph Board of Graduate Studies Research Scholarship,"The author acknowledges funding provided for this work by the University of the Philippines Los Banos Gender Center Research Grants Program, the Gelia Castillo Research in Community Engagements (RICE) Grant of the Philippine Sociological Society, and the University of Guelph Board of Graduate Studies Research Scholarship.",,142,1,1,2,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

This article sets out to investigate the emergence of spiritual ecologies in the Chilean town of Constitucion. Unlike most previous studies, we rethink the partial connections and entanglements of humans with nature through linking this to spirituality, environmental care and gender. By adopting a kaleidoscopic perspective, we aim to avoid a simplification or a singular representation of the (re-)entanglements with Mother Nature. Constitucion provides an excellent setting for studying contemporary changes in human-nature entanglements as compounding crises of earthquakes, tsunami and forest fires, exacerbated by extensive timber production, that have struck the town during the past decade, have led to a resurgence by a large part of the population in interpreting and expressing their relationship with Mother Nature. Through intermittent ethnographic research between 2015 and 2019, we have concluded that the entanglements with Mother Nature in Constitucion are the result of what we call Andean performative pragmatism, and the overrepresentation of women within the group of people who care for Mother Nature can be interpreted through an ecowomanist perspective that stands for the creation of social and environmental justice. As such, the findings offer a fresh and updated way to understand and interrogate the challenges confronting present-day human-nature relations in times of climate adaptation both in Chile and far beyond.","[Pfister, Sina] Univ Cologne, Artes Grad Sch Humanities, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [de Jong, Edwin] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Cultural Anthropol & Dev Studies, NL-6525 XZ Nijmegen, Netherlands",University of Cologne; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Pfister, S (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Artes Grad Sch Humanities, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",sinapfister@posteo.net; edwin.dejong@ru.nl,,,European Union [713600],European Union(European Commission),"This research was co-funded by the European Union, grant number 713600.",,69,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1444,,RELIGIONS,Religions,APR,2022,13,4,,,,,,,341,10.3390/rel13040341,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rel13040341,,,23,Religion,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Religion,0Q6UM,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000785051100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Determining which maternal factors increase or decrease this risk will inform climate adaptation strategies. Objectives This study aims to assess the risk of spontaneous preterm birth associated with exposure to ambient temperature and differences in this relationship between mothers with different health and demographic characteristics. Methods We used quasi-Poisson distributed lag non-linear models to estimate the effect of high temperature-measured as the 95th percentile of daily minimum, mean and maximum compared with the median-on risk of spontaneous preterm birth (23-36 weeks of gestation) in pregnant women in New South Wales, Australia. We estimated the cumulative lagged effects of daily temperature and analyses on population subgroups to assess increased or decreased vulnerability to this effect. Results Pregnant women (n = 916,678) exposed at the 95th percentile of daily mean temperatures (25oC) had an increased risk of preterm birth (relative risk 1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.07, 1.21) compared with the median daily mean temperature (17celcius). Similar effect sizes were seen for the 95th percentile of minimum and maximum daily temperatures compared with the median. This risk was slightly higher among women with diabetes, hypertension, chronic illness and women who smoked during pregnancy. Conclusions Higher temperatures increase the risk of preterm birth and women with pre-existing health conditions and who smoke during pregnancy are potentially more vulnerable to these effects.","[Jegasothy, Edward; Morgan, Geoffrey G.] Univ Sydney, Univ Ctr Rural Hlth, Sydney Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Jegasothy, Edward; Randall, Deborah A.; Ford, Jane B.; Nippita, Tanya A.] Univ Sydney, Women & Babies Res, Northern Clin Sch, St Leonards, NSW, Australia; [Jegasothy, Edward] NSW Minist Hlth, NSW Biostat Training Program, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Randall, Deborah A.; Ford, Jane B.; Nippita, Tanya A.] Kolling Inst, Northern Sydney Local Hlth Dist, St Leonards, NSW, Australia; [Nippita, Tanya A.] Royal North Shore Hosp, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Northern Sydney Local Hlth Dist, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney; University of Sydney; University of Sydney; Kolling Institute of Medical Research; Royal North Shore Hospital,"Jegasothy, E (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Univ Ctr Rural Hlth, Sydney Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",edward.jegasothy@sydney.edu.au,,"Morgan, Geoffrey/0000-0003-4046-2405; Ford, Jane/0000-0001-7272-7733",NSW Ministry of Health,NSW Ministry of Health,NSW Ministry of Health,,25,5,5,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-5022,1365-3016,,PAEDIATR PERINAT EP,Paediatr.

For this purpose, five drought resistant cotton genotypes i.e., FH-941, FH-187, FH-4243, FH-1000 and FH-207 were sown under irrigated and drought conditions. Larval population of H. armigera was low on water stressed plants (0.32 larvae/plant) as compared to irrigated plants (0.45 larvae/plant). In contrast, H. armigea caused more damage to stressed plants (16.90%) than irrigated plants (14.58%). FH-4243 was evaluated as resistant genotypes on the basis of less percent damage by H. armigera for both irrigated and drought conditions with value of 13.24 and 09.59%, respectively. Population of C. carnea was statistically similar under both for irrigated (0.20 larvae/plant) and drought conditions (0.19 larvae/plant). Unlikely, low parasitism of H. armigera by H. hebetor was observed under drought (14.64%) than irrigated condition (20.79%). Treatment involving integration of Neemosal, C. carnea and H. hebetor demonstrated 0.09 larvae/plant and provided maximum control of H. armigera; whereas alone application of Neemosal proved least effective against H. armigera (0.32 larvae/plant). On the basis of cost benefit ratio (CBR), module-15 involving integrated implementation of Spinosad, Neemosal, C. carnea and H. hebetor explained highest yield (1639.52 kg/ha) and CBR (1: 6.15) and proved economical and effective IPM module. In conclusion, water stress condition had positive impact on H. armigera feeding-damage (bi-trophic interaction) but had negative impact on parasitism. Integration of bio-control agents, botanicals and reduced-risk insecticides would be more cost-effective than their alone or two-level integration.

Here, we identify and quantify uncertainties in global and European land cover projections over a diverse range of model types and scenarios, extending the analysis beyond the agro-economic models included in previous comparisons. The results from 75 simulations over 18 models are analysed and show a large range in land cover area projections, with the highest variability occurring in future cropland areas. We demonstrate systematic differences in land cover areas associated with the characteristics of the modelling approach, which is at least as great as the differences attributed to the scenario variations. The results lead us to conclude that a higher degree of uncertainty exists in land use projections than currently included in climate or earth system projections. To account for land use uncertainty, it is recommended to use a diverse set of models and approaches when assessing the potential impacts of land cover change on future climate. Additionally, further work is needed to better understand the assumptions driving land use model results and reveal the causes of uncertainty in more depth, to help reduce model uncertainty and improve the projections of land cover.","[Alexander, Peter; Brown, Calum; Holzhauer, Sascha; Rounsevell, Mark D.

However, little research has focused on the psychological mechanisms that facilitate or constrain agricultural adaptation behavior. Drawing on the protection motivation theory from health promotion research, we propose a risk, coping, and social appraisal (RCSA) model of adaptation decisions. To test the model, we assessed drought risk perceptions, efficacy beliefs, village identification, and perceived descriptive norms among a sample of 192 paddy farmers from five villages in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. Results revealed that the RCSA model was a better predictor of agricultural adaptaticin intention than a strictly demographic model. Efficacy beliefs were the strongest predictor of behavioral intentions, with descriptive norms also consistently relating to intentions. Drought risk perceptions related only to intention to adopt one of the behaviors, while village identification related only to a very communal behavior. The results have implications for agricultural extension officers, irrigation officers, and water management officials in their efforts to assist farmers in adapting to limited water resources.

This review leads to the conclusion that the representation of adaptation behaviour and decision-making remain very limited in most of the agent-based models in the forestry sector. Moreover, theoretical frameworks used to understand the adaptation behaviour of forest owners are also lacking. In this paper, we propose the application of protection motivation theory (PMT) as a framework to understand the motivation of forest owners to reduce the negative impacts of climate change on their forest plantations. Furthermore, the use of PMT allows factors affecting the maladaptive behaviour of forest owners to be examined. A survey of New Zealand foresters showed that less than 10% of smallholder forest owners adopted adaptation strategies. This result highlights the importance of addressing the research question what motivates forest owners to take risk reduction measures? Exploring this question is crucial to the future success of the New Zealand forestry sector and we suggest that it can be addressed by using PMT. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for an agent-based model as an alternative to simulating adaptation pathways for forest plantations in New Zealand.","[Villamor, Grace B.; Dunningham, Andrew; Clinton, Peter W.] Scion New Zealand Forest Res Inst Ltd, Titokorangi Dr,Private Bag 3020, Rotorua 3046, New Zealand; [Villamor, Grace B.] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res, 3 Genscherallee, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Stahlmann-Brown, Philip] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, 17 Whitmore St, Wellington 6011, New Zealand",Scion; University of Bonn; Landcare Research - New Zealand,"Villamor, GB (corresponding author), Scion New Zealand Forest Res Inst Ltd, Titokorangi Dr,Private Bag 3020, Rotorua 3046, New Zealand.;Villamor, GB (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res, 3 Genscherallee, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",grace.villamor@sdonresearch.com; andrew.dunningham@scionresearch.com; brownp@landcareresearch.co.nz; peter.dinton@scionresearch.com,"Stahlmann-Brown, Philip/B-4948-2016","Stahlmann-Brown, Philip/0000-0003-4310-1103; Clinton, Peter/0000-0002-8921-4835; Dunningham, Andrew/0000-0003-1889-4439",Scion; Forest Growers Levy Trust; NZ Forest Owners Association (FOA); NZ Farm Forestry Association (FFA),Scion; Forest Growers Levy Trust; NZ Forest Owners Association (FOA); NZ Farm Forestry Association (FFA),"Funding for this research came from Scion and the Forest Growers Levy Trust, with the support of the NZ Forest Owners Association (FOA) and the NZ Farm Forestry Association (FFA).

This article explores the several measures to help reduce the basin's vulnerability to climate change as considered in the technical component of the Ebro Basin Hydrological Plan 2010-2015. These adaptation tools include wastewater treatment, control of water intakes, water reuse, agro-environmental measures, modernization of irrigated areas, improvement of urban water supplies, removal of contaminated sediments, improvement of regulation infrastructure to ensure water supply and control inundations, optimization of hydroelectric exploitation, and improvement of drought and flood management.","Hydrog Confederat Ebro, Zaragoza, Spain",,"Garcia-Vera, MA (corresponding author), Hydrog Confederat Ebro, Zaragoza, Spain.",mgarciave@chebro.es,,,,,,,32,11,11,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0790-0627,1360-0648,,INT J WATER RESOUR D,Int.

In this study, we explore contemporary relationships between plants and Indigenous People in the KRB, identifying benefits of cultural ecosystem services (CES) derived from Indigenous stewarding and gathering of culturally significant plants, and discuss how these services may change based on climate change observations and experiences. This study contributes to the conceptualization of Indigenous Cultural Ecosystem Services (ICES), providing a framework for the incorporation of Indigenous concepts, approaches, and perspectives into assessments of ecosystem services (ES) and, particularly, CES. It highlights the value of Indigenous perspectives and observations of climate change effects on plant reproduction and productivity, as well as their contribution to cultural ecosystem resilience and adaptation under changing climate conditions.

In order for knowledge to be usable for decision-making, in the field of climate adaptation and beyond, it must meet the criteria of credibility, salience, and legitimacy (Cash et al., PNAS 100:8086-8091, 2003). Deliberate co-production of knowledge between producers and users has the potential to increase usability for decision-making and policy in some contexts. While co-production is increasingly advanced as an instrumental approach to facilitate the production of usable climate services, such efforts have paid scant attention to the role of power relations. In this article, we bring together literature on normative approaches to co-production-which treats co-production as an instrumental means to an end-with analytical interpretations of co-production within the field of Science and Technology Studies to examine efforts to develop usable climate services in Tanzania. We show that without reflexive processes that are explicitly attentive to power dynamics, normative co-production within climate services development can serve to reinforce, rather than overcome, power imbalances among actors.","[Daly, Meaghan] Univ New England, Dept Environm Studies, Biddeford, ME 04005 USA; [Dilling, Lisa] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Dilling, Lisa] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Ctr Sci & Technol Policy Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of New England - Maine; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Daly, M (corresponding author), Univ New England, Dept Environm Studies, Biddeford, ME 04005 USA.",mdaly8@une.edu,,"Dilling, Lisa/0000-0001-5061-0809","National Science Foundation SES-Division of Science, Technology, and Society [1354542]; U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Climate Change Resilient Development Small Grants Program [CCRDACD0001]; University of Colorado Boulder Innovative Seed Grant Program","National Science Foundation SES-Division of Science, Technology, and Society; U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Climate Change Resilient Development Small Grants Program(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); University of Colorado Boulder Innovative Seed Grant Program","The authors thank three anonymous reviewers and the guest editor, Sophie Webber, for their insightful comments, which greatly improved the article.

In this article, we identify two fruitful directions for planning theory to better engage with the imbricated nature of humans and nonhumans is recognised as characteristic of the Anthropocene - multispecies entanglements and becoming-world. Drawing on the more-than-human literature in urban and cultural geography and the environmental humanities, we consider how these terms offer new possibilities for productively rethinking the ontological exceptionalism of humans in planning theory. We critically explore how planning theory might develop inclusive, ethical relationships that can nurture possibilities for multispecies flourishing in diverse urban futures, the futures that are increasingly recognised as co-produced by nonhuman agents in the context of climate variability and change. This, we argue, is critical for developing climate-adaptive planning tools and narratives for the creation of socially and environmentally just multispecies cities.","[Houston, Donna] Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Hillier, Jean] RMIT Univ, Sustainabil & Urban Planning, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [MacCallum, Diana] Curtin Univ, Dept Planning & Geog, Perth, WA, Australia; [Steele, Wendy] RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Steele, Wendy] RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Byrne, Jason] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Urban & Environm Planning, Gold Coast City, Australia",Macquarie University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Curtin University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Griffith University,"Houston, D (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",donna.houston@mq.edu.au,"Byrne, Jason/AAC-6344-2019","Houston, Donna/0000-0003-3181-3517; Steele, Wendy/0000-0003-1565-3752",ARC Project [DP150100299],ARC Project(Australian Research Council),"We acknowledge support from ARC Project DP150100299, Enabling social innovation for local climate adaptability.",,154,80,82,5,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1473-0952,1741-3052,,PLAN THEOR,Plan.

Specific mitochondrial DNA sequence was used to investigate geographic distribution of the type 4 haplotype (mtRFLP4) within 1363 isolates of Z. tritici originating from 21 countries. The mtRFLP4 haplotype was detected from both durum and bread wheat hosts with greater frequency on durum wheat. The distribution of mtRFLP4 was limited to populations sampled from the Mediterranean and the Red Sea region. Greater frequencies of mtRFLP4 were found in Tunisia (87%) and Algeria (60%). The haplotype was absent within European, Australian, North and South American populations except Argentina. While alternative hypotheses such as climatic adaptation could not be ruled out, it is postulated that mtRFLP4 originated in North Africa (e. g. Tunisia or Algeria) as an adaptation to durum wheat as the prevailing cereal crop. The specialized haplotype has subsequently spread as indicated by lower frequency of occurrence in the surrounding Mediterranean countries and on bread wheat hosts.","[Boukef, Sameh; Rezgui, Salah] Inst Natl Agron Tunisia, Genet Lab, Tunis 1002, Tunisia; [Yahyaoui, Amor.] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, El Batan 56130, Texcoco, Mexico",Universite de Carthage; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Rezgui, S (corresponding author), Inst Natl Agron Tunisia, Genet Lab, Ave Charles Nicolle, Tunis 1002, Tunisia.",salahrezgui@yahoo.fr,,,Federal Commission for Scholarships for Foreign Students (FCS) [20080384],Federal Commission for Scholarships for Foreign Students (FCS),Part of this work was conducted in the lab of Prof Bruce McDonald.

Since its publication, many researchers and analysts have criticized the White Paper for its lack of concrete and enforceable actions. In this paper, we analyse the White Paper as an instrument of soft law. First, we provide background on the theory of soft law, its terms of applicability, and the standards by which to judge its success. Second, we analyse the content and context of the White Paper according to soft law principles. We find that the conditions under which the White Paper was adopted were exactly those suited to a soft law approach and highly determined by the European multi-level governance context. As such, the White Paper has managed to achieve several of the common objectives of soft law in particular in setting up processes allowing information-sharing and subsidiarity. However it has failed to achieve several others especially in fostering the commitment of the states, and in moving the European Union in the direction of binding regulation. Further strategy development will be required to fix these deficiencies.","[Dreyfus, Magali] United Nations Univ, Inst Adv Studies, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Patt, Anthony] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria",United Nations University; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Dreyfus, M (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Adv Studies, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.",dreyfus@ias.unu.edu,"Patt, Anthony/E-5437-2017",,Mediation project; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [10F00810] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Mediation project; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Funding for this research came from the Mediation project, coordinated by the University of Wageningen, of the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme for research and cooperation.

Such events create significant public health needs that can exceed local capacity to respond, resulting in excess morbidity or mortality and in the declaration of disasters. Human vulnerability to any disaster is a complex phenomenon with social, economic, health, and cultural dimensions. Vulnerability to natural disasters has two sides: the degree of exposure to dangerous hazards (susceptibility) and the capacity to cope with or recover from disaster consequences (resilience). Vulnerability reduction programs reduce susceptibility and increase resilience. Susceptibility to disasters is reduced largely by prevention and mitigation of emergencies. Emergency preparedness and response and recovery activities-including those that address climate change-increase disaster resilience. Because adaptation must occur at the community level, local public health agencies are uniquely placed to build human resilience to climate-related disasters. This article discusses the role of public health in reducing human vulnerability to climate change within the context of select examples for emergency preparedness and response.","Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Environm Hlth, Agcy Tox Subst & Dis Registry, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA",Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA,"Keim, ME (corresponding author), Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Environm Hlth, Agcy Tox Subst & Dis Registry, 4770 Buford Highway,MS-F29, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA.",mjk9@cdc.gov,,,,,,,75,235,241,8,118,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0749-3797,1873-2607,,AM J PREV MED,Am.

To maximize prioritization of these habitats a better understanding of the full range of ecosystem functions is needed, starting with an examination of how coastal wetlands have been portrayed in restoration literature to date. This study consists of a literature review and the use of automated topic analyses aimed at (1) summarizing the current research related to coastal wetland restoration, (2) identifying the key fields of research, and (3) identifying research efforts connecting restoration and climate adaptation strategies (e.g. blue carbon). Of the 702 papers sourced for this analysis, most studies were conducted in North America and Europe. An increase in articles considering wetland restoration was found from 1985 to October 2020, with 40% of the research published just in the last triennia (2018-2020). Topic division highlights the emergence of studies related to management under climate change (e.g. sea level rise, adaptive management) and to carbon sequestration as separate fields of research from classical ecological studies. This reveals the need to ensure that classical ecological research is not neglected by work relating to climate strategies, which depend upon an accurate understanding of ecological processes.","[Bertolini, Camilla] Ca Foscari Univ, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, I-30170 Venice, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Bertolini, C (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, I-30170 Venice, Italy.",camilla.bertolini@unive.it,,"bertolini, camilla/0000-0003-1198-5557",Downforce Trust,Downforce Trust,"The authors are thankful to Jack Wright, Kasia Ruskowska, and Oliver Loeb Mills for providing useful English revisions.

Broad-scale assessments of vegetation responses to drought are needed to anticipate, manage, and potentially mitigate climate-change effects on ecosystems. We quantified the drought sensitivity of vegetation in the Pacific Northwest, USA, as the percent reduction in vegetation greenness under droughts relative to baseline moisture conditions. At a regional scale, shrub-steppe ecosystems-with drier climates and lower biomass-showed greater drought sensitivity than conifer forests. However, variability in drought sensitivity was considerable within biomes and within ecosystems and was mediated by landscape topography, climate, and soil characteristics. Drought sensitivity was generally greater in areas with higher elevation, drier climate, and greater soil bulk density. Ecosystems with high drought sensitivity included dry forests along ecotones to shrublands, Rocky Mountain subalpine forests, and cold upland sagebrush communities. In forests, valley bottoms and areas with low soil bulk density and high soil available water capacity showed reduced drought sensitivity, suggesting their potential as drought refugia. These regional-scale drought-sensitivity patterns discerned from remote sensing can complement plot-scale studies of plant physiological responses to drought to help inform climate-adaptation planning as drought conditions intensify.","[Cartwright, Jennifer M.] US Geol Survey, Lower Mississippi Gulf Water Sci Ctr, Nashville, TN 37211 USA; [Littlefield, Caitlin E.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT USA; [Michalak, Julia L.; Lawler, Joshua J.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA USA; [Dobrowski, Solomon Z.] Univ Montana, Dept Forest Management, Missoula, MT 59812 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Vermont; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Montana System; University of Montana,"Cartwright, JM (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Lower Mississippi Gulf Water Sci Ctr, Nashville, TN 37211 USA.",jmcart@usgs.gov,"Dobrowski, Solomon Z/Q-7132-2019","Dobrowski, Solomon Z/0000-0003-2561-3850; Cartwright, Jennifer/0000-0003-0851-8456",U.S. Geological Survey; Department of the Interior Northwest Climate Adaptation Science Center,U.S. Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey); Department of the Interior Northwest Climate Adaptation Science Center,"This study was supported by the U.S. Geological Survey and the Department of the Interior Northwest Climate Adaptation Science Center.

Current scientific literature and grant-making institutions have often reinforced the compartmentalized fashion in which we learn and draw policy lessons from North/South, social/technical, and bottom-up/top-down sustainability initiatives, including local food system innovations. The strategic levers for global sustainable development lying in-between are thus left out. This paper uses exploratory, multiple case study analysis to address this omission. By concurrently drawing lessons from grassroots innovations in Brazil, New York, and Senegal-three profoundly different socioeconomic and geographic contexts-we identify common pressure points that have enabled local communities to drive system-wide transformations toward climate adaptation, resilience, and sustainability in the agri-food system.

Adaptive capacity and, especially, social capital increases recovery from disasters and enhances adaptation. Social capital is declining nationwide and the Sunbelt States, with highest national temperatures, have the lowest levels of social capital. Social capital is situational and reflects a position within the formal and informal aspects of any issue, and frameworks developed for some purposes may not be relevant for others. Few have fully explored social capital's relation to heat vulnerability. There is a need to understand social capital in the context of urban heat to determine if it is present, used, enhanced or is a latent capacity. This research explores indicators and related questions for effective social capital for urban heat. This research was conducted in one of the hottest United States cities, metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona and, while the geographic and cultural context may be different, the findings have applicability to other warming urban centres. Using social capital as a lens to explore heat vulnerability and better metrics for urban heat social capital can inform policies that deepen networks and increase trust, minimise poor public health outcomes, and facilitate more effective community engagement. Effective social capital for extreme heat can provide a roadmap for decision-makers in working towards climate adaptation at the community scale by increasing their understanding of when and how to assist communities in building their capacity.","[Guardaro, M.; Redman, C.

The traditional mosque in the Qassim region until the end of the fourteenth century AH, and before mechanical air conditioning, was one of the most similar mosques to the Prophet mosque in terms of formation. The current climatic design concepts of contemporary mosques in Qassim are different than their counterparts in the traditional architecture of yesterday, to which the community has adapted for centuries by exploiting natural resources. This research aims to explore the climatic adaptations of the traditional mosques in the Qassim region - the warm dry continental climate - as well as the views of the construction masters in the Qasimi area on how to make use this in contemporary mosque design. The researcher applied a descriptive analytical approach to study mosques in the region. The research results indicate that there are successful solutions and adaptive climatic treatments in the architecture of traditional mosques in Qassim, particularly considering the formation of spaces, which satisfied both the architect and the community. The community lived with this adaptation for centuries by using specific five different places to pray during the six seasons of the year, enjoying the cooling, ventilation and heating by natural means. Based on this, the researcher recommends the benefits from this study to the contemporary mosque designs in a similar climate.s.","[Al-Mushaiqih, Abdulssalam M.

Efforts to decrease the vulnerability of transport networks have been largely limited to understanding projected risks through governance and administrative efforts. Where physical adaptation measures have been implemented, these have typically aligned with a traditional engineering resilience approach of increasing the strength and rigidity of assets to withstand the impacts of climate change and maintain a stable operating state. Such systems have limited agility and are susceptible to failure from surprise events. Addressing these limitations, this paper considers an alternate approach to resilience, inspired by natural ecosystems that sense conditions in real-time, embrace multi-functionality and evolve in response to changing environmental conditions. Such systems embrace and thrive on unpredictability and instability. This paper synthesises key literature in climate adaptation and socio-ecological resilience theory to propose a shift in paradigm for transport infrastructure design, construction and operation, towards engineered systems that can transform, evolve and internally manage vulnerability. The authors discuss the opportunity for biomimicry (innovation inspired by nature) as an enabling discipline for supporting resilient and regenerative infrastructure, introducing three potential tools and frameworks. The authors conclude the importance of leveraging socio-ecological resilience theory, building on the achievements in engineering resilience over the past century. These findings have immediate practical applications in redefining resilience approaches for new transport infrastructure projects and transport infrastructure renewal.","[Hayes, Samantha; Desha, Cheryl] Griffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Burke, Matthew] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Gibbs, Mark] Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Sci & Engn, Inst Future Environm, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Chester, Mikhail] Arizona State Univ, Sc Sustainable Engn & Built Environm, Phoenix, AZ USA",Griffith University; Griffith University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix,"Hayes, S (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Nathan Campus,170 Kessels Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",samantha.hayes3@griffithuni.edu.au,"; Desha, Cheryl/J-1340-2012","Chester, Mikhail/0000-0002-9354-2102; Hayes, Samantha/0000-0002-3085-1215; Desha, Cheryl/0000-0002-4026-0830",,,,,99,23,23,9,39,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-1647,1464-5327,,TRANSPORT REV,Transp.

However, the predictabilities of complex traits are always severely affected by negative factors, including distant relatedness, environmental discrepancies, unknown population structures, and indeterminate numbers of predictive variables. In this study, we utilised two independent F-1 hybrid populations in the years 2012 and 2015 to predict rice thousand grain weight (TGW) using parental untargeted metabolite profiles with a partial least squares regression method. A stable predictive model for TGW was built based on hybrids from the population in 2012 (r = 0.75) but failed to properly predict TGW for hybrids from the population in 2015 (r = 0.27). After integrating hybrids from both populations into the training set, the TGW of hybrids could be predicted but was largely dependent on population structures. Then, core hybrids from each population were determined by principal component analysis and the TGW of hybrids in both environments were successfully predicted (r > 0.60). Moreover, adjusting the population structures and numbers of predictive analytes increased TGW predictability for hybrids in 2015 (r = 0.72). Our study demonstrates that the TGW of F-1 hybrids across environments can be accurately predicted based on parental untargeted metabolite profiles with a core hybridisation strategy in rice. Metabolic biomarkers identified from early developmental stage tissues, which are grown under experimental conditions, may represent a workable approach towards the robust prediction of major agronomic traits for climate-adaptive varieties.","[Dan, Zhiwu; Chen, Yunping; Xu, Yanghong; Huang, Junran; Huang, Jishuai; Hu, Jun; Zhu, Yingguo; Huang, Wenchao] Wuhan Univ, Key Lab Res & Utilizat Heterosis Indica Rice, Yangtze River Valley Hybrid Rice Collaborat & Inn, State Key Lab Hybrid Rice,Coll Life Sci, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Yao, Guoxin] Hubei Engn Univ, Sch Life & Sci Technol, Xiaogan, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Hubei Engineering University,"Huang, WC (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Key Lab Res & Utilizat Heterosis Indica Rice, Yangtze River Valley Hybrid Rice Collaborat & Inn, State Key Lab Hybrid Rice,Coll Life Sci, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",wenchaoh@whu.edu.cn,"huang, wen/GXW-0661-2022; Dan, Zhiwu/AAM-5103-2021; Dan, Zhiwu/AAC-7071-2022","Dan, Zhiwu/0000-0002-3930-9158; Chen, Yunping/0000-0001-8787-9385",National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFD0100400]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31771746]; National Rice Industry Technology System [CARS-01-07]; Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice (Wuhan University),National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Rice Industry Technology System; Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice (Wuhan University),"This research was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFD0100400), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31771746), National Rice Industry Technology System (CARS-01-07), and the Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice (Wuhan University).",,34,10,11,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1467-7644,1467-7652,,PLANT BIOTECHNOL J,Plant Biotechnol.

Many of the subjective choices that modellers make including model and criteria selection can have a significant impact on the magnitude and distribution of the output uncertainty. Hydrological modellers are tasked with understanding and minimising the uncertainty surrounding streamflow predictions before communicating the overall uncertainty to decision makers. Parameter uncertainty in conceptual rainfall-runoff models has been widely investigated, and model structural uncertainty and forcing data have been receiving increasing attention. This study aimed to assess uncertainties in streamflow predictions due to forcing data and the identification of behavioural parameter sets in 31 Irish catchments. By combining stochastic rainfall ensembles and multiple parameter sets for three conceptual rainfall-runoff models, an analysis of variance model was used to decompose the total uncertainty in streamflow simulations into contributions from (i) forcing data, (ii) identification of model parameters and (iii) interactions between the two. The analysis illustrates that, for our subjective choices, hydrological model selection had a greater contribution to overall uncertainty, while performance criteria selection influenced the relative intra-annual uncertainties in streamflow predictions. Uncertainties in streamflow predictions due to the method of determining parameters were relatively lower for wetter catchments, and more evenly distributed throughout the year when the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of logarithmic values of flow (lnNSE) was the evaluation criterion.

Increasing agricultural water productivity by reducing the amount of irrigation water without affecting the yields, especially in paddy rice, is necessary. This is possible with alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation. This study was conducted under greenhouse conditions at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Japan to evaluate the response of yield, water productivity and harvest index with different water regimes. The experiment was performed in pots with four water regimes as treatments and three replications, making 12 pots. The water regimes were continuous flooding irrigation as control and three AWD conditions-AWD5, AWD10 and AWD15-in which pots were irrigated when water reached 5, 10 and 15 cm soil depth, respectively, after the disappearance of surface ponding water. Yield components, harvest indexes and water productivity showed no significant difference (p < 0.05) between irrigation treatments. In this research, as there is more than a 25% reduction in water use and only 6.4% in grain yield, AWD15 was considered the best irrigation practice among the other treatments.

Adapting to climate uncertainty requires trialing out new experiments in water governance and establishing processes to learn from those experiments. Social learning is regarded as an important aspect that supports the transformation of water governance systems. Understanding where and how social learning is occurring is critical to improving adaptation outcomes of water management in an uncertain climate. Yet, there is little research asserting the scope of social learning processes in a wide variety of empirical contexts. This article examines social learning in water management in Western Australia. Two specific case studies involving the state-of-the-art experiments in surface and groundwater management are used to illustrate and to understand the institutional dynamics and barriers of social learning. The cases depict single-loop learning to a larger extent and double-loop learning to a lesser extent. The findings emphasize the importance of dealing with learning externalities, the mismatch of ecological and administrative scales, and facilitating actor networks and multilevel interaction in order to embed social learning in climate adaptation. Water governance reforms should facilitate institutional configurations that enhance social learning opportunities.","[Ananda, Jayanath] CQ Univ, Sch Business & Law, Melbourne Campus, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [McFarlane, Don] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Environm, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Loh, Michael] Water Corp, Infrastruct Planning Branch, Leederville, WA, Australia",Central Queensland University; University of Western Australia,"Ananda, J (corresponding author), CQ Univ, Sch Business & Law, Melbourne Campus, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",j.ananda@cqu.edu.au,"Ananda, Jayanath/C-9715-2013","Ananda, Jayanath/0000-0002-4072-6725",,,,,61,10,10,2,12,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",1756-932X,1756-9338,,ENVIRON POLICY GOV,Environ.

This study presents a methodological framework with which to assess the suitability of the double rice cropping system in Southern China and the effects of crop management and climate warming on its distribution. The results indicate that the isolated effects of climate warming have led to the northward and westward expansions of double rice northern limits over the past six decades and an increase in suitable areas by 4.76 Mha. Under the isolated effect of crop management, the northern limits of the medium- and late-maturity double rice changed significantly due to the increased accumulated temperature required caused by varietal replacement and planting date change, which moved an average of 123 and 134 km southward, respectively. A combined scenario analysis indicated that crop management could offset the effects of climate warming and push the northern limits southward, reducing the overall suitable area by 1.31 Mha. Varietal replacement and other crop management methods should also be appropriately considered in addition to climate warming to develop locally adapted agricultural management strategies.","[Li, Shuo; Shi, Xiaoyu; Lu, Jie; Chen, Fu; Chu, Qingquan] China Agr Univ, Coll Agron & Biotechnol, Key Lab Farming Syst, Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs,"Chu, QQ (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Agron & Biotechnol, Key Lab Farming Syst, Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",lis@cau.edu.cn; xyshi@cau.edu.cn; jielu89@foxmail.com; chenfu@cau.edu.cn; cauchu@cau.edu.cn,,"Li, Shuo/0000-0003-4891-3100",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0300210],National Key Research and Development Program of China,We are grateful to the scientists from our university laboratories.

Even though cities will be the main subject of climate change impacts, they can propose solutions and build alternative scenarios. The difficulties that municipalities may encounter in their adaptation processes concern the lack of planning skills, technical knowledge, and human resources. To face these challenges Italian Metropolitan Cities can play a fundamental role in helping municipalities to plan and coordinate their efforts. The process in the Venetian territory has lasted many years and it has led to the awareness that local adaptation policies need to be addressed with broader support. The Metropolitan City of Venice has constructed a methodology for the planning of climatic adaptation. This methodology has been developed thanks to various plans and projects. These projects acted to increase the coordination between bodies, to define a broad area vision, to help municipalities to implement local actions. The role played by CMVe intends to direct public policies towards adaptation and mitigation in a structural way and with broad area governance. The process activated could be replicable in other Italian Metropolitan Cities in the approach and the result even if adapted to local needs.","[Magni, Filippo; Litt, Giovanni; Carraretto, Giovanni] Univ Iuav Venice, Dept Architecture & Arts, Venice, Italy",IUAV University Venice,"Litt, G (corresponding author), Univ Iuav Venice, Dept Architecture & Arts, Venice, Italy.",filippo.magni@iuav.it; giovanni.litt@iuav.it; giovanni.carraretto@iuav.it,,"Magni, Filippo/0000-0002-1399-1080",,,,,46,1,1,1,6,"UNIV STUDI NAPOLI FEDERICO II, DIPT PIANIFICAZIONE & SCIENZA TERRITORIO",NAPLES,"PIAZZALE TECCHIO 80, NAPLES, 80125, ITALY",1970-9889,1970-9870,,TEMA,TeMA,AUG,2021,14,2,,,,,125,144,,10.6092/1970-9870/7948,http://dx.doi.org/10.6092/1970-9870/7948,,,20,Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Urban Studies,UK3OP,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000691882600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

We model interactions between two neighboring towns, and explore welfare implications of spatial-dynamic feedbacks in the coastal zone. When communities are adjacent, the community with a wider beach loses sand to the community with a narrower beach through alongshore sediment transport. Spatial-dynamic feedbacks create incentives for both communities to nourish less, resulting in lower long-run beach width and lower property values in both communities, a result that parallels the classic prisoner's dilemma. Intensifying erosion-consistent with accelerating sea level rise-increases the losses from failure to coordinate. Higher erosion also increases inequality in the distribution of benefits across communities under spatially coordinated management. This disincentive to coordinate suggests the need for higher-level government intervention to address a traditionally local problem. We show that a spatially targeted subsidy can achieve the first best outcome, and explore conditions under which a second-best uniform subsidy leads to small or large losses.","[Gopalakrishnan, Sathya] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, 2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [McNamara, Dylan] UNC Wilmington, Dept Phys & Phys Oceanog, Ctr Marine Sci, Wilmington, NC USA; [Smith, Martin D.; Murray, A.

This article explores short- and long-term consequences of farmers' adaptation decisions on groundwater resource use, under several climate change scenarios. We model farmer decisions on crop choice, investment in irrigation and water application rates, using a stochastic dynamic programming model with embedded year and season decision stages. Several sources of risk are considered that may impact farmer decisions, with poor rainfall affecting crop yield and market prices, while driving crop and borewell failure probabilities. We further investigate the performance of water management policies for groundwater resource conservation. This is achieved through policy simulations from a calibrated version of the stochastic dynamic model, using data from a field survey in the Berambadi watershed, Karnataka state, southern India. The most relevant and novel aspect of our model is the joint consideration of (i) investment decisions about irrigation over a long-term horizon and with the probability of borewell failure, (ii) several water management policies, and (iii) detailed farmers' water practices and the representation of crop choice for each agricultural season with crop failure.

Since most climate policies affecting agriculture rely on voluntary efforts by individual farmers, success requires a sound understanding of the factors that motivate farmers to change practices. Recent evidence suggests that past experience with the effects of climate change and the psychological distance associated with people's concern for global and local impacts can influence environmental behavior. Here we surveyed farmers in a representative rural county in California's Central Valley to examine how their intention to adopt mitigation and adaptation practices is influenced by previous climate experiences and their global and local concerns about climate change. Perceived changes in water availability had significant effects on farmers' intention to adopt mitigation and adaptation strategies, which were mediated through global and local concerns respectively. This suggests that mitigation is largely motivated by psychologically distant concerns and beliefs about climate change, while adaptation is driven by psychologically proximate concerns for local impacts. This match between attitudes and behaviors according to the psychological distance at which they are cognitively construed indicates that policy and outreach initiatives may benefit by framing climate impacts and behavioral goals concordantly; either in a global context for mitigation or a local context for adaptation.","[Haden, Van R.] Univ Calif Davis, Agr Sustainabil Inst, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Niles, Meredith T.; Lubell, Mark; Perlman, Joshua] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Jackson, Louise E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Haden, V (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Agr Sustainabil Inst, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",vrhaden@ucdavis.edu; mtniles@ucdavis.edu,,"Lubell, Mark/0000-0001-5757-7116; Niles, Meredith/0000-0002-8323-1351",California Energy Commission [CEC-500-2012-032],California Energy Commission,"The source of funding for this study was the California Energy Commission (grant # CEC-500-2012-032).

As a function of global warming, future climatic conditions will present further challenges, but may also present many new opportunities for farmers. We involved a range of rural communities via 14 workshops across a range of Australia's large-scale broadacre cropping regions employing a rural livelihoods framework to elicit and interpret community responses. Farmers identified indicators and rated them on the extent to which they might constrain or enable adaption to increased climate variability or climate change. Financial issues, such as low equity or limited capital were, considered to be most constraining, and natural capital assets, such as high soil productivity and low rainfall variability were considered to be most enabling. Most indicators were of broad-scale significance, affecting broadacre mixed farmers across a range of locations, and were not necessarily specific to climate change only. Broad-scale constraints identified were isolation/rural decline, limited access to services, poor regional infrastructure, equity/debt, and the high cost of production. Conversely, enabling factors identified were farmer education/experience, sense of community, and off-farm income. Actions to address these perceived constraints related to farm management practices, training, community, technology/research, communication, funding and institutional arrangements. In the Australian context, adapting to climate variability and change is more than just implementing a new technology, but is also about enhancing the broader resilience of the community in ways that will ensure its long term viability. To achieve this it will be necessary for different components of government and other institutional actors to work together to improve the adaptation capacity of farmers in the future.

A conceptual framework was developed for determining the preferred FRTs across planning periods, adapting FRTs to future climate change, assessing the sustainability of adaptive responses to climate change, and evaluating the validity of the two premises motivating this issue of Sustainability. The conceptual framework: (1) accounts for uncertainty about future climate change and its effects on management objectives for FRTs; (2) employs biophysical simulation and mental models to estimate the management objectives for FRTs; (3) uses fuzzy TOPSIS to determine the preferred FRTs for climate futures; (4) employs the minimax regret criterion to identify the preferred FRT for each planning period; (5) determines the best strategy for adapting FRTs to future climate change; and (6) assesses landscape sustainability when using the preferred FRTs. The framework is demonstrated with constructed examples for adapting FRTs to climate change for privately- and publicly-owned forested landscapes. Based on the conceptual framework, current knowledge does not allow determining with certainty whether managers' adaptations of FRTs to future climate change are sustainable or unsustainable due to type I and II decision errors.","Univ Missouri Columbia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Eureka, MT 59917 USA",,"Prato, T (corresponding author), Univ Missouri Columbia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 355 Wild West Dr, Eureka, MT 59917 USA.",pratoa@missouri.edu,,,National Science Foundation [0903562],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The research reported here was supported by the National Science Foundation, Award ID 0903562.",,49,5,5,1,13,MDPI AG,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2015,7,4,,,,,3571,3591,,10.3390/su7043571,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su7043571,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CH0MV,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000353715400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Bouskoura basin is the pilot site selected, because an integrated water resources management (IWRM) approach may be considered due to rapid urbanization and industrialization, and hosting wide facilities such as airport, highway, many expanding urban areas promotion and including 64% of rural areas. Hydrological modeling was carried out through HEC-HMS model for the reconstitution of theoretical natural hydrograph because of the lack of hydrological measurements and STORM model to study the integrated effect of the water harvesting facilities on the socio-economic and environmental aspects of the basin and its relationships with its environment. Continuous simulations are made based on data from climate models re analysis because of the lack of ground measured climate data. Modeling was used to measure the impact of storm-water on the environment in general and on the hydrological cycle in particular including mitigation of flood magnitudes, the substantial drinking water costs reduction, the impact obtained from watering green spaces, the artificial recharge of the aquifer and the reduction of greenhouse effect gas emissions. We need to put emphasis on the fact that these in situ IWRM developed in this case, can lead to creation of smart spaces from smart projects through smart cities to smart watersheds. The results are promising and show that flood mitigation for the Bouskoura basin is 46% of the peak flow. The other advantages are of useful importance in domestic use, infiltration to the aquifer, etc. The impacts for each unit such as airport, roads, administrative or industrial buildings are measured in this case. We can conclude that if more space is urbanized more the impact is important.

More recently, geomorphometric characteristics have been added to determine more suitable locations for dams and reservoirs depending on their dimensions. This study presents a fully automatized ArcGIS Pro model, suitable for working with several digital elevation model resolutions and for evaluating best potential reservoir locations to reduce evaporation losses. Here, a smart location strategy to preserve water resources is used based on the premise that the higher the ratio of water stored to water surface area of the reservoir, the lower the water evaporation. The model was tested in two dissimilar basins in the province of Cadiz (SW Spain) and the results are compared with the nearby existing reservoirs. The methodology presented in this paper allows selecting the most suitable sites where it is possible to build a reservoir with a water surface smaller than other reservoirs but also able to hold an equal or greater volume of water; this also allows reducing the area occupied by the reservoir. As an example, in the first study case presented in this paper, a new reservoir could store 30.7 m(3)/m(2) versus the current 9 m(3)/m(2) stored in the nearby existing reservoir.

Results highlight that: (1) water use, cost, quality, management, and perception are the main topics debated by both reclaimed and desalinated water users; (2) water governance schemes could be improved by including local stakeholders and water users in decision-making; and (3) rainwater is not recognized as a complementary option to increase water supply in semi-arid regions. Furthermore, the strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats (SWOT) analysis identifies complementary concerns such as acceptability and investment in reclaimed water, regulation (cost recovery principle), and environmental impacts of desalinated water.","[Ricart, Sandra; Villar-Navascues, Ruben A.; Hernandez-Hernandez, Maria; Rico-Amoros, Antonio M.; Molto-Mantero, Enrique] Univ Alicante, Interuniv Inst Geog, Water & Terr Res Grp, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03690, Spain; [Ricart, Sandra] Politecn Milan, Environm Intelligence Global Change Lab, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Hernandez-Hernandez, Maria; Rico-Amoros, Antonio M.; Olcina-Cantos, Jorge; Molto-Mantero, Enrique] Univ Alicante, Interuniv Inst Geog, Lab Climatol, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03690, Spain; [Hernandez-Hernandez, Maria; Rico-Amoros, Antonio M.; Olcina-Cantos, Jorge; Molto-Mantero, Enrique] Univ Alicante, Dept Reg Geog Anal & Phys Geog, Alicante 03690, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; Polytechnic University of Milan; Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat d'Alacant,"Ricart, S (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Interuniv Inst Geog, Water & Terr Res Grp, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03690, Spain.;Ricart, S (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Environm Intelligence Global Change Lab, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",sandra.ricart@ua.es; rvnavascues@ua.es; maria.hernandez@ua.es; am.rico@ua.es; jorge.olcina@ua.es; enrique.molto@ua.es,"Hernández, María Hernández/H-2198-2015; NAVASCUES, RUBEN ALEJANDRO VILLAR/AAR-5809-2020; Casadevall, Sandra Ricart/H-4222-2016; Rico, Antonio/H-2464-2015; Olcina, Jorge/H-2447-2015","Hernández, María Hernández/0000-0002-8823-0083; NAVASCUES, RUBEN ALEJANDRO VILLAR/0000-0002-1693-7741; Casadevall, Sandra Ricart/0000-0002-5065-0074; Rico, Antonio/0000-0002-9997-1186; Olcina, Jorge/0000-0002-4846-8126; Molto, Enrique/0000-0002-8521-060X","project Cambio climatico y agua: los recursos no convencionales como estrategia adaptativa para incrementar la resiliencia de los usos agricolas y urbanoturisticos en el litoral de Alicante [AICO/2020/253]; Regional government of Valencia, Spain, through the Programa per a la promocio de la investigacion cientifica, el desenvolupament tecnologic i la innovacio en la Comunitat Valenciana; SIMTWIST project (ERA-NET Water JPI 2018) - Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [PCI2019-103395]","project Cambio climatico y agua: los recursos no convencionales como estrategia adaptativa para incrementar la resiliencia de los usos agricolas y urbanoturisticos en el litoral de Alicante; Regional government of Valencia, Spain, through the Programa per a la promocio de la investigacion cientifica, el desenvolupament tecnologic i la innovacio en la Comunitat Valenciana; SIMTWIST project (ERA-NET Water JPI 2018) - Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation","This study is supported by the project Cambio climatico y agua: los recursos no convencionales como estrategia adaptativa para incrementar la resiliencia de los usos agricolas y urbanoturisticos en el litoral de Alicante (AICO/2020/253) and funded by the Regional government of Valencia, Spain, through the Programa per a la promocio de la investigacion cientifica, el desenvolupament tecnologic i la innovacio en la Comunitat Valenciana.

Projections of future climate change have focussed on extratropical cyclones identified close to the surface, but cyclones identified at multiple levels of the atmosphere ('deep' cyclones) make the largest contributions to total and extreme rainfall. Here we use ten CMIP5 models to assess projected changes in cyclone frequency and associated heavy rainfall between 1979-2005 and 2070-2099 under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), with a focus on changes in vertically organised ('deep') systems with cyclones present at both the surface and 500 hPa. We find a robust decrease in the number of deep cyclones by the end of the 21st century, together with an increase in the number of extreme rainfall events caused by deep cyclones. In contrast to deep cyclones, shallow cyclones identified only at the surface are found to produce less rain and are projected to increase in frequency in the future, particularly over land areas. Our findings demonstrate the benefits of considering vertically deep cyclones, as their connection to extreme rainfall has implications for risk assessment and climate adaptation strategies.","[Pepler, Acacia; Dowdy, Andrew] Australian Bur Meteorol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Bureau of Meteorology - Australia,"Pepler, A (corresponding author), Australian Bur Meteorol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",acacia.pepler@bom.gov.au,"Pepler, Acacia/ABC-6565-2020","Pepler, Acacia/0000-0002-1478-2512",Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub of the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program (NESP),Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub of the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program (NESP),"This project is funded by the Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub of the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program (NESP), and was assisted by resources from the Australian National Computational Infrastructure (NCI).

Although the urban poor are increasingly recognized as needing to be part of climate adaptation planning and implementation, many governance arrangements fail to explicitly include them. In order to make climate governance more inclusive, transformative capacity is needed. Drawing on two case studies from different urban contexts in South Africa, this paper explores the nature of inclusive governance between local government and the urban poor and the extent to which this has contributed to transformative development trajectories. The findings suggest that inclusive governance will be strengthened when local government (1) recognizes the everyday reality of the urban poor and works with them to identify priorities for transformative change, (2) supports sustained intermediaries who are urban poor themselves and (3) draws on diverse modes of governance to find new ways to engage diverse actors and experiment with inclusive adaptation planning and practice. These practices will help to build transformative capacity that can envisage and enable new ways of governing urban risk and implementing adaptation that puts the poor, frequently most impacted by climate and disaster risk, at the centre.","[Ziervogel, Gina] Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa; [Ziervogel, Gina] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Ziervogel, G (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa.;Ziervogel, G (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa.",gina.ziervogel@uct.ac.za,"Ziervogel, Gina/AAG-2945-2019","Ziervogel, Gina/0000-0003-4219-6809",South African-Norway Cooperation Program (SANCOOP) of the Research Council of Norway - Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs [234206]; South African National Treasury through the Flemish Government,South African-Norway Cooperation Program (SANCOOP) of the Research Council of Norway - Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; South African National Treasury through the Flemish Government,"Some of the work drawn on in this paper was supported by the South African-Norway Cooperation Program (SANCOOP) of the Research Council of Norway and funded by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Grant Number 234206).

The first sample consisted of 396 personnel working on offshore oil- and gas installations in the North Sea (response rate: 42%). The second sample comprised 594 crew members working on vessels belonging to two large Norwegian shipping companies (response rate: 73%). Data from both studies supported a three factor solution labelled Individual intention and motivation, Management prioritization, and Safety routines. The subscales had good psychometric properties. The validity indicators revealed correlations between the safety climate scales and transformational and authentic leadership, risk perception, health problems, intentions to leave, and job satisfaction in the expected directions.

Climate adaptation will be essential, and planning for adaptation can be simplified through operationalizing concepts of climate resilience and vulnerability. This article reviews concepts and theories in a range of diverse fields to illustrate how the general notion of urban climate resilience can be developed into an operational framework for planning practitioners. The framework integrates theoretical and empirical knowledge of the factors contributing to resilience with processes for translating those concepts into practice. The framework includes characteristics of urban systems, the agents (people and organizations) that depend on and manage those systems, institutions that link systems and agents, and patterns of exposure to climate change. It operationalizes these concepts through structured and iterative shared learning approaches that allow local planners to define these factors in their own context, in order to develop practical strategies for local action. The viability of the framework is demonstrated through examples from resilience planning activities undertaken in 10 cities across Asia through the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.","[Tyler, Stephen] Adapt Resource Mgmt Ltd, Victoria, BC V8N 1V2, Canada; [Tyler, Stephen; Moench, Marcus] ISET, Boulder, CO USA",,"Tyler, S (corresponding author), Adapt Resource Mgmt Ltd, 2207 Arbutus Rd, Victoria, BC V8N 1V2, Canada.",adaptive@telus.net,,,,,,,83,329,336,59,354,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

These concepts and criteria are then used to interpret empirically derived insights relating to local management of water shortages in Ontario, Canada. General determinants of water-related community capacity relate to upper tier political and institutional arrangements; the characteristics of, and relationships among, pertinent agencies, groups, or individuals involved in water management; and the adequacy of financial, human, information, and technical resources. The case analysis illustrates how general factors play out in local experience. The findings point to geographically specific factors that influence the effectiveness of management. Key factors include collaboration between water managers, clarification of agency roles and responsibilities, integration of water management and land-use planning, and recognition and participation of both urban and rural stakeholders, whose sensitivities to water shortages are spatially and temporally variable.","Univ Guelph, Dept Geog, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Smithers, J (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Geog, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",jsmither@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,54,100,107,2,54,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0364-152X,,,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

Specifically, it reports on the development and application of explorative scenarios (multiple plausible futures) involving six natural resource management organisations and their communities of practice operating along the East Coast of Australia. Scenarios were developed based on two key drivers of change, namely: maturing approach to natural resource management; and community driven climate change action, to test the robustness and flexibility of a suite of existing strategies, policies and targets. Findings indicate that explorative scenarios were useful in the identification of strategies that may result in perverse or negative impacts under different futures; guide selection of different approaches in response to unexpected events; encourage a forward-looking approach rather than relying on past experiences only; create flexible, robust strategies that are better able to deal with shocks and surprises; provide participating policy owners with an opportunity to consider future contexts for their policies to play out in; and, ascertain a range of possible pathways to achieve a vision or goals depending on changed circumstances.","[Serrao-Neumann, Silvia] Univ Waikato, Sch Social Sci, Environm Planning Programme, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Serrao-Neumann, Silvia; Schuch, Gemma; Cox, Melanie; Choy, Darryl Low] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Nathan, Qld, Australia",University of Waikato; Griffith University,"Serrao-Neumann, S (corresponding author), Univ Waikato, Sch Social Sci, Environm Planning Programme, Hamilton, New Zealand.",s.neumann@waikato.ac.nz,,"Serrao-Neumann, Silvia/0000-0001-9601-4914","Australian Government as part of the Natural Resource Management Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Research Grants Program, under Stream 2 of the Natural Resource Management Planning for Climate Change Fund; Planners Working Group","Australian Government as part of the Natural Resource Management Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Research Grants Program, under Stream 2 of the Natural Resource Management Planning for Climate Change Fund; Planners Working Group","The authors thank members of the East Coast Cluster, and in particular the Planners Working Group, for their support and participation in this project.

Development of aquaculture without adequate planning can lead to unsustainable economic feasibility due to future climate stressors. In this sense, offshore mariculture could be an alternative for mitigating the effect of coastal warming. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the suitability of the coastline in terms of global warming and sea surface temperature trends in locations where fish aquaculture is currently being developed, as well as the spatial changes of thermal anomalies up to 30 km from the coast, during the last 31 yr in the western Mediterranean (Spanish coast). This study was conducted using EU Copernicus Marine Service Information, covering the period 1981-2018, with a spatial resolution of 4 x 4 km. The results show that, over the last decade, the Mediterranean coastal environment off the Iberian Peninsula has experienced an increase in temperature of around 1 degrees C due to global change, with a clear latitudinal pattern modified by mesoscale oceanographic processes. The development of offshore aquaculture at some latitudes mitigates the extreme aestival effects on surface water temperatures. Strategic plans for aquaculture development should be able to forecast and incorporate future climate projections and local oceanographic conditions, and offshore aquaculture may provide an alternative in some regions, depending on local oceanographic conditions.","[Lopez Mengual, I; Sanchez-Jerez, P.] Univ Alicante, Dept Marine Sci & Appl Biol, Fase Ciencias 5, Ap C 99, Alicante 03080, Spain; [Ballester-Berman, Jd] Univ Alicante, Inst Comp Res IUII, Ap C 99, Alicante 03080, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat d'Alacant,"Sanchez-Jerez, P (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Marine Sci & Appl Biol, Fase Ciencias 5, Ap C 99, Alicante 03080, Spain.",psanchez@ua.es,,,,,,,48,1,1,4,10,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",1869-215X,1869-7534,,AQUACULT ENV INTERAC,Aquac.

Nonetheless, the sector keeps on confronting production challenges as a result of frequent and extended droughts, and these necessitate the use of drought-resistant crops such as sorghum. This review initiates one of the most common food grains grown in the poorest countries and the most food-insecure regions of the nation. We used deductive logical reasoning to develop a comprehensive scientific understanding of the crop that can be used to inform future research and policies. Various exclusion and inclusion criteria were used to filter the most prominent findings. Sorghum has the highest utility for its climatic adaptability and has grown for multiple purposes: From staple to industrial outcomes, its economic, social value, and health outcomes, and for animal silage. It is a gluten-free crop, has high nutritive value, and is preferred by healthy consumers. It is among the top five cereal crops worldwide in both production and acreage. This has necessitated the development of coping measures, such as the cultivation of drought-tolerant crops suitable for the affected areas. Therefore, this crop is used to ensure productivity, food security, and availability of food when other crops fail and food deficit and famine are affected in the region. This will contribute to the ongoing discussion on how to better inform private and public sector policy and investments in Ethiopia to increase sorghum and other drought-tolerant crop production, transform agriculture, improve nutrition, and food systems, and end hunger, food insecurity, and poverty.","[Sirany, Teshome] Debre Markos Univ, Dept Rural Dev, Debre Markos, Ethiopia; [Tadele, Esubalew; Aregahegn, Haimanot; Wale, Dagnachew] Debre Markos Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Debre Markos, Ethiopia",,"Sirany, T (corresponding author), Debre Markos Univ, Dept Rural Dev, Debre Markos, Ethiopia.",teshome_sirany@dmu.edu.et; esu360@gmail.com; haimanotrtt@gmail.com; dagne2112@gmail.com,"Sirany, Teshome/AEV-3522-2022","Sirany, Teshome/0000-0002-5124-7199; Tadele, Esubalew/0000-0001-7519-2738",,,,,85,0,0,2,2,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",2356-654X,2314-7539,,ADV AGR,Adv.

However, the potential effects of co-produced GI plans and the underlying preparation process are rarely evaluated. To bridge this gap, the aim of this article is to examine what works in addressing environmental burdens in the urban neighborhood of Dortmund Marten, Germany. As part of a larger transdisciplinary process, selective GI measures were delineated in the case study area through a cooperative workshop between scientists and urban planners. Workshop ideas were incorporated into a mitigative scenario considering a hot summer day to quantify the effects of the derived GI measures on thermal comfort and particulate matter dispersion (PM10 and PM2.5). To evaluate the experiences of the science-practice collaboration, the viewpoints of researchers and urban planners on learning effects, knowledge integration, and GI planning were summarized and compared via an online survey. The results indicate that the proposed GI measures could reduce physiological equivalent temperature (PET) by 25 degrees C. At the same time, additional roadside trees could increase PM10 concentrations by up to 36 mu g/m(3) due to wind blocking effects. Reflections on the science-practice workshop show that learning effects were higher for the participating researchers than for planning practitioners, while the integration of individual expertise during the workshop was more difficult for academics. These findings point to the importance of continuous reflections on individual understandings in cooperating stakeholder groups and the value of the evaluation of outcomes in transdisciplinary GI planning.","[Schaefer, Mathias] TU Dortmund Univ, Res Grp Spatial Informat Management & Modelling R, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany",Dortmund University of Technology,"Schaefer, M (corresponding author), TU Dortmund Univ, Res Grp Spatial Informat Management & Modelling R, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany.",mathias.schaefer@tu-dortmund.de,,"Schaefer, Mathias/0000-0002-5330-7714",Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LR1721A],Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"Open Access funding was enabled and organized by Project DEAL.

This study proposes hypothetical low-rise street-house models popular in contemporary urban Vietnam by applying the spatial and ecological lessons learned from the analysis. Design/methodology/approach In total, 23 well-preserved vernacular houses in Dong Hoa Hiep - an 18th century village in the Tien Giang Province - were chosen for a 2-month, on-site investigation. During the field survey, the houses were measured to fabricate scale drawings for detailed analysis, and photographs were taken. Findings An in-depth evaluation highlighted unique characteristics of spatial compositions, sustainable features, and architectural components that contribute to climate adaptive strategies. Research limitations/implications Although numerous potential arrangements of the models are possible, a few examples are illustrated to validate that the assembly could help achieve a dynamic streetscape for street houses. Social implications From this perspective, vernacular houses in Vietnam are a rich architectural resource and a significant cultural heritage, because these houses have adopted sustainable design strategies suitable for the local climate and culture to ensure comfort and well-being for a long time. Perhaps, sustainable lessons drawn from Vietnam's indigenous houses are a prerequisite to developing contemporary housing in the country. Originality/value Employing the lessons learned from vernacular houses, this study developed three sustainable prototypical designs for the development of contemporary street houses in densely populated cities in Vietnam.","[Le Thi Hong Na] Ho Chi Minh City Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Le Thi Hong Na] Vietnam Natl Univ Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Park, Jin-Ho; Jeon, Yangsook; Jung, Sejung] Inha Univ, Dept Architecture, Incheon, South Korea",Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMCUT); Vietnam National University Hochiminh City; Vietnam National University Hochiminh City; Inha University,"Park, JH (corresponding author), Inha Univ, Dept Architecture, Incheon, South Korea.",jinhopark@inha.ac.kr,,,INHA University Research Grant; Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT) - VNU-HCM,INHA University Research Grant; Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT) - VNU-HCM,This work was supported by the INHA University Research Grant.

Farmers are both the basic executors of agricultural adaptation and among the most vulnerable groups to climate change. However, the understanding on climate change perception and adaptive behavior of local farmers is still very limited. This study develops a binary logistic regression (BLR) model to explore the underlying principles of local farmer's perception and adaptive behavior toward climate change, with a focus on influential farmers. Through a field survey with 117 head farmers from 89 farmers' cooperatives in Chongming Island of China the largest alluvial island in the world, we found that: 1) 92% of the respondents thought climate change is happening; 59% of the respondents thought climate change has an obvious impact on agriculture production; and 45% of the respondents had a plan for future adaptation. 2) Based on BLR analysis, it was found that 3 out of 16 factors have significant impacts on head farmer's adaptive behavior toward climate change, including agricultural training, perceived temperature change, and education level. 3) The percentage of consistency (POC) is proposed to describe the performance of our BLR model. The overall POC of BLR model is 68.4%, with a higher POC (85.7%) for farmers who have no adaptive behavior. 4) Key measures to enhance local climate adaptation include an integrated and coordinated plan of farmer-level adaptation, tailored and specialized training programs, improvement of scientific research, and publicity of best practices.

Thirty-six downscaled climate projections from five General Circulation Models (GCMs) under the three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6;4.5 and 8.5 scenarios for the periods of 2015-2044 and 2045-2074 were incorporated into the calibrated SWAT model. Differences of these scenarios were calculated by comparing to the 1975-2004 baseline period. Overall, the SWAT model performed well in monthly streamflow simulation, with the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values of 0.75 and 0.63 for calibration and validation, respectively. Based on the ensemble of five GCMs, the annual rainfall and maximum temperature are projected to increase by 1.2-8.7% and 0.6-2.1 C-omicron, respectively. This corresponds to the increases in the annual streamflow (14.6-272%), evapotranspiration (0.3-2.7%), surface runoff (46.8-90.2%) and water yield (142-26.5%) components. The study shows an increase of monthly rainfall during the wet season, and decrease during the dry season. Therefore, the monthly streamflow and surface runoff are likely to increase significantly in November, December and January. In addition, slight decreases in the monthly water yield are found between June and October (1.9-8.9%) during the 2015-2044 period. These findings could act as a scientific reference to develop better climate adaptation strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This is caused by gas flaring, crude oil spillages, illegal oil bunkering and pipeline vandalism in the region. The call for eco-democracy and the disruption of eco-apathy has driven global academia into developing paradigms that would foster environmental transformation. Interestingly, while academic disciplines such as history, geography, anthropology and the global humanities continue to critically engage in practices and discourses that would facilitate achieving anticipatory climate adaptation, African academia, especially in Nigeria, has been slow to absorb the same critical spirit as the West. In fact, environmental film critics in Nigeria have not fully explored the environmental discourse that has gathered strength in other disciplines central to the greening of the humanities. Therefore, there remains a dearth of critical underpinning for environment and cinema, or what I term discourses of/on the green cinema, in African scholarship. Against this backdrop, I examine environmental crisis in the documentary films Delta Blues, The Nigerian Oil Thieves and The True Price of Crude Oil, and use content analysis method to investigate how these films have been used to create environmental awareness in the region. The analysis is anchored on Adrian Ivakhiv's biocentric model of ecocriticism, which acknowledges the unity of man and all the creatures and the environment around him, and further recommends a shift from human-centrism to biocentrism.","[Okpadah, Stephen Ogheneruro] Univ Ilorin, Dept Performing Arts, Ilorin, Nigeria; [Okpadah, Stephen Ogheneruro] Univ Warwick, Dept Theatre & Performance Studies, Coventry, England",University of Ilorin; University of Warwick,"Okpadah, SO (corresponding author), Univ Ilorin, Dept Performing Arts, Ilorin, Nigeria.;Okpadah, SO (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Dept Theatre & Performance Studies, Coventry, England.",Stephen.Okpadah@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,0,"POLISH ACAD SCIENCES, INST SLAVIC STUDIES",WARSAW,"BARTOSZEWICZA 1B-17, WARSAW, 00-337, POLAND",2081-6774,2392-2419,,COLLOQ HUMAN-POLAND,Colloq.

Yet, it remains unclear to what extent subsidies are effective in motivating behavioural change. Subsidies are effective if they lead to adoption of the behaviour by individuals different from those who would adopt otherwise. On the bases of two theoretical frameworks, we examine the effectiveness of two subsidy schemes in the Netherlands. In Study 1 (n = 151), we applied the Transtheoretical Model and argued that a subsidy for climate adaptation measures is effective if it not only attracts those in the action and preparation stages of the model, but also people in the precontemplation and contemplation stage. In Study 2 (n = 367), we applied the Diffusion of Innovations Theory and argued that a subsidy for electric vehicles is effective if it attracts not only innovators and early adopters, but also early and late majority adopters. In both studies, we examined the extent to which subsidies remove financial barriers and serve as a cue to action. In Study 1, we found that the subsidies primarily attracted people who were in the action and preparation stages. In Study 2, we found that a subsidy for electric vehicles did not attract more early and late majority adopters compared to those who adopted an electric vehicle without a subsidy. In both studies we found that the subsidy mainly served as a cue to action, and was less likely to remove financial barriers.","[van Valkengoed, A.

The climatic adaptation of buildings and their indoor environment become an essential condition for maintaining the health and productivity of the occupants. This paper proposes a model to assess the thermal comfort of naturally ventilated buildings in hot and dry climates in Burkina Faso.

It consists in proposing the zones of thermal comfort on the diagram of the humid air for each climatic region. Findings A decision-making tool is set up for evaluating the comfort of buildings to better consider the bio-climatic concept through a long-term comfort index. This comfort index is defined and is used to assess the degree of thermal discomfort for various types of housing. Two natural ventilation pilot buildings located in Ouagadougou were considered.

Aquaporin (AQP) water channels are found throughout nature and confer high-capacity water flow through cell membranes. The genome of the major malaria vector mosquito Anopheles gambiae contains at least seven putative AQP sequences. Anticipating that transmembrane water movements are important during the life cycle of A. gambiae, we identified and characterized the A. gambiae aquaporin 1 (AgAQP1) protein that is homologous to AQPs known in humans, Drosophila, and sap-sucking insects. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, AgAQP1 transports water but not glycerol. Similar to mammalian AQPs, water permeation of AgAQP1 is inhibited by HgCl(2) and tetraethylammonium, with Tyr185 conferring tetraethylammonium sensitivity. AgAQP1 is more highly expressed in adult female A. gambiae mosquitoes than in males. Expression is high in gut, ovaries, and Malpighian tubules where immunofluorescence microscopy reveals that AgAQP1 resides in stellate cells but not principal cells. AgAQP1 expression is up-regulated in fat body and ovary by blood feeding but not by sugar feeding, and it is reduced by exposure to a dehydrating environment (42% relative humidity). RNA interference reduces AgAQP1 mRNA and protein levels. In a desiccating environment (< 20% relative humidity), mosquitoes with reduced AgAQP1 protein survive significantly longer than controls. These studies support a role for AgAQP1 in water homeostasis during blood feeding and humidity adaptation of A. gambiae, a major mosquito vector of human malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.","[Liu, Kun; Tsujimoto, Hitoshi; Cha, Sung-Jae; Agre, Peter; Rasgon, Jason L.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Johns Hopkins Malaria Res Inst, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,"Liu, K (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Johns Hopkins Malaria Res Inst, 615 N Wolfe St,E5132, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",kuliu@jhsph.edu; jrasgon@jhsph.edu,,"Rasgon, Jason/0000-0002-4050-8429",National Institutes of Health [R01HL48268]; JHMRI,National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); JHMRI,"We thank Drs.

Design/methodology/approach Inspired by the critical institutionalism approach, the study uses qualitative methods (i.e. key informant interviews, semi-structured interviews, community workshops and documentary review) to understand the role of different formal and informal water-related institutions vis-a-vis responding to climate-related challenges in the case study area, and how the identified institutions can improve their efforts in the context of national water and environmental policy and regulation frameworks. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis. Findings The study found that climatic challenges in the case study area, as in most of rural Africa, have raised the stakes in local water management with respect to regulating access to and balancing competing interests in, and demands for, water. It ultimately argues for the embracing of complexity thinking and flexibility in local water management as well as clear coordination of institutions across scales in the face of increasing climate-related challenges. Originality/value The study adds to case studies and evidence-based analyses focused on institutional alternatives for climate adaptation vis-a-vis water resources management in water-stressed rural African communities.","[Nyamwanza, Admire Mutsa] Human Sci Res Council, Econ Performance & Dev Unit, Cape Town, South Africa",Human Sciences Research Council-South Africa,"Nyamwanza, AM (corresponding author), Human Sci Res Council, Econ Performance & Dev Unit, Cape Town, South Africa.",anyamwanza@gmail.com,,,IDRC; African Climate Change Fellowship Program (ACCFP III),IDRC; African Climate Change Fellowship Program (ACCFP III),This paper is part of work undertaken by the author under the African Climate Change Fellowship Program Phase 3 (ACCFP III).

Our key interest in the article is the potential offered by experimental participatory events to support the biodiverse transformation of public areas by creating micro-utopian entanglements of citizens and nonhuman organisms. The article will focus on three experimental participatory events enacted as part of the research project: (1) public dialogues and workshops, (2) the arrival on the scene of charismatic cows, and (3) pop-up events in the form of participatory playing. The article concludes that this kind of material citizenship is a powerful strategy for stimulating public engagement in building more biodiverse futures. The strategy thus materializes micro-utopian spaces where the importance of biodiversity can be rehearsed and sensed by local communities. In this way, a culturally transformative zone of dreaming while doing-or doing dreams-is enacted.","[Knudsen, Britta Timm] Aarhus Univ, Sch Culture & Commun, ARTS, Jens Chr Skousvej 2, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Stage, Carsten] Aarhus Univ, Sch Commun & Culture, Aarhus C, Denmark; [Zandersen, Marianne] Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",Aarhus University; Aarhus University; Aarhus University,"Knudsen, BT (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Sch Culture & Commun, ARTS, Jens Chr Skousvej 2, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",norbtk@cc.au.dk,,,Aarhus University Strategic Research funds from DCE,Aarhus University Strategic Research funds from DCE,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research was financed by Aarhus University Strategic Research funds from DCE for the project Permeable Green City Aarhus - Combining life policies, biodiversity, citizen empowerment and sustainable urban drainage to create an ecologically and socially resilient city.",,52,0,0,3,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1206-3312,1552-8308,,SPACE CULT,Space Cult.,NOV,2022,25,4,,,,,720,742,,10.1177/1206331219863312,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1206331219863312,,,23,Cultural Studies; Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Cultural Studies; Geography,5N1FK,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000871535100014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Conservation agriculture is expected to offer substantial climate adaptation benefits. However, synergistic effects of conservation practices on yield during normal versus extreme climates and underlying regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we analyze 29-years of climate data, cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) yield, and soil data under 32 management practices in Tennessee, USA. We find that long-term no-tillage enhanced agroecosystem resilience and yield stability under climate extremes and maximized yield under favorable climate. We demonstrate that no-tillage benefits are tied with enhanced soil structural stability and organic carbon. No-tillage enhanced the effectiveness of legume cover crop in stabilizing cotton yield during relatively dry or wet, and dry years, while nitrogen fertilizer rate and precipitation timing, controlled yield stability in wetter years. Our findings provide evidence-based insights into how management strategies can enhance agroecosystem resilience and production stability in climate extremes.

People, governments, and a range of non-state actors are responding to these climatic and non-climatic risks through planned and autonomous response strategies. While several studies examine the drivers of vulnerability and range of response strategies undertaken, few distinguish development interventions from climate adaptation actions, making it difficult to identify particular entry points for enabling and strengthening adaptation action. In this paper, we apply Eakin et al.'s (2014) framework of generic versus specific capacity to data from three semi-arid regions in India to examine the implications of multi-scalar response strategies on local adaptive capacities and adaptation processes. We find that current arguments of good development translating into effective adaptation are not always seen: building specific capacities to deal with climatic risks is essential to leverage wins through development interventions. This can help semi-arid regions and people living in them to move towards sustainable adaptation pathways.","[Singh, Chandni; Iyer, Soundarya; Bazaz, Amir] Indian Inst Human Settlements, Bangalore City Campus,197-36, Bangalore 560080, Karnataka, India; [Solomon, Divya] Ashoka Trust Res Ecol & Environm, Royal Enclave Sriramapura, Jakkur Post, Bengaluru 560064, Karnataka, India; [Bendapudi, Ramkumar; Kuchimanchi, Bhavana] Watershed Org Trust, 2nd Floor, Pune 411009, Maharashtra, India; [Iyer, Soundarya] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, India Observ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Solomon, Divya] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Singh, C (corresponding author), Indian Inst Human Settlements, Bangalore City Campus,197-36, Bangalore 560080, Karnataka, India.",csingh@iihs.ac.in,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Singh, Chandni/H-8384-2019; Iyer, Soundarya/AAN-6693-2020","Singh, Chandni/0000-0001-6842-6735; Iyer, Soundarya/0000-0001-8307-4870; Solomon, Divya/0000-0003-0373-9356","UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada","UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada(CGIAR)","This work was carried out under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA), with financial support from the UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID) and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada.

In some manner, climate change will impact on the livelihoods of most individuals in the twenty-first century. Some of the risks for small islands are risk of death, injury, ill-health or disrupted livelihoods in low-lying coastal zones due to storm surges, coastal flooding, and sea level rise. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that in small islands, which have diverse physical and human attributes, community-based adaptation has been shown to generate larger benefits when delivered in conjunction with other developmental activities. One of the adaptive responses suggested is to improve the efficacy of traditional community coping strategies; this can be facilitated by social work intervention at the macro-level. The role of social workers in SIDS can impact on sustainable development and towards improved livelihoods of a country's human resources. According to the Council on Social Work Education, the purpose of the social work profession is to promote human and community well-being. This purpose is put into practice through a quest for social and economic justice, the prevention of conditions that limit human rights, the elimination of poverty and the enhancement and quality of life for all persons. Key strategies by which social workers can promote sustainable development include building relations with communities, helping individuals to deepen their understanding of sustainable development, and assisting them to develop and work towards goals and objectives that lead towards the integration and improvement of economic, social and environmental outcomes.","[Joseph, Debra D.] Univ West Indies, Dept Govt Sociol & Social Work, Fac Social Sci, Cave Hill, Barbados",University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Cave Hill Campus,"Joseph, DD (corresponding author), Univ West Indies, Dept Govt Sociol & Social Work, Fac Social Sci, Cave Hill, Barbados.",debra.joseph@cavehill.uwi.edu,,,,,,,42,5,5,1,32,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

In recent years, local governments, concerned with their community's resilience to climate disasters, have started to consider insurance programs as part of their adaptation strategies. However, we do not yet have a robust body of research that shows if, and how, expanded insurance take-up among households affects community-wide recovery after a climate disaster. Filling this disaster insurance research gap will better equip public sector leaders to assess if investments in insurance programs can further community resilience goals and when disaster insurance is an appropriate climate adaptation tool. In this article, we assess the state of empirical evidence through existing frameworks of community recovery and put forward an agenda for future research that is attuned to local policy needs.Key policy insights:There is increasing interest by policymakers in expanding the number of households with disaster insurance to provide financial protection in the face of increasing climate risks, but little evidence exists on how household-level insurance affects community-level resilience outcomes.Expanded research on this topic could support local decision-makers in designing effective and efficient policies to support community recovery from climate extremes.Future research should focus on testing more holistic disaster recovery measures and downscaling global and national research to the local scale.Emerging pilot insurance programs and experimental policies offer novel opportunities to study impacts at the local level.","[French, Karina; Kousky, Carolyn] Environm Def Fund, New York, NY USA; [Kousky, Carolyn] 257 Pk Ave South, New York, NY 10010 USA",Environmental Defense Fund,"Kousky, C (corresponding author), 257 Pk Ave South, New York, NY 10010 USA.",ckousky@edf.org,,,,,,,59,0,0,4,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

How people are impacted depends on where they are located, how vulnerable they are, and the magnitude of the hazard. Although a significant amount of geospatial data is freely available, there has been a lack of user-friendly data tools allowing for integrated data-driven assessments of these complex climate-related security risks. Strata is such a tool, developed by a multidisciplinary team and co-designed with practitioners in the fields of peacebuilding, climate adaptation and environmental conservation. It addresses the need for making visible the available climate and conflict data via a web browser and allows a high level of analysis and customisation by users. Here we describe the process of co-developing the principles behind Strata, the data aggregation framework used, and the choice of datasets. Example outputs for Somalia, the pilot location, demonstrate how data is aggregated to produce hotspot maps and how these provide information on where impacts relating to climate, environmental and security stresses should be investigated, at a range of spatial scales. We reflect on challenges in co-designing Strata and pathways for continued development of the tool. We also highlight how user insights can be incorporated in this and similar tools, to ensure actionable data-driven insights within the context of available data and understandings of impact pathways.","[Young, Hannah R.; Cha, YoungHwa; Watmough, Gary R.; Donovan, Kate; Patenaude, Genevieve; Woodhouse, Iain H.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Drummond St, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Scotland; [den Boer, Hannah; Nash, Kathryn] Univ Edinburgh, Old Coll, Edinburgh Law Sch, South Bridge, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Scotland; [Schellens, Marie] United Nat Environm Programme, Disasters & Conflicts Branch, Chemin Anemones 15, CH-1219 Vernier, Switzerland; [Watmough, Gary R.] Univ Edinburgh, Global Acad Agr & Food Syst, Easter Bush Campus,Bush Farm Rd, Edinburgh EH25 9RG, Scotland; [Donovan, Kate] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh Climate Change Inst, High Sch Yards, Infirm St, Edinburgh EH1 1LZ, Scotland; [Patenaude, Genevieve; Fleming, Sam; Butchart, Ben] Earth Blox, 6 Redheughs Rigg, Edinburgh EH12 9DQ, Scotland; [Young, Hannah R.] UK Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Bush Estate, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Scotland",University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH),"Woodhouse, IH (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Drummond St, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Scotland.",i.h.woodhouse@ed.ac.uk,,"Cha, YoungHwa/0000-0002-9677-3889",European Union; Government of Norway; Scottish Funding Council Beacon Programme at the University of Edinburgh,European Union(European Commission); Government of Norway; Scottish Funding Council Beacon Programme at the University of Edinburgh,"We thank those who participated in the surveys, interviews and workshops for sharing their knowledge and providing feedback to inform the design of Strata.

Identification and prioritization of adaptation options would greatly support decision-making in drought-prone Northwest Bangladesh. This study identified climate adaptation options by literature review and stakeholder consultation, then used multi-criteria analysis to evaluate and prioritize the options. The complexity of the options was also evaluated, specifically social, institutional, and technical obstacles to their local uptake. Seventy-two adaptation options were identified, spanning six sector categories. The options were further classified asin-system dependent, i.e., options that could be implemented by local actors, or asout-system dependent, i.e., options reliant on actions by external actors. Finally, they were defined as on-farm or off-farm strategies. Transboundary cooperation to increase surface water flows was ranked as the overall top-priority option, though this option is very complex andout-system dependent. Integrated water resources management and integrated crop management were the top-ranked options in the water management and crop production management sectors, respectively. Clustering scattered households and offering training programs in on-farm water management were the most and least complex measures, respectively. Stakeholders exhibited a clear preference for higher scaleout-system dependentstrategies, rather thanin-system dependentoptions focused on changing the agricultural system itself to cope with climate change. Nonetheless, it is recommended that short-term and medium-term planning focus on opportunities to implement achievable adaptation measures within the local agricultural system.

Recent research on this is shown here, covering climate change projections for future years throughout this century, predictions at multi-week to seasonal lead times and historical climate records based on observations. Climate projections are presented based on extreme metrics with results shown for individual seasons. A seasonal prediction system for fire weather conditions is demonstrated here as a new capability development for Australia. To produce a more seamless set of predictions, the data sets are calibrated based on quantile-quantile matching for consistency with observations-based data sets, including to help provide details around extreme values for the model predictions (demonstrating the quantile matching for extremes method). Factors influencing the predictability of conditions are discussed, including pre-existing fuel moisture, large-scale modes of variability, sudden stratospheric warmings and climate trends. The extreme 2019-2020 summer fire season is discussed, with examples provided on how this suite of calibrated fire weather data sets was used, including long-range predictions several months ahead provided to fire agencies. These fire weather data sets are now available in a consistent form covering historical records back to 1950, long-range predictions out to several months ahead and future climate change projections throughout this century. A seamless service across different time scales is intended to enhance long-range planning capabilities and climate adaptation efforts, leading to enhanced resilience and disaster risk reduction in relation to natural hazards.","[Dowdy, Andrew J.] Bur Meteorol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Bureau of Meteorology - Australia,"Dowdy, AJ (corresponding author), Bur Meteorol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",andrew.dowdy@bom.gov.au,,,,,,,47,11,11,1,7,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",,2206-5865,,J SO HEMISPH EARTH,J.

This study evaluated trends in precipitation extremes from 1985 to 2014 in the Kelantan River Basin (KRB), Malaysia. Forty-one climate stations that had <10% missing data, and which passed the data quality control and homogeneity tests were selected. Trends of 14 precipitation extreme indices recommended by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices that related to duration, threshold, absolute, relative and percentile indices were analysed using the Mann-Kendall and Sen's tests. Generally, most of the regional precipitation extremes' indices had increased trends, except the consecutive dry days and consecutive wet days, which are quite consistent with global scale trends studies. On a monthly scale, the maximum 5-day precipitation amount (Rx5d) had increasing trends in January (34.91mmdecade(-1)) and December (13.96mmdecade(-1)), by field significance at 95% confidence level. For spatial context, most of the stations with significant trends were distributed in the south-western (mountainous) and northern (near-coastal) regions. In the Tropics, the KRB's extremes indices trends had a similar pattern to the West Pacific, Indian Ocean and Caribbean regions, but were different from Western Thailand, the South China Sea and the North Inter-tropical Convergence Zone, showing that trends of precipitation extreme events are different regionally. Overall, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Multivariate El-Nino Southern Oscillation Index, Indian Ocean Dipole and Madden-Julian Oscillation had a significant relationship with all precipitation extremes' indices, and they are contributors to climate changes in this basin.","[Tan, Mou Leong] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Block E1,08-22,1 Engn Dr 2, Singapore 117576, Singapore; [Tan, Mou Leong; Ibrahim, Ab Latif] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Res Inst Sustainable Environm, Geosci & Digital Earth Ctr, Johor Baharu, Malaysia; [Cracknell, Arthur P.] Univ Dundee, Sch Engn Phys & Math, Dundee, Scotland; [Yusop, Zulkifli] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Res Inst Sustainable Environm, Ctr Environm Sustainabil & Water Secur, Johor Baharu, Malaysia",National University of Singapore; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; University of Dundee; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Tan, ML (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Block E1,08-22,1 Engn Dr 2, Singapore 117576, Singapore.",mouleong@gmail.com,"Tan, Mou Leong/N-4678-2017","Tan, Mou Leong/0000-0003-3939-0336",Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under the Transdisciplinary Research Grant Scheme [R.J130000.7809.4L835],"Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia(Ministry of Education, Malaysia); Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under the Transdisciplinary Research Grant Scheme","This research was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under the Transdisciplinary Research Grant Scheme (R.J130000.7809.4L835).

Careful spatial planning can reduce this vulnerability, provided that decision-makers have insight into the costs and benefits of adaptation options. This paper addresses the question which adaptation options are suitable, from an economic perspective, to adapt spatial planning to climate change at a regional scale. We apply social cost-benefit analysis to assess the net benefits of adaptation options that deal with the impacts of climate change-induced extreme events. From the methods applied and results obtained, we also aim at learning lessons for assessing climate adaptation options. The case study area, the Zuidplaspolder, is a large-scale urban development project in the Netherlands. The costs as well as the primary and secondary benefits of adaptation options relating to spatial planning (e.g. flood-proof housing and adjusted infrastructure) are identified and where possible quantified. Our results show that three adaptation options are not efficient investments, as the investment costs exceed the benefits of avoided damages. When we focus on 'climate proofing' the total area of the Zuidplaspolder, when the costs and benefits of all the presented adaptation options are considered together, the total package has a positive net present value. The study shows that it is possible to anticipate climate change impacts and assess the costs and benefits of adjusting spatial planning. We have learned that scenario studies provide a useful tool but that decision-making under climate change uncertainty also requires insight into the probabilities of occurrence of weather extremes in the future.","[de Bruin, Karianne] CICERO, N-0318 N Oslo, Norway; [Goosen, Hasse] Wageningen Univ, Alterra, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Ierland, Ekko C.; Groeneveld, Rolf A.] Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"de Bruin, K (corresponding author), CICERO, POB 1129, N-0318 N Oslo, Norway.",karianne.debruin@gmail.com,"Groeneveld, Rolf/B-3119-2010","Groeneveld, Rolf/0000-0002-3699-1200; Goosen, Hasse/0000-0002-8749-2874; de Bruin, Karianne/0000-0002-3719-0579",Climate changes Spatial Planning programme; Province of Zuid-Holland,Climate changes Spatial Planning programme; Province of Zuid-Holland,"We like to thank the editor, the guest editor and two anonymous reviewers for their useful comments.

Crop intensification, diversification, reduced tillage, and variable N management are among strategies proposed to mitigate and adapt to climate shifts in the inland Pacific Northwest (iPNW). Our objectives were to assess these strategies across iPNW agroecological zones and time for their impacts on (1) winter wheat (WW) (Triticum aestivum L.) productivity, (2) crop sequence productivity, and (3) N fertilizer use efficiency. Region-wide analysis indicated that WW yields increased with increasing annual precipitation, prior to maximizing at 520 mm yr(-1) and subsequently declining when annual precipitation was not adjusted for available soil water holding capacity. While fallow periods were effective at mitigating low nitrogen (N) fertilization efficiencies under low precipitation, efficiencies declined as annual precipitation exceeded 500 mm yr(-1). Variability in the response of WW yields to annual precipitation and N fertilization among locations and within sites supports precision N management implementation across the region. In years receiving <350 rum precipitation yr-1, WW yields declined when preceded by crops rather than summer fallow. Nevertheless, WW yields were greater when preceded by pulses and oilseeds rather than wheat across a range of yield potentials, and when under conservation tillage practices at low yield potentials. Despite the yield penalty associated with eliminating fallow prior to WW, cropping system level productivity was not affected by intensification, diversification, or conservation tillage. However, increased fertilizer N inputs, lower fertilizer N use efficiencies, and more yield variance may offset and limit the economic feasibility of intensified and diversified cropping systems.","[Maaz, Tai M.; Madsen, Isaac J.; Pan, William L.] Washington State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Schillinger, William F.] Washington State Univ, Lind Dryland Res Stn, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Lind, WA USA; [Machado, Stephen] Columbia Basin Agr Res Ctr, Adams, OR USA; [Brooks, Erin; Glover, Ayana] Univ Idaho, Biol Engn, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Johnson-Maynard, Jodi L.] Univ Idaho, Dept Plant Soil & Entomol Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Young, Lauren E.] Washington State Crop Improvement Assoc, Pullman, WA USA; [Young, Frank L.; Leslie, Ian] USDA ARS, Northwest Sustainable Agroecosyst Res, Pullman, WA USA; [Esser, Aaron] Washington State Univ Extens, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Lind Res Stn, Ritzville, WA USA; [Collins, Harold P.] USDA ARS, Grassland Soil & Water Res Lab, Temple, TX 76502 USA",Washington State University; Washington State University; Idaho; University of Idaho; Idaho; University of Idaho; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Washington State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Maaz, TM (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",tai.mcclellan@wsu.edu,"Schillinger, William/P-4112-2019; Johnson-Maynard, Jodi L/E-9518-2013","Johnson-Maynard, Jodi L/0000-0002-4450-4636; Madsen, Isaac/0000-0003-2216-1529; Brooks, Erin/0000-0002-6921-4870; Schillinger, William/0000-0001-9285-8159",USDA National Institute for Food and Agriculture [2011-68002-30191],USDA National Institute for Food and Agriculture,This research was funded through Award #2011-68002-30191 from USDA National Institute for Food and Agriculture.,,133,13,13,1,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

Overall, the results revealed that the variation of the parcel-based NetBBFs should be attributed to the land parcels characterized with differential land developmental intensity. The results further showed that stepwise regression (SR) models exhibited lower statistical power for interpreting the relationships between the LPDA metrics and parcel-based NetBBFs, explaining 52.50-54.90% of the variance of the parcel-based NetBBFs. In contrast, the partial least square regression (PLSR) models better interpreted such relationships, explaining 59.9-71.6% of the variance of the parcel-based NetBBFs.

Understanding these factors is essential for developing planning tools for risk reduction and response. In this qualitative study, focus groups are used to learn about homeowners' experiences with a disturbance event, as well as their perceptions and expectations regarding local climate adaptation. The analysis provides insights about how risk perceptions, insurance practices, and social networks may influence individuals' willingness and ability to cope with a disaster. Potential social limits to adaptation among participants included inaccurate risk perceptions based on experiences and feelings of helplessness, and a lack of political trust at the state level. Existing social resources that may be more formally leveraged to enhance adaptive capacity include knowledge reserves of long-term residents, strong bonding capital,'' and trust in local, nonelected government employees.

The results show that air temperature, air movement and mean radiant temperature have significant influence, but humidity has no statistical significance. By using probit regressive analyses, the thermal neutrality and thermal preference of students occurred at 26.3 degrees C ET* and 24.7 degrees C ET*, respectively. Responses from those students suggest a wider acceptable temperature range for occupants in Taiwan. The margins of the acceptable zones obtained from direct and indirect acceptability assessing methods are 21.1-29.8 degrees C ET* and 24.2-29.3 degrees C ET*, respectively.

We used 5-day hypothetically perfect rainfall forecasts and 4-day real rainfall forecasts for 2007-2008 issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The rainfall forecasts were incorporated into the agro-hydrological model SWAP (Soil Water Plant Atmosphere), to produce alternative irrigation schedules. The SWAP model was calibrated with data from field experiments at Kharagpur, North-East India. Rice yield simulations were performed for observed weather (1989-2009) and for a future climate with more dry spells and more intense rainfall events. The model revealed that basing the decision to irrigate rice on short-term weather forecasts could reduce average water application by 27% when 5-day perfect rainfall forecasts were used. Even though the real 4-day rainfall forecasts were not very accurate, their use also resulted in a reduction in irrigation water application. Using 5-day hypothetically perfect forecasts under future climate conditions led to a saving of 32% of irrigation water compared to water use under the current climate. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Hotter temperatures can detrimentally affect workers' health and their economic productivity and livelihoods, especially in rural areas in industrializing countries that may be more vulnerable and less resilient. A growing literature has examined these factors at large spatial scales, yet few studies have done so at finer scales. Micro-level data from developing regions is needed to understand the extent of heat exposure, as well as current and future adaptation strategies of working, healthy, and rural populations. We fill this gap using objective environmental measurements from 3M (TM) Questemp (TM) 46 Heat Stress Monitors, as well as survey data from working, healthy, and rural communities in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Our data contain two groups: those who work in only open areas, and those who work in both forests and open areas. We document workers' livelihood strategies, work schedules, perceptions of how temperatures impact their work, and future adaptation strategies for even hotter days. Ambient tempera. tures are 2.6-8.3 degrees C cooler in forests compared to open areas, indicating the temperature effects of deforestation can be immediate and significant. Those working only in open areas face up to 6.5 h of exposure to temperatures above the accepted Threshold Limit Value for worker well-being. Workers adapt to hotter temperatures by altering the timing of their work shifts and breaks, indicating our sample is already adapting to increasing temperatures from climate and land use change. We also find differential adaptation strategies between those working only in open areas compared to those working in both forests and open areas, suggesting current acclimatization may be a factor in how people adapt. Our results suggest the need for adaptation and mitigation policies tailored to the unique constraints of rural workers that specifically incorporate extant adaptation strategies.","[Masuda, Yuta J.; Wolff, Nicholas H.; Game, Edward T.] Nature Conservancy, Global Sci, Arlington, VA USA; [Castro, Brianna] Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Aggraeni, Ike] Mulawarman Univ, Fac Publ Hlth, Samarinda, Indonesia; [Ebi, Kristie; Krenz, Jennifer; Spector, June] Univ Washington, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ebi, Kristie] Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Garg, Teevrat] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Global Policy & Strategy, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",Nature Conservancy; Harvard University; Universitas Mulawarman; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Masuda, YJ (corresponding author), Nature Conservancy, 4245 Fairfax Dr 100, Arlington, VA 22203 USA.",ymasuda@tnc.org,"Game, Edward/AAD-2289-2020","Game, Edward/0000-0003-4707-9281; Wolff, Nicholas/0000-0003-1162-3556; Ebi, Kristie/0000-0003-4746-8236",,,,,93,27,27,3,27,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

It provides water for several municipalities and its biosphere reserves are important tourist attractions. Much of the forest cover outside the core protected areas is in fact coffee grown under traditional forest shade. Unless this (agro)forest cover can be sustained, the biodiversity of the Sierra Madre and the environmental services it provides are at risk. We analyzed the threats to livelihoods and environment from climate change through crop suitability modeling based on downscaled climate scenarios for the period 2040 to 2069 (referred to as 2050s) and developed adaptation options through an expert workshop. Significant areas of forest and occasionally coffee are destroyed every year by wildfires, and this problem is bound to increase in a hotter and drier future climate. Widespread landslides and inundations, including on coffee farms, have recently been caused by hurricanes whose intensity is predicted to increase. A hotter climate with more irregular rainfall will be less favorable to the production of quality coffee and lower profitability may compel farmers to abandon shade coffee and expand other land uses of less biodiversity value, probably at the expense of forest. A comprehensive strategy to sustain the biodiversity, ecosystem services and livelihoods of the Sierra Madre in the face of climate change should include the promotion of biodiversity friendly coffee growing and processing practices including complex shade which can offer some hurricane protection and product diversification; payments for forest conservation and restoration from existing government programs complemented by private initiatives; diversification of income sources to mitigate risks associated with unstable environmental conditions and coffee markets; integrated fire management; development of markets that reward sustainable land use practices and forest conservation; crop insurance programs that are accessible to smallholders; and the strengthening of local capacity for adaptive resource management.","[Schroth, Goetz; Dempewolf, Jan; Moreno, Jaime Garcia] Conservat Int, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [Laderach, Peter] CIAT, Managua, Nicaragua; [Philpott, Stacy] Univ Toledo, Dept Environm Sci, Toledo, OH 43606 USA; [Haggar, Jeremy] CATIE, Managua, Nicaragua; [Eakin, Hallie] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Castillejos, Teresa; Hernandez, Ricardo] Conservac Int Mexico, Tuxtla Gutierrez 29030, Chiapas, Mexico; [Pinto, Lorena Soto] El Colegio Frontera ECOSUR, Chiapas 29200, Mexico; [Eitzinger, Anton; Ramirez-Villegas, Julian] CIAT, Cali, Colombia",Conservation International; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; University System of Ohio; University of Toledo; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; El Colegio de la Frontera Sur (ECOSUR); Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT,"Schroth, G (corresponding author), Conservat Int, 2011 Crystal Dr,Suite 500, Arlington, VA 22202 USA.",g.schroth@conservation.org,"Ramirez-Villegas, Julian/AAY-8073-2020; Philpott, Stacy/M-3486-2019; Eitzinger, Anton/AAU-4960-2020; Philpott, Stacy M/F-2330-2011; Eakin, Hallie/J-3654-2012","Ramirez-Villegas, Julian/0000-0002-8044-583X; Philpott, Stacy/0000-0002-8338-3806; Eitzinger, Anton/0000-0001-7317-3381; Philpott, Stacy M/0000-0002-8338-3806; Laderach, Peter/0000-0001-8708-6318; Soto-Pinto, Lorena/0000-0002-2254-8603",,,,,52,126,139,0,187,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

The local background climate has a significant impact on the PCE, however the dominant factors and threshold value of efficiency (TVoE) of the PCE under different local background climates are still uncertain. Here, we selected 207 urban parks in 27 cities in East China with four different local background climates, warm temperate sub-humid monsoon (WTC), northern subtropical sub-humid monsoon (NSC), northern subtropical humid monsoon (NHC), and middle subtropical humid monsoon climate (MSC), for comparative studies. The relative contributions of multi-influencing factors to the PCE and TVoE of urban parks were quantified through a multivariate stepwise regression model and curve fitting. The results show that: (1) PCE increases from WTC, NSC, NHC to MSC, and urban parks at low latitudes have a greater cooling effect in general than those at high latitudes; (2) the area of the park is the dominant factor of PCE under four different local background climates (the explanation rate exceeds 50%) and water bodies within urban parks play a more significant role in the cooling effect in high latitudes, dry areas; (3) the TVoE of park on WTC, NSC, NHC, and MSC are 0.81, 0.71, 0.70, and 0.66 ha, respectively, revealing that the background climate significantly affects the TVoE.

This study also discusses the correlation between patient needs and satisfaction. Background Hospitals seek to improve patient satisfaction to provide better service. However, there is a lack of existing literature on grassroots medical institutions in towns and townships, especially in cold regions. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the correlation between patient needs and the satisfaction of township hospitals in the cold regions of China. Methods First, a hierarchical task analysis method was used to build the hierarchy for patient satisfaction demands. Patients from 15 township hospitals in cold areas were subjected to semistructured interviews, and a theoretical model was proposed using the grounded theory method. Finally, each open code index was evaluated, and 270 questionnaires were issued to evaluate patient satisfaction. Results The framework for patient satisfaction demands included five dimensions: tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. A theoretical model for patient satisfaction demands was built, and four selective codes, including Characteristic, Perceived Quality, Loyalty Intention, and Environment Expectation, were extracted. The weights of these satisfaction-influencing factors were subsequently evaluated. Conclusions This study summarizes the existing problems in a basic health service provision capacity, climate adaptability, lack of environmental design, and so on; proposes four influencing factors; establishes a patient satisfaction evaluation model; and obtains the weight of influence of each factor. These results will help provide accurate and effective suggestions for hospital management.","[Wu, Yue; Mu, Jingyi; Zhang, Shanshan] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, Key Lab Cold Reg Urban & Rural Human Settlement E, 66 West Dazhi St, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Mu, JY (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, Key Lab Cold Reg Urban & Rural Human Settlement E, 66 West Dazhi St, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",mujingyi1713@163.com,"Zhang, shanshan/HLP-6320-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51808160, 51878210]; HIT.NSRIF [2020035]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); HIT.NSRIF,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51808160, 51878210) and HIT.NSRIF (2020035).",,39,7,7,8,36,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1937-5867,2167-5112,,HERD-HEALTH ENV RES,Herd-Health Env.

This article explores the population's perception of coastal risk on the Atlantic coast of France (Pays de la Loire region) that is an at-risk terri-tory historically affected by erosion and is particularly sensitive to coastal flooding. The major goal of the paper is to collect data in terms of risk perception by carrying out a field survey on three territorial collectivities, with the aim to enhance the feasibility of the managed retreat operations that will be implemented on this coast in the next years. A total of 700 surveys were collected and several original results can be drawn: the population has a good knowledge of erosion in the area where they live, and this knowledge is key because the territory is vulnerable. Similarly, the respondents have a good knowledge of protection measures, but some are more important than others: for example, the reinforcement of coastal defenses is the most commonly cited strategy to deal with coastal hazards whereas relocation is the second-most-known but least-popular scenario. Several factors influence people's perception of risk: for example, time spent in the residence and age of residents are two elements contributing to place attachment that must be taken into account before starting to implement any cli-mate adaptation policies.","[Chadenas, C.; Robin, M.] Univ Nantes, CNRS, UMR 6554, Littoral,Environm,Teledetect,Geomat, Nantes, France; [Chotard, M.; Kerguillec, R.; Juigner, M.] Univ Nantes, Observ Reg Risques Cotiers Pays Loire, CNRS, UMS 3281,Soutien OSUNA, Nantes, France; [Navarro, O.] Univ Nantes, Lab Psychol Pays Loire, EA 4638, Nantes, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Nantes Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Nantes Universite; Nantes Universite,"Chotard, M (corresponding author), Univ Nantes, Observ Reg Risques Cotiers Pays Loire, CNRS, UMS 3281,Soutien OSUNA, Nantes, France.",manon.chotard@univ-nantes.fr,"Navarro, Oscar/S-2008-2017","Navarro, Oscar/0000-0002-4225-1962",OR2C,OR2C,"This article's authors gratefully acknowledge the students of IGARUN's Master 2 GAEM(class of 2019/20), who carried out the surveys as part of a workshop in December 2019; C.

To shift society in these directions we need to quantify impacts in relation to these objectives and develop cost-effective interventions. Techniques for quantifying greenhouse gas emissions are relatively well established and enable identification of hotspots where there is emissions reduction potential. However, there are no established techniques to assess and quantify adaptation vulnerability issues and identify hotspots for intervention. This paper presents work undertaken at a European level with the objective of identifying potential hotspots where ecosystem services may be vulnerable to climate change and thus where intervention may be required under the European Rural Development Programme. A pragmatic and relatively simple approach is presented, based on data that is readily available across Europe. The vulnerability assessments cover: Water (quality: dilution and filtration, regulation: flooding and provision); soils (erosion and organic matter); and biodiversity (forest fires, migration and pollination). The framework and assessments presented are considered fit for purpose (at a basic level) and they are potentially valuable tools for targeting limited resources to achieve desirable outcomes. They also contribute towards providing a better understanding of the climate change challenges we face and support the formulation of solutions to optimally address those challenges. There is scope to further improvement and a number of options are discussed and explored within this paper.","[Tzilivakis, John; Warner, D. J.; Green, A.; Lewis, K.

The 2019 Midwest floods led to major flooding at every monitoring site along the Mississippi River, set record water levels at 42 sites, and resulted in an estimated $6.2 billion in infrastructure damage and recovery costs. Although the risks associated with increasing flooding in the Midwestern US have been well recognized, less is known about the adaptation challenges and opportunities in the region, particularly in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. This exploratory study examined stakeholder perspectives on river system management, flood risk reduction, and adaptation planning in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. We conducted in-depth interviews with flood management stakeholders between August and October 2019. Interview data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Five themes emerged from the interviews: (1) River flooding in the Midwestern US is a different experience than US coastal flooding; (2) River flooding in the Midwestern US is a regional experience that requires a regional response; (3) Local actors face constrained resources for flood risk protection and recovery; (4) Differentiated responsibility across levels of governments makes recovery and response difficult to navigate; and (5) Competing stakeholder goals challenge cooperative flood hazard management. Overall, these results suggest that locally focused adaptation efforts, while perhaps appropriate for coastal communities or more urban contexts, are suboptimal strategies for communities in the flood-prone river basins of the Midwestern US. Instead, structures and support for regional collaboration should be considered and pursued.","[Reed, Tamsen; Ekenga, Christine C.] Washington Univ, Brown Sch, Campus Box 1196,1 Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Reed, Tamsen] Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Mason, Lisa Reyes] Univ Denver, Grad Sch Social Work, Denver, CO USA",Washington University (WUSTL); University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of Denver,"Ekenga, CC (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Brown Sch, Campus Box 1196,1 Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",ekengac@wustl.edu,,,,,,,62,4,4,3,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1178-6302,,,ENVIRON HEALTH INSIG,Environ.

Land use-land cover and rainfall are two factors affecting soil erosion. This study estimated the spatial variation of soil erosion in the Nalanda Oya catchment in Sri Lanka using Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model supported with a GIS. The study assesses the changes in erosion with time in relation to the changes of land use-land cover and climate change impacted rainfall. The findings of the study would help on the land management to minimize erosion potential under changing climate. The mean annual soil loss value of the catchment is 2.99 t ha(-1) yr(-1), and the expected changes in land use-land cover and projected rainfall could increase the mean annual soil loss in 2030's to be 3.43 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and 3.66 t ha(-1) yr(-1) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively. The results highlighted that about 18.78% of the catchment is under moderate to high (> 5 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) erosion risk which may increase to about 20.83% to 21.58% in 2030s, for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. About 32% of the land area would show an increase in soil erosion mostly due to the climate change impacted changes in rainfall. Improving the land use to mitigate the increase in potential erosion may require reforestation and conservation practices, as a climate adaptation measure to protect sensitive ecosystems and ensure continued ecosystem services.","[de Silva, S.

Thus, the spatial prioritization of Green Infrastructure (GI) is of great importance for ecosystem conservation and climate adaptation. The existing GI prioritization methods in deltaic regions lack a systematic method of incorporating the state of vulnerability and risk. In this study, a novel method was developed for systematically prioritizing GI management zones based on the biodiversity and ecosystem services that addresses the clear relevance to multi-hazard risk to the social-ecological system (SES). The approach was demonstrated in the Yangtze River Delta, China. The multi-hazard risk to the SES in the county-level administrative regions was evaluated based on the Global Delta Risk Index (GDRI). The outputs were then transferred into a critical cost factor in a combined spatial prioritization of the biodiversity and ecosystem services using the Marxan with Zones software to determine the spatial priorities of multiple management zones (the core zone, conservation zone, and sustainable use zone). Two comparative scenarios were run to illustrate how the inclusion of the multi-hazard risk can affect the spatial prioritization of GI. Based on our results, integrating the multi hazard risk of the SES can effectively coordinate the configuration of GI management zones. This supports our conclusion that the risk to the SES should always be considered during future GI prioritization to ensure the GI network s resilience to multiple climatic changes. Our proposed framework will help guide future applications of GI in global deltas and the implementation of flexible conservation management in a multi-hazard context.","[Ou, Xiaoyang; Lyu, Yingshuo; Liu, Yang; Zheng, Xi; Li, Fangzheng] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Landscape Architecture, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",Beijing Forestry University,"Zheng, X; Li, FZ (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Landscape Architecture, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",zhengxi@bjfu.edu.cn; fangzhengli@bjfu.edu.cn,,"Ou, Xiaoyang/0000-0003-4875-2669",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFD11004021],National Key Research and Development Program of China,This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (NO. 2019YFD11004021).

The comprehensive land use planning process is traditionally been considered as a neutral undertaking. The policy statement in the Philippine Climate Change Act of 2009 presented a noteworthy research opportunity to carefully understand how a comprehensive land use plan can be made gender-sensitive to increase the climate-risk resiliency of the local government units especially since the existing frameworks for gender mainstreaming did not comprehensively consider climate change and its gender dimensions. To explore how climate change, women concerns, and participation can be mainstreamed in the comprehensive land use planning process, this study used the Municipality of Cabiao, Province of Nueva Ecija as a case study. The dynamics of the current process and planning environment in the Municipality of Cabiao were assessed and the various entry points in the process wherein flooding in the context of climate change and gender concerns can be mainstreamed were identified. In the study's illustration of the impacts of flooding on the local community, it was confirmed that women are made more vulnerable to the impacts of flooding due to the roles that they perform which are intimately related to the natural environment. Likewise, their access to and control over important resources have made them more vulnerable to climate change. The comprehensive land use plan is expected to remedy the adverse impacts of flooding in the locality. As such, the study recommended that several reforms be made in both the process and the document. The comprehensive land use plan should reduce, if not totally eliminate, the adverse effects of flooding to the natural environment as the disruptions in the latter affect existing roles that are performed by women. These disruptions are what make women vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.","Univ Philippines, Natl Coll Publ Adm & Governance, Quezon City 1101, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman,"Gamboa, MAM (corresponding author), Univ Philippines, Natl Coll Publ Adm & Governance, Room 303B,RP Guzman St, Quezon City 1101, Philippines.",mmgamboa@up.edu.ph,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,9,ASIA LIFE SCIENCES,"LOS BANOS, COLLEGE","C/O DR.

Though the country has engaged in the restoration of village tanks for nearly 170 years, only around 50% of the ancient tanks amounting to around 16,000 are restored and in working condition. Hence, this study aims to identify a strategy for restoring the abandoned tanks in the country towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals. The study reviewed the evolution of policies and approaches adopted in developing village tanks and identified conceptual and technical drawbacks in the existing normative assessment approach. New conceptual and decision-making frameworks were developed, incorporating design-level strategic considerations identified while following a multidimensional and transdisciplinary approach.

By using state and district level data on weather variables (viz., temperature and rainfall) and growth rate of per-capita real GDP, the study evaluates the short-run as well as medium-run effects of changing weather on the growth. We use a fixed-effects model on state- and district-panel data sets spanning across several decades. The results based on the state-level analysis are suggestive of negative effects of the increasing temperature on the growth during 1980-2019. These aggregate results are further reinforced by the results from the district-level analysis. We find that higher temperatures have a significant negative impact on poorer districts, with a 1 degrees C increase in temperature leading to a nearly 4.7% fall in the growth rate of district per-capita income. Moreover, higher temperatures not only have level effects but also have growth effects, especially for richer districts. Further, to propound tangible climate adaptation policy discussion, we use some developmental characteristics like credit access, electrification, urbanisation, and improved roads and market network in our analysis. The results suggest that such developmental characteristics may play a significant role in mitigating the negative impacts of climate change.","[Sandhani, Medhavi] Council Energy Environm & Water, New Delhi, India; [Pattanayak, Anubhab] Indian Inst Technol, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Kumar, K.

Several sites were visited across the English city of Bath during 2015 and 2016. Tick presence was confirmed in all habitats sur-veyed, with increased likelihood in woodland and woodland edge. Highest nymph densities were also reported in these habitats, along with grassland during one of the sampling years. Adult ticks were more likely to be infected compared to nymphs, and the highest densities of infected nymphs were associated with woodland edge habitat. In addition to Lyme borreliosis causing Borrelia genospecies, Borrelia miyamotoi was also detected at several sites. This study adds to the growing evidence that urban green space habitats present a public health risk from tick bites, and this has implications for many policy areas including health and wellbeing, climate adaptation and urban green space planning.","[Hansford, Kayleigh M.; Medlock, Jolyon M.] Publ Hlth England, Med Entomol & Zoonoses Ecol, Emergency Response Dept Sci & Technol, Porton Down, England; [Hansford, Kayleigh M.; Wheeler, Benedict W.] Univ Exeter, European Ctr Environm & Human Hlth, Med Sch, Truro, England; [Hansford, Kayleigh M.; Wheeler, Benedict W.; Medlock, Jolyon M.] Publ Hlth England, Hlth Protect Res Unit Environm Change & Hlth, Porton Down, England; [Tshirren, Barbara] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn, England; [Medlock, Jolyon M.] Publ Hlth England, Hlth Protect Res Unit Emerging & Zoonot Infect, Porton Down, England",Public Health England; University of Exeter; Public Health England; University of Exeter; Public Health England,"Hansford, KM (corresponding author), Publ Hlth England, Med Entomol & Zoonoses Ecol, Emergency Response Dept Sci & Technol, Porton Down, England.",kayleigh.hansford@phe.gov.uk,"Wheeler, Benedict/G-1711-2012; Tschirren, Barbara/F-8202-2011","Wheeler, Benedict/0000-0001-9404-5936; Tschirren, Barbara/0000-0003-4806-4102",Bath and North East Somerset Council; National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Environmental Change and Health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Public Health England (PHE); University of Exeter; University College London; Met Office; NIHR HPRU in Emerging Infections and Zoonoses at the University of Liverpool; PHE; Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine,Bath and North East Somerset Council; National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Environmental Change and Health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Public Health England (PHE); University of Exeter; University College London(General Electric); Met Office; NIHR HPRU in Emerging Infections and Zoonoses at the University of Liverpool; PHE; Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine,"This work was a collaborative project between Public Health England and the University of Exeter and was completed as part of PhD studies by the lead author.

Notwithstanding the fact that the behavior of transmission lines under strong winds has been investigated in numerous studies, wind-induced failures of TLs are still common worldwide, which are mainly due to the lack of accurate understanding of the tremendous variability in wind speed. The main goal of this paper is to extend the concept of nonlinear dynamic analysis to identify and characterize the dynamic structures hidden in wind speed fluctuation, which are responsible for generating the variability in wind speed. Two well-established nonlinear dynamic analysis techniques, namely, recurrence plot and recurrence quantification analysis, are applied to diagnose the underlying dynamic characteristics. The results indicate that wind speed time series, regardless of the type of wind event, are likely to exhibit chaotic behavior. Often, the dynamics associated with monsoons are more complex than those for tropical cyclone and thunderstorm winds. Moreover, site-to-site variability in wind speed dynamics is also apparent, which is due mainly to the terrain-enhanced effect. The outcomes of this study are expected to provide a new avenue to aid the wind-resistant design of TL systems, and to accelerate the advancement in wind load design codes and climate-adapted decision-making procedures.","[Shu, Z.

These foreign workers are facing issues not only regarding construction demanding tasks but also facing social and climate adaptions. This review paper compiles previous research works related to construction workers issues which were carried out worldwide including Saudi Arabia. It able to extract 63 issues from worldwide studies and narrowed it to 45 issues for Saudi Arabia situation. With the issues from Saudi Arabia, it was clustered into 2 main categories which are technical and non-technical related issues. In technical category, 15 issues were assigned to 4 groups while for non-technical category, 30 issues were assigned to 7 groups. Based on frequency analysis, the 3 most frequent construction workers' issues from worldwide studies are shortage of skilled labours, low productivity level and lack of experience. While from Saudi Arabia studies the 3 most frequent construction workers' issues for both technical and non-technical groups are shortage of skilled labours, low productivity level, unqualified workforce and personal conflicts among labours, absenteeism of labours, discrimination based on nationality respectively. These preliminary findings serve as a basis for further investigation related to construction workers issues in the construction industry of Saudi Arabia.","[Rahman, Ismail Abdul] Univ Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn & Built Environm, Dept Bldg & Construct Engn, Batu Pahat 86400, Johor, Malaysia; [Al-Emad, Nashwan] Absal Paul Contracting Co, Prince Muhammad Ibn Saad Ibn Abdulaziz Rd, Riyadh 13515, Saudi Arabia",University of Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia,"Al-Emad, N (corresponding author), Absal Paul Contracting Co, Prince Muhammad Ibn Saad Ibn Abdulaziz Rd, Riyadh 13515, Saudi Arabia.",df080116@gmail.com,", PROF.

Many empirical models (EMs) and machine learning (ML) methods have been proposed for DYB models. However, the number of their comparative studies based on diverse climates is limited. In this study, a grand total of 14 DYB models are established to estimate daily global solar radiation based on measured data from 1994 to 2015 at 35 meteorological stations in six climate zones of China. Detailed tasks are as follows: (1) Seven EMs and seven ML models are trained for solar radiation estimation. (2) A new EM and two novel ML models are proposed, i.e. hybrid 3rd order polynomial and sine wave model, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) optimized by chaotic firefly algorithm (CFA) and ANFIS optimized by whale optimization algorithm with simulated annealing and roulette wheel selection (WOASAR). (3) Four statistical indicators are utilized to compare those models, and the best model for each station is decided. (4) We discuss the model parameters and climate variances of six specific stations in different climate zones. The comparison results demonstrate superb estimation precision and climate adaptability of the newly proposed models. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Permafrost also has wide-ranging effects on other features of the Arctic environment including geomorphology, biogeochemical fluxes, tundra plant and animal ecology, and the functioning of lake, river, and coastal marine ecosystems. This review presents an Earth system perspective on permafrost landscapes as an approach towards integration across disciplines. The permafrost system can be described by a three-layer conceptual model, with an upper buffer layer that contains vegetation or infrastructure. Snow and liquid water strongly affect the thermal properties and stability of these layers and their associated interfaces, resulting in critical times and places for accelerated degradation of permafrost and for exchanges of mass and heat with the hydrosphere and atmosphere. Northern permafrost landscapes are now in rapid transition as a result of climate warming and socioeconomic development, which is affecting their ability to provide geosystem and ecosystem services. The Earth system approach provides a framework for identifying linkages, thresholds, and feedbacks among system components, including human systems, and for the development of management strategies to cope with permafrost change.","[Vincent, Warwick F.] Univ Laval, Takuvik Joint Int Lab, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Vincent, Warwick F.; Lemay, Mickael; Allard, Michel] Univ Laval, CEN, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Allard, Michel] Univ Laval, Takuvik Joint Int Lab, Dept Geog, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",Laval University; Laval University; Laval University,"Vincent, WF (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Takuvik Joint Int Lab, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.;Vincent, WF (corresponding author), Univ Laval, CEN, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",warwick.vincent@fsg.ulaval.ca,"Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019","Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938",Discovery Frontiers program of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council (NSERC) of Canada; ArcticNet; Centre d'etudes nordiques (CEN); Universite Laval; Canada Research Chair program; Fonds de recherche du Quebec - nature et technologies (FRQNT); Polar Continental Shelf Program (PCSP); Takuvik Joint International Laboratory,Discovery Frontiers program of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council (NSERC) of Canada; ArcticNet; Centre d'etudes nordiques (CEN); Universite Laval; Canada Research Chair program(Canada Research Chairs); Fonds de recherche du Quebec - nature et technologies (FRQNT); Polar Continental Shelf Program (PCSP)(Natural Resources Canada); Takuvik Joint International Laboratory,"We thank all members of the ADAPT project, funded by the Discovery Frontiers program of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council (NSERC) of Canada, with additional support from ArcticNet, Centre d'etudes nordiques (CEN), Universite Laval, the Canada Research Chair program, the Fonds de recherche du Quebec - nature et technologies (FRQNT), Polar Continental Shelf Program (PCSP), and the Takuvik Joint International Laboratory.

This paper presents an investigation of carbonation-induced deterioration in three typical Chinese cities (Kunming, Xiamen and Jinan) under a changing climate. The changing trends of atmospheric CO2, local temperature and RH of typical Chinese cities are projected based on the latest CO2 emission scenarios. The time-dependent analysis is based on Monte Carlo simulation, and includes the uncertainty of climate projections, deterioration processes, material properties, dimensions and accuracy of predictive models. Deterioration of RC structures is represented by the probabilities of reinforcement corrosion initiation and damage. It was found that the mean carbonation depths by 2100 may increase by up to 45% for RC structures in China due to a changing climate. It was also found that climate change can cause an additional 7-20% of carbonation-induced damage by 2100 for RC buildings in temperate or cold climate areas in China. The findings provide a basis for the development of climate adaptation strategies through the improved design of concrete structures.","[Peng, Lizhengli; Stewart, Mark G.] Univ Newcastle, Ctr Infrastruct Performance & Reliabil, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Peng, LZL (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Ctr Infrastruct Performance & Reliabil, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",lizhengli.peng@uon.edu.au; mark.stewart@newcastle.edu.au,,"Stewart, Mark/0000-0001-6887-6533",,,,,72,45,46,5,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1573-2479,1744-8980,,STRUCT INFRASTRUCT E,Struct.

A maximum entropy (MaxEnt) ecological model was implemented to predict spatial distribution and incidence rate of scrub typhus using spatial data sets on environmental and social variables. Additionally, relationships between the incidence of scrub typhus and critical spatial data were analyzed. Elevation and temperature were analyzed as dominant spatial factors which influenced the growth environment of Leptotrombidium scutellare (L. scutellare) which is the primary vector of scrub typhus. A temporal number of diseases by scrub typhus was predicted by a deep neural network (DNN). The model considered the time-lagged effect of scrub typhus. The DNN-based prediction model showed that temperature, precipitation, and humidity in summer had significant influence factors on the activity of L. scutellare and the number of diseases at fall. Moreover, the DNN-based prediction model had superior performance compared to a conventional statistical prediction model. Finally, the spatial and temporal models were used under climate change scenario. The future characteristics of scrub typhus showed that the maximum incidence rate would increase by 8%, areas of the high potential of incidence rate would increase by 9%, and disease occurrence duration would expand by 2 months. The results would contribute to the disease management and prediction for the health of residents in terms of public health.","[Kim, SangYoun; Nam, KiJeon; Heo, SungKu; Lee, SunJung; Choi, JiHun; Park, JunKyu; Yoo, ChangKyoo] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, 1732 Deogyeong Daero, Yongin 17104, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Yoo, C (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, 1732 Deogyeong Daero, Yongin 17104, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",ckyoo@khu.ac.kr,,"Heo, Sungku/0000-0002-8972-7470; Yoo, ChangKyoo/0000-0002-9406-7649",,,,,30,1,1,2,6,KOREAN INSTITUTE CHEMICAL  ENGINEERS,SEOUL,"F.5, 119, ANAM-RO, SEONGBUK-GU, SEOUL 136-075, SOUTH KOREA",0304-128X,2233-9558,,KOREAN CHEM ENG RES,Korean Chem.

Strong relationships are found between peripherality and both community size and the dependency ratio (percent of young/old dependents), as well as traditional medicine usage (and percent traditional healers), and autonomous community coping after disasters. Two measures are calculated to capture community autonomy, both of which proxy peripherality. Results show the usefulness of peripherality as a way of measuring community diversity in developing-country contexts. Peripherality also correlates with community autonomy, more-peripheral communities having greater autonomous coping abilities/capacity than near-core (less-peripheral) communities. Results also show the unhelpfulness of the default 'one-size-fits-all' approach to communities implicit in many external assistance programs. Yet while traditional coping in such communities may not be able to fully overcome future climate-change challenges, the conservation of the traditional knowledge underpinning this should be encouraged, mainly because of the likelihood that external funding for future adaptation in such communities will be inadequate. The best hope for effective and sustainable adaptation to future climate change, focused on sustaining livelihoods, lies in strengthening autonomous community coping.","[Korovulavula, Isoa; Fong, Teddy] Univ South Pacifoc, Inst Appl Sci, Suva, Fiji; [Nunn, Patrick D.; Kumar, Roselyn] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Social Sci, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia",University of the Sunshine Coast,"Nunn, PD (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Social Sci, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia.",pnunn@usc.edu.au,"Nunn, Patrick D./C-7864-2011; Nunn, Patrick/ABA-2943-2021","Nunn, Patrick D./0000-0001-9295-5741; Nunn, Patrick/0000-0001-9295-5741; Kumar, Roselyn/0000-0002-3940-0488",Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research [CRRP2015-FP02],Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research,This work was supported by Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research: [Grant Number CRRP2015-FP02].,,54,13,13,0,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

This study involves the sweet cherry (Prunus avium) cultivar 'Burlat' grafted on the 'Mariana 2624', 'Adara' and 'LC 52' rootstocks. In a climate chamber at two CO2 concentrations, ambient (400 mu mol mol(-1)) and elevated (800 mu mol mol(-1)), the plants were submitted to waterlogging for 7 d, followed by 7 d of recovery after drainage. Waterlogging drastically decreased the rate of photosynthesis, significantly endangering plant survival, particularly for the 'LC 52' and 'Adara' rootstocks. 'Mariana 2624' was also clearly affected by waterlogging that increased lipid peroxidation and the Cl- and SO42- concentrations in all the studied plants. Nevertheless, CO2 was able to overcome this reduction in photosynthesis, augmenting growth, increasing soluble sugars and starch, raising turgor and regulating the concentrations of Cl- and SO42-, while lowering the NO3- concentration in leaves of all the studied rootstocks. In concordance with these results, the proline levels indicated a more intense stress at control CO2 than at high CO2 for waterlogged plants. 'Mariana 2624' was more resistant to waterlogging than 'Adara', and both were more resistant than 'LC 52' in control CO2 conditions; this clearly enhanced the chance of survival under hypoxia.","[Perez-Jimenez, Margarita; Hernandez-Munuera, Maria; Carmen Pinero, M.; Lopez-Ortega, Gregorio; del Amor, Francisco M.] Inst Murciano Invest & Desarrollo Agr & Alimentar, Dept Hortofruticultura, Murcia 30150, Spain",,"Perez-Jimenez, M (corresponding author), Inst Murciano Invest & Desarrollo Agr & Alimentar, Dept Hortofruticultura, Murcia 30150, Spain.",margarita.perez3@carm.es,"del Amor, Francisco M/A-4806-2009; Zapata, Maria Carmen Piñero/AAS-6264-2020; Jiménez, Margarita Pérez/G-6546-2018","del Amor, Francisco M/0000-0002-2459-2472; Zapata, Maria Carmen Piñero/0000-0002-8551-5067; Jiménez, Margarita Pérez/0000-0003-1005-3280",European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) - Region de Murcia [FEDER 1420-07],European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) - Region de Murcia,"The authors sincerely acknowledge Dr Bruce Schaffer from the University of Florida, for his kindness in solving our doubts over the experiment procedure, Jose Garcia Gil, Rafael Perez Alba and Javier Alfaro Alvarez, for technical support, and Dr David J.

This explanation however, does not fit the scarcity of data for predomestication cultivation in the Natufian Period. The resilience of Younger Dryas foragers is better illustrated by a concept of adaptive cycles within a theory of adaptive change (resilience theory). Such cycles consist of four phases: release/collapse (Omega); reorganization (alpha), when the system restructures itself after a catastrophic stimulus through innovation and social memory-a period of greater resilience and less vulnerability; exploitation (r); and conservation (K), representing an increasingly rigid system that loses flexibility to change. The Kebarans and Late Natufians had similar responses to cold and dry conditions vs. Early Natufians and the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A responses to warm and wet climates. Kebarans and Late Natufians (alpha-phase) shifted to a broader-based diet and increased their mobility. Early Natufian and Pre-Pottery Neolithic A populations (r- and K-phases) had a growing investment in more narrowly focused, high-yield plant resources, but they maintained the broad range of hunted animals because of increased sedentism. These human adaptive cycles interlocked with plant and animal cycles. Forest and grassland vegetation responded to late Pleistocene and early Holocene climatic fluctuations, but prey animal cycles reflected the impact of human hunting pressure. The combination of these three adaptive cycles results in a model of human adaptation, showing potential for great sustainability of Levantine foraging systems even under adverse climatic conditions.","[Rosen, Arlene M.; Rivera-Collazo, Isabel] UCL, Inst Archaeol, London WC1H 0PY, England; [Rivera-Collazo, Isabel] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Rio Piedras, PR 00931 USA",University of London; University College London; University of Puerto Rico; University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras,"Rosen, AM (corresponding author), UCL, Inst Archaeol, Mortimer St, London WC1H 0PY, England.",a.rosen@ucl.ac.uk,"Rivera-Collazo, Isabel C./O-7808-2019","Rivera-Collazo, Isabel C./0000-0002-6857-2318",,,,,57,101,104,1,73,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

In this paper we quantify water budget components and storage changes for two of the largest watersheds in the State of Michigan, USA (the Grand River and the Saginaw Bay watersheds) using remotely sensed data and a process-based hydrologic model (PAWS) that includes detailed representations of subsurface and land surface processes. Model performance is evaluated using ground-based observations (streamflows, groundwater heads, soil moisture, and soil temperature) as well as satellite-based estimates of evapotranspiration (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS) and watershed storage changes (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, GRACE). We use the model to compute annual-average fluxes due to evapotranspiration, surface runoff, recharge and groundwater contribution to streams and analyze the impacts of land use and land cover (LULC) and soil types on annual hydrologic budgets using correlation analysis. Watershed storage changes based on GRACE data and model results showed similar patterns. Storage was dominated by subsurface components and showed an increasing trend over the past decade. This work provides new estimates of water budgets and storage changes in Great Lakes watersheds and the results are expected to aid in the analysis and interpretation of the current trend of declining lake levels, in understanding projected future impacts of climate change as well as in identifying appropriate climate adaptation strategies.","[Niu, Jie; Li, Shu-Guang; Phanikumar, Mantha S.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Niu, Jie] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Earth Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shen, Chaopeng] Penn State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Michigan State University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Niu, J (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",jniu@lbl.gov,"Phanikumar, Mantha S/A-2523-2008","Shen, Chaopeng/0000-0002-0685-1901",NOAA [3002283555],NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"This research was funded by a NOAA grant to the last author (award 3002283555).

The typology of terminal phloem was verified. The monotypy of plant taxa up to the family level was confirmed. For orders and subclasses, the wide distribution of structural parallelisms was demonstrated. The lists of plant families with similar structures of the phloem terminals was elaborated. As a result of comparative analysis of these lists and paleobotanic data on the age of plant families, the specificity of the types of terminal phloem and the associated morphological and functional characteristics of the groups of families of the same evolutionary, age were revealed. Ancestral type prevails among the families belonging to Prodicots, which were emerged during Cretaceous. Symplastic type is characteristic to the families of Eudicots and biomes appeared in Paleogene, while the apoplastic type is characteristic to the families and biomes of Neogene. For each group to taxa, plant stem and root parasitism is characteristic for the crown taxa completing the structural sequences of trees and herbs. All these data allow discussion of the questions of climatic adaptogenesis of the character complex studied here, the impossibility of structural iterations in morphological evolution, and the reasons of similarities and differences in the evolutionary and contemporary zonal series of the terminal phloem in Dicots.","[Gamalei, Yu.

In Drosophila melanogaster, Wolbachia frequencies vary clinally in frequency in Australia and may confound climatic adaptation. Here we use field cages in a reciprocal exchange design to test for Wolbachia effects in D. melanogaster in winter at temperate and tropical sites. Infected flies of both populations had a lower fecundity in tropical north Queensland, whilst in temperate southern Victoria Wolbachia effects depended on the nuclear population background. Here infected flies from Victoria were more fecund. Wolbachia also influenced larval/pupal viability in the tropics but this was dependent on population background. In comparisons of the populations, there was no evidence for local adaptation for total fecundity, viability or survival over winter. However, in Victoria, a local population had a higher late-life fecundity than a tropical population from Queensland that had higher early-life fecundity. At a tropical site, local Queensland flies had a higher early fecundity than Victorian flies. In contrast to many laboratory studies, mortality rates in the field cages increased only slightly over time. Both the Wolbachia effects and population differences have not been previously detected in laboratory studies with D. melanogaster and highlight the utility of Drosophila field studies in fitness experiments.","La Trobe Univ, Ctr Environm Stress & Adaptat Res, Bundoora, Vic 3083, Australia",La Trobe University,"Hoffmann, AA (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Ctr Environm Stress & Adaptat Res, Bundoora, Vic 3083, Australia.",,"Hoffmann, Ary/C-2961-2011; Hoffmann, Ary/R-2972-2019","Hoffmann, Ary/0000-0001-9497-7645",,,,,22,61,60,0,14,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0018-067X,,,HEREDITY,Heredity,JUN,2001,86,,6,,,,731,737,,10.1046/j.1365-2540.2001.t01-1-00892.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2540.2001.t01-1-00892.x,,,7,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,478WD,11595053,Bronze,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000171370300010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Considering central critical paths, psychological assets (PsyA) entail mediational factors into the sustainable livelihoods index. The findings show that the essential support of the livelihood of farmers' social, cultural, economic, and human assets positively impacts sustainable livelihoods, though physical and natural assets depict a nonsignificant impact on SLI. However, human and financial assets show comparatively substantial effects on smallholders' adaptation strategies; consequently, physical, social, and natural assets reveal significant impacts on farmers' livelihoods. The study further indicates that PsyA can, directly and indirectly, boost the human and physical assets and exploit the farmers' sustainable livelihoods index successfully.

These options involve restoring an oyster reef bar that would act as a natural breakwater versus an impermeable revetment. The results of an on-site survey of users of the amenity and a negative binomial travel cost model demonstrate that the coastal trail has considerable recreational use value to local communities. In terms of a cost benefit analysis it was found that both protection options resulted in a positive net benefit over a 20 year time horizon but the nature based solution had a benefit cost ratio multiple times larger than the grey infrastructure alternative. The conclusions of the analysis remain valid under sensitivity analysis. The results suggest a compelling case for embedding nature based solutions in climate adaption and flood management planning for low lying coastal areas where recreational resources are under threat as it can be not only more cost effective but may also offer other ecosystem benefits to coastal communities.","[Hynes, Stephen; Burger, Ryan; Tudella, Joao; Norton, Daniel] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Whitaker Inst, Socioecon Marine Res Unit, Galway, Ireland; [Chen, Wenting] Norwegian Inst Water Res NIVA, Oslo, Norway",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA),"Hynes, S (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Whitaker Inst, Socioecon Marine Res Unit, Galway, Ireland.",stephen.hynes@nuigalway.ie,,,European Union [689518]; MERCES (Marine Ecosystem Restoration in Changing European Seas),European Union(European Commission); MERCES (Marine Ecosystem Restoration in Changing European Seas),"This study has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 689518, project MERCES (Marine Ecosystem Restoration in Changing European Seas) .",,69,3,3,12,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We apply a climate risk analysis across the European fisheries sector to identify the most at-risk fishing fleets and coastal regions and then link the two analyses together. We employ an approach combining biological traits with physiological metrics to differentiate climate hazards between 556 populations of fish and use these to assess the relative climate risk for 380 fishing fleets and 105 coastal regions in Europe. Countries in southeast Europe as well as the United Kingdom have the highest risks to both fishing fleets and coastal regions overall, while in other countries, the risk-profile is greater at either the fleet level or at the regional level. European fisheries face a diversity of challenges posed by climate change; climate adaptation, therefore, needs to be tailored to each country, region, and fleet's specific situation.

We investigated the relationship between adaptation and child nutrition, in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) during an extreme drought. Households varied in both adaptation behavior and household resources and we found that, overall, households that adapted had better child nutrition than those that didn't adapt. When controlling for the influence of household capital, we found that more vulnerable households, those with greater dependence on natural resources and lower income, had a stronger positive relationship between adaptation and nutrition than less vulnerable households. We also found that some adaptations had stronger positive relationships with nutrition than others. In our system, the adaptation that most strongly correlated with improved nutrition, selling chickens, most likely benefits from local social networks and consistent demand, and performed better than other adaptations.

However, the IPCC has faced criticism for its different organizational and functional biases which include a geographical bias favoring experts from the global north, a gender bias in favor of men, a disciplinary bias in favor of the natural sciences over the social sciences and humanities, and finally, a cosmological bias favoring western science over indigenous knowledges. In recent years, scholars have noted changes in the IPCC, pointing at the inclusion of social science/humanities perspectives and a growing engagement with plural worldviews. Despite such forays, all aspects of knowledge production within the IPCC still echo the aspirations of nation states and quantitative models of attribution and detection. Climate knowledge production in the Himalayan region reflects this reality. In this essay, we focus on our personal experiences with local communities from the Himalayas and bring it in dialogue with our experiences with the IPCC knowledge production process. In doing so, we have two objectives: first, to highlight marginalized stories of climate-society relationships that challenge normative climate science/policy and, second, in light of these stories, suggest some salient considerations required to foreground justice and equity in futureengagements with the IPCC, which explores the production of democratic knowledge and how such knowledge can be wielded to achieve regional climate justice.","[Chakraborty, Ritodhi] Lincoln Univ, Fac Agr & Life Sci, Ctr Excellence DFPL, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand; [Sherpa, Pasang Yangjee] Pacific Lutheran Univ, 12180 Pk Ave S, Tacoma, WA 98447 USA",Lincoln University - New Zealand; Pacific Lutheran University,"Chakraborty, R (corresponding author), Lincoln Univ, Fac Agr & Life Sci, Ctr Excellence DFPL, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand.",Ritodhi.chakraborty@lincoln.ac.nz,,"Chakraborty, Ritodhi/0000-0001-6714-3741",,,,,70,8,8,4,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The performance of each model type was parallelly assessed using the partial least square regression (PLSR) and random forest regression (RFR) methods. Our results revealed that Type-2 models exhibited higher interpretation power (PLSR:55.604-55.887% and RFR:53.841-55.739%) than Type-1 models (PLSR:47.531-47.591% and RFR: 47.111-50.300%) for explaining the variance in parcel-level intra-SUHIIs. This finding indicated the non negligible importance of potential interactions of the factors in determining the models' interpretation power.

Urbanisation, however, is interlaced with existential challenges such as climate change. The National Government has developed an overabundance of national plans to foster sustainable economic development, which has led to a plethora of acts that place many statutory requirements on municipalities. This article contains a critical review of these national plans, the statutory requirements, and the resultant planning frameworks and instruments. The main findings are that many national plans did not make adequate progress and that acts and planning instruments do not require policy interventions or long-term visions to be tested before being implemented. This might contribute to fragmentation, poor coordination, and neglecting the impact of climate change. Case studies based on simulation models being used locally as decision-support tools are presented before a case is made for the use of Integrated Land Use and Transport models to test policy interventions that include urban and climate planning. An enhanced simulation-optimisation framework is proposed to allow planners to determine the best means to achieve specific targets. This framework is useful as many government departments know `what' they wish to achieve, but often struggle to determine `how' to achieve these targets, let alone whether they are even achievable.","[van Heerden, Quintin] CSIR, Smart Places, Urban & Reg Dynam, POB 395, Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa; [van Heerden, Quintin] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Stellenbosch Unit Operat Res Engn, Private Box X1, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, Western Cape, South Africa; [van Vuuren, Jan] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Stellenbosch Unit Operat Res Engn, Operat Res, Private Box X1, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, Western Cape, South Africa",Council for Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - South Africa; Stellenbosch University; Stellenbosch University,"van Heerden, Q (corresponding author), CSIR, Smart Places, Urban & Reg Dynam, POB 395, Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa.;van Heerden, Q (corresponding author), Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Stellenbosch Unit Operat Res Engn, Private Box X1, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, Western Cape, South Africa.",QvHeerden@csir.co.za; 23507705@sun.ac.za,,,,,,,71,0,0,0,0,"UNIV FREE STATE, DEPT TOWN & REGIONAL PLANNING",BLOEMFONTEIN,"PO BOX 339, BLOEMFONTEIN, 9300, SOUTH AFRICA",1012-280X,2415-0495,,TOWN REG PLAN,Town Reg.

Cropping intensities and crop yields are low and unstable in these areas due to unpredictable patterns of rainfall, a host of biotic and abiotic stresses and adherence to traditional farm practices. This precarious food security situation is especially dangerous in the central Indian tribal belt (also known as the poverty belt) which is a typical rainfed area dominated by tribal communities. More than 90% of the tribal people are totally dependent on agriculture and produce much of what they eat. Small land holdings and their low productivity, along with uncertainties in rainfall patterns, increases economic and social risks for these farmers. With degraded soils and unreliable weather patterns, return on investment is uncertain and likely to be much lower overall than under irrigated conditions with better soils. Under such conditions, one approach to achieve improved crop production is to minimize soil and other natural resource degradation by adopting a set of crop-nutrient-water-land system management practices, such as conservation agriculture (CA). To assess the effect of introduced technology under local ecological and socio-economic conditions, the study focused on two ecosystem services: a) provisional, and b) regulatory through five treatments consisting of farmers' traditional practice (FP) which was conventional tillage with broadcast of local variety maize (Zea mays L); and four CA treatments viz., conventional tillage with sole cropped maize using line sowing of the improved maize cultivar 'Nilesh' (CT-M); conventional tillage with maize intercropped with the improved cowpea (Vig na unguiculata L cultivar 'Hariyalli Bush') (CT-M + C); reduced tillage with sole cropped maize (MT-M); and reduced tillage with maize + cowpea (MT-M + C). After harvest of maize and cowpea, mustard was planted as a post rainy season crop and all the mustard plant residues were returned to their respective plots as residue cover except FP. Under provisional ecosystem services, performance of CA on crop yield, and profitability was assessed through maize equivalent yield and partial budget analysis, respectively. Results showed that reduced tillage combined with maize-cowpea intercropping (MT-M + C) followed by mustard residue retention had higher system productivity and net benefits, an increase of 200% and 230%, respectively over FP. Under regulatory ecosystem services, the soil quality was assessed through calculation of soil quality index (SQI) which was highest under MT-M + C followed by mustard residue retention and lowest under farmers' practices. In terms of CA treatment preference, 35% of the farmers indicated a strong preference for MT-M + C compared to 14% for FP. Combined, these results clearly demonstrate the potential of CA to simultaneously increase yield, diversify crop production and improve soil quality which should support a move towards sustainable intensification of crop production to improve future household income and food security. Additionally, using a transdisciplinary approach fully engaged all stakeholders in co-designing the CA treatments appropriate for the farmers and local environmental conditions leading to significant impacts on economic livelihoods, environmental sustainability and food security.

Here, we draw on participatory causal-diagramming workshops, interviews and survey data, to provide contextually grounded knowledge about rural communities' exposure and vulnerability to climate-related hazards in western Myanmar. By tracing how the 2015 cyclone Komen led to a prolonged humanitarian disaster, we show that climate-related risks in this area arise from the complex interplay of households' pre-existing vulnerabilities, persistent farming challenges, extensive disasters and cascading effects, which disparately affect lowland and upland communities. The different household strata's dissimilar vulnerabilities vis-a-vis Komen's impacts were rooted in the distinct exposure of their production systems to landslides and floods. Pre-existing land-access barriers, land-degradation processes, climatic stressors, agricultural pests and diseases, and chronic lack of assets and food insecurity further mediated households' vulnerability. Relief interventions did not stop the disaster's escalation, although this could have been achieved with early technical and material assistance to address the cyclone's impacts on farmers' land. Targeted aid for households facing imminent food insecurity or debt crisis could have lessened engagement in precarious coping strategies and distress migration. A diversification of households' livelihood and land-use practices and increased redundancies of critical assets and infrastructure could help to mitigate future cyclone-triggered disasters. By demonstrating the strengths of local knowledge approaches in untangling the complex interplay of extreme events with households' everyday vulnerabilities and agricultural land-use practices, we make a case for more contextually grounded disaster risk and climate adaptation research.","[Kmoch, Laura; Persson, Ulf Martin] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Space Earth & Environm, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Kmoch, Laura] Univ Kassel, Sect Social Ecol Interact Agr Syst, Fac Organ Agr Sci, Steinstr 19, S-37213 Witzenhausen, Sweden; [Palm, Matilda] Vi Skogen, Stockholm, Sweden; [Jepsen, Martin Rudbeck] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Copenhagen, Denmark",Chalmers University of Technology; University of Copenhagen,"Kmoch, L (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Space Earth & Environm, Gothenburg, Sweden.;Kmoch, L (corresponding author), Univ Kassel, Sect Social Ecol Interact Agr Syst, Fac Organ Agr Sci, Steinstr 19, S-37213 Witzenhausen, Sweden.",kmoch@chalmers.se; matilda.palm@viskogen.se; martin.persson@chalmers.se; mrj@ign.ku.dk,"Kmoch, Laura/I-4286-2016","Kmoch, Laura/0000-0002-0548-1240",Agroecology Learning Alliance in South-East Asia,Agroecology Learning Alliance in South-East Asia,"We thank all research participants from the case study villages and the entire Ar Yone Oo team in Kalay for sharing their knowledge and participating in this study.

Homeowners are increasingly expected to adapt their homes to protect against possible floods. Although an overall agreement seems to exist on the involvement of homeowners in flood risk governance, the academic literature is dispersed in its argumentation on why homeowners should be involved. Therefore, this article provides a coherent overview of the transition from flood protection to flood risk management, and subsequently of the arguments that unfold regarding the shifting position of homeowners within this debate. This overview, based on a systematic review of the academic literature, helps to shed light on the changing role of homeowners in flood risk governance and contributes to categorizing the arguments used in current academic reasoning on homeowner involvement in flood risk governance. We use a conceptual distinction between macro-level and micro-level arguments, and between individual and collective efforts to structure our results. This conceptual overview illustrates the potential gap in convincing homeowners of the urgency to take action, because the connection between the macro-level arguments (i.e., climate change and responsibility) and the micro-level arguments (i.e., minimizing flood damage on privately owned properties) is generally not made. We, therefore, suggest that a stronger coherence in the argumentation would contribute to increase homeowner awareness of their changing responsibilities, which might bring about a future shift toward a new phase in flood risk governance, in which the responsibilities of homeowners are more explicitly acknowledged and integrated into climate adaptation strategies.

By being implemented as, e.g., facade shading systems, their adaptability to environmental changes can improve energy efficiency and indoor comfort of buildings. Autonomous, humidity-driven wood bilayers are proposed as an alternative to motor-driven facade shading elements. Due the hygro-responsiveness of the wood material, the changes of relative humidity during day and night as well as the drying effect of direct solar radiation can be utilized for inducing cyclic programmed shape changes of wood bilayers for aperture opening and closing of such adaptive facade shading systems. The kinetics of such autonomous shape changes of wood bilayers have been analyzed at small scale, but the application-relevant upscaling remains a challenge. So far, the proposed solutions do not allow maintaining a sufficiently high rate of shape change and the required mechanical stability of the wood bilayers at the same time. Here, we present the coupling of two wood bilayers as one possible solution for the implementation as shading elements. By coupling, the rate of aperture opening and closing can be amplified without increasing the (limited) rate of shape change of the single wood bilayers. The coupling and the resulting combination of shape change and rotation are characterized for five different typologies of lever arm configuration. Based on first studies with bilayer strips, an upscaling in width is conducted and its implementation for a humidity-driven shading system is presented by means of a demonstrator.

In Ethiopia, climate change is likely to affect crop yields negatively and therefore food security. However, quantitative evidence is lacking about the ability of farm-level adaptation options to offset the negative impacts of climate change and to improve food security. The MarkSim Global Climate Model weather generator was used to generate projected daily rainfall and temperature data originally taken from the ECHAM5 general circulation model and ensemble mean of six models under high (A2) and low (B1) emission scenarios. The FAO AquaCrop model was validated and subsequently used to predict maize yields and explore three adaptation options: supplemental irrigation (SI), increasing plant density and changing sowing date. The maximum level of maize yield was obtained when the second level of supplemental irrigation (SI2), which is the application of irrigation water when the soil water depletion reached 75% of the total available water in the root zone, is combined with 30 000 plants/ha plant density. It was also found that SI has a marginal effect in good rainfall years but using 94-111 mm of SI can avoid total crop failure in drought years. Hence, SI is a promising option to bridge dry spells and improve food security in the Rift Valley dry lands of Ethiopia. Expected longer dry spells during the shorter rainy season (Belg) in the future are likely to further reduce maize yield. This predicted lower maize production is only partly compensated by the expected increase in CO2 concentration. However, shifting the sowing period of maize from the current Belg season (mostly April or May) to the first month of the longer rainy season (Kiremt) (June) can offset the predicted yield reduction. In general, the present study showed that climate change will occur and, without adaptation, will have negative effects. Use of SI and shifting sowing dates are viable options for adapting to the changes, stabilizing or increasing yield and therefore improving food security for the future.","[Muluneh, A.; Stroosnijder, L.; Keesstra, S.] Wageningen Univ, Soil Phys & Land Management Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 4, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Muluneh, A.] Hawassa Univ, Sch Biosyst & Environm Engn, POB 05, Hawassa, Ethiopia; [Biazin, B.] Int Livestock Res Inst, Addis Ababa 5689, Ethiopia; [Biazin, B.] Hawassa Univ, Wondo Genet Coll Forestry & Nat Resources, Shashemene 128, Ethiopia",Wageningen University & Research; Hawassa University; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Hawassa University,"Muluneh, A (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Soil Phys & Land Management Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 4, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.;Muluneh, A (corresponding author), Hawassa Univ, Sch Biosyst & Environm Engn, POB 05, Hawassa, Ethiopia.",muluneh96@yahoo.com,"keesstra, saskia/Z-5477-2019","Keesstra, Saskia/0000-0003-4129-9080; Temesgen, Birhanu/0000-0001-7532-3849",Netherlands Organization for International Cooperation in Higher Education (NUFFIC); International Foundation for Science (IFS),Netherlands Organization for International Cooperation in Higher Education (NUFFIC); International Foundation for Science (IFS)(International Foundation for Science),The authors express their sincere appreciations to the Netherlands Organization for International Cooperation in Higher Education (NUFFIC) and International Foundation for Science (IFS) for supporting the research financially.

Adaptability of transparent components and facade integration of renewable energy harvesters are being widely studied. However, opaque facade components are less developed, even if their performance can be further optimized. When searching responsive technologies to propose new opaque facades, we learned they were usually created for other fields, which hampers their direct application in new envelopes. The successful implementation of these technologies in fa ade industry depends on the fulfilment of diverse requirements, such as durability, security or flexibility in design among others, but this information was not easy to get when they were not developed for the built environment. There is a lack of empirical studies evaluating these characteristics for adaptive technologies, which are mandatory to define the technical specifications of a fa ade. However, literature review provides a great amount of qualitative information and this study uses it for its analysis in order to gain insights into the degree of accomplishments of aforementioned requirements. Analysed technologies were kinetic elements, shifting thermal behaviour elements, dynamic components and systems. Overall, they still need to face several technical challenges for their suitable fa ade application. The novel visual analysis proposed in this paper is an useful tool for researchers undertaking this task, as it allows a fast and holistic comparison of the potentials and weaknesses of the dynamic technologies.

This degradation is the result of self-reinforcing interactions between deforestation, climate change and fire. We assess the economic, natural capital and ecosystem services impacts and trade-offs of scenarios representing movement towards an Amazon tipping point and strategies to avert one using the Integrated Economic-Environmental Modeling (IEEM) Platform linked with spatial land use-land cover change and ecosystem services modeling (IEEM + ESM). Our approach provides the first approximation of the economic, natural capital and ecosystem services impacts of a tipping point, and evidence to build the economic case for strategies to avert it. For the five Amazon focal countries, namely, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia and Ecuador, we find that a tipping point would create economic losses of US$256.6 billion in cumulative gross domestic product by 2050. Policies that would contribute to averting a tipping point, including strongly reducing deforestation, investing in intensifying agriculture in cleared lands, climate-adapted agriculture and improving fire management, would generate approximately US$339.3 billion in additional wealth and a return on investment of US$29.5 billion. Quantifying the costs, benefits and trade-offs of policies to avert a tipping point in a transparent and replicable manner can support the design of regional development strategies for the Amazon biome, build the business case for action and catalyze global cooperation and financing to enable policy implementation.","[Banerjee, Onil] RMGEO Consultants Inc, Atmaya 8C, Pelita Dalam 12430, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Cicowiez, Martin] Univ Nacl La Plata, Fac Ciencias Econ, Calle 6 Entre 47 & 48,3er piso,Oficina 312, RA-1900 La Plata, Argentina; [Macedo, Marcia N.; Coe, Michael T.; Neill, Christopher] Woodwell Climate Res Ctr, Gilman Ordway Campus,149 Woods Hole Rd, Falmouth, MA 02540 USA; [Macedo, Marcia N.; Rattis, Ludmila] Amazon Environm Res Inst IPAM, CLN 211 Bl B Sala 201, BR-70863520 Asa Norte, DF, Brazil; [Malek, Ziga; Verburg, Peter H.; Goodwin, Sean] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, 1087 HV Amsterdam,Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Vargas, Renato] CHW Res, 40 Ave 52-90 Zona 16 Edif Trento Suite 402, Guatemala City 01016, Guatemala; [Bagstad, Kenneth J.] US Geol Survey, Geosci & Environm Change Sci Ctr, POB 25046,MS 980, Denver, CO 80225 USA; [Brando, Paulo M.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, 3200 Croul Hall St, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Marti, Octavio Damiani] Interamer Dev Bank, Climate Change & Sustainable Dev, Setor Embaixadas Norte Quadra 802 Conjunto F Lote, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Murillo, Josue Avila] Interamer Dev Bank, Climate Change & Sustainable Dev, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA",National University of La Plata; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of California System; University of California Irvine; Inter-American Development Bank,"Banerjee, O (corresponding author), RMGEO Consultants Inc, Atmaya 8C, Pelita Dalam 12430, Jakarta, Indonesia.",obanerjee@gmail.com,"Verburg, Peter/A-8469-2010","Verburg, Peter/0000-0002-6977-7104; Malek, Ziga/0000-0002-6981-6708","UK's Department for Environment, Food Rural Affairs; Inter-American Development Bank; SGS Land Change Science Program; NSF [1739724]; CNPq [441463/2017-7, 441703/2016-0PELD]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [5482, 9957]","UK's Department for Environment, Food Rural Affairs; Inter-American Development Bank; SGS Land Change Science Program; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation)","This study was commissioned by the UK's HM Treasury to inform the Dasgupta Review on the Economics of Biodiversity.

In Denmark, a large part of the responsibility for climate adaptation lies with the local municipalities. The purpose of this study was to map the user needs for coastal climate change information of five municipalities in the Danish south western Baltic Sea and the Danish Coastal Authority in a cost-efficient way and to transform the mapping into local climate indicators. An interview template was customized to form the basis for telephone interviews of key stakeholders and systematic gathering of the results. The interest for the interviews was high, and response from the interviewed persons on the use of the template was very positive. During the interviews, it was clear that the municipalities have access to extensive information on the population and infrastructure, as well as detailed geographical information. The main interests were in very high quality storm surge warnings and present day and future extreme sea level and wave heights. This should be based on modeling of past storm surges and future changes, taking observations, and historical records into account. There was a big need for more detailed information than presently available, and for common scenarios, which will help the collaboration between municipalities. Within this study, the user requirements were used to define targeted climate indicators. Within the C3S CODEC project, the indicators will be provided for the municipalities, based on a downscaling of European scale storm surge, and wave simulations to local scale.","[Madsen, Kristine S.; Murawski, Jens; Blokhina, Marina; Su, Jian] Danish Meteorol Inst, Copenhagen, Denmark",Danish Meteorological Institute DMI,"Madsen, KS (corresponding author), Danish Meteorol Inst, Copenhagen, Denmark.",kma@dmi.dk,,,coastal climate change (CODEC) [C3S_422_Lot2_Deltares],coastal climate change (CODEC),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the C3S_422_Lot2_Deltares contract on coastal climate change (CODEC), for the Copernicus Climate Change Service.",,12,6,6,5,28,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-6463,,FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ,Front.

Future impacts can be difficult to assess as they often involve long timescales, dynamic systems with high uncertainties, and are typically confounded by other drivers of change. Despite a growing literature on climate change impacts on ecosystem services, no quantitative syntheses exist. Hence, we lack an overarching understanding of the impacts of climate change, how they are being assessed, and the extent to which other drivers, uncertainties, and decision making are incorporated. To address this, we systematically reviewed the peer-reviewed literature that assesses climate change impacts on ecosystem services at subglobal scales. We found that the impact of climate change on most types of services was predominantly negative (59% negative, 24% mixed, 4% neutral, 13% positive), but varied across services, drivers, and assessment methods. Although uncertainty was usually incorporated, there were substantial gaps in the sources of uncertainty included, along with the methods used to incorporate them. We found that relatively few studies integrated decision making, and even fewer studies aimed to identify solutions that were robust to uncertainty. For management or policy to ensure the delivery of ecosystem services, integrated approaches that incorporate multiple drivers of change and account for multiple sources of uncertainty are needed. This is undoubtedly a challenging task, but ignoring these complexities can result in misleading assessments of the impacts of climate change, suboptimal management outcomes, and the inefficient allocation of resources for climate adaptation.","[Runting, Rebecca K.; Yetka, Kathleen; Rhodes, Jonathan R.] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Runting, Rebecca K.; Maseyk, Fleur J.

This study investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of Inner Mongolia grassland, the main grassland region in China and part of the Eurasia Steppe, to detect the interactive nature of climate, ecosystems and society. Land-use and landscape patterns for the period from 1985 to 2009 were analysed based on TM- and MODIS-derived land-use data. Net Primary Productivity (NPP) estimated by using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach model was used to assess the growth status of grassland. Furthermore, the factors related to the dynamics of grassland were analysed from the perspectives of two driving factors, climate change and human activities. The results indicated that higher temperatures and lower precipitation may generally have contributed to grassland desertification, particularly in arid regions. During the period from 1985 to 2000, a higher human population and an increase in livestock numbers were the major driving forces responsible for the consistent decrease in NPP and a relatively fragmented landscape. From 2000 to 2009, the implementation of effective ecological restoration projects has arrested the grassland deterioration in some ecologically fragile regions. However, a rapid growth of livestock numbers has sparked new degradation onnon-degraded or lightly degraded grassland, which was initially neglected by these projects. In spite of some achievement in grassland restoration, China should take further steps to develop sustainable management practices for climate adaptation and economic development to bring lasting benefits.","[Mu, S.

But small regions - where private and public sector decision makers take actions whose aggregated effects shape those broader pathways - are faced with the need to adapt to climate impacts over which they have little control. Such impacts already include not only direct climatological ones, but also related systemic shifts in technologies, markets, and policies. Firms and policymakers can widen the range of adaptation opportunities by exploring regional resources applicable to emergent clusters, through which technologically related inter-organizational dynamics may permit more effective climate responses. As in the resource-based view of the firm underlying cluster theory, key decision fields are chosen based on existing capabilities internal to the region in relation to the threats and opportunities transmitted by external climate change impacts. Adaptive strategy options at the regional level can be identified and assessed using a scenario-building methodology that incorporates the interactions among multiple variables and decision-makers' actions over time. Stakeholder input and engagement during the research process can facilitate realism and traction. This methodology is applied to northwestern Pennsylvania, on Lake Erie, projecting a scenario based on a set of complementary, lower-carbon energy and transportation technologies.

Design/methodology/approach Employing the qualitative approach, a total of 31 in-depth interviews with customer relationship management (CRM) officers of telecom and organized outlets were carried out. Data were analysed using NVIVO-12 plus and ATLAS tools. Findings The analysis extracted 13 unique themes namely training and development, communication skills, convincing skills, interpersonal skills, knowledge management, grievance handling, organisation's culture development, service climate, adaptive behaviour, customer retention skills, customer profiling, trust and commitment, and suitability of employees. The results claimed that these themes can assist in building strong customer relationships. However, the extent of the significance of themes may vary for telecom and organized retail outlets. Research limitations/implications The findings have vital implications for frontline employees to drive customer value as they directly involve with customers. Findings further suggest that hiring of employees according to their location and catchment area of outlets are utmost important. Originality/value Employee orientation is an indispensable determinant in building a sustainable relationship with customers through uniqueness and consistency in meeting customers' expectations. This is a first attempt to explore the various unique themes responsible for employee orientation and the imperative role of such themes in maintaining long-lasting customer relationships.","[Jhamb, Deepika; Kampani, Nidhi] Chitkara Univ, Chitkara Business Sch, Rajpura, Punjab, India; [Arya, Vikas] Int Univ Rabat, Rabat Business Sch, Rabat, North Africa, Morocco","Chitkara University, Punjab; Universite Internationale de Rabat","Jhamb, D (corresponding author), Chitkara Univ, Chitkara Business Sch, Rajpura, Punjab, India.",deepika.jhamb@chitkara.edu.in,"Arya, Dr. Vikas/U-5500-2017","Arya, Dr. Vikas/0000-0001-8025-1528",,,,,103,2,2,2,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-5771,1758-4094,,BENCHMARKING,Benchmarking,FEB 10,2022,29,2,,,,,411,433,,10.1108/BIJ-12-2020-0614,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/BIJ-12-2020-0614,,,23,Management,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,ZD5KO,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000758238500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The presented approach encompasses: (1) the strategic identification of focal areas in terms of climate adaptation needs, (2) comprehensive diagnosis of local ecological vulnerability and natural adaptive potential to build adaptive capacity, and (3) incorporation of natural adaptive potential through an identified set of planning and design tools. For diagnosis and strategic environmental impact assessment, the multicriteria analysis has been elaborated. The described procedure is applied to the City of Warsaw on the strategic level, by elaboration of the ranking of districts in terms of priority to take adaptation actions based on climatic threats, demographic vulnerability, and assessment of Warsaw Green Infrastructure potential. For further analysis at the planning and design stage, the district with the most urgent adaptation needs has been chosen, and within its borders, two neighborhoods (existing and planned one) with diagnosed ecological sensitivity were selected. Both case studies were analyzed in terms of environmental conditions, urban structure, and planning provisions. It enabled identification of existing natural adaptive potential and assessment of its use. As a result, propositions for enhancing neighborhood resilience to climate change were suggested.","[Redzinska, Katarzyna; Piotrkowska, Monika] Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Geodesy & Cartog, Dept Spatial Planning & Environm Sci, Pl Politech 1, PL-00661 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Technology,"Redzinska, K (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Geodesy & Cartog, Dept Spatial Planning & Environm Sci, Pl Politech 1, PL-00661 Warsaw, Poland.",katarzyna.redzinska@pw.edu.pl; monika.piotrkowska@pw.edu.pl,,"Piotrkowska, Monika/0000-0002-3269-1884; Redzinska, Katarzyna/0000-0001-8621-0073",WARSAW UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY,WARSAW UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY,The research was carried out as part of the cooperation of the City of Warsaw and the science sector.

In the present study, we evaluated both the production capacity of organic horticultural systems, and the ex-post sustainability through a new multi-attribute decision model named DEXi-met. This qualitative model is able to estimate the environmental sustainability of cropping systems managed with different agro-ecological approaches. In particular, we compared the following three horticultural systems: (i) ECO, an organic system with full implementation of agro-ecological strategies (agro-ecological services crops (ASC), strip cultivation, and organic amendment); (ii) GM, an organic system with the introduction of the ASC; (iii) NO ASC, an organic system without ASC. The treatments with ASC presence (ECO and GM) showed similar total energy outputs (substantially higher than the NO ASC), indicating the positive effect of this agro-ecological practice. The findings pointed out that the ECO system, which followed the principles of natural ecosystems, can contribute to building up more complex agro-ecosystems, increasing both resilience and biodiversity. This management strategy reached a good compromise between the production of vegetable cropping systems and environmental sustainability achievement. Then, it is possible to optimize the use of natural resources, support climate adaptation, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.","[Montemurro, Francesco] Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal Econ Agr, Res Ctr Vegetable & Ornamental Crops, Via Salaria 1, I-63030 Monsampolo Del Tronto, AP, Italy; [Persiani, Alessandro; Diacono, Mariangela] Consiglio Ric & Anal Econ Agr, Res Ctr Agr & Environm, Via Celso Ulpiani 5, I-70125 Bari, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Montemurro, F (corresponding author), Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal Econ Agr, Res Ctr Vegetable & Ornamental Crops, Via Salaria 1, I-63030 Monsampolo Del Tronto, AP, Italy.",francesco.montemurro@crea.gov.it; alessandro.persiani@crea.gov.it; mariangela.diacono@crea.gov.it,"Diacono, Mariangela/AFU-0696-2022; Persiani, Alessandro/ABG-9577-2020","Diacono, Mariangela/0000-0002-5501-8027; Persiani, Alessandro/0000-0002-8603-5591; Montemurro, Francesco/0000-0003-3209-0189",Organic Farming Office of the Italian Ministry of Agriculture; ERA-Net CORE Organic Plus of the European Union's FP7 research and innovation programme [618107],Organic Farming Office of the Italian Ministry of Agriculture; ERA-Net CORE Organic Plus of the European Union's FP7 research and innovation programme,"This paper is a result of the research projects RETIBIO (Attivita di supporto nel settore dell'agricoltura biologica per il mantenimento dei dispositivi sperimentali di lungo termine e il rafforzamento delle reti di relazioni esistenti a livello nazionale e internazionale), funded by the Organic Farming Office of the Italian Ministry of Agriculture, and SOILVEG (Improving soil conservation and resource use in organic cropping systems for vegetable production through introduction and management of Agro-ecological Service Crops (ASC)) funded by ERA-Net CORE Organic Plus Funding Bodies partners of the European Union's FP7 research and innovation programme under the grant agreement No. 618107.",,40,3,3,3,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

However, implementation has been disappointing, which led scientists at the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) to consider a scenario exercise as a way to mitigate the risk of unwanted outcomes. The study had a characteristic that it shares with many other studies: close interaction of larger-scale processes and trends (global markets, national policy) with smaller-scale systems (regional and local policy, farmer livelihoods). The authors therefore felt than an explicitly multi-scale approach was called for. To keep close to the well-known practice, we made a modest extension to a conventional scenario logic approach, and introduced a nested, and multi-scale scenario logic. While modest, we believe that the modification is useful, and the method could be used in other studies, in particular climate adaptation studies. We applied the method during two scenario workshops held to explore the use of smallholder tree plantations in efforts to improve rural livelihoods: each workshop considered two different localities. While the scenario frameworks resulting from the workshops were similar between the localities, we believe that the nested scenario framework served to structure the process and revealed meaningful contextual differences. From these experiences, we discuss and critique the method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This area of research is highly sensitive to the myriad of possible inputs and thus holds a wide range of predicted outcomes. However, general trends have been found, showing significant sensitivity to ventilation rate, U-values, occupant behaviour and location. Heating demand will still be dominant over cooling demand in UK dwellings by the 2080s, based on an UKCIP02 A1F1 weather scenario. A national worst case scenario for the 2050s, shows a 10 megatonne CO2 emissions saving on present levels largely due to a 20% reduction in gas consumption. Practical applications: The balance of heating and cooling demand causes more modest changes in CO2 than first anticipated. Despite first perceptions of future energy use in housing and climate change, heating appears to remain the major load rather than cooling, even into the 2080s. These predictions of future CO2 emissions will be useful to those in the building industry planning appropriate proportionate climate adaptation and climate mitigation measures. Also, the prediction of changes to future energy demands from the housing sector will be of interest to energy providers considering future demands for heating and cooling and may feed into larger bottom-up energy models.","[Collins, Lisa; Levermore, Geoff] Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Natarajan, Sukumar] Univ Bath, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Manchester; University of Bath,"Collins, L (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",l.collins@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk,,"Natarajan, Sukumar/0000-0001-5831-1678","School of MACE, Manchester University","School of MACE, Manchester University","Author Lisa Collins was gratefully supported in this research by a School of MACE, Manchester University, scholarship.",,20,41,41,2,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0143-6244,1477-0849,,BUILD SERV ENG RES T,Build Serv.

The native distribution of cat's claw creeper was used to predict the potential range of climatically suitable habitats for cat's claw creeper in its introduced ranges. A Composite Match Index (CMI) of cat's claw creeper was determined with the 'Match Climates' function in order to match the ranges in Australia and South Africa where the plant is introduced with its native range in South and Central America. This information was used to determine which areas might yield climatically-adapted agents. Locations in northern Argentina had CMI values which best matched sites with cat's claw creeper infestations in Australia and South Africa. None of the sites from where three currently prioritised biological control agents for cat's claw creeper were collected had CMI values higher than 0.8. The analysis showed that central and eastern Argentina, south Brazil, Uruguay and parts of Bolivia and Paraguay should be prioritised for exploration for new biological control agents for cat's claw creeper to be used in Australia and South Africa.

Theoretical framework: Theory of Organizational Identity (Ashforth & Mael, 1989) Methodology: A survey was carried out from an Organizational Identification scale built specifically for cooperatives together with a reduced scale of organizational climate adapted cross-culturally for cooperatives. Data analysis was performed using a quantitative approach, using the techniques of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Results: The analysis of structural paths revealed that the 'Group Adjustment' construct is the one that most influences the Organizational Climate. The final validated model combined a second order construct, 4 first order constructs and 17 variables. The final results of the model demonstrated that the Organizational Climate is 83.7% explained by its Affective, Cognitive and Instrumental aspects. Originality: Cooperatives have several characteristics that differentiate them from conventional societies, and therefore they need theoretical constructs adapted to their reality. The differentiating characteristics of cooperatives are self-declared worldwide, but they have not been studied from the Theory of Organizational Identity. Theoretical and practical contributions: This research develops a new construct and scale called Cooperative Organizational Identity.

When provided on a national scale, they can help inform the general public, policymakers, and public health professionals about important trends in exposures and how well public health systems are preventing those exposures from causing adverse health outcomes. There is a growing need to understand national trends in exposures and health outcomes associated with climate change and the effectiveness of climate adaptation strategies for health. To date, most indicators for health implications of climate change have been designed as independent, individual metrics. This approach fails to take into account how exposure-outcome pathways for climate-attributable health outcomes involve multiple, interconnected components. We propose reframing climate change and health indicators as a linked system of indicators, which can be described as follows: upstream climate drivers affect environmental states, which then determine human exposures, which ultimately lead to health outcomes; these climate-related risks are modified by population vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies. We apply this new conceptual framework to three illustrative climate-sensitive health outcomes and associated exposure-outcome pathways: pollen allergies and asthma, West Nile virus infection, and vibriosis.","[Liu, Ann Y.; Balbus, John M.] NIEHS, Off Director, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Trtanj, Juli M.] NOAA, Climate Program Off, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Lipp, Erin K.] Univ Georgia, Off Acad Affairs Environm Hlth Sci, Coll Publ Hlth, Athens, GA 30602 USA",National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Balbus, JM (corresponding author), NIEHS, Off Director, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",john.balbus@nih.gov,,"Balbus, John/0000-0003-3356-8332","NIH, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences","NIH, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS))","This work was supported, in part, by the NIH, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.",,50,3,3,5,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The ENVI-met 4.3 software, developed by Michael Bruse at Bochum, German, was used to simulate the microclimate distribution data, combined with the boosted regression tree (BRT) model and the correlation analysis method. The results showed that at the network level, the distance from the water body and the connectivity of green space had a stronger cooling correlation. The orientation of green corridors consistent with a summer monsoon had larger cooling effect ranges. In terms of spatial morphology, the vegetation sky view factor (SVF) and Vegetation Surface Albedo (VSAlbedo) had an important correlation with air temperature (T), and the green corridor with a 20-25 m width had the largest marginal effect on cooling.

This living network strengthens the resilience of urban environments to respond to the major current and future challenges of climate change, growth, health and biodiversity loss, as well as water, energy and food security. With the rapid expansion of towns and cities around the world, the far-reaching value of Green Infrastructure is increasingly recognised by scientific, planning and design communities. A key strategy area of the South Australian Green Infrastructure Project has been development of a sound and credible evidence base to demonstrate the multiple benefits and make the case for investment in Green Infrastructure. A review of local and global literature, with an emphasis on the most recent peer-reviewed research, was carried out between 2012 and 2014.

Some of the key positive and negative impacts of climate change on agricultural commodities, using the examples of wheat and barley, are identified; of particular significance are temperature changes, water availability, and CO2 fertilization. Although they are not exempt from the negative impacts of climate change, higher latitude regions of production, including Canada and Russia, will benefit the most from climate change. The impacts on other important production regions, such as parts of Europe, the US, and Argentina, will be more mixed. Market stability in all regions will also be affected by changes in climate and weather extremes. To increase resilience to the effects of weather events and climate change on the agricultural commodity market, countries should diversify their sources of supply, encourage more countries to grow and export the relevant commodities, and support crop research and climate adaptation. Policy relevance Climate change will substantially affect future food security and the price of agricultural commodities. This study takes a broad approach to identify the key aspects of the agricultural commodities market that are vulnerable to climate change and suggests ways in which policy makers might improve its resilience.","[Lewis, Kirsty; Witham, Claire] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Lewis, K (corresponding author), Met Off Hadley Ctr, Fitzroy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",kirsty.lewis@metoffice.gov.uk,,"Witham, Claire/0000-0001-5037-6987",,,,,36,12,12,5,72,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Model calibration and evaluation were carried out in 2008 using data from a citrus orchard considered representative of the typical agricultural practices in Andalucia. The SWAP model outputs agreed well with corresponding measured values in simulating soil water dynamics in-field. The model can be used in support of developing appropriate irrigation strategies for sustainable water management.

Managed retreat has emerged in the literature as one method by which to manage some acute and slow-onset events caused by climate change, but it requires substantial additional research and examination. It is now clear that humanity must scrutinize how and where we live and the wisdom of policies that support continued rebuilding and reinvestment after climate-related disasters. Despite its emergence as a potential policy response to risk, the phrase managed retreat is documented as a barrier in itself to successful adaptation actions, largely because the term is currently almost exclusively considered to mean physical movement of infrastructure or people out of harm's way-that is, retreat. There is a need to document and consider case studies where managed retreat is being utilized more broadly and to consider these case studies as a climate governance approach to managing risk. The case studies presented of local policy responses to climate-induced disaster events demonstrate examples of the permanent changes that are already occurring to the existing and historical governance of climate-related risks. These case studies can serve to broaden the climate adaptation discussion and framework beyond managed retreat and may lead to more successful implementation of adaptation measures that reduce climate risks. We adopt the term transformative adaptation measures, rather than managed retreat, and provide case study illustrations of climate governance strategies that communities faced with a changing climate risk profile may consider, rather than focusing on retreat.","[Dundon, Leah a.; Abkowitz, M.

Few insect monitoring programmes cover the large spatial scales required to provide more generalizable estimates of insect responses to global change drivers. We ask how climate and surrounding habitat affect flying insect biomass using data from the first year of a new monitoring network at 84 locations across Germany comprising a spatial gradient of land cover types from protected to urban and crop areas. Flying insect biomass increased linearly with temperature across Germany. However, the effect of temperature on flying insect biomass flipped to negative in the hot months of June and July when local temperatures most exceeded long-term averages. Land cover explained little variation in insect biomass, but biomass was lowest in forests. Grasslands, pastures, and orchards harboured the highest insect biomass. The date of peak biomass was primarily driven by surrounding land cover, with grasslands especially having earlier insect biomass phenologies. Standardised, large-scale monitoring provides key insights into the underlying processes of insect decline and is pivotal for the development of climate-adapted strategies to promote insect diversity. In a temperate climate region, we find that the positive effects of temperature on flying insect biomass diminish in a German summer at locations where temperatures most exceeded long-term averages. Our results highlight the importance of local adaptation in climate change-driven impacts on insect communities.","[Welti, Ellen A.

However, the success of such strategies depends on whether thresholds can be accurately linked to future vulnerabilities. This study presents a framework for testing the ability of adaptation thresholds to dynamically identify vulnerable scenarios within ensemble projections. Streamflow projections for 91 river sites predominantly in the western USA are used as a case study in which vulnerability is determined by the ensemble members with the lowest 10% of end-of-century mean annual flow. Illustrative planning thresholds are defined through time for each site based on the mean streamflow below which a specified fraction of scenarios is vulnerable. We perform a leave-one-out cross-validation to compute the frequency of incorrectly identifying or failing to identify a vulnerable scenario (false positives and false negatives, respectively). Results show that in general, this method of defining thresholds can identify vulnerable scenarios with low false positive rates (<10%), but with false negative rates for many rivers remaining higher than random chance until roughly 2060. This finding highlights the tradeoff between frequently triggering unnecessary action and failing to identify potential vulnerabilities until later in the century, and suggests room for improvement in the threshold-setting technique that could be benchmarked with this approach. This testing framework could extend to thresholds defined with multivariate statistics, or to any application using thresholds and ensemble projections, such as long-term flood and drought risk, or sea level rise.","[Robinson, Bethany; Herman, Jonathan D.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Robinson, B (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",bjrobins@ucdavis.edu,"Herman, Jonathan D/M-9079-2017; Robinson, Bethany/HGU-5221-2022","Herman, Jonathan D/0000-0002-4081-3175; Robinson, Bethany/0000-0002-8942-9027","U.S. National Science Foundation [CNS-1639268, CNH-1716130]",U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was partially supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation grants CNS-1639268 and CNH-1716130.,,50,9,9,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

To better quantify possible changes in relatively rare design-relevant precipitation quantiles (e.g. the 1 in 10 year event), a Bayesian regional extreme value model was used, which employed the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) - a measure of ENSO - as a covariate. Regions found to be influenced by ENSO include parts of North and South America, southern and eastern Asia, South Africa, Australia and Europe. The season experiencing the greatest ENSO effect varies regionally, but in most of the ENSO-affected regions the strongest effect happens in boreal winter, during which time the 10-year precipitation for vertical bar SOI vertical bar = 20 (corresponding to either a strong El Nino or La Nina episode) can be up to 50% higher or lower than for SOI = 0 (a neutral phase). Importantly, the effect of ENSO on extreme precipitation is asymmetric, with most parts of the world experiencing a significant effect only for a single ENSO phase. This finding has important implications on the current understanding of how ENSO influences extreme precipitation, and will enable a more rigorous theoretical foundation for providing quantitative extreme precipitation intensity predictions at seasonal timescales. We anticipate that incorporating asymmetric impacts of ENSO on extreme precipitation will help lead to better-informed climate-adaptive design of flood-sensitive infrastructure.

At the same time, the degree of frost formation of the air source heat pumps outdoor units are mainly affected by local climatic conditions. Therefore, this study proposes the concept of frosting degree hours, which is used to specifically characterize the impact of climatic conditions on air source heat pumps frost. In order to make the analysis and calculation of the frosting degree hours more accurate, this study carried out the collection of the actual operation data of the air source heat pumps in winter in many cities in China. Through the selection and analysis of the actual operating data, the data fitting method was used to analyze the different variables and the characteristic temperature difference between the evaporation temperature and the outdoor dry bulb temperature of systems with different power types was obtained. Finally, according to the analysis of the frosting degree hours under different characteristic temperature differences, combined with the frost characteristics of air source heat pumps of different power types in 275 cities in China, the climatic division was performed. This can provide a reference for the climate-adaptive design of air source heat pumps and the development of defrost control strategies. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Fossil fan palm fronds are well known from Eocene sites in the United States; however, although they are also known from the Paleogene Huntingdon Formation of British Columbia for over 100 years, these are poorly studied. There are early anecdotal reports of Eocene Sabal or Sabalites leaves from the Vancouver area, pollen from Vancouver and the interior of British Columbia, and a single megafossil palm described from the Princeton Chert, indicating past warm climates in the region. Leaves of coryphoid palms (Arecaceae) from British Columbia are described formally here for the first time. Methodology. We analyze morphologically the Eocene palm frond fossils from the Vancouver area (Huntingdon Formation) and the Ashcroft area in British Columbia. Pivotal results. The Sabalites fossil fronds from the Vancouver area represent fan palms (subfamily Coryphoideae, cf. tribe Sabaleae) and are assigned to the new taxon Sabalites dawsonii. These and other Eocene palm fossils from the Pacific Northwest demonstrate that-based on prior paleoclimate analyses-coryphoid palms were growing under paleotemperatures close to their modern cold limits. Palm fossils reported from near Ashcroft are not Arecaceae, as key diagnostic characters are absent. Conclusions. These and comparable palm fossil records, coupled with analyses of paleoclimate, corroborate an early Paleogene origin of temperate climate adaptation by Coryphoideae, likely as part of the initial Sabaleae and Trachycarpeae diversifications.","[Greenwood, David R.] Brandon Univ, Deptartment Biol, 270-18th St, Brandon, MB R7A 6A9, Canada; [Conran, John G.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Australian Ctr Evolutionary Biol & Biodivers, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Conran, John G.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Sprigg Geobiol Ctr, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",Brandon University; University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide,"Greenwood, DR (corresponding author), Brandon Univ, Deptartment Biol, 270-18th St, Brandon, MB R7A 6A9, Canada.",greenwoodd@brandonu.ca,"Greenwood, David R./C-2758-2008","Greenwood, David R./0000-0002-8569-9695",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC); Australian Research Council (ARC),Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council),"D.

Concurrently, research shows that native mycorrhizal fungi (symbiotic with plant roots) appropriate to plant provenance and site conditions significantly accelerate restoration, support crucial ecosystem services, and provide natural climate solutions (sequestering carbon), and nature-based solutions for climate change (climate adaptation). We reviewed 130 management plans for natural areas in the United States to evaluate whether restoring native mycorrhizal communities has translated into implementation. Although management plans frequently discussed the ecosystem services mycorrhizal fungi provide, nearly one half (46%) viewed fungi solely as pathogens or ignored them altogether. Only 8% of plans mentioned mycorrhizal fungi. Only one plan mentioned that mycorrhizae were potentially helpful to natural regeneration, while one other mentioned utilizing soil as a restoration tool. Our examination of publicly available data and case studies suggests that relatively meager protections for fungi, limited research funding and resulting data, research difficulty, and limited access to mycology experts and training contribute to this gap between science and implementation. A database of literature showcasing mycorrhizal ecosystem services and benefits is provided to highlight when and why mycorrhizae should be considered in management, regeneration, and restoration. Three action items are recommended to safeguard native mycorrhizal fungal communities and accelerate restoration and regeneration. Ten implementation tips based in scientific literature are provided to clarify the need and methods for mycorrhizal restoration.","[Markovchick, Lisa M.; Gibson, Kara Skye; Kovacs, Zsuzsi I.; Johnson, Nancy C.; Whitham, Thomas G.; Gehring, Catherine A.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, POB 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Markovchick, Lisa M.; Belgara-Andrew, Abril; Whitham, Thomas G.; Gehring, Catherine A.] No Arizona Univ, Ctr Adaptable Western Landscapes, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Markovchick, Lisa M.] WildEarth Guardians, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Carrasco-Denney, Vanessa] Nature Conservancy, 4245 N Fairfax Dr,Suite 100, Arlington, VA 22203 USA; [Sharma, Jyotsna] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Lubbock, TX USA; [Querejeta, Jose Ignacio] Spanish Natl Res Council, CEBAS CSIC, Soil & Water Conservat Grp, POB 164, Murcia 30100, Spain; [Swaty, Randy] Nature Conservancy, 1502 Garfield Ave,Home Off, Marquette, MI 49855 USA; [Uhey, Derek A.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Johnson, Nancy C.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Earth & Sustainabil, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA",Northern Arizona University; Northern Arizona University; Nature Conservancy; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro de Edafologia y Biologia Aplicada del Segura (CEBAS); Northern Arizona University; Northern Arizona University,"Markovchick, LM (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, POB 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.;Markovchick, LM (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Ctr Adaptable Western Landscapes, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.;Markovchick, LM (corresponding author), WildEarth Guardians, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA.",lisa_markovchick@nau.edu,,"Gibson, Kara/0000-0003-2081-9315",Naval Base Point Loma; United States Department of Defense; NSF Macrosystems [DEB-1340852]; NAU's Presidential Fellowship Program; ARCS Foundation; Lucking Family Professorship; Arizona Mushroom Society's Dr. Chester Leathers Graduate Student Scholarship,Naval Base Point Loma; United States Department of Defense(United States Department of Defense); NSF Macrosystems; NAU's Presidential Fellowship Program; ARCS Foundation; Lucking Family Professorship; Arizona Mushroom Society's Dr. Chester Leathers Graduate Student Scholarship,"The authors thank Rivers Edge West and all who participated in Mycorrhizae for Land Managers seminars and mycorrhizal restoration workshops, attendees of the Society for Ecological Restoration Southwest Chapter Annual Conference and the Biennial Conference of Science & Management on the Colorado Plateau, the Gehring lab, and the Cottonwood Ecology and Community Genetics Laboratory group for constructive questions and feedback.

Differences in climate conditions and the appearance of severe events, like droughts, has a significant imprint on local, regional and global agricultural productivity. The goal of this paper is to present remotely sensed approaches for water availability and requirements in vulnerable agriculture. Earth Observation (EO) data contribute to precision agriculture for efficient crop monitoring and irrigation management. A drought susceptible region considered as vulnerable farming was chosen, in the Thessaly prefecture in Central Greece. Water availability is measured by means of precipitation frequency examination and drought estimation. Crop water requirements are measured by assessing crop evapotranspiration (ET) with the synergistic use of WV-2 satellite images and ground-truth data. The remote-based ETcsat is assessed by utilizing the reference ETo derived from Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) methodology, while the meteorological data and Kc are evolved from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). According to the rainfall frequency studies, indicators demonstrate a significant precipitation decrease. The results reveal the importance of water availability estimation for facing agriculture water needs and the necessity for monitoring of drought conditions in a vulnerable Mediterranean area in order to plan an integrated strategy for climate adaptation. Moreover, the conclusions clarify the usefulness of collaborating innovative very high spatial and sperctral resolution EO images along with ground-truth data for crop ET monitoring and also the assimilation into the precision agriculture methodology which is valuable for optimal agricultural production.","[Dalezios, Nicolas R.] Univ Thessaly, Dept Civil Engn, Volos, Greece; [Dalezios, Nicolas R.; Dercas, Nicholas; Psomiadis, Emmanouil] Agr Univ Athens, Dept Nat Resources Management & Agr Engn, Athens, Greece; [Spyropoulos, Nicos V.] SIGMA Geotechnol, Munich, Germany",University of Thessaly; Agricultural University of Athens,"Psomiadis, E (corresponding author), Agr Univ Athens, Dept Nat Resources Management & Agr Engn, Athens, Greece.",mpsomiadis@gmail.com,"PSOMIADIS, EMMANOUIL/T-1667-2018","PSOMIADIS, EMMANOUIL/0000-0002-1094-9397",INTERREG Illb PRODIM project; EU FP6 PLEIADES project; HORIZON2020 FATIMA project,INTERREG Illb PRODIM project; EU FP6 PLEIADES project; HORIZON2020 FATIMA project,"A previous shorter version of the paper has been presented in the 10th World Congress of EWRA Panta Rei Athens, Greece, July 2017.

A case study of Nordic insurers,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; Nordic; Policy; Mitigation; Adaptation; Insurance,INSURANCE,"Collective actions of stakeholders are required for fulfilling the climate commitments of the Kyoto protocol. The insurance sector's global influence and societal impact is fairly well documented. The sector influences societies based on its interaction with stakeholders, on its products, business and political stance. As such, it is a critical actor in facilitating key climate change actions of mitigation and adaptation, and has already been recognized as a leading sector in terms of climate adaptation. The aim of this paper is to explore the role of non-life insurers in fulfilling the climate commitments of the Kyoto Protocol. This paper is based on a case study on Nordic non-life insurance companies. The study documents that Nordic insurers are responding to climate-related threats and opportunities in a strategic manner by reducing their own impacts, through their core activities, and by influencing others to act. Although Nordic insurers do not classify their actions into mitigation and adaptation, but classify them according to their core activities, they demonstrate through actions their role as potential allies for nations in fulfilling the Kyoto protocol climate commitments. The study also reveals that the commercial reality of the industry is not the same as the expected contribution to climate commitments, for instance as specified in international conventions and treaties and in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and industry reports.

To this end, local policy makers need to identify the most thermally vulnerable areas within cities. The Local Climate Zone (LCZ) scheme highlights local-scale variations; however, its classes, although highly valuable, are to a certain extent generalized in order to be universally applicable. High spatial resolution indicators have the potential to better reflect city-specific challenges; in this paper, the Urban Heat Exposure (UHeatEx) indicator is developed, integrating the physical processes that drive the urban heat island (UHI). In particular, the urban form is modeled using remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) techniques, and used to estimate the canyon aspect ratio and the storage heat flux. The Bowen ratio is calculated using the aerodynamic resistance methodology and downscaled remotely sensed surface temperatures. The anthropogenic heat flux is estimated via a synergy of top-down and bottom-up inventory approaches. UHeatEx is applied to the city of Athens, Greece; it is correlated to air temperature measurements and compared to the LCZs classification. The results reveal that UHeatEx has the capacity to better reflect the strong intra-urban variability of the thermal environment in Athens, and thus can be supportive for adaptation responses. High-resolution climate projections from the EURO-CORDEX ensemble for the region show that the adverse effects of the existing thermal inequity are expected to worsen in the coming decades.","[Agathangelidis, Ilias; Cartalis, Constantinos] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Dept Phys, Athens 15784, Greece; [Santamouris, Mat] Univ New South Wales, Fac Built Environm, Anita Lawrence Chair High Performance Architectur, Sydney, NSW 2033, Australia",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Agathangelidis, I (corresponding author), Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Dept Phys, Athens 15784, Greece.",iliasaga@phys.uoa.gr; ckartali@phys.uoa.gr; m.santamouris@unsw.edu.au,"Mat, Santamouris/AAP-2836-2021","Santamouris, Matthaios/0000-0001-6076-3526","European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) through the Operational Programme Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning [MIS-5000432]","European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) through the Operational Programme Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning","This research is co-financed by Greece and the European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) through the Operational Programme Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning in the context of the project Strengthening Human Resources Research Potential via Doctorate Research (MIS-5000432), implemented by the State Scholarships Foundation (IK gamma).",,151,16,16,8,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,JUN,2019,7,6,,,,,,,75,10.3390/cli7060075,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli7060075,,,28,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,II6RT,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000475321700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adaptive management is commonly put forward as the preferred approach for managing uncertainty and change in environmental flows. However, we contend that a simple adaptive management loop falls short of meeting the challenges posed by climate change. Rather, a fundamental rethink is required to ensure both the structure of environmental flows assessments, along with each individual technical element, actively acknowledges the multiple dimensions of change, variability and complexity in socio-ecological systems. This paper outlines how environmental flow assessments can explicitly address the uncertainty and change inherent in adaptively managing multiple values for management of environmental flows. While non-stationarity and uncertainty are well recognised in the climate literature, these have not been addressed within the structure of environmental flows methodologies. Here, we present an environmental flow assessment that is structured to explicitly consider future change and uncertainty in climate and socio-ecological values, by examining scenarios using ecological models. The environmental flow assessment methodology further supports adaptive management through the intentional integration of participatory approaches and the inclusion of diverse stakeholders. We present a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, highlighting how this methodology facilitates adaptive management. Rethinking our approach to environmental flows assessments is an important step in ensuring that environmental flows continue to work effectively as a management tool under climate change.","[Horne, Avril C.; Webb, J.

Using Landsat 8 satellite imagery, we quantified the effects of building density on land surface temperature (K) across 21 cities in China and analysed their spatial patterns, possible factors, and mechanisms. Results showed that the effects of building density on LST were more significant in areas with dry climates compared to humid climates. The spatial variability in the effects of building density on LST was closely related to climate conditions, soil type, and vegetation. The results from stepwise regression analysis showed that precipitation (climate) controlled the spatial variability, indicating that there is a complex mechanism underlying these potential factors. Furthermore, the results from climatic zoning statistics revealed that the K-values of northern Chinese cities were positively correlated with the areas of local water bodies. However, the K-values of southern Chinese cities were significantly and positively correlated with the mean annual temperature and aridity and were negatively correlated with population density. Stepwise regression results further indicated that the mean annual temperature may be the most influential factor for southern cities. These results highlight the spatial variance and different determinants of K and suggest that climate-adapted urban design and planning standards are needed in different climate zones.","[Song, Jinchao; Huang, Ke; Prishchepov, Alexander, V] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Chen, Wei; Zhang, Jianjun] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jianjun] Minist Land & Resources, Key Lab Land Consolidat & Rehabil, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Huang, Ke] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Hou, Boyan] Xian Tieyi Sch, Int Cooperat Sch, Xian 710054, Peoples R China","University of Copenhagen; China University of Geosciences; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Song, JC (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark.;Zhang, JJ (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.;Zhang, JJ (corresponding author), Minist Land & Resources, Key Lab Land Consolidat & Rehabil, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",songjinchao08@163.com; zhangjianjun@cugb.edu.cn,"Prishchepov, Alexander/H-6708-2012","Prishchepov, Alexander/0000-0003-2375-1651",,,,,84,48,50,11,98,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-2046,1872-6062,,LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN,Landsc.

To better understand local climate, 35-year-long time series of air temperature, relative humidity and rainfall were analyzed along the reef corridor of the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. Data came from a climatological model and to assess its local performance, differences with in situ records were estimated when available. All three variables showed coherence with the record of the North Atlantic high-pressure system (also known as the Bermuda High) at similar times and periods between 4 to 8 and >10 years, evidencing the influence, at this regional scale, of El Nifio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Positive and negative anomalies showed linear trends depicting an increase of warmer and moister events during a seasonal climatology at the reef corridor of the southwestern Gulf of Mexico and a relatively higher correlation (> 0.5) with the AMO mode. Return periods of extreme values varied between 5 and 10 years. In general, trends and extreme events showed similar patterns at a regional scale, but the increase in rainfall is expected to be larger near the central location of the study area. A higher frequency of extreme events could threaten local ecosystems and human populations; therefore, plans and actions at local scales of governance are needed to achieve preemptive climate adaptation.","[de Jesus Salas-Perez, Jose; Guillermo Jordan-Garza, Adan] Univ Veracruzana, Fac Ciencias Biol & Agr, Tuxpan, Veracruz, Mexico; [Salas-Monreal, David] Univ Veracruzana, Inst Ciencias Marinas & Pesquerias, Boca Del Rio, Veracruz, Mexico",Universidad Veracruzana; Universidad Veracruzana,"Salas-Perez, JD (corresponding author), Univ Veracruzana, Fac Ciencias Biol & Agr, Tuxpan, Veracruz, Mexico.",jsalasp39@yahoo.es,"Jordán-Garza, Adán Guillermo/ABE-4089-2021","Jordán-Garza, Adán Guillermo/0000-0002-9856-2276",,,,,62,2,2,4,11,CENTRO CIENCIAS ATMOSFERA UNAM,MEXICO CITY,"CIRCUITO EXTERIOR, MEXICO CITY CU 04510, MEXICO",0187-6236,2395-8812,,ATMOSFERA,Atmosfera,APR,2020,33,2,,,,,143,157,,10.20937/ATM.52730,http://dx.doi.org/10.20937/ATM.52730,,,15,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,PD7YT,,Bronze,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000597896400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since China is still in the process of urbanisation, the greatest challenge it faces is finding a balance between economic growth and keeping carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emission rates at a manageable level. Cities in China play a key role in the implementation of the central policies and make concrete actions in response to climate change. With reference to a series of recent policy papers and action plans as the background, this paper attempts to provide a critical overview of China's climate change action plans from the national to the city and urban level. It seeks to understand whether the proposed responses to climate change and strategies for actions on greening and air corridors for cities and urban areas are appropriate. It is found that for China to advance its urban climatic adaptation strategy there is a need for (1) urban data, (2) a cross-disciplinary impact assessment, and (3) the development of a market and policy transformation mechanism.

There is now increased attention paid to climate-agriculture links as the world is focused on climate change. This has shown the need for it understanding of current and future climate and the links to agricultural investment decisions, particularly farmers' decisions, and that integrated strategies for coping with climate change need to start with managing current climate risk. Research, largely from an Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa (ASARECA) project to demonstrate the value of such increased understanding, is presented in this issue of the journal. Key lessons from this research are as follows: 1. Statistical methods of analysis of historical climate data that are relevant to agriculture need not be complex. The most critical point is to describe the climate in terms of events of direct relevance to farming (such as the date of the start of a rainy season) rather than simple standard measures (such as annual total rainfall). 2. Analysis requires access to relevant data, tools and expertise. Daily climate data, both current and historical, arc primarily the responsibility of national meteorological services (NMS). Accessing such data, particularly daily data, is not always easy. Including stall from the NMS as research partners, not just data providers, can reduce this problem. 3. Farmers' perceptions of climate variation, risk and change are complex. They are keenly aware of variability, but there is evidence that they over-estimate risks of negative impacts and thereby Fill to make use of good conditions when they occur. There is also evidence that multiple causes of changes arc confounded, so farmers who observe decreasing crop production may not be distinguishing between rainfall change and declining soil fertility or other conditions. Hence any project working with farmers' coping and adaptation to climate must also have access to analyses of observed climate data (Foal nearby recording stations. 4. Mechanisms for reducing and coping with risks are exemplified in pastoral systems that exist in the most variable environments. New approaches to risk transfer, such as index-based insurance, show potential for positive impact. 5. Skilful seasonal forecasts, which give a better indication of the coming season than a simple average, would help farmers take decisions for the coming cropping season. Increasing meteorological knowledge shows that such forecasting is possible for parts of Africa. There are institutional barriers to farmers accessing and using the forecast information. Furthermore, the skill of the forecasts is currently limited so that there are maybe still only a few rational choices for a farmer to make on the basis of a forecast. With the justified current: interest in climate and agriculture, all stakeholders including researchers, data providers, policy developers and extension workers will need to work together to ensure that interventions are based on a correct interpretation of a valid analysis of relevant data.","[Coe, R.; Stern, R.

One of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change is agriculture because farming relies heavily on planning for weather and seasons according to experience of past years, and therefore changes in seasons and unusual weather patterns lead to loss of crops or livestock. Responding to climate change impacts requires both mitigation and adaptation, in which communication plays an important role to raise awareness, change behaviours and gain policy support. Gain vs. loss message framing has been extensively studied in persuasive communication. Despite successful examples in risk communication, the effect of gain vs. loss message framing method in communicating climate change, a psychologically distant risk, is still not well understood. This study combines message persuasiveness with psychological distance to develop messages to encourage farmers on climate adaptation. We applied a 2 x 2 factorial design (gain/loss and abstract/concrete framed messages) and conducted the research in a coastal farming community (N = 368). Findings confirm that gain-framed messages are more effective in raising risk perceptions and efficacy, with stronger impact on behavioural intentions toward climate change, compared to loss-framed messages. Above all, farmers were more willing to take adaptation measures when exposed to gain- in combination with concrete-framed messages vs. loss- and abstract-framed. Implications for climate change communication research and practice are discussed.","[Chinh Cong Ngo] AMDI, Asian Management & Dev Inst, Res Ctr Disaster Risk Reduct & Climate Change, Trinh Van Bo St Xuan Phuong Ward, Hanoi 10000, Vietnam; [Chinh Cong Ngo; Poortvliet, P.

Long-term culture change across the circumpolar Arctic was often highly dynamic, with episodes of rapid migration, regional abandonment, and-in some cases-the disappearance or wholesale replacement of entire cultural traditions. By the 1960s, researchers were exploring the possibility that warming episodes had positive effects on cold-adapted premodern peoples in the Arctic by (a) reducing the extent of sea ice, (b) expanding the size and range of marine mammal populations, and (c) opening new waterways and hunting areas for marine-adapted human groups. Although monocausal climatic arguments for change are now regarded as overly simplistic, the growing threat of contemporary Arctic warming to Indigenous livelihoods has given wider relevance to research into long-term culture-climate interactions. With their capacity to examine deeper cultural responses to climate change, archaeologists are in a unique position to generate human-scale climate adaptation insights that may inform future planning and mitigation efforts. The exceptionally well-preserved cultural and paleo-ecological sequences of the Arctic make it one of the best-suited regions on Earth to address such problems. Ironically, while archaeologists employ an exciting and highly promising new generation of methods and approaches to examine long-term fragility and resilience in Arctic social-ecological systems, many of these frozen paleo-societal archives are fast disappearing due to anthropogenic warming.","[Desjardins, Sean P.

Questions of how human societies and organisations learn and transition on the basis of environmental knowledge relate to the core ideas of ecological economics with its pluralistic understanding of human behaviour in contrast to the limited focus on incentive-driven behaviour. Our study analyses the emergence and thematic foci of social learning studies within ecological economics over the past 15 years. We selected and analysed 54 articles published after peer review in established journals adhering to the epistemological tradition of ecological economics. This study is guided by the interest in how social learning is conceptualised, how this research is positioned in terms of process dynamics, causal factors and outcomes of learning. Results show, that the number of related papers grew substantially in recent years. Also the role of formal or informal institutions has been found to be a strong causal factor for social learning and change processes vis-A-vis technological, economic or political factors. In addition, there is a growing awareness of social learning processes in various environmental policy fields such as biodiversity governance, water and land management, fisheries, and climate adaptation. We conclude that these insights can give new impulses to research on socio-ecological transition and to the related debate on societal change and transformation processes as core topics for ecological economics.

Climate change models currently identify a heightening of Bihar's flood risk, as rainfall patterns become more intense and Himalayan glaciers recede. During the past half century, the major strategy deployed by the State and national governments to address the risk of floods has involved the construction of embankments: raised areas of land that seek to control river flow and provide temporary sanctuaries for flood-affected populations. In this article, qualitative data from interviews with flood-affected villagers and policy makers at local, district and State levels are used to assess the social implications of embankments as an adaptive response to flood risk. Evidence from these testimonies leads us to conceptualise embankments as contributing to recursive cycles of vulnerability, in which women, children and poorer social segments have been unwitting bearers. Hence, reliance on embankments is a maladaptation that perpetuates, if not exacerbates, the severe manifestations of social and economic inequality that continue to plague rural Bihar. Perhaps not surprisingly, the voices of those whose lives have been made more difficult by embankments are heard all too infrequently in policy debates. This emphasises the need for climate adaptation initiatives to be anchored in a sustainable livelihood approach, for which the prime analytical objective is to understand the factors that enable or constrain the abilities of people, especially those who are most vulnerable, to make decisions about their lives.","[Pritchard, Bill; Thielemans, Rebeka] Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Pritchard, B (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Human Geog Res Grp, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",bill.pritchard@sydney.edu.au,,"Pritchard, Bill/0000-0001-7506-2095",,,,,40,9,9,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-9182,1465-3311,,AUST GEOGR,Aust.

This work is part of the regional climate adaptation project nordwest2050 aiming at innovative solutions toward a climate-proof and resilient region. Methodologically, we extended the established vulnerability assessment based on climate change impacts by a structural analysis, highlighting general weaknesses of the metropolitan energy system. Our findings indicate that the structural vulnerabilities of the energy system around Bremen-Oldenburg pose a greater threat to maintaining the system's services than climate change itself. Climate-change-based vulnerabilities, however, aggravate many of the structural vulnerabilities and therefore demand attention in their own right. The structural vulnerabilities mainly originate from political and regulatory uncertainties, turbulent market conditions, conflicts along the supply chains, and the current dynamics in the energy sector induced by increased climate mitigation efforts. One of our main conclusions is thus that the metropolitan energy system's capabilities to handle turbulence, perturbations, and surprises must be improved. This will also help in reducing the climate-change vulnerabilities, because such a system is better equipped when facing currently hard-to-predict changes in climate parameters. The results of the assessment described here will be used as the starting point to find options for innovations toward a climate-proof and resilient energy system for the region in the course of the remaining project.","[Goessling-Reisemann, Stefan; Wachsmuth, Jakob; Stuehrmann, Soenke; von Gleich, Arnim] Univ Bremen, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen,"Gossling-Reisemann, S (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Enrique Schmidt Str 7, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",sgr@uni-bremen.de,"Gößling-Reisemann, Stefan/J-8974-2013","Gößling-Reisemann, Stefan/0000-0002-9453-2571; Wachsmuth, Jakob/0000-0001-9562-5609",German Ministry for Education and Research (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung) as part of its KLIMZUG initiative,German Ministry for Education and Research (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung) as part of its KLIMZUG initiative,"This article was made possible, in part, through support by a grant from the German Ministry for Education and Research (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung) as part of its KLIMZUG initiative.

As an abundant renewable resource, today, wind is increasingly seen as a critical resource to help tackle issues associated with rapid urbanization and climate adaptation and mitigation, such as improving thermal comfort, providing clean energy, improving air quality, and reducing carbon emissions. Despite the growing importance of wind as an invaluable resource for cities, wind in the context of urban planning and design is a relatively understudied area of research. This study aims to explore the means by which cities that can benefit from wind and ways urban planning and design can help deliver these benefits. The study adopts a systematic literature review methodological approach. The findings disclosed that: (a) improving urban wind environment via sound urban planning and design may enhance urban ventilation and energy performance; (b) better urban ventilation and energy performance enable cities to become climate positive or net zero and relieve the urgent climate crisis; (c) wind sensitive urban design is an emerging research area critical to harvest the benefits of wind for cities.

This article analyzes rainfall and temperature change effects on household food security in Kimandi-Wanyaga, in Murang'a County, Kenya. Both the meteorological and the community perceptions were analyzed. Monthly rainfall and temperature data for Thika Meteorological Station were analyzed for trends using MAKESENS procedure. The community perceptions data obtained through household survey, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and content analysis. The study hypotheses were tested using chi-square tests. The community perceived inadequate rainfall during crop growth (79%), reduced rainfall intensity (77%) and erratic onset and cessation of seasonal rainfall (73%) had interrupted their crop productivity. These disagreed with MAKESENS rainfall trends that showed statistically insignificant rainfall variability (alpha > 0.1). The community's warmer temperature perceptions agreed with observed rising maximum temperature trend at 0.001 significance level. This study observed a significant relationship between the community's perceived local rainfall and temperature changes, and household food security. For robust and strategically designed climate policies and programs for food security, governments need to communicate to policy makers the perceptions of smallholder farmers involved in autonomous climate adaptation.","[Ngure, Mary W.] Univ Nairobi, Inst Climate Change & Adaptat ICCA, Dept Earth & Climate Sci, POB 21162-00505, Nairobi, Kenya; [Wandiga, Shem O.; Olago, Daniel O.; Oriaso, Silas O.] Univ Nairobi, Inst Climate Change & Adaptat ICCA, Dept Earth & Climate Sci, POB 30197-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Wandiga, Shem O.] Univ Nairobi, Dept Chem, POB 30197-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Oriaso, Silas O.] Univ Nairobi, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, POB 30197-00100, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Nairobi; University of Nairobi; University of Nairobi; University of Nairobi,"Ngure, MW (corresponding author), Univ Nairobi, Inst Climate Change & Adaptat ICCA, Dept Earth & Climate Sci, POB 21162-00505, Nairobi, Kenya.",mngure2013@gmail.com,,,,,,,88,0,0,0,2,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",2391-9531,,,OPEN AGRIC,Open Agric.,OCT 18,2021,6,1,,,,,587,608,,10.1515/opag-2021-0042,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/opag-2021-0042,,,22,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Agriculture,XU9LR,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000734577600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Moreover, climate change is projected to lead to increasingly frequent wildfires and additional annual area burned in forests historically characterized by long fire return intervals. Western Oregon and Washington, USA (westside) have experienced few large wildfires (fires greater than 100 hectares) the past century and are characterized to infrequent large fires with return intervals greater than 500 years. We evaluated impacts of climate change on wildfire hazard in a major urban watershed outside Portland, OR, USA. We simulated wildfire occurrence and fire regime characteristics under contemporary conditions (1992-2015) and four mid-century (2040-2069) scenarios using Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5. Simulated mid-century fire seasons expanded in most scenarios, in some cases by nearly two months. In all scenarios, average fire size and frequency projections increased significantly. Fire regime characteristics under the hottest and driest mid-century scenarios illustrate novel disturbance regimes which could result in permanent changes to forest structure and composition and the provision of ecosystem services. Managers and planners can use the range of modeled outputs and simulation results to inform robust strategies for climate adaptation and risk mitigation.","[McEvoy, Andy] USFS PNW Res Stn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [McEvoy, Andy; Nielsen-Pincus, Max; Gleason, Kelly E.] Portland State Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Management, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Holz, Andres; Catalano, Arielle J.] Portland State Univ, Dept Geog, Portland, OR 97201 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Portland State University; Portland State University,"McEvoy, A (corresponding author), USFS PNW Res Stn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.;McEvoy, A (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Management, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",andrew.mcevoy2@usda.gov; maxnp@pdx.edu; andres.holz@pdx.edu; acat2@pdx.edu; k.gleason@pdx.edu,"Holz, Andres/D-1826-2014","Holz, Andres/0000-0002-8587-2603; Nielsen-Pincus, Max/0000-0002-0847-4820; McEvoy, Andrew/0000-0002-4152-6776",United States Forest Service (USFS) Research Participation Program; National Science Foundation award [1738104],United States Forest Service (USFS) Research Participation Program; National Science Foundation award(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"A.M. was supported in part by an appointment to the United States Forest Service (USFS) Research Participation Program administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) through an interagency agreement between the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). c All opinions expressed in this paper are the author's and do not necessarily reflect the policies and views of USDA, DOE, or ORAU/ORISE.

Urban road infrastructure is equally important for the efficient functioning of society and it is imperative to understand the peculiarities of adapting these types of roads, however, existing frameworks may not be appropriate for this purpose. This paper presents a conceptual framework called the Expanded Adaptation Action Cycles (EAAC) that conceptualizes in a simple, yet comprehensive manner the adaptation planning processes of urban road infrastructure. A case study of the decision-making processes for the development and maintenance of the road network of Bogota, Colombia was conducted to demonstrate the practical utility of this framework as a diagnostic tool. Analysing the evidence collected using the EAAC framework indicates that the city is currently at the early stages of its adaptation planning and that the adaptation measures being considered suggest that, at most, the city is aiming to implement incremental adaptation. This demonstrates how the EAAC framework provides the ability to understand the relative position of a city's approach to adaptation planning within a wider spectrum of possibilities, providing insight into the potential impact of possible planning interventions.","[Canavera Herrera, Juan Sebastian; MacAskill, Kristen; Haigh, Stuart] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England",University of Cambridge,"MacAskill, K (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England.",jsc80@cam.ac.uk; kam71@cam.ac.uk; skh20@cam.ac.uk,,"Canavera Herrera, Juan Sebastian/0000-0002-9913-3430",Alcaldia Mayor de Bogota; CEIBA Foundation (Fundacion Ceiba) through the scholarship Beca Rodolfo Llin as para la promocion de la formacion avanzada y el espiritu cientifico en Bogot a; Cambridge Trust; EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Infrastructure and Built Environment [EP/L016095/1],Alcaldia Mayor de Bogota; CEIBA Foundation (Fundacion Ceiba) through the scholarship Beca Rodolfo Llin as para la promocion de la formacion avanzada y el espiritu cientifico en Bogot a; Cambridge Trust; EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Infrastructure and Built Environment(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This research has been funded by the Mayor of Bogota (Alcaldia Mayor de Bogota) and the CEIBA Foundation (Fundacion Ceiba) through the scholarship Beca Rodolfo Llin as para la promocion de la formacion avanzada y el espiritu cientifico en Bogot a; and by the Cambridge Trust.; This research was developed at the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Infrastructure and Built Environment (EPSRC grant reference number EP/L016095/1).,,49,4,4,0,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1361-9209,1879-2340,,TRANSPORT RES D-TR E,Transport.

This risk is compounded by future climatic and socioeconomic changes due to the increasing temperature and humidity, rising sea level, changing frequency and intensity of hurricanes, and amplifying exposure and consequences to adverse events. These future conditions, however, involve deep uncertainty, making life-cycle risk assessment and management extremely difficult. To address this challenge, a novel approach is proposed to identify, among various factors related to climatic and socioeconomic changes, the vulnerability of coastal bridges that could lead to unacceptable life-cycle risk. The considered factors include temperature increase, sea level rise, hurricane frequency and intensity, and socioeconomic growth. The acceptable risk is derived from the threshold reliability index of existing structures and the associated failure consequences. The entire space of relevant factors is divided into acceptable and unacceptable categories using Latin hypercube sampling and life-cycle risk assessment. Advanced analysis tools, including feature scoring, scenario discovery, and dimensional stacking, are then used to pinpoint the driving factors of bridge vulnerability and their thresholds that are prone to create unacceptable risk. The proposed approach is applied to a representative bridge in a coastal setting. The implication of the approach on robust decision-making about climate adaptation is also discussed.

Identifying where ES originate and to whom the benefits flow-under current and future climate conditions-is especially critical in rapidly developing countries, where the risk of ES loss is high. Here, using Myanmar as a case study, we assess where and how ecosystems provide key benefits to the country's people and infrastructure. We model the supply of and demand for sediment retention, dry-season baseflows, flood risk reduction and coastal storm protection from multiple beneficiaries. We find that locations currently providing the greatest amount of services are likely to remain important under the range of climate conditions considered, demonstrating their importance in planning for climate resilience. Overlap between priority areas for ES provision and biodiversity conservation is higher than expected by chance overall, but the areas important for multiple ES are under-represented in currently designated protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas. Our results are contributing to development planning in Myanmar, and our approach could be extended to other contexts where there is demand for national-scale natural capital information to shape development plans and policies.","[Mandle, Lisa; Wolny, Stacie; Hamel, Perrine] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Nat Capital Project, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Mandle, Lisa; Wolny, Stacie; Hamel, Perrine] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bhagabati, Nirmal; Bartlett, Ryan; Dixon, Adam] World Wildlife Fund, 1250 24th St,NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Helsingen, Hanna; Myint, Sai Nay Won; Myint, Win] World Wide Fund Nat, Yangon, Myanmar; [Dixon, Adam] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Dept Geog & Environm Syst, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA; [Horton, Radley; Lesk, Corey; Manley, Danielle; De Mel, Manishka; Bader, Daniel] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Ctr Climate Syst Res, New York, NY USA; [Horton, Radley; Lesk, Corey; Manley, Danielle; De Mel, Manishka; Bader, Daniel] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Mon, Myat Su] Minist Nat Resources & Environm Conservat, Forest Dept, Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar",Stanford University; Stanford University; World Wildlife Fund; World Wildlife Fund; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County; Columbia University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Mandle, L (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Nat Capital Project, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Mandle, L (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",lmandle@stanford.edu,,"Mandle, Lisa/0000-0002-1420-8529; Horton, Radley/0000-0002-5574-9962",Leona M. and Harry B.

National scale yield-temperature relationships show that there are clear negative yield responses of maize, wheat, and soybean to increased growing-season temperature. Regional scale yield-temperature relationships show that over 50 % of the arable land exhibited yield susceptibility to past warming trends, with maize showing the highest vulnerability and rice the lowest vulnerability. However, in most of the main food-producing areas, crops experienced increases or insignificant changes in yields due to better agronomic management. The Loess plain is revealed as the most vulnerable region to the past warming, as at least two food crops have exhibited the signs of warming susceptibility in the majority of the area. We also find considerable yield reductions in spring wheat in the central northeast, winter wheat in the Yellow River basin, and maize in Southwest China. These findings of hotspot areas are valuable in prioritizing future climate adaptation strategies for Chinese agriculture.","[Xiong, Wei] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Wei] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Holman, Ian P.] Cranfield Univ, Cranfield Water Sci Inst, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England; [You, Liangzhi] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Yang, Jie] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Wu, Wenbin] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Environment & Sustainable Development in Agriculture, CAAS; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Cranfield University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); China Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning, CAAS","Xiong, W (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",xiongwei8848@hotmail.com,"Holman, Ian/A-7108-2010; xiong, wei/O-1782-2014","Holman, Ian/0000-0002-5263-7746; Xiong, Wei/0000-0003-2007-8190","National Basic Research Program of China [2010CB951504, 2012CB95904]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41171093]; National Scientific Program [2012BAC19B01]",National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Scientific Program,"This research was jointly supported by National Basic Research Program of China (project no. 2010CB951504, 2012CB95904) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41171093), and National Scientific Program (No. 2012BAC19B01).

Adaptive solutions must be designed locally with stakeholders. We developed the Approach for Building Adaptation Scenarios with Stakeholders (ABASS), which aims to identify adaptation policies and corresponding scenarios of natural resource management in the context of climate change. Its originality is the combination of different existing participatory methods, organized in three phases. In step 1, experts identify local environmental problems on a map and build the assumption tree of local climate change effects. In step 2, experts identify stakeholders. Step 3 leads to the construction of adaptation scenarios with stakeholders in two phases. First, in a participatory workshop gathering numerous stakeholders, the assumption tree is presented to help stakeholders identify potential policies that address the effects of climate change. Then, using the map produced in step 1, each group of stakeholders separately translates each potential policy into a detailed scenario. We applied ABASS to the context of groundwater overexploitation in South India. Two policies at the farm level emerged as consensual: (i) ponds to harvest runoff water and (ii) drip irrigation to conserve water; but their implementation highlights the differences of opinion among stakeholders.","[Baccar, Mariem; Bergez, Jacques-Eric; Leenhardt, Delphine] Univ Toulouse, INRAE, AGIR, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Couture, Stephane] INRA, MIAT, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Sekhar, Muddu; Ruiz, Laurent] Indian Inst Sci, Indo French Cell Water Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; [Ruiz, Laurent] INRAE, Inst Agro, SAS, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Ruiz, Laurent] UPS, CNRS, IRD, GET, F-31400 Toulouse, France",INRAE; INRAE; Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore; INRAE; Institut Agro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier,"Baccar, M (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, INRAE, AGIR, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.",mariem.baccar@inrae.fr; jacques-eric.bergez@inrae.fr; stephane.couture@inrae.fr; muddu@iisc.ac.in; laurent.ruiz@inrae.fr; delphine.burger-leenhardt@inrae.fr,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; IFCWS, LMI/C-5187-2013","Sekhar, Muddu/0000-0001-9326-1813",project ATCHA [ANR-16-CE03-0006],project ATCHA,The study was funded by the project ATCHA ANR-16-CE03-0006.,,58,3,3,4,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2021,13,15,,,,,,,8459,10.3390/su13158459,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13158459,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TW2FT,,"Green Published, Green Accepted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000682223600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A literature review identified climate change and health adaptation frameworks for comparison with the Ontario Public Health Standards. Key informant interviews gauged the extent to which climate change risks are currently considered in policy and planning. Ontario's Public Health Standards already require many of the risk management activities identified in climate change and health adaptation frameworks. However, public health officials require additional information about linkages between climate change and health to manage risks. Risk management activities such as population health assessments, surveillance and public education and outreach can address many key risks related to climate hazards when information about the risks, vulnerable populations and time scales is made available to health officials. The development, analysis and transfer of this information should be considered a priority at all levels within the public health sector.","[Clarke, Kaila-Lea] Univ Ottawa, Dept Geog, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Clarke, Kaila-Lea; Berry, Peter] Hlth Canada, Water Air & Climate Change Bur, Ottawa, ON K1A 0L2, Canada",University of Ottawa; Health Canada,"Clarke, KL (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Geog, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",kaila-lea_clarke@hc-sc.gc.ca,,,,,,,39,11,11,1,21,SPRINGER BASEL AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",1661-8556,1661-8564,,INT J PUBLIC HEALTH,Int.

The objective of this study was to determine the suitable times for broadcasting rice crops in the rice cultivation paddies belonging to Long Xuyen Quadrilateral as a mitigation solution to the negative ICC. To conduct this research, crop model namely the FAO-AquaCrop (Version 6.0) was selected to simulate grain yields of rice crops based on different scenarios of crop broadcasting calendar (CBC). The results point out that the grain yield of winter-spring (WS) and summer-autumn (SA) cropping seasons can increase up to 6.2% and 5.3% if the CBC is delayed from 7 to 14 d compared to the current broadcasting calendar (baseline) in the two experimental areas while the grain yield of the autumn-winter (AW) cropping season can increase 6.4% if the CBC is shifted 14 d compared to the baseline. In general, a shift in the CBC for all rice broadcasting crops compared to the baseline can be considered as an effective solution to minimize the negative impacts of weather factors as well as contribute to improve rice productivity.","[Dang Truong An] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Sustainable Management Nat Resources & Environm R, Ho Chi Minh City 070000, Vietnam",Ton Duc Thang University,"An, DT (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Sustainable Management Nat Resources & Environm R, Ho Chi Minh City 070000, Vietnam.",dangtruongan@tdtu.edu.vn,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,3,INST INVESTIGACIONES AGROPECUARIAS,CHILLAN,"CENTRO REGIONAL DE INVESTIGACION QUILAMAPU, CASILLA 426, CHILLAN, 00000, CHILE",0718-5839,,,CHIL J AGR RES,Chil.

As societies slowly come to grips with the possibility of not being able to save everything that is valued, there is an urgent need to identify what is most important for individuals and groups, to prioritise action and prevent or minimise intolerable losses. Yet, people's priorities vary greatly; individual choices are contingent on what people hold dear in the places they inhabit, which in turn is shaped by their positioning in society and everyday experiences with harm and loss. In this article, we draw on recent epistemological and ontological engagements with climate adaptation and loss from the social sciences to examine how individuals consider their options to protect what they value most in the face of climatic impacts. Drawing on 80+ interviews with residents along an urban-rural transect in Western Australia, we first demonstrate the complex and dynamic nature of individual decision-making 'worlds'. We do this by using an innovative methodology that allows participants to visualise their value trade-offs, in the present and the future. We then examine similarities and differences between these worlds to show where priorities converge and diverge. We argue that attention to intersecting, conflicting, and potentially uncomfortable processes of prioritisation, and the losses and omissions they (re)produce, provide crucial entry points to negotiate adaptation and navigate risks within and across communities in ways that are inclusive, fair, and sustainable.","[Henrique, Karen Paiva; Tschakert, Petra] Univ Western Australia, Sch Social Sci, Dept Geog & Planning, Perth, WA, Australia; [Henrique, Karen Paiva] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res AISSR, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev GPIO, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [du Coudray, Chantal Bourgault] Univ Western Australia, Sch Humanities, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA, Australia; [Horwitz, Pierre] Edith Cowan Univ, Ctr People Pl & Planet, Joondalup, WA, Australia; [Horwitz, Pierre] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Sci, Joondalup, WA, Australia; [Krueger, Kai Daniel Christian; Wheeler, Alexander James] Univ Western Australia, UWA Sch Agr & Environm, Perth, WA, Australia",University of Western Australia; University of Amsterdam; University of Western Australia; Edith Cowan University; Edith Cowan University; University of Western Australia,"Henrique, KP (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Roeterseilandcampus,Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",k.paivahenrique@uva.nl,"; Bourgault du Coudray, Chantal/H-8868-2014","Henrique, Karen Paiva/0000-0002-2163-2854; Bourgault du Coudray, Chantal/0000-0002-2155-2512",Australian Research Council [ARC] [DP180103700],Australian Research Council [ARC](Australian Research Council),"We would like to thank Elise Haddleton, Neville Ellis, and Ben Johnson for their help with data collection and data entry.

Development time of the strains differed significantly only when exposed to 15A degrees, 20A degrees, and 25A degrees C. Cumulative fertility and longevity differed significantly at 15A degrees and 20A degrees C. Realized fertility differed significantly at all constant temperatures. Emergence rates of all strains were less than 65% and were decreased even further as temperature increased. Female-biased sex ratio ranged from 65% to 100% at all constant temperatures. The low temperature threshold for T. aurosum was 10A degrees C and the mean number of degree-days at 15A degrees, 20A degrees, 25A degrees and 30A degrees C was 175, 183, 173 and 185, respectively. The Bavarian strain tolerated high temperatures and had the highest parasitization capability, while the Hessian strain had the lowest parasitization at all temperatures. Fertility life table analysis revealed a major effect of temperature on the population growth parameters. Net reproductive rate was highest at intermediate constant temperatures in all strains, with the highest rate recorded for the Bavarian strains at all constant temperatures. Mean cohort generation time, and population doubling time decreased as temperature increased. The daily intrinsic rate of increase and finite rate of increase were positively correlated with temperature.

The vulnerability of crops to different climatic conditions like exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive indicators along with its different components and agribusiness has been studied. The study uses data collected over the past six decades from 1960 to 2020. Analytical tools such as the Tobit regression model and Principal Component Analysis were used for the investigation which has shown that among climatic parameters, an increase in temperature along with huge variations in rainfall and consistent increase in CO2 emissions have had a negative impact by reducing crop productivity, particularly cereals (26 percent) and oilseed (35 percent). Among various factors, adaptive factors such as cropping intensity, agricultural machinery, and livestock density in combination with sensitivity factors such as average operational land holding size and productivity of cereals, and exposure indicators like Kharif (June-September) temperature, heavy rainfall, and rate of change in maximum and minimum Rabi (October-February) temperature have contributed significantly in increasing crop vulnerability. The agribusiness model needs to be more inclusive. It should pay attention to small and remote farmers, and provide them with inclusive finance that can facilitate the adoption of climate-smart financial innovations, serve the underserved segments, and help them reach the target of a sustainable and inclusive agribusiness model. Though the social, technological, and economic initiatives can enhance the adaptive capacity of farmers, political measures still have a major role to play in providing a healthy climate for agriculture in India through tailored adaptive approaches like the adoption of craft climate adaptation program, dilating the irrigation coverage and location-centric management options.

While it is well understood that more frequent and intense climate events in many areas are resulting in a decline in crop yields, the impact on crop quality is less acknowledged, yet it is critical for food systems that benefit both farmers and consumers through high-quality products. This study examines tea (Camellia sinensis; Theaceae), the world's most widely consumed beverage after water, as a study system to measure effects of seasonal precipitation variability on crop functional quality and associated farmer knowledge, preferences, and livelihoods. Sampling was conducted in a major tea producing area of China during an extreme drought through the onset of the East Asian Monsoon in order to capture effects of extreme climate events that are likely to become more frequent with climate change. Compared to the spring drought, tea growth during the monsoon period was up to 50% higher. Concurrently, concentrations of catechin and methylxanthine secondary metabolites, major compounds that determine tea functional quality, were up to 50% lower during the monsoon while total phenolic concentrations and antioxidant activity increased. The inverse relationship between tea growth and concentrations of individual secondary metabolites suggests a dilution effect of precipitation on tea quality. The decrease in concentrations of tea secondary metabolites was accompanied by reduced farmer preference on the basis of sensory characteristics as well as a decline of up to 50% in household income from tea sales. Farmer surveys indicate a high degree of agreement regarding climate patterns and the effects of precipitation on tea yields and quality. Extrapolating findings from this seasonal study to long-term climate scenario projections suggests that farmers and consumers face variable implications with forecasted precipitation scenarios and calls for research on management practices to facilitate climate adaptation for sustainable crop production.","[Ahmed, Selena] Montana State Univ, Dept Hlth & Human Dev, Sustainable Food & Bioenergy Syst Program, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Ahmed, Selena; Orians, Colin; Buckley, Sarabeth] Tufts Univ, Dept Biol, Medford, MA USA; [Ahmed, Selena; Stepp, John Richard; Xue, Dayuan; Long, Chunlin; Kennelly, Edward] Minzu Univ China, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Stepp, John Richard] Univ Gainesville, Dept Anthropol, Gainesville, FL USA; [Griffin, Timothy; Cash, Sean] Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Matyas, Corene] Univ Gainesville, Dept Geog, Gainesville, FL USA; [Robbat, Albert] Tufts Univ, Dept Chem, Medford, MA USA; [Unachukwu, Uchenna; Kennelly, Edward] CUNY, Grad Ctr, Dept Biochem, New York, NY USA; [Small, David] Tufts Univ, Sch Engn, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; Tufts University; Minzu University of China; Tufts University; Tufts University; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Tufts University,"Ahmed, S (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Dept Hlth & Human Dev, Sustainable Food & Bioenergy Syst Program, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",selena.ahmed@montana.edu,"Matyas, Corene/A-6435-2008; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Matyas, Corene/0000-0002-9773-2501; Kennelly, Edward/0000-0002-1682-2696; Stepp, John Richard/0000-0001-9594-9187; Cash, Sean/0000-0002-7561-3392; Long, Chunlin/0000-0002-6573-6049; Ahmed, Selena/0000-0001-5779-0697; Orians, Colin/0000-0003-3773-0894; unachukwu, uchenna/0000-0001-8248-5723","TEACRS Program (NIGMS) at Tufts University [IRACDA-K12GM074869]; Program 111 in Ethnobiology of the Chinese Ministry in Education/Minzu University of China; Tufts Institute of the Environment; Tropical Conservation and Development Program at the University of Florida; Tufts University Provost Office; NSF REU Program at Tufts University (NSF) [DBI 1005082]; NSF Coupled Natural Human Systems (NSF) [BCS-1313775]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1313775] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","TEACRS Program (NIGMS) at Tufts University; Program 111 in Ethnobiology of the Chinese Ministry in Education/Minzu University of China; Tufts Institute of the Environment; Tropical Conservation and Development Program at the University of Florida; Tufts University Provost Office; NSF REU Program at Tufts University (NSF); NSF Coupled Natural Human Systems (NSF); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This research was supported by the TEACRS Program (NIGMS IRACDA-K12GM074869) at Tufts University, Program 111 in Ethnobiology of the Chinese Ministry in Education/Minzu University of China, the Tufts Institute of the Environment, the Tropical Conservation and Development Program at the University of Florida, Tufts University Provost Office (Tufts Collaborates!), NSF REU Program at Tufts University (NSF DBI 1005082), and the NSF Coupled Natural Human Systems (NSF grant #BCS-1313775).

Integrating multiple-glazing envelope with PCM as a passive solar utilization system can reduce energy consumption of building by latent heat storage. However, the traditional PCM-filled glazed envelope still has a poor thermal performance and thermal regulation as well as climate adaptability. In this work, an innovative reversible multiple-glazing roof integrated with two PCM, silica aerogel and low-e glass was proposed and a numerical study was performed to explore its thermal performance across the season in cold climate (Daqing, China). The new roof with and without low-e glass were investigated, and compared with the traditional air-filled multiple-glazing roof. The influence of melting temperature and thickness proportion of two PCM on thermal performance of the roof was analyzed. And an energy-economy comparison between the new roof and the traditional roof in full life was performed. The results indicate that the new glazed roof can provide excellent thermal performance in both summer and winter, and has the economic feasibility. Taking the traditional roof as a reference, the energy saving rate can achieve 14.08% in summer and 33.74% in winter, respectively, and the total cost is saved 217 Yuan/m(2) in full life.

Forested areas were also under agricultural use; however, their use changed, starting at least from the Middle Ages when the need for new arable fields resulted in a tremendous decrease in forested areas. The protection of forests started for many reasons, saving them for fuelwood and construction materials. This is the reason why there were periods when forests of the Carpathian Basin suffered from considerable pressure, and even today, this pressure continues; however, the source changed from animal husbandry to tourism, forestry, and wildlife management, or rather hunting. This created the need to search for and analyse former sustainable use of the forests. Furthermore, the consideration of the use of trees/treelines is under the scope of helping the climate adaptation of arable fields. Wooded grasslands have also been mapped and various analyses were done, related to their survival. We wish to introduce some of the ancestral forms of the agricultural use of Hungarian farming, where trees play an important role, their origin, distribution, threatening factors, and their future.

Green Infrastructure (GI) can reduce stormwater runoff and offer multiple benefits that have been initiated in the United Kingdom (UK) and China, namely Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) and Sponge Cities Program (SCP) respectively. Currently, the implementation of GI is restricted to small spatial (site specific) scale and facing several constraints such as financial investment and governance, that limited its fuller functions and potential. This study aims to identify the barriers and enablers for the adoption of GI by investigating SUDS and SCP in the UK and China, through twelve in-depth semi-structured interviews with stakeholders. Our results found that multiple benefits of the SUDS and SCP were identified, as the main enablers in both countries with reducing the stormwater runoff and alleviating peak discharge in the drainage system, also contributing to social well-being and climate adaptations. Some barriers found the current practices are facing challenges from financial, biophysical and socio-political circumstances in both cases. We conclude that it is beneficial to learn the comparative findings and experiences from both countries, which contributes to stakeholders for improving current GI practices, in prior to achieve more sustainable long-term deliverables.","[Li, Lei; Chan, Faith Ka Shun] Univ Nottingham Ningbo China, Fac Sci & Engn, Sch Geog Sci, Ningbo 315000, Peoples R China; [Li, Lei; Collins, Alexandra M.] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, 109 Weeks Bldg,16-18 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NE, England; [Cheshmehzangi, Ali] Univ Nottingham Ningbo China, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Ningbo 315100, Peoples R China; [Chan, Faith Ka Shun] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Chan, Faith Ka Shun] Univ Leeds, Water Leeds Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Nottingham Ningbo China; Imperial College London; University of Nottingham Ningbo China; University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Li, L (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham Ningbo China, Fac Sci & Engn, Sch Geog Sci, Ningbo 315000, Peoples R China.",lei.li@nottingham.edu.cn; Alexandra.collins@imperial.ac.uk; ali.cheshmehzangi@nottingham.edu.cn; faith.chan@nottingham.edu.cn,"Chan, Faith Ka Shun/AAV-4088-2020; Chan, Faith Ka Shun/H-1541-2017","Chan, Faith Ka Shun/0000-0001-6091-6596; Chan, Faith Ka Shun/0000-0001-6091-6596; Li, Lei/0000-0002-8743-9993; Collins, Alexandra/0000-0003-4703-4921","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41850410497, 71950410760]; National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFC1510400]; British Academy; British Academy [IC3\100093]; Faculty of Science and Engineering (FoSE) Postgraduate Research Scholarship of University of Nottingham Ningbo China",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; British Academy; British Academy; Faculty of Science and Engineering (FoSE) Postgraduate Research Scholarship of University of Nottingham Ningbo China,"We appreciate the review and comments from the editor and two anonymous reviewers.

In addition to their heritage value, traditional buildings are usually considered a model of sustainability in the use of available resources, with a minimal negative environmental impact, minimization of costs, and a reduction of energy demand. In the current context of the globalization of construction techniques and high requirements of comfortable dwellings, the preservation of vernacular architecture means a major challenge, given that this kind of architecture represents more than 75% of the world's existing buildings. Based on a study of selected peer-reviewed literature indexed in the Web of Science for the period between 2000 and 2022, this paper qualitatively analyzes the current areas of research on vernacular architecture, with particular attention to the scope of the studies, traditional building materials and construction techniques, preservation problems and solutions, climate adaptation, and the reuse of abandoned vernacular buildings. In order to achieve the goal of preserving vernacular architecture in the coming centuries, research should continue in interdisciplinary teams by promoting fieldwork in under-studied regions and incorporating modern materials and solutions in old vernacular buildings to satisfy current comfort standards without excessively changing their essential features.","[Pardo, Jose Maria Fuentes] Univ Politecn Madrid, BIPREE Res Grp, Madrid 28040, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Pardo, JMF (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, BIPREE Res Grp, Madrid 28040, Spain.",jm.fuentes@upm.es,"FUENTES, JOSE MARÍA/I-9438-2012","FUENTES, JOSE MARÍA/0000-0002-0891-0063",,,,,146,0,0,15,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,JAN,2023,13,1,,,,,,,162,10.3390/buildings13010162,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings13010162,,,16,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,7Y0JI,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000914576500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Water accounting, that is a standardized documentation of data on water resources, is a useful tool to provide this information. Pan-European data on climate impacts do not recognize local anthropogenic interventions in the water cycle. Most European river basins have a specific toolset that is understood and used by local experts and stakeholders. However, these local tools are not versatile. Thus, there is a need for a common approach that can be understood by multi-fold users to quantify impact indicators based on local data and that can be used to synthesize information at the European level. Then, policies can be designed with the confidence that underlying data are backed-up by local context and expert knowledge. This work presents a simplified water accounting framework that allows for a standardized examination of climate impacts on water resource availability and use across multiple basins. The framework is applied to five different river basins across Europe. Several indicators are extracted that explicitly describe green water fluxes versus blue water fluxes and impacts on agriculture.

This approach shows a great potential in regards to a solution of problems like global warming and limited resources. Experiences with analyzed projects show however, that, despite the goal to create working and healthy homes, technologies and concepts often are not tailored to local conditions. Using the example of a cooperation project of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich) and the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) in which a climate adapted building envelope was developed the paper shows what modifications have to be made. This is especially relevant in the field of building physics in order to increase efficiency and avoid damages to the building and inhabitants and create sustainable homes. Besides this the interchange of the developed envelope, associated production methods and other relevant frame conditions, like local resource availability, is used to demonstrate what barriers and potential synergies can emerge in the course of such a project.","[Wallbaum, Holger; Ostermeyer, York] ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Goto, Yutaka] EMPA, Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland",ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA),"Wallbaum, H (corresponding author), ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, Wolfgang Pauli Str 15, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",,"Wallbaum, Holger/B-6272-2008","Wallbaum, Holger/0000-0001-5809-9400",,,,,37,1,1,0,2,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0932-8351,,,BAUTECHNIK,Bautechnik,JAN,2011,88,1,,,,,3,16,,10.1002/bate.201110001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bate.201110001,,,14,"Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,710GG,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000286498300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data were collected from a longitudinal survey of 127 agro-pastoral households. Approximately one-third of the households have inadequate feeds, and livestock diseases are major challenges during non-drought and drought periods. Agro-pastoralists' responses to drought are reactive and mainly involve intensifying exploitation of resources and the commons. Proactive responses such as improving production resources are few. Poverty, limited responses to market dynamics and inadequate skills constrain adaptations. Many agro-pastoralists' attachment to livestock deters livestock divestment, favouring disadvantageous sales that result in declining incomes. To improve adaptive capacity, interventions should expose agro-pastoralists to other forms of savings, incorporate agro-pastoralists as agents of change by building their capacity to provide extension services, and maintain infrastructure. Securing livestock mobility, pasture production and access is crucial under the variable social-ecological conditions.","[Speranza, Chinwe Ifejika] Ctr Training & Integrated Res Arid & Semiarid Lan, Nanyuki, Kenya; [Speranza, Chinwe Ifejika] Univ Bern, Bern, Switzerland; [Speranza, Chinwe Ifejika] German Dev Inst, Bonn, Germany",University of Bern; Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE),"Speranza, CI (corresponding author), Ctr Training & Integrated Res Arid & Semiarid Lan, Nanyuki, Kenya.",chinwe.ifejika.speranza@cde.unibe.ch,"Speranza, Chinwe Ifejika/B-2408-2012","Speranza, Chinwe Ifejika/0000-0003-1927-7635",,,,,39,49,49,5,40,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",0957-8811,1743-9728,,EUR J DEV RES,Eur.

To explore how climate change affects these choices, this study performed a regional scale analysis using the well-validated APSIM-maize model for the Northeast China Plain (NEC) which is the leading maize (Zea mays L.) producing area in China. Results indicated that high temperature had a significantly negative effect on grain yield, while effective accumulated temperature and solar radiation had significant positive effects on grain yield and kernel number. Cloudy and rainy weather in flowering stage had significant negative effects on kernel number. Delayed sowing led to less cloudy and rainy weather during flowering and reduced the negative effect on kernel number. Higher diurnal thermal range and less precipitation during the grain-filling stage also increased the 1000-kernel weight. Delayed sowing, however, also significantly increased the risk of early senescence and frost (>80%) in middle and high latitude areas. In the middle and high latitude areas of the NEC, the grain yield of a long-season cultivar (LS) under early sowing (I) (6.2-19.9%) was significantly higher than under medium sowing (II) or late sowing (III), and higher than that of an early sown (I) short-season (SS) and medium-season cultivar (MS). In the low latitude area of the NEC, the grain yield of MS under medium sowing date (II) was higher than that under I and III, meanwhile, this was also higher than that of SS and LS. Therefore, under climate warming, LS sown earlier in high and medium latitudes and MS sown medium in low latitude were the appropriate cultivar and sowing date choices, which could mitigate the stress of high temperatures and reduce the risk of early senescence and frost. Cultivar and sowing date selection are effective measures to alleviate negative effects of climate change on maize production in the NEC, and provides valuable advice for breeders on cultivar selection, and the choice of varieties and sowing dates for farmers in actual production.","[Han, Xiangfei; Dong, Lina; Shao, Xiwen; Wang, Yongjun; Wang, Lichun] Jilin Agr Univ, Agron Coll, Changchun 130118, Peoples R China; [Han, Xiangfei; Dong, Lina; Cao, Yujun; Lyu, Yanjie; Wang, Yongjun; Wang, Lichun] Jilin Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Environm, Changchun 130033, Peoples R China",Jilin Agricultural University; Jilin Academy of Agricultural Sciences,"Wang, YJ (corresponding author), Jilin Agr Univ, Agron Coll, Changchun 130118, Peoples R China.;Wang, YJ (corresponding author), Jilin Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Environm, Changchun 130033, Peoples R China.",hxfei1994@126.com; donglina0330@126.com; caoyujun828@163.com; lvyanjie_1977@163.com; shaoxiwen@126.com; yjwang2004@126.com; w1c1960@163.com,"dong, li/HMW-0948-2023",,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFD0300303]; Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Project of Jilin [CXGC2017JQ006],National Key Research and Development Program of China; Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Project of Jilin,This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFD0300303) and the Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Project of Jilin (CXGC2017JQ006).,,46,5,5,14,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,MAY,2022,12,5,,,,,,,984,10.3390/agronomy12050984,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12050984,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,1Q2QS,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000802539400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We identify measures by which local people in the semi-arid Limpopo Basin part of Botswana are responding to climate change and fluctuations in ecosystem products and examine socio-economic attributes of households influencing their adoption and discuss their adequacy. Our study used a case study of Bobirwa sub-district and employed key informant and household interviews to collect qualitative and quantitative data. Thematic analysis was used to analyze textural data from key informant interviews while frequencies, proportions, and Chi-squared tests were used to analyze the adoption of different strategies. A multinomial logit (MNL) regression was used to analyze the influence of several social, demographic, and economic attributes of households on household adaptation choices. We attributed the high adoption of on-farm adaptations to the simultaneous influence of more severe droughts and the free input support through the government's Integrated Support Programme for Arable Agriculture (ISPAAD). Our findings suggest that current adaptations were inadequate and implementation of the ISPAAD programme required fine-tuning to be more effective. Results of the MNL regression provide critical information on the barriers and enablers of adaptation in the sub-district yet offer important entry points for improving current adaptations. Therefore, the government needs to put measures that encourage investments in the processing of ecosystem products in rural areas to broaden the livelihood base and possibly reduce overdependence on rainfed agriculture. However, the extent to which this can be achieved depends on the level of government commitment to supporting local initiatives to addressing the climate change threat.","[Mugari, Ephias; Masundire, Hillary] Univ Botswana, Dept Biol Sci, Fac Sci, Gaborone UB0022, Botswana; [Bolaane, Maitseo] Univ Botswana, Dept Hist, Fac Humanities, Gaborone UB0022, Botswana",University of Botswana; University of Botswana,"Mugari, E (corresponding author), Univ Botswana, Dept Biol Sci, Fac Sci, Gaborone UB0022, Botswana.",mugarie@gmail.com; Masundh@mopipi.ub.bw; Bolaanem@mopipi.ub.bw,"Bolaane, Maitseo/AAS-3775-2021; Mugari, Ephias/AAD-1809-2022","Mugari, Ephias/0000-0002-9205-9653","Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA); UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada","Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA); UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada(CGIAR)","This research was carried out under the Adaptation at Scale in Semi-Arid Regions project (ASSAR).

Lessons from communities dependent on livestock and forests in northern Mali,INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,gender; climate change; adaptation; Faguibine; Mali,VULNERABILITY; PROPERTY,"The growing risk of vulnerability to climate change is widely discussed in the scientific and political sphere. More evidence from local case studies emerges that document this risk. Vulnerability to climate change and variability appears most likely to negatively affect poor people, particularly women. Tendencies to widen existing inequalities have been observed. In the Lake Faguibine area in Northern Mali the social, political and ecological conditions have drastically changed in the last three decades. We conducted 6 single gender participatory workshops using PRA in two communities. The workshops assessed vulnerability and adaptive strategies to climate variability and change for livestock and forest based livelihoods. Our results show divergences in the adaptive strategies of men and women. Migration represented one of the most important strategies for men. Women perceived this strategy more as a cause of vulnerability than an adaptive strategy. Traditionally male activities have been added to the workload of women (e.g. small ruminant herding). The historical axes show that development projects targeting women have not integrated climate change and variability into their planning. Most activities have been built around small scale agriculture. With the drying out of Lake Faguibine, those water dependent activities are no longer relevant. Women have developed their own adaptive strategies based on newly emerged forest resources in the former lake area (e.g. charcoal production). However, women are hindered from realizing the potential of these new activities. This is due to loss of person power in the household, unclear access to natural resources, lack of knowledge and financial resources. Lack of power to influence decision at the household and community levels as well as limited market opportunities for women are additional factors. Even though women's vulnerability is increasing in the short term, over the long term the emerging changes in women's roles could lead to positive impacts. These impacts could be both societal (division of labor and power, new social spaces), and economic (market access, livestock wealth). Locally specific gender sensitive analysis of vulnerability is needed to understand dynamics and interaction of divergent adaptive strategies. Societal and political change at broader scales is needed to realize potential benefits for women in the long term.","[Djoudi, H.; Brockhaus, M.] Jalan CIFOR, Ctr Int Forestry Res, Bogor 16680, Indonesia",CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),"Djoudi, H (corresponding author), Jalan CIFOR, Ctr Int Forestry Res, Bogor 16680, Indonesia.",H.Djoudi@cgiar.org; M.Brockhaus@cgiar.org,,"Brockhaus, Maria/0000-0001-7348-4921",European Commission [EuropeAid/ENV/2004-81719],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),This document has been produced within the framework of the 'Tropical Forests and Climate Change Adaptation' (TroFCCA) project executed by CATIE and CIFOR and funded by the European Commission under contract EuropeAid/ENV/2004-81719.

Fifteen individuals displayed characteristic bouts of torpor in which oxygen consumption (VO2) fell below 50% of the resting levels of non-torpid pouched mice for more than 2 hr during the early morning. These bouts ended in an abrupt increase in VO2 which overshot resting levels during arousal to normothermia. Minimum oxygen consumption (VO2min) was not correlated with the energy saved during torpor, but there was a significant positive correlation between VO2min and the duration of torpor (D(t)) and also between D(t) and energy saved. In contrast, there was a negative correlation between the cost of arousal and energy saved which suggests that the cost of regaining homeothermy can limit the energetic efficiency of short bouts of torpor. Pouched mice from all 6 localities had the capacity to enter torpor and there were no significant geographical differences in the incidence of torpor. However, there were substantial differences in the expression of torpor, and Pouched mice from localities experiencing more variable temperatures underwent significantly longer bouts of torpor which suggests that selection for torpor had been greater in more energetically unpredictable environments.","UNIV PRETORIA,INST MAMMAL RES,PRETORIA 0002,SOUTH AFRICA",University of Pretoria,,,,"Ellison, George/0000-0001-8914-6812",,,,,27,6,6,0,1,POLISH ACAD SCIENCES,BIALOWIEZA,"MAMMAL RESEARCH INST, 17-230 BIALOWIEZA, POLAND",0001-7051,,,ACTA THERIOL,Acta Theriol.,,1993,38,1,,,,,49,59,,10.4098/AT.arch.93-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.4098/AT.arch.93-4,,,11,Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,LL860,,Bronze,,,2023-03-25,WOS:A1993LL86000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The west end of Dauphin Island offers a clear case study of such practices and illustrates the crucial role that State and local regulation play in curtailing many of the moral hazard effects of federal disaster relief funding in promoting maldevelopment. Where unrestricted, moral hazard can act as an incentive to build or rebuild in at-risk areas, and unlike many other coastal areas, Dauphin Island lacks policies and requirements which restrict such development. Using the richest dataset available for the island and geospatial visualization, this analysis presents Dauphin Island as a case study of the potential consequences of unrestricted, heavily subsidized maldevelopment, and outlines the policies that enabled it to take place.Dauphin Island demonstrates that Federal disaster relief programs other than the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) can contribute to maldevelopment. On Dauphin Island, Federal disaster relief from a combination of programs created a continual cycle of rebuilding on the island since 1979. Crucially, local coastal management policy acts as a valve restricting and directing the flow of federal funds. On Dauphin Island, those funds have not been directed towards resiliency, but towards maintaining and rebuilding the most vulnerable portion of the island.Geospatial visualization of current parcel development patterns clearly shows the consequences of these incentives to build and rebuild in areas that are known to be risky in terms of future storms and flooding. In particular, this analysis indicates that the typical property on the island is: (1) not owned by island residents, and (2) is a second home either rented out or used seasonally. Thus, a significant portion of the State, Local, and Federal expenditures designed for local disaster relief benefit property owned by off-island and out-of-state residents used for second homes. These high-value, high-risk properties result in the island receiving disproportionately high (FEMA) expenditures.","[Patsch, Kiki] Calif State Univ Channel Isl, Camarillo, CA 93012 USA; [Jenkins, Sarah] Univ Pacific, Stockton, CA USA; [King, Philip] San Francisco State Univ, San Francisco, CA USA",California State University System; California State University Channel Islands; University of the Pacific; California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Patsch, K (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Channel Isl, Camarillo, CA 93012 USA.",kiki.patsch@csuci.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,,,,,83,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,FEB 15,2023,233,,,,,,,,106451,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106451,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106451,,DEC 2022,10,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Oceanography; Water Resources,8A9IX,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000916548000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, breeding of varieties adapted to the constantly changing conditions is pivotal to enable a quantitatively and qualitatively adequate crop production despite the negative effects of climate change. As it is not yet possible to select for adaptation to future climate scenarios in the field, simulations of future conditions in controlled-environment (CE) phenotyping facilities contribute to the understanding of the plant response to special stress conditions and help breeders to select ideal genotypes which cope with future conditions. CE phenotyping facilities enable the collection of traits that are not easy to measure under field conditions and the assessment of a plant's phenotype under repeatable, clearly defined environmental conditions using automated, non-invasive, high-throughput methods. However, extrapolation and translation of results obtained under controlled environments to field environments is ambiguous. This review outlines the opportunities and challenges of phenotyping approaches under controlled environments complementary to conventional field trials. It gives an overview on general principles and introduces existing phenotyping facilities that take up the challenge of obtaining reliable and robust phenotypic data on climate response traits to support breeding of climate-adapted crops.","[Langstroff, Anna; Stahl, Andreas] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, IFZ Res Ctr Biosyst Land Use & Nutr, Dept Plant Breeding, Heinrich Buff Ring 26, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Heuermann, Marc C.; Junker, Astrid] Leibniz Inst Plant Genet & Crop Plant Res IPK Gat, Corrensstr 3, D-06466 Seeland, Germany; [Stahl, Andreas] Julius Kuhn Inst JKI, Inst Resistance Res & Stress Tolerance, Fed Res Ctr Cultivated Plants, Erwin Baur Str 27, D-06484 Quedlinburg, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen; Leibniz Institut fur Pflanzengenetik und Kulturpflanzenforschung; Julius Kuhn-Institut,"Junker, A (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Plant Genet & Crop Plant Res IPK Gat, Corrensstr 3, D-06466 Seeland, Germany.",junkera@ipk-gatersleben.de,,"Stahl, Andreas/0000-0003-3870-4073; Langstroff, Anna/0000-0003-2751-4995; Heuermann, Marc Christian/0000-0002-5520-5287",German-PlantPhenotyping Network - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [031A053]; German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) [2818403A18/HaploSelekt],German-PlantPhenotyping Network - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL),"This work was supported by the German-PlantPhenotyping Network which was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF grant: 031A053).

Forced displacements in the world have increased significantly in the recent decade, and an estimated 22.5 million people have left their homes due to climate change since 2008. Most of this migration has remained internal and regional, but who will move, where and in what numbers in future is still debated. How the relationship between climate change and migration is viewed and described by influential policy making bodies has consequences for what kind of actions that are proposed to deal with the phenomenon and thereby also for the lives of those who are most affected by the negative effects of climate change globally. Is migration considered a problem or a solution, and for whom? Focusing on years during which forced displacement increased significantly, we explore perspectives on climate induced migration in UN and EU official policy documents. The results show that both actors consider climate change as potentially leading to increased cross-border migration. UN perspectives tend to be human security-oriented while the EU perspectives tend to focus on state security.

One strand of literature demonstrates that compact cities of sufficient density result in lower GHG emissions in the transport and the buildings sectors compared to sprawled cities. Another strand of literature, however, reveals that compactness hinders climate adaptation by amplifying the urban heat island (UHI) effect. As a result, mitigation and adaptation objectives of cities appear to contradict each other. Here, we develop a geometrical optimization framework and model of a three-dimensional city that minimizes this conflict. It makes use of the observation that low-carbon efficient transport can be realized via linear public transport axes, and that GHG emissions and UHI effects scale differently with varying geometric properties, thus enabling design that reflects both the economics and the climate of cities. We find that star-shaped cities, in contrast to radially symmetric cities, are well suited to alleviate the problematic trade-off. We also demonstrate that urban design considerations depend on transport fuel prices. The results are of particular importance for city planners of rapidly urbanizing cities in Asia and Africa who still have the potential to shape urban layout.","[Pierer, Carl; Creutzig, Felix] Tech Univ Berlin, Sustainabil Econ Human Settlements, Berlin, Germany; [Pierer, Carl; Creutzig, Felix] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Pierer, C (corresponding author), Tech Univ Berlin, Sustainabil Econ Human Settlements, Berlin, Germany.;Pierer, C (corresponding author), Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany.",carl.pierer@ens.fr,"Creutzig, Felix/B-8691-2016","Creutzig, Felix/0000-0002-5710-3348",,,,,74,12,12,3,28,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

It remains unclear to what extent these strategies are generalizable or vary across regions. In this study we ask about three potential key factors influencing farming households' ability to adapt: access to weather information, household and agricultural production-related assets, and participation in local social institutions. We use a 12-country data set from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia to explore the links between these three potential drivers of agricultural change and the likelihood that farmers made farm-associated changes, such as adopting improved crop varieties, increasing fertilizer use, investing in improved land management practices, and changing the timing of agricultural activities. We find evidence that access to weather information, assets, and participation in social institutions are associated with households that have reported making farming changes in recent years, although these results vary across countries and types of practices. Understanding these drivers and outcomes of farm-associated changes across different socio-economic and environmental conditions is critical for ongoing dialogues for climate-resilient strategies and policies for increasing the adaptive capacity of smallholders under climate change.

In response to hydroclimatic variability, surface water is being substituted with groundwater, which must be viewed as a strategic resource for climate adaptation. In this sense, the supply of electricity for pumping is an adaptation policy tool. Additionally, planning for climate-change mitigation must consider CO2 emissions resulting from pumping. This paper examines the influence of electricity supply and pricing on groundwater irrigation and resulting emissions, with specific reference to Mexico-a climate-water-energy 'perfect storm'. Night-time power supply at tariffs below the already-subsidized rates for agricultural groundwater use has caused Mexican farmers to increase pumping, reversing important water and electricity conservation gains achieved. Indiscriminate groundwater pumping, including for virtual water exports of agricultural produce, threatens the long-term sustainability of aquifers, non-agricultural water uses, and stream-aquifer interactions that sustain riparian ecosystems. Emissions resulting from agricultural groundwater pumping in Mexico are estimated to be 3.6% of total national emissions and are equivalent to emissions from transporting the same agricultural produce to market. The paper concludes with an assessment of energy, water, and climate trends coupled with policy futures to address these challenges.","[Scott, Christopher A.] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Scott, Christopher A.] Univ Arizona, Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA",University of Arizona; University of Arizona,"Scott, CA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, 803 East 1st St, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA.",cascott@email.arizona.edu,,,"Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research [005]; National Science Foundation, NSF [GEO-1138881]; NSF [DEB-1010495, EFRI-0835930]; Directorate For Geosciences [1138881] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Directorate For Geosciences; ICER [1128040] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1010495] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research; National Science Foundation, NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Directorate For Geosciences; ICER(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","Partial funding support for this research was provided by the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (project SGP-CRA #005, supported by the National Science Foundation, NSF Grant No. GEO-1138881) and by NSF Grant Nos.

The key research aim of the LCA Project was to determine what kind of procedural and institutional frameworks are needed to ensure that locally determined adaptation needs are linked upwards to national and international policy and institutional structures. The overview brings together policy relevant insights on this question whilst also explaining the conceptual underpinnings of the project, focusing on the nature of vulnerability and adaptation and policy processes to support community-led adaptation. The key conclusions are that climate change is a serious, ongoing threat to development and will add burdens to those who are already poor and vulnerable, and that climate vulnerability analysis should be incorporated systematically into the three main policy and institutional frameworks relevant for adaptation: development, disaster relief and climate change. Ways of fostering conceptual, operational and institutional linkages between these three domains are described, focusing on how these can help communities take centre stage in conducting vulnerability analysis and implementation to enhance their long-term capacities for adaptation.",,,,,,,,,,,65,61,62,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0265-5012,1759-5436,,IDS BULL-I DEV STUD,IDS Bull.-Inst.

Developing new tools for fast and accurate estimation of chlorophyll parameters, chlorophyll a (Chl-a) content, chlorophyll b (Chl-b) content, and their ratio (Chl-a/b), can promote breeding programs of wheat with enhanced climate adaptability. Spectral reflectance of leaves is affected by changes in pigment concentration and can be used to estimate chlorophyll parameters. The current study identified and validated the top known spectral indices and developed new vegetation indices (VIs) for Chl-a and Chl-b content estimation and used them to non-destructively estimate Chl-a/b values and compare them to hyperspectral estimations. Three wild emmer introgression lines, with contrasting drought stress responsiveness dynamics, were selected. Well-watered and water-limited irrigation regimes were applied. The wheat leaves were spectrally measured with a handheld spectrometer to acquire their reflectance in the 330 to 790 nm range. Regression models based on calculated VIs as well as all hyperspectral curves were calibrated and validated against chlorophyll extracted values. The developed normalized difference spectral indices (NDSIs) resulted in high accuracy of Chl-a (NDSI415,614) and Chl-b (NDSI406,525) estimation, allowing for indirect non-destructive estimation of Chl-a/b with root mean square error (RMSE) values that could fit 6 to 10 times in the range of the measured values. They also performed similarly to the hyperspectral models. Altogether, we present here a new tool for a non-destructive estimation of Chl-a/b, which can serve as a basis for future breeding efforts of climate-resilient wheat as well as other crops.","[Mulero, Gabriel; Bacher, Harel; Kleiner, Uri; Peleg, Zvi; Herrmann, Ittai] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Robert H Smith Inst Plant Sci & Genet Agr, IL-7610001 Rehovot, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Herrmann, I (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Robert H Smith Inst Plant Sci & Genet Agr, IL-7610001 Rehovot, Israel.",gabriel.mulero@mail.huji.ac.il; harel.bacher@mail.huji.ac.il; uri.kleiner@mail.huji.ac.il; zvi.peleg@mail.huji.ac.il; ittai.herrmann@mail.huji.ac.il,"Herrmann, Ittai/AAP-4767-2020; Peleg, Zvi/A-4662-2012","Herrmann, Ittai/0000-0003-1136-1883; Peleg, Zvi/0000-0001-8063-1619; Bacher, Harel/0000-0002-5929-7131; Mulero, Gabriel/0000-0002-2935-6233",U.S. Agency for International Development Middle East Research and Cooperation [M34-037]; Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs under Dutch development/foreign policy (Project WheatMAX); Hebrew University of Jerusalem Intramural Research Fund Career Development; Hebrew University Center for Sustainability (OptiWheat); Hebrew University International School of Agricultural Sciences,U.S. Agency for International Development Middle East Research and Cooperation(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs under Dutch development/foreign policy (Project WheatMAX); Hebrew University of Jerusalem Intramural Research Fund Career Development; Hebrew University Center for Sustainability (OptiWheat); Hebrew University International School of Agricultural Sciences,"This study was partially supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development Middle East Research and Cooperation (grant #M34-037), the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs under Dutch development/foreign policy (Project WheatMAX), the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Intramural Research Fund Career Development, Hebrew University Center for Sustainability (OptiWheat), and the Hebrew University International School of Agricultural Sciences.",,73,2,2,5,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,JUN,2022,14,11,,,,,,,2585,10.3390/rs14112585,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14112585,,,14,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,1Z3RA,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000808744500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The ventilation efficiency at peak time (13:00-15:00) is significantly higher than that at valley time (08:00), which indicates that thermal buoyancy plays a positive role in air change rate (ACH) and wind velocity conditions, and the thermal pressure form with low-inlet and high-outlet has a higher climate adaptability.

There is a large operating time range (71.35% similar to 100%) for a medium-sized gymnasium in the subtropical regions to apply the passive ventilation mode in transition seasons of spring and autumn, and the thermal comfort condition of the sports area is better than that of the spectator area. On the other hand, the operating time range shows 36.96%-64.93% in summer as the peak time comfort exceeds the upper limit of the standard value. Since the sports crowd has stronger thermal endurance than the sitting crowd, it is possible to achieve a higher range of energy saving by effectively controlling the operation time and power consumption of air conditioning measures in non-event time (no consideration of the use in spectator area) in hot summer.","[Guo, Weihong; Liang, Sheng; He, Yiwei; Li, Weiwei; Xiong, Bo; Wen, Hongyan] South China Univ Technol, Sch Architecture, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Guo, Weihong] South China Univ Technol, State Key Lab Subtrop Bldg Sci, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China",South China University of Technology; South China University of Technology,"Liang, S (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Sch Architecture, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",whguo@scut.edu.cn; lsh_guangzhou@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [51678239]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0702505]; State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Building Science,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Building Science,"The authors thank the joint support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project NO. 51678239) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Project NO. 2017YFC0702505) for this research, which allows the cooperation and technical exchange between the school of architecture of South China University of Technology and the State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Building Science, and provides funds for all aspects of this work.",,59,6,6,21,55,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

Studies have also shown a preference towards conveying climate data through geo-visual representations, to quickly present ideas rooted in geographical challenges and solutions. However, a rapid pace of technological advancements has paved the way for an abundance of geovisualization products that have eclipsed the necessary theoretical inquiry and knowledge required to establish effective visualization principles. This study addresses this research gap through a two-step process of (1) conducting a thorough review of the geovisualization for climate change literature, and (2) creating a conceptual framework that classifies existing geovisualization products into themes relating to visualization features, audiences, and the intended outcome or purpose of the visualization medium. The result is the Climate Visualizations for Adaptation Products (CVAP) framework, a tool for researchers and practitioners to use as a decision support system to discern an appropriate type of geovisualization product to implement within a specific use case or audience. Visualizations with more interactivity were favoured among expert user groups, to act as tools for knowledge discovery. This is contrary to the visualizations intended for communicating a known message to a user group, as those products often had a low level of interactivity associated with their use.","[Goudine, Alexei; Bone, Christopher] Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada; [Newell, Robert] Univ Fraser Valley, Food & Agr Inst, Abbotsford, BC V2S 7M8, Canada",University of Victoria; University of Fraser Valley,"Bone, C (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada.",goudine@uvic.ca; Robert.Newell@ufv.ca; chrisbone@uvic.ca,,"Newell, Robert/0000-0003-4108-1727","Marine Environmental Observation, Prediction, and Response Network (MEOPAR)","Marine Environmental Observation, Prediction, and Response Network (MEOPAR)","The authors would like to acknowledge the generous support from the Marine Environmental Observation, Prediction, and Response Network (MEOPAR) for funding that supported this study.",,39,2,2,2,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2220-9964,,ISPRS INT J GEO-INF,ISPRS Int.

Farmers in Burkina Faso have a long history of adapting their farming activities to frequent changes in climate. Using 150 in-person surveys, this study assesses farmers' perceptions of climate change based on multiple climate variables, and reviews adaptation practices, including soil and water conservation strategies, in the Soudanian, Soudano-Sahelian, and Sahelian agroclimatic zones of Burkina Faso. In general, farmers are aware of changing climatic conditions, including increased temperatures, greater rainfall variability, heavier precipitation events, delayed onset, and premature offset of the rainy season. However, farmers perceive shifts in climate differently depending on their location and agroclimatic zone. As a result, different adaption strategies are implemented by farmers according to the climatic, societal, and economic context. Survey results show that in the Sahel, climate adaptation strategies rely on traditional knowledge and experimental approaches; whereas in the Soudanian zone, where weather conditions are more favorable for agriculture, adaptation practices are market oriented. These regional differences are important for targeting advisory services, planning processes, and decision-making to support the effective provision of weather and climate information services to the last mile.","[Alvar-Beltran, Jorge; Dalla Marta, Anna; Orlandini, Simone] Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry DAGRI, I-50144 Florence, FI, Italy; [Dao, Abdalla; Sanou, Jacob] Inst Environm & Rech Agr INERA, BP910, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso; [Heureux, Ana] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, I-00153 Rome, RM, Italy",University of Florence; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Alvar-Beltran, J (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry DAGRI, I-50144 Florence, FI, Italy.",jorge.alvar@unifi.it; adao@wacci.ug.edu.gh; anna.dallamarta@unifi.it; Ana.Heureux@fao.org; jsanou24@yahoo.fr; simone.orlandini@unifi.it,"orlandini, simone/L-7880-2015","orlandini, simone/0000-0001-6290-9752; Alvar, Jorge/0000-0003-2454-0629; Dao, Abdalla/0000-0001-9965-1353; Dalla Marta, Anna/0000-0002-4606-7521",,,,,49,9,9,1,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,AUG,2020,11,8,,,,,,,827,10.3390/atmos11080827,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11080827,,,15,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,NL2RP,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000567269400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Due to the rural, remote and specific institutional characteristics of SIDS, these efforts are commonly implemented at the community level. Therefore, the adaptive capacity of the community is an essential attribute of the adaptation process. With a focus on the role of social capital, this paper provides a quantitative analysis of determinants of household intention to participate in community adaptation projects, using data from a household survey and discrete choice experiment conducted in a coastal community in the Federated States of Micronesia. The results reveal that expectation of high climate change risks and strong sense of social capital enhance adaptive capacity. Participation in community activities and perception of threats to the social group in question are important components of social capital in determining adaptive capacity. Household size, income diversification, and very high resource dependency are negatively related to the household's intention to contribute to community adaptation and therefore adaptive capacity. These results provide crucial insights for the design and implementation of community adaptation projects in SIDS.","[Hagedoorn, L. C.; Brander, L. M.; van Beukering, P. J. H.; Dijkstra, H.

We also aimed to promote awareness among community members of western scientific concepts of climate change. Workshops and interviews with participants emphasized the use of participatory, visual techniques to encourage discussion and visioning of the future. Participants indicated very limited understanding of western concepts and English language terms associated with climate change and why change was occurring. However, in deeper conversations, many reported observing unusual patterns of environmental change they could not explain by other means. These observations, combined with changes in customary practices and loss of local knowledge in recent years, worried participants, particularly the elderly. The idea that climate change was resulting from human impacts on the environment was an easy concept for most participants to grasp. The demonstrated worldviews of participants was dominated by social and cultural links to the past and present, but had weaker links to western concepts of 'the future'. Thus, discussions around planning adaptation did not generally fit easily into peoples' framings of their worlds. People's preferences for adaptation included building general community capacity, drawing from customary knowledge, being more involved in decision-making and learning more about scientific knowledge on climate change. Enabling collection of plant and animal foods and associated interaction with the landscape was also considered important for improving community independence, resilience and well-being for adaptation.","[Petheram, Lisa] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Stacey, Natasha] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Fleming, Ann] Northern Terr Govt, Aquaculture Branch, Dept Primary Ind & Fisheries, Darwin, NT 0801, Australia",Australian National University; Charles Darwin University; Northern Territory Government,"Petheram, L (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",lisa.petheram@gmail.com,,"Fleming, Ann/0000-0001-8310-8030; Stacey, Natasha/0000-0002-2262-9817",Australian Government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency); National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF); Warruwi community,Australian Government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency)(Australian Government); National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF); Warruwi community,"This research was supported by the Australian Government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) and the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF).

Two schools of thought exist-one that views farmers' perceptions of climate indicators as erroneous and inferior, while the other views, scientific data, specifically meteorological data, to be superior and accurate. The accuracy of farmers perception of climate variability indicators is in doubt relative to the scientific data. This article targets assessing farmers perception of climate variability indicators compared to the scientific data with an eye to distil policy implications for climate variability resilience and adaptation. Using cross-sectional data on 197 smallholder maize farmers in southern Ghana, the article answers the research question: To what extent do smallholder farmers perception of climate variability indicators align or vary from objective climate data? We find variation between farmers perception of climate indicators and the objective data from the Ghana Meteorological Agency. Specifically, while farmer perceptions showed a decrease in rainfall over the past 10 years (2009-2018), the objective data proved otherwise. Again, a contradiction existed between farmers perception of sunshine and the scientific data. However, farmers' perceptions of temperature aligned with the objective data. The scientific data established coefficient of variations of 0.21, 0.04, 0.03, and 0.12 for rainfall, sunshine, maximum, and minimum temperatures respectively. We recommend collaborative efforts between the national research council's, Ghana Meteorological Agency, and academic institutions to commission further studies that will test, confirm, and harmonize the reliability of smallholder perceptions of climate variability and change in climate adaptation efforts.","[Ankrah, Daniel Adu; Mensah, Jojo; Anaglo, Jonathan Nicholas; Boateng, Seth Dankyi] Univ Ghana, Coll Basic & Appl Sci CBAS, Sch Agr, Legon Accra, Ghana; [Ankrah, Daniel Adu] Univ Ghana, Coll Basic & Appl Sci CBAS, Sch Agr, Dept Agr Extens, POB LG 68, Legon Accra, Ghana",University of Ghana; University of Ghana,"Ankrah, DA (corresponding author), Univ Ghana, Coll Basic & Appl Sci CBAS, Sch Agr, Dept Agr Extens, POB LG 68, Legon Accra, Ghana.",dankrah@ug.edu.gh,"Ankrah, Daniel/ABC-9929-2021","Ankrah, Daniel/0000-0001-9360-0854",,,,,90,0,0,6,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1932,,,COGENT FOOD AGR,Cogent Food Agr.,DEC 31,2023,9,1,,,,,,,2148323,10.1080/23311932.2022.2148323,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2022.2148323,,,19,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,7A4FP,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000898414500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The biggest challenge grapevine breeders face is the extraordinarily complex trait of wine quality, which is the all-pervasive and most debated characteristic. Since the 1920s, Germany runs continuous grapevine breeding programmes. This continuity was the key to success and lead to various new cultivars on the market, so called PIWIs. Initially, introduced pests and diseases such as phylloxera, powdery and downy mildew were the driving forces for breeding. However, preconceptions about the wine quality of new resistant selections impeded the market introduction. These preconceptions are still echoing today and may be the reason in large parts of the viticultural community for: (1) ignoring substantial breeding progress, and (2) sticking to successful markets of well-known varietal wines or blends (e.g. Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Riesling). New is the need to improve viticulture ' s sustainability and to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Climate change with its extreme weather will impose the need for a change in cultivars in many wine growing regions. Therefore, a paradigm shift is knocking on the door: new varieties (PIWIs) versus traditional varieties for climate adapted and sustainable viticulture. However, it will be slow process and viticulture is politically well advised to pave the way to variety innovation. In contrast to the widely available PIWIs, competitive cultivars created by means of new breeding technologies (NBT, e.g. through CRISPR/Cas) are still decades from introduction to the market.","[Toepfer, Reinhard; Trapp, Oliver] Inst Grapevine Breeding Geilweilerh, Fed Res Ctr Cultivated Plants, Julius Kuhn Inst, Siebeldingen, Germany",Julius Kuhn-Institut,"Topfer, R (corresponding author), Inst Grapevine Breeding Geilweilerh, Fed Res Ctr Cultivated Plants, Julius Kuhn Inst, Siebeldingen, Germany.",reinhard.toepfer@julius-kuehn.de,,,Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

These impacts will manifest in complex and nuanced ways, particularly when coupled with additional social, economic, and environmental shifts that vary across contexts. Given these challenges, urban decision-makers are seeking new knowledge, and new ways of using existing knowledge, to support decision-making processes. In response, a broad range of knowledge products (i.e. decision-support tools, climate services) have been developed for urban areas. Yet, to date, little research has directly evaluated these products. The Knowledge Product Evaluation (KnoPE) framework addresses this gap by providing both conceptual clarity surrounding knowledge products and a structured, generalizable methodology to guide research and support improved knowledge product creation and uptake. The KnoPE Framework combines data and information on knowledge products, their use in decision-making over time, and evidence of tangible actions taken. The KnoPE Framework was developed with two urban resilience knowledge products - the Urban-Climate Adaptation Tool and the Maine Flood Resilience Checklist. Initial testing indicates that the KnoPE Framework can assess the transferability, scalability, and use of knowledge products in urban resilience decision-making. Any evaluation using the KnoPE Framework requires a thorough understanding of the contextual details of each case and understanding what factors may influence knowledge product development and subsequent decision-making processes and outcomes. Yet, as an analytical entry point for the evaluation of knowledge products, the KnoPE Framework can offer insights regarding the extent to which knowledge products influence urban resilience decision-making processes.","[Ernst, Kathleen M.] FAMU FSU, Coll Engn, Tallahassee, FL USA; [Preston, Benjamin L.] RAND Corp, Community Hlth & Environm Policy Program, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida A&M University; Florida State University; RAND Corporation,"Ernst, KM (corresponding author), 2525 Pottsdamer St,Room B202-A, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA.",kernst@eng.famu.fsu.edu,"Preston, Benjamin/B-9001-2012","Preston, Benjamin/0000-0002-7966-2386; Ernst, Kathleen/0000-0002-4726-0331",,,,,41,4,5,6,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Such development places an increasing number of people and capital at risk, which calls for public flood management as well as household level adaptation measures that reduce social vulnerability to flooding and climate change. This study explores several private adaptation responses to flood risk, that are driven by various behavioral triggers. We conduct a survey among households in hazard-prone areas in eight coastal states in the USA, of which, some have recently experienced major flooding. While numerous empirical studies have investigated household-level flood damage mitigation, little attention has been given to examining the decision to retreat from flood zones. We examine what behavioral motives drive the choices for flood damage mitigation and relocation separately among property buyers and sellers. Hence, we focus on the drivers that shape demand for future development in flood-prone cities. We find that households' choices to retreat from or to avoid flood zones (1) are highly sensitive to information that provokes people's feelings of fear, and (2) rely on hazardous events to trigger a protective action, which ideally would take place well before these events occur. We highlight that major flooding may cause a potential risk of large-scale outmigration and demographic changes in flood- prone areas, putting more low-income households at risk. Therefore, coordinated policies that integrate bottom- up drivers of individual climate adaptation are needed to increase urban resilience to floods.","[de Koning, Koen; Filatova, Tatiana] Univ Twente, Dept Governance & Technol Sustainabil CSTM, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Need, Ariana] Univ Twente, Dept Publ Adm PA, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Bin, Okmyung] East Carolina Univ, Ctr Nat Hazards Res, Dept Econ, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Filatova, Tatiana] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Informat Syst & Modeling, Fac Engn & IT, 15 Broadway, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Twente; University of Twente; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University; University of Technology Sydney,"de Koning, K (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Dept Governance & Technol Sustainabil CSTM, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",k.dekoning@utwente.nl; t.filatova@utwente.nl; a.need@utwente.nl; BIN0@ecu.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Filatova, Tatiana/K-8233-2016","Filatova, Tatiana/0000-0002-3546-6930","Faculty of Behavioural, Management and Social Sciences (BMS) of the University of Twente; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [758014]","Faculty of Behavioural, Management and Social Sciences (BMS) of the University of Twente; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program(European Research Council (ERC))","We are grateful for the financial support provided by the Faculty of Behavioural, Management and Social Sciences (BMS) of the University of Twente, without which this survey would not have been possible.

Climate resilient road infrastructure in rural areas is critical for improving quality of live. For this reason, a geospatial risk and vulnerability assessment method was developed as a tool for determining where access roads, and the communities they serve, are most at risk to the effects of a changing climate. This is intended to help guide, through prioritisation, the identification of high-risk areas where appropriate climate adaptation measures would be most effective in reducing the impacts of climate variability and change. The research methodology relies on using GIS processes and spatial data to calculate a composite climate risk index, the combined output of a hazard exposure index as well as a road criticality index. The analysis methodology was applied to Mozambique, where large parts of the country were found to be at very high risk to change in terms of rural accessibility given the countries high and recurrent exposure to extreme floods. Downscaled climate simulations for a 2050 future under a low mitigation scenario indicated that pronounced increases in rainfall and cyclone activity are plausible in northern Mozambique, whilst the southern region may become hotter and drier. Prioritisation is thus crucial for more effective and efficient asset management. The methodology was found to be an efficient and effective way of identifying high-risk regions in terms of community access and the physical impact of climate on road infrastructure.","[le Roux, Alize; Khuluse-Makhanya, Sibusisiwe; Arnold, Kathryn; Engelbrechet, Francois; Verhaeghe, Benoit] CSIR, Pretoria, South Africa; [Engelbrechet, Francois] Univ Witwatersrand, Global Change Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Paige-Green, Phil] Paige Green Consulting, Pretoria, South Africa; [Paige-Green, Phil] Tshwane Univ Technol, Pretoria, South Africa",Council for Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - South Africa; University of Witwatersrand; Tshwane University of Technology,"le Roux, A (corresponding author), CSIR Smart Pl, Pretoria Campus Bldg 2A,Meiring Naude Rd, Pretoria, South Africa.",ALeroux1@csir.co.za,"Arnold, Kathryn A/AAU-1382-2021","Arnold, Kathryn Anne/0000-0001-5050-933X",UKAid,UKAid(CGIAR),"This paper is the result of a research programme that was commissioned by the Africa Community Access Partnership (AfCAP), a research programme funded by UKAid.

The primary use of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) in managed plant systems has been focused on inundative releases in a biopesticide strategy. Little effort has been placed in investigating the use of natural occurring or adapted EPN strains for long-term suppression of pest outbreaks in managed systems. This study examined the potential of EPN isolates from Northern New York (NNY), inoculated at a low level (250 million IJ/ha), which are climate adapted and their persistent characteristics preserved to maintain population levels in agricultural fields (N = 82) for multiple years and across crop rotation (alfalfa: corn: alfalfa). Persistence levels for Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser) (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae) ranged between 8 and 12% of the soil cores assayed in continuous alfalfa and 1-14% of the soil cores assayed in continuous corn rotated from EPN treated alfalfa. Steinernema feltiae (Filipjev) (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae) residual persistence level ranged between 17 and 32% in continuous alfalfa and 22-41% in continuous corn rotated from EPN treated alfalfa. Combined EPN level ranged between 27 and 43% of the soil cores in continuous alfalfa and 28-55% in continuous corn rotated from EPN-treated alfalfa. Inspection of individual fields suggested EPN populations established in prior years at the residual soil core level of 18-35% can respond positively to an increase of susceptible hosts in both alfalfa and corn, often increasing their presence to 100%.","[Shields, Elson J.; Testa, Antonio M.; O'Neil, Walker J.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, 4144 Comstock Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Shields, EJ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, 4144 Comstock Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",es28@cornell.edu,,,Northern NY Agricultural Development Program; Cornell University; NY Farm Viability Institute,Northern NY Agricultural Development Program; Cornell University; NY Farm Viability Institute,"We thank the Northern NY Agricultural Development Program, NY Farm Viability Institute and Cornell University for funding this research.

Land surface and atmospheric conditions for summer heat waves were analyzed during spring (March-April-May, MAM) and summer (June-July-August, JJA) based on the Climate and Ocean: Variability, Predictability, and Change maximum temperature definition for heat wave frequency (HWF). The spatial-temporal pattern of HWF was determined using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and the corresponding principle component time series of the first EOF of HWF. Statistically significant analyses of observed conditions indicated that sensible heat increased and latent heat fluxes decreased with high HWF in the South Central U.S. The largest positive correlations of sensible heat flux to HWF and the largest negative correlations of latent heat flux to HWF were specifically observed over the CN. This is a significantly different energy transfer regime due to less available soil moisture during the antecedent MAM and JJA. The higher sensible heat from dry soil could cause significant warming from the near surface (>2.0 degrees C) to the lower troposphere (>1.5 degrees C), and accumulated boundary layer heat could induce the significant patterns of higher geopotential height and enhance anticyclonic circulations (negative vorticity anomaly) at the midtroposphere. Results suggested a positive land-atmosphere feedback associated with heat waves and called attention to the need for region-specific climate adaptation planning.","[Lee, Eungul; Shanmugasundaram, Jothiganesh] West Virginia Univ, Dept Geol & Geog, Morgantown, WV USA; [Bieda, Rahama] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Meteorol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Richter, Heather Basara] Tulane Univ, Dept Global Environm Hlth Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA",West Virginia University; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; Tulane University,"Lee, E (corresponding author), West Virginia Univ, Dept Geol & Geog, Morgantown, WV USA.",eungul.lee@mail.wvu.edu,"Lee, Eungul/AAJ-2993-2020","Shanmugasundaram, Jothiganesh/0000-0001-9919-5351; Lee, Eungul/0000-0002-1887-1870",National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NEIHS) [7R21 ES022598-02],National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NEIHS),"This study was supported by National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences grant (NEIHS Award: 7R21 ES022598-02).

The adaptation of artificial or technical snow, as a solution to combat a decline in tourism, is pervasive, yet controversial. This paper uses Q methodology to analyse the perspectives of stakeholders in relation to artificial snow production with regard to the three pillars of sustainable development. While all stakeholders agreed that there are ecological constraints to socioeconomic development, three distinct perspectives were identified. Perspective 1 prioritizes the environment, not accepting ecological compromises for socioeconomic development. Perspective 2 is more willing to accept trade-offs, focusing on economic diversification and long-term strategies. Perspective 3 focuses on the economy, with a preference for the status quo. The ecological awareness of all stakeholders provides a promising basis for sustainable development. However, the diverse views on priority setting present nontrivial obstacles towards devising future strategies for sustainable development.","[Moser, Deyshawn J.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Kings Bldg,James Hutton Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3FE, Midlothian, Scotland; [Moser, Deyshawn J.] Hurdnerwaldlistr 91, CH-8808 Pfaffikon, Switzerland; [Baulcomb, Corinne] Scotlands Rural Coll SRUC, Rural Econ Environm & Soc, Peter Wilson Bldg,Kings Bldg,West Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh; Scotland's Rural College; University of Edinburgh,"Moser, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Kings Bldg,James Hutton Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3FE, Midlothian, Scotland.;Moser, DJ (corresponding author), Hurdnerwaldlistr 91, CH-8808 Pfaffikon, Switzerland.",deyshawn.moser@gmx.ch; corinne.baulcomb@sruc.ac.uk,,"Moser, Deyshawn/0000-0003-1789-9393",,,,,67,8,8,4,33,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Mitigation of the UHI effects via the configuration of green spaces and sustainable design of urban environments has become an issue of increasing concern under changing climate. In this paper, the effects of the composition and configuration of green space on land surface temperatures (LST) were explored using landscape metrics including percentage of landscape (PLAND), edge density (ED) and patch density (PD). An oasis city of Aksu in Northwestern China was used as a case study. The metrics were calculated by moving window method based on a green space map derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery, and LST data were retrieved from Landsat TM thermal band. A normalized mutual information measure was employed to investigate the relationship between LST and the spatial pattern of green space. The results showed that while the PLAND is the most important variable that elicits LST dynamics, spatial configuration of green space also has significant effect on LST. Though, the highest normalized mutual information measure was with the PLAND (0.71), it was found that the ED and PD combination is the most deterministic factors of LST than the unique effects of a single variable or the joint effects of PLAND and PD or PLAND and ED. Normalized mutual information measure estimations between LST and PLAND and ED, PLAND and PD and ED and PD were 0.7679, 0.7650 and 0.7832, respectively. A combination of the three factors PLAND, PD and ED explained much of the variance of LST with a normalized mutual information measure of 0.8694. Results from this study can expand our understanding of the relationship between LST and street trees and vegetation, and provide insights for sustainable urban planning and management under changing climate.

The study revealed evidence of increased climate variability and heightening vulnerability in farming systems. Rainfall seasons have shortened by up to four weeks, impacting on food sources and ecosystem services, and increasing pressure on women and children as traditional roles change. Communities depended primarily on indigenous knowledge and local biological and geographical indicators of seasonal forecasts in making major strategic, tactical and operational decisions on crop production, including management of food stocks and social safety nets. In providing climate and technical production information, researchers and development practitioners will therefore need to fit in with farmers' local decision-making frameworks. However, it should be recognized that some of the indicators (e.g. biological) on which this indigenous knowledge is traditionally based are also adversely affected by increased climate variability, placing limits on its scope as a basis for decision-making. Despite this, efforts to build the adaptive capacity of these farming communities should still consider the current indigenous knowledge base as an entry point.","[Mapfumo, Paul; Mtambanengwe, Florence] Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Soil Sci & Agr Engn, POB MP 167, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Mapfumo, Paul; Mtambanengwe, Florence; Chikowo, Regis] Univ Zimbabwe, Soil Fertil Consortium Southern Africa SOFECSA, POB MP 167, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Chikowo, Regis] Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Crop Sci, POB MP 167, Harare, Zimbabwe",University of Zimbabwe; University of Zimbabwe; University of Zimbabwe,"Mapfumo, P (corresponding author), Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Soil Sci & Agr Engn, POB MP 167, Harare, Zimbabwe.;Mapfumo, P (corresponding author), Univ Zimbabwe, Soil Fertil Consortium Southern Africa SOFECSA, POB MP 167, Harare, Zimbabwe.",pmapfumo@agric.uz.ac.zw,"Mtambanengwe, Florence/AAX-4571-2021","Mtambanengwe, Florence/0000-0002-8250-9075",,,,,21,38,39,0,45,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

In Ethiopia, where the majority of the population rely on agriculture, climate change has adverse effects. In rural areas, low resilient capacity to shocks exacerbates the impacts of climate change such as production failure, which in turn enormously contributed to food insecurity. In view of this fact, this study assessed the perceptions and practices of climate change and related adaptation and mitigation strategies among farmers in the Konta Special District, Southern Ethiopia, by using a mixed research approach involving a concurrent method of data collection and analysis. Quantitative data for this study was generated from 296 randomly selected survey households; while, qualitative data was collected through focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and in-depth interviews. The findings of this study revealed that sample respondents recognized the occurrence climate change and its increasing adverse effects. Regarding its cause, a substantial proportion (46.8%) of the respondents perceived climate change as the wrath of God and a natural phenomenon rather than attributing it to human activities. Participants also acknowledged that anthropogenic factors such as deforestation are the major driving factors for climate change. The study found that farmers affirmatively perceive the feasibility of the majority of the strategies embraced in the Climate Resilient Green Economy initiative endorsed at national level. Understanding that climate change effects are less reversible, farmers were found to practice mitigation strategies such as afforestation, agroforestry and agricultural intensification more than adaptation strategies. Adaptation strategies such as fuel conservation technologies were perceived costly and complex given the economic capacity and skill of farmers. Hence, rural and agricultural development policies should initiate context sensitive adaptation and mitigation strategies to enhance the capability of smallholders to deal with the effects of climate change.","[Abera, Nega; Tesema, Dereje] Jimma Univ, Dept Sociol, Jimma, Ethiopia",Jimma University,"Tesema, D (corresponding author), Jimma Univ, Dept Sociol, Jimma, Ethiopia.",derejetesema2011@gmail.com,,,,,,,44,3,3,1,7,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",2354-0079,,,ENVIRON SOCIO-ECON S,Environ.

The state produces over a third of the country's vegetables and two-thirds of its fruits and nuts. Despite being highly productive, current and future climate change poses many challenges to the agricultural sector. This paper provides a summary of the current state of knowledge on historical and future trends in climate and their impacts on California agriculture. We present a synthesis of climate change impacts on California agriculture in the context of: (1) historic trends and projected changes in temperature, precipitation, snowpack, heat waves, drought, and flood events; and (2) consequent impacts on crop yields, chill hours, pests and diseases, and agricultural vulnerability to climate risks. Finally, we highlight important findings and directions for future research and implementation. The detailed review presented in this paper provides sufficient evidence that the climate in California has changed significantly and is expected to continue changing in the future, and justifies the urgency and importance of enhancing the adaptive capacity of agriculture and reducing vulnerability to climate change. Since agriculture in California is very diverse and each crop responds to climate differently, climate adaptation research should be locally focused along with effective stakeholder engagement and systematic outreach efforts for effective adoption and implementation. The expected readership of this paper includes local stakeholders, researchers, state and national agencies, and international communities interested in learning about climate change and California's agriculture.","[Pathak, Tapan B.] Univ Calif, Div Agr & Nat Resources, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Maskey, Mahesh L.; Zaccaria, Daniele] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Dahlberg, Jeffery A.; Bali, Khaled M.] Univ Calif, Div Agr & Nat Resources, Kearney Agr Res & Extens Ctr, Parlier, CA 93648 USA; [Kearns, Faith] Univ Calif, Div Agr & Nat Resources, Calif Inst Water Resources, Oakland, CA 94607 USA",University of California System; University of California Merced; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Pathak, TB (corresponding author), Univ Calif, Div Agr & Nat Resources, Merced, CA 95343 USA.",tpathak@ucmerced.edu; mmaskey@ucdavis.edu; jadahlberg@ucanr.edu; Faith.Kearns@ucop.edu; kmbali@ucanr.edu; dzaccaria@ucdavis.edu,"Pathak, Tapan/K-2867-2019; mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020; Maskey, Mahesh Lal/AAY-8330-2020; Maskey, Mahesh/AGO-8784-2022","Pathak, Tapan/0000-0001-9923-5712; Maskey, Mahesh Lal/0000-0002-2258-2932","University of California Office - Carbon Neutrality Initiative; University of California, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resource (UC ANR)","University of California Office - Carbon Neutrality Initiative; University of California, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resource (UC ANR)","This paper was supported by the University of California Office of the President, supported Carbon Neutrality Initiative funding and by the University of California, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resource (UC ANR).",,89,117,119,32,140,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,MAR,2018,8,3,,,,,,,25,10.3390/agronomy8030025,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy8030025,,,27,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,GA7GF,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000428503200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

To explore the influencing mechanism of the outdoor temperature on the indoor air temperature and thermal adaptation in winter, field studies on the thermal comfort in residential buildings with heating systems during the heating season have been conducted in three northern cities of China, with both subjective questionnaire surveys and objective on-site measurements performed simultaneously in every field survey. The results indicated that the indoor temperature is affected by the outdoor climate to some extent, even under conditions of space heating. When the outdoor temperature was below 10 degrees C in cold climates, the indoor temperature gradually increased with the decrease of the outdoor temperature. The outdoor temperature affected not only the adaptive behavior, but also the thermal acceptability. When the outdoor temperature experienced by the occupants in winter was lower, and the low temperature was experienced longer, the dependence on heating equipment, acceptability of a high temperature, and impatience with a low temperature environment were stronger. When the mean outdoor temperature experienced by the occupants was only slightly cold, the occupants expressed a lower thermal expectation and accepted a wider temperature range. The above climate adaptation mechanism provides a valuable reference for the design of higher efficient space heating systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We modified a well-established model to assess and describe the vulnerability of the two major industries dependent on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to extreme weather events. The modification entailed distinguishing between the properties that determine exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity for both the ecological and the social components of a natural resource system. We surveyed 145 commercial fishers and 62 tourism operators following a severe tropical cyclone and a major flooding event that extensively affected the region in 2011. Exposure of these industries included direct risk to life and infrastructure and indirect risk from loss of important ecosystem services. Our study found that many commercial fishers and marine-based tourism operators were sensitive to changes in the GBR's condition and limited in their adaptive capacity. However, those with smaller businesses, higher levels of occupational identity, place attachment, formal networks, and strategic approaches also had higher levels of adaptive capacity. These results suggest that resource users with higher sensitivity to change are not necessarily the most vulnerable; sensitivity may be offset by adaptive capacity. That is, while exposure and sensitivity determine the potential impact of a climate-induced change, adaptive capacity may be a major influence on the impacts that eventuate. We empirically show that adaptive capacity is an obvious focus for climate adaptation planning.","[Marshall, Nadine A.] James Cook Univ, CSIRO Ecosyst Sci & Climate Adaptat Flagship, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Tobin, Renae C.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Tobin, Renae C.] James Cook Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Marshall, Paul A.; Gooch, Margaret] Marine Pk Author, Great Barrier Reef, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Hobday, Alistair J.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Climate Adaptat Flagship, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); James Cook University; James Cook University; James Cook University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Marshall, N (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, CSIRO Ecosyst Sci & Climate Adaptat Flagship, ATSIP Bldg 145, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",nadine.marshall@csiro.au,"Marshall, Nadine/D-9339-2011; Tobin, Renae/B-4677-2012; Hobday, Alistair/A-1460-2012","Marshall, Nadine/0000-0003-4463-3558; Tobin, Renae/0000-0001-6779-3912; Hobday, Alistair/0000-0002-3194-8326; Gooch, Margaret/0000-0002-3788-0617",Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority; CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship,Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority; CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),"The authors are sincerely grateful to the 145 fishers and 62 tourism operators who agreed to participate in the study and to the six interviewers who collected the data.

Climate and environmental databases are critical for achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and for efficiently planning and implementing appropriate adaptation measures. Available federated and distributed databases can serve as necessary starting points for municipalities to identify needs, prioritize resources, and allocate investments, taking into account often tight budget constraints. High-quality geospatial, climate, and environmental data are now broadly available and remote sensing data, e.g., Copernicus services, will be critical. There are forward-looking approaches to use these datasets to derive forecasts for optimizing urban planning processes for local governments. On the municipal level, however, the existing data have only been used to a limited extent. There are no adequate tools for urban planning with which remote sensing data can be merged and meaningfully combined with local data and further processed and applied in municipal planning and decision-making. Therefore, our project CoKLIMAx aims at the development of new digital products, advanced urban services, and procedures, such as the development of practical technical tools that capture different remote sensing and in-situ data sets for validation and further processing. CoKLIMAx will be used to develop a scalable toolbox for urban planning to increase climate resilience. Focus areas of the project will be water (e.g., soil sealing, stormwater drainage, retention, and flood protection), urban (micro)climate (e.g., heat islands and air flows), and vegetation (e.g., greening strategy, vegetation monitoring/vitality). To this end, new digital process structures will be embedded in local government to enable better policy decisions for the future.","[Buehler, Michael Max; Michalski, Alexander; Rothstein, Benno] Konstanz Univ Appl Sci, Fac Civil Engn, D-78462 Constance, Germany; [Sebald, Christoph; Metzner, Martin; Schwieger, Volker] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Engn Geodesy IIGS, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany; [Rechid, Diana; Harrs, Jan-Albrecht; Jacob, Daniela] Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon GmbH, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Baier, Eberhard; Panhuis, Gunnar In Het] City Konstanz, Mayors Dept, D-78462 Constance, Germany; [Nuebel, Konrad] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Civil Geo & Environm Engn, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Koehler, Lothar] Benefit Unternehmensentwicklung GmbH, D-77933 Lahr, Germany; [Tejeda, Raymundo C.

In this work, XBeach software was used to model the effects of storm induced wave overtopping and sea erosion in a low-lying sandy shore in Costa da Caparica, Portugal. Two experiments were carried out, simulating a storm event in a segment and in a grid area. Results show beach and dune erosion and wave overtopping, similar to recorded effects in past events, and important limitations are discussed.

However, the importance of the surface heat island effect within urban areas, scilicet the intra-SUHI effect, has attracted less concern. The aim of this study was to quantitatively explore the relationship between the spatial heterogeneity of a built environment and the intra-urban surface heat island (intra-SUHI) effect using the thermally sharpened land surface temperature (LST) and high-resolution land-use classification products. The results show that at the land parcel scale, the parcel-based relative intensity of intra-SUHI should be attributed to the land parcels featured with differential land developmental intensity. Furthermore, the partial least squares regression (PLSR) modeling quantified the relative importance of the spatial heterogeneity indices of the built environment that exhibit a negative contribution to decreasing the parcel-based intra-SUHI effect or a positive contribution to increasing the intra-SUHI effect.

Based on projected temperature changes, we conclude that about a third of the region's population and roughly 14% of its land area will become at high risk for malaria transmission within a century under the high-emissions-no-mitigation baseline scenario for future climate change. Our analysis combines dynamically down-scaled regional climate projections, high resolution satellite observations of temperature, and a village-scale malaria transmission model that was developed based on climatic, environmental, entomological, and medical data collected by our group in comprehensive multi-year field surveys of villages in this region. The projected impacts of global warming on malaria transmission in Africa have been controversial. We propose a framework that reconciles seemingly contradictory conclusions, and informs strategies for climate adaptation not only over the Ethiopian Highlands but broadly over Africa, where more than 90% of malaria deaths occur every year.","[Endo, Noriko; Eltahir, Elfatih A.

Yet rigorous estimates of the impact of this pathway on agricultural yields in CSA interventions remain limited. Here we analyze maize yield effects of agroforestry within a large CSA project, funded by the US Agency for International Development and implemented from 2009 to 2014 in southern Malawi. Using original survey data from 808 households across five districts, we apply a double hurdle specification with a control function approach to account for the endogeneity of CSA program participation and the intensity of agroforestry fertilizer trees (as a proxy for agroforestry adoption) in the study area. We find a positive and statistically significant yield effect of CSA program participation and the intensity of agroforestry fertilizer trees: maize yields increased, on average, by 20% for participation, and 2% for the intensity of fertilizer trees - a modest but useful result with implications for increasing agricultural productivity among smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere. More broadly, our results show that incorporating agroforestry into CSA interventions could enhance agricultural yields among smallholder farmers in the face of climate change - a crucial aspect of sustainable development goals on hunger and climate adaptation.","[Amadu, Festus O.; Miller, Daniel C.] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, S-406 Turner Hall,1102 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [McNamara, Paul E.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 341 Mumford Hall,1301 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Amadu, FO (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, S-406 Turner Hall,1102 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;Amadu, FO (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 62 Mumford Hall,1301 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",amadu2@illinois.edu; dcmiller@illinois.edu; mcnamar1@illinois.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Miller, Daniel/0000-0001-6812-0314; McNamara, Paul/0000-0001-7692-4494","United States Agency for International Development (USAID), through the Borlaug Leadership Enhancement in Agriculture Program [016258-128]; United States Agency for International Development (USAID), through the Strengthening Agriculture & Nutrition Extension (SANE) project [AID-612-LA-15-00003]; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), through National Institute of Food & Agriculture Hatch project [1009327]; Association for International Agriculture & Rural Development through a Future Leaders' Fellowship","United States Agency for International Development (USAID), through the Borlaug Leadership Enhancement in Agriculture Program(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); United States Agency for International Development (USAID), through the Strengthening Agriculture & Nutrition Extension (SANE) project(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), through National Institute of Food & Agriculture Hatch project; Association for International Agriculture & Rural Development through a Future Leaders' Fellowship","The authors acknowledge funding from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), through the Borlaug Leadership Enhancement in Agriculture Program (Grant # 016258-128) and Strengthening Agriculture & Nutrition Extension (SANE) project (Grant # AID-612-LA-15-00003), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), through National Institute of Food & Agriculture Hatch project # 1009327.

Dock village terrain features deep, fertile soil suitable for farming. Taihu Lake contains a number of classic examples of dock villages. Dock villages are relatively independent and hidden, characteristics that not only play a role in security and defense, but also, more importantly, are associated with enhanced climate adaptability, a relative lack of cold weather, and equable levels of heat and humidity. The dock village reflects the wisdom and distillation of traditional Chinese ecological practices and is highly valued as a research topic. Based on microclimate theory and ENVI-met software, four microclimate indices, namely, air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and relative humidity, were simulated and analyzed in this study. The correlation between spatial characteristics and microclimate was studied from four perspectives: plane space, cross-section space, vertical section space, and linear development space. This research summarizes the historical context and evolution of the dock village spatial form in the construction of contemporary human settlements. It also provides scientific suggestions for the protection and sustainable development of ancient villages.","[Ma, Kun; Tang, Xiaolan; Ren, Yujie; Wang, Yiwen] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Forestry University,"Tang, XL (corresponding author), Nanjing Forestry Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",mkfakefool@gmail.com; xiaolant@njfu.com.cn; primocurry@gmail.com; wyw0011100@gmail.com,"Ren, Yujie/N-3022-2019; Wang, Yijun/GXW-1763-2022; wang, yi/GVT-8516-2022; Wang, Yin/HCI-9352-2022; wang, yixuan/GXW-2866-2022; wang, ya/HQZ-7558-2023; Wang, Yixuan/GZK-6559-2022","Ren, Yujie/0000-0003-3681-9715; Tang, Xiaolan/0000-0002-2880-0726",National Natural Science Foundation of China [31270746]; Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province [2013-JZ-014]; Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province [KYCX18_0979]; Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development [2016-R2-068]; Top-notch Academic Project of Jiangsu Higher Education,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province; Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province; Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development; Top-notch Academic Project of Jiangsu Higher Education,"This research is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China: 31270746, Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province: 2013-JZ-014, Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province: KYCX18_0979, Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development: 2016-R2-068, Top-notch Academic Project of Jiangsu Higher Education.",,48,5,5,17,71,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN 2,2019,11,2,,,,,,,368,10.3390/su11020368,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11020368,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HJ4FR,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000457129900072,View Full Record in Web of Science

Low indoor air quality (IAQ) leads to Sick Building Syndromeone of the major reasons for labor loss in office buildings. The fundamental measure to ensure indoor air quality is ventilation, which includes two basic types: mechanical ventilation and natural ventilation. Natural ventilation is an exchange of stale indoor air with fresh outdoor air by means of a pressure difference due to wind and/or stack effect. Trickle Vents, known also as background ventilators, are natural ventilation devices which can be integrated into facades or window systems as an alternative to operable vents, specifically in high-rise buildings. The major design criteria of Trickle Vents are ventilation capacity, controllability, actuation, thermal insulation, air permeability, water tightness, climatic adaptation, security, and acoustic attenuation. Other important parameters in Trickle Vents design are positioning, equivalent area, and control strategy. This paper aims to review all these aspects, particularly with reference to building regulations and commercial products. Furthermore, simulation, experimental, monitoring, and survey studies of Trickle Vents are also discussed. This literature review is presented from the perspective of performance parameters, control strategies, positioning, etc., with an aim to provide a comprehensive overview of such technology.","[Biler, Ahmet; Su, Yuehong] Univ Nottingham, Fac Engn, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Biler, Ahmet; Tavil, Aslihan Unlu] Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Architecture, TR-34437 Istanbul, Turkey; [Khan, Naghman] Integrated Environm Solut Ltd, Helix Bldg,West Scotland Sci Pk, Glasgow G20 0SP, Lanark, Scotland",University of Nottingham; Istanbul Technical University,"Biler, A (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Fac Engn, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.;Biler, A (corresponding author), Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Architecture, TR-34437 Istanbul, Turkey.",biler@itu.edu.tr; tavil@itu.edu.tr; yuehong.su@nottingham.ac.uk; naghman.khan@iesve.com,"Ünlü, Aslihan/ABE-2285-2020","Ünlü, Aslihan/0000-0002-1068-152X; Biler, Ahmet/0000-0001-7732-4431",Turkish National Agency,Turkish National Agency(Turkiye Cumhuriyeti Kalkinma Bakanligi),"Special thanks to Turkish National Agency for supporting me as part of the Erasmus Programme to be a Visiting PhD Researcher in the Department of Architecture and Built Environment, University of Nottingham.

Intercropping shade trees with coffee shrubs can produce multiple ecosystem services. Depending on the shade cover levels, however, the joint production of these services might be complementary or competitive based on their impacts on coffee yields. We develop a computational, bioeconomic model to find the range of shade level for which a coffee farmer is better off under. a shade-grown system compared to a sun-grown system, in the presence of coffee berry borer (CBB) infestations. We model the plant level provision of shade-induced pest control services, crop growth services, and timber, and consider in the baseline case a net price premium for shade-grown coffee. Using parameters from coffee regions in Colombia, our baseline simulation results indicate that, in the presence of a CBB infestation, the expected net present values in the shade-grown system can be higher but only for shade cover levels between 11% and 34%. The optimal shading level is 25% in the baseline scenario. It increases to 27% for greater values of crop growth ecosystem services and decreases to 20% in the absence of a price premium for shade-grown coffee.","[Atallah, Shady S.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Gomez, Miguel I.] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Jaramillo, Juliana] Bayer CropSci, D-6100 Monheim, Germany",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; Cornell University; Bayer AG; Bayer CropScience,"Atallah, SS (corresponding author), 56 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",shadi.atallah@unh.edu; mig7@cornell.edu; juliana.jaramillo@bayer.com,"Atallah, Shady/AFR-7527-2022; Gomez, Miguel I./AAD-3707-2019","Atallah, Shady/0000-0002-9715-6268; ",Atkinson Center for Sustainable Futures at Cornell University; Institute for the Social Sciences at Cornell University,Atkinson Center for Sustainable Futures at Cornell University; Institute for the Social Sciences at Cornell University,"The authors acknowledge support from the Atkinson Center for Sustainable Futures and the Institute for the Social Sciences at Cornell University.

Coupled with these, crop residue burning contributes significantly to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and environmental pollution. So, to evaluate the GHG mitigation potential of various climate-smart agricultural practices (CSAPs), an on-farm research trial was conducted during 2014-2017 in Karnal, India. Six management scenarios (portfolios of practices), namely, Sc1-business as usual (BAU)/conventional tillage (CT) without residue, Sc2-CT with residue, Sc3-reduced tillage (RT) with residue + recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF), Sc4-RT/zero tillage (ZT) with residue + RDF, Sc5-ZT with residue + RDF + GreenSeeker + Tensiometer, and Sc6-Sc5 + nutrient-expert tool, were included. The global warming potential (GWP) of the RW system under CSAPs (Sc4, Sc5, and Sc6) and the improved BAU (Sc2 and Sc3) were 33-40% and 4-26% lower than BAU (7653 kg CO2 eq./ha/year), respectively. This reflects that CSAPs have the potential to mitigate GWP by ~38(7) metric tons (Mt) CO2 eq./year from the 13.5 Mha RW system of South Asia. Lower GWP under CSAPs resulted in 36-44% lower emission intensity (383 kg CO2 eq./Mg/year) compared to BAU (642 kg CO2 eq./Mg/year). Meanwhile, the N-factor productivity and eco-efficiency of the RW system under CSAPs were 32-57% and 70-105% higher than BAU, respectively, which reflects that CSAPs are more economically and environmentally sustainable than BAU. The wheat yield obtained under various CSAPs was 0.62 Mg/ha and 0.84 Mg/ha higher than BAU during normal and bad years (extreme weather events), respectively. Thus, it is evident that CSAPs can cope better with climatic extremes than BAU. Therefore, a portfolio of CSAPs should be promoted in RW belts for more adaptation and climate change mitigation.","[Kakraliya, Suresh K.; Singh, Ishwar; Kakraliya, Manish; Gora, Manoj K.] CCS Haryana Agr Univ, Dept Agron, Hisar 125004, Haryana, India; [Kakraliya, Suresh K.; Jat, Hanuman S.; Kakraliya, Manish; Sharma, Parbodh C.] ICAR Cent Soil Salin Res Inst, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India; [Sapkota, Tek B.; Jat, Mangi L.] NASC Complex, Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, New Delhi 110012, India; [Sapkota, Tek B.] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, El Batan 56237, Texcoco, Mexico",CCS Haryana Agricultural University; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Central Soil Salinity Research Institute; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Jat, HS (corresponding author), ICAR Cent Soil Salin Res Inst, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India.;Jat, ML (corresponding author), NASC Complex, Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, New Delhi 110012, India.",kakraliyask@gmail.com; hs.jat@icar.gov.in; t.sapkota@cgiar.org; skk8326@gmail.com; manishkakraliya719@gmail.com; goramanoj6@gmail.com; parbodh.chander@icar.gov.in; m.jat@cgiar.org,"Jat, ML/O-2824-2019","Jat, ML/0000-0003-0582-1126; Sharma, Parbodh Chander/0000-0002-5783-7480; Sapkota, Tek/0000-0001-5311-0586",,,,,38,2,2,9,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,DEC,2021,11,12,,,,,,,1269,10.3390/agriculture11121269,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11121269,,,20,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,XW6NN,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000735733500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Pastoral women, being among the poorest of the poor, are expected to be highly vulnerable to climate change. However, empirical evidence on gender-differentiated vulnerability and adaptive capacity is limited. A triangulation of different techniques including focused group discussions, individual interviews, case studies and structured observations was used to see if there is a difference in factors that determine the level of vulnerability and adaptive capacity between Afar men and women. Gender inequality inherent in the Afar customary tradition (Adda) acts as a risk multiplying factor, resulting in women being more vulnerable than men to climate change-induced food insecurity and related risks. Moreover, men have better scores in different variables determining vulnerability and adaptive capacity, including wealth ownership, wealth inheritance, household-level decision power, opportunities for community-level participation, household burdens and health or body mass index (BMI). Despite their limited scores in many of these factors, Afar pastoral women make higher contributions to household-level adaptation to recurrent drought and weather variability. A gendered approach that recognizes the difference in potentials, limitations and vulnerabilities of pastoral women and men is required for successful implementation of adaptation measures.","[Balehey, Selam] Mekelle Univ, Inst Environm Gender & Dev Studies, Post Box 231,Main Campus, Mekelle, Tigray, Ethiopia; [Tesfay, Girmay] Mekelle Univ, Dept Nat Resource Econ & Management, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Balehegn, Mulubrhan] UNEP IEMP, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Balehegn, Mulubrhan] Mekelle Univ, Coll Dryland Agr & Nat Resources, Mekelle, Ethiopia",Mekelle University; Mekelle University; Mekelle University,"Balehey, S (corresponding author), Mekelle Univ, Inst Environm Gender & Dev Studies, Post Box 231,Main Campus, Mekelle, Tigray, Ethiopia.",selamsisbg@yahoo.com,,,Mekelle University Recurrent research fund,Mekelle University Recurrent research fund,This study was funded by Mekelle University Recurrent research fund for postgraduate students in 2016.,,47,17,17,2,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2041-7136,,,PASTORALISM,Pastoralism,AUG 29,2018,8,,,,,,,,23,10.1186/s13570-018-0129-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13570-018-0129-1,,,14,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HF6ME,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000454350400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Narratives and quantitative data were used to build a system dynamics (SD) model, ResiMod, within a participatory process. The paper demonstrates how narratives can inform, and be informed by, iterative model development whilst integrating scientific data. The approach facilitated an exploration of perceptions of causality, connections between stakeholder sectors, and mitigatory actions for responding to climate-change impacts on biodiversity.

We conducted interviews with key stakeholders and analysed each CCRA in the context of objective, audience, budget, frame, key findings, dissemination, and how they informed policy. We found that stakeholders used the CCRA in three main ways: (i) to make a business case for their work; (ii) to shape direction of policy or work; and (iii) practical applications. Our findings suggest that the way in which both CCRAs have been operationalized are symptomatic of the UK state reinforcing scientific reductionism in adaptation assessments for policymaking. Recommendations from interviews for future CCRAs included (i) adopting more innovative methodological approaches, (ii) developing more effective mechanisms for operationalisation of the CCRAs, and (iii) improving communication of the CCRAs, their risks and recommendations. This would enable better alignment with user needs and more robust inclusive decision-making processes in the assessment of future UK climate risks and impacts.

Observations show a decline in ISM rainfall from 1950 to 1999 and a recovery from 1999 to 2013. While the decline has been attributed to global warming, aerosol effects, deforestation, and a negative-to-positive phase transition of the interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO), the cause for the recovery remains largely unclear. Through analyses of a 57-member perturbed-parameter ensemble of model simulations, this study shows that the externally forced rainfall trend is relatively weak and is overwhelmed by large internal variability during both 1950-99 and 1999-2013. The IPO is identified as the internal mode that helps modulate the recent decline and recovery of the ISM rainfall. The IPO induces ISM rainfall changes through moisture convergence anomalies associated with an anomalous Walker circulation and meridional tropospheric temperature gradients and the resultant anomalous convection and zonal moisture advection. The negative-to-positive IPO phase transition from 1950 to 1999 reduces what would have been an externally forced weak upward rainfall trend of 0.01 to -0.15 mm day(-1) decade(-1) during that period, while the rainfall trend from 1999 to 2013 increases from the forced value of 0.42 to 0.68 mm day(-1) decade(-1) associated with a positive-to-negative IPO phase transition. Such a significant modulation of the historical ISM rainfall trends by the IPO is confirmed by another 100-member ensemble of simulations using perturbed initial conditions. Our findings highlight that the interplay between the effects of external forcing and the IPO needs be considered for climate adaptation and mitigation strategies in South Asia.","[Huang, Xin; Zhou, Tianjun; Chen, Xiaolong; Jiang, Jie; Man, Wenmin; Wu, Bo; Zhang, Lixia; Zhang, Wenxia; Zou, Liwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LASG, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Xin; Zhou, Tianjun; Jiang, Jie] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Tianjun; Man, Wenmin; Wu, Bo; Zhang, Lixia; Zou, Liwei] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Turner, Andrew] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [Turner, Andrew] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Dai, Aiguo] Univ Albany State Univ New York, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY USA; [Clark, Robin; Murphy, James; Rostron, John] Met Off, Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; University of Reading; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre","Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LASG, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhoutj@lasg.iap.ac.cn; james.murphy@metoffice.gov.uk,"Dai, Aiguo/D-3487-2009; Dai, Aiguo/Y-2443-2019; Chen, Xiaolong/AAO-7147-2020; ZHOU, Tianjun/C-3195-2012; Jiang, Jie/Y-8371-2019; Turner, Andrew G/D-2286-2009; Wu, Bo/C-8644-2009; Zhang, Lixia/J-7752-2017; Zhang, Wenxia/L-8394-2015","Chen, Xiaolong/0000-0003-4098-9952; ZHOU, Tianjun/0000-0002-5829-7279; Jiang, Jie/0000-0002-2095-4667; Turner, Andrew G/0000-0002-0642-6876; Zhang, Lixia/0000-0002-8424-3741; Zhang, Wenxia/0000-0001-8614-8070; Huang, Xin/0000-0002-7351-3902; Man, Wenmin/0000-0003-3004-5464","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20060102]; International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [134111KYSB20160031]; REAL Projections and EMERGENCE projects (NERC) [NE/N018591/1, NE/S004890/1]; National Science Foundation [OISE-1743738]; U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA15OAR4310086, NA18OAR4310425]; U.K.-China Research and Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China as part of the Newton Fund",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences; REAL Projections and EMERGENCE projects (NERC); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); U.K.-China Research and Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China as part of the Newton Fund,"This work was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences under Grant XDA20060102 and the International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences under Grant 134111KYSB20160031.

Capturing the nature of precipitation probability distribution functions (PDF) is critical for assessing variability and change. Conventional linear regression-based analyses assume that slope coefficients for the wet and dry tails of the PDF are consonant with the conditional mean trend. This assumption is not always borne out in the analyses of historical records. Given the relationship between sea surface temperature (SST) and precipitation, recent trends in global SST complicate interpretations of precipitation variability and risk. In this study, changes in the PDF of annual precipitation (1951-2011) at the global river basin scale were analyzed using quantile regression (QR). QR is a flexible approach allowing for the assessment of precipitation variability conditioned on the leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) patterns of global SST that reflect El Nio-Southern Oscillation and Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation. To this end, the framework presented (a) offers a characterization of the entire PDF and its sensitivity to the leading modes of SST variability, (b) captures a range of responses in the PDF including asymmetries, (c) highlights regions likely to experience higher risks of precipitation excesses and deficits and inter-annual variability, and (d) offers an approach for quantifying risk across specified quantiles. Results show asymmetric responses in the PDF in all regions of the world, either in single or both tails. In one instance, QR detects a differential response to the leading patterns of SST in the Tana basin in eastern Africa, highlighting changes in variability as well as risk.","[Lausier, Anne M.; Jain, Shaleen] Univ Maine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Orono, ME 04469 USA",University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Lausier, AM (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",anne.lausier@maine.edu; shaleen.jain@maine.edu,"Jain, Shaleen/B-2923-2011","Jain, Shaleen/0000-0003-1792-4421; Lausier, Anne/0000-0002-2474-7681","US NSF [DGE 1144205, CAREER 1055934]; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys [1055934] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","US NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))",Supported by US NSF grants: DGE 1144205 & CAREER 1055934,,37,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Shifts are expected in precipitation, an essential component of agriculture, including increased intensity of rainfall. We examined the effect of extreme precipitation intensity on spinach (Spinacia oleraceaL.) growth and quality through a manipulative greenhouse study. Water treatments produced by a rainfall simulator modeled precipitation intensity of predicted storms in a spinach-growing area in northeastern USA and were compared to a flooding only treatment. Crop growth and quality were measured using biomass and total phenolic concentration (TPC), a general indicator of quality, which impacts the appearance, flavor, and health attributes of crops. Leaves from plants receiving high-intensity precipitation had smaller biomass than leaves from a flooding treatment. Root biomass exhibited a negative relationship with TPC. Excess water increased TPC of leaves in all treatments. Higher TPC only occurred in roots of the low-intensity precipitation treatment. Findings highlight that water treatments and extreme precipitation may enhance crop quality of spinach leaves in the context of climate change, though too much water could have negative impacts on yield and require climate-adaptation strategies.","[Buckley, Sarabeth] Boston Univ, Earth & Environm Dept, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Buckley, Sarabeth] Harvard Med Sch, Syst Biol Dept, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ahmed, Selena] Montana State Univ, Sustainable Food Syst, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Griffin, Timothy] Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Orians, Colin] Tufts Univ, Biol Dept, Boston, MA 02111 USA",Boston University; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; Tufts University; Tufts University,"Buckley, S (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Earth & Environm Dept, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;Buckley, S (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Syst Biol Dept, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",sarabeth@bu.edu,,"Orians, Colin/0000-0003-3773-0894",,,,,90,1,1,1,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1542-7528,1542-7536,,J CROP IMPROV,J.

A case study illustrates the application of the proposed method using Washington, DC, data. Projections based on the highest greenhouse gas concentration scenario, representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5, indicate a continually increasing trend of heat waves in Washington, DC, in the 21st century. The lowest concentration scenario, RCP 2.6, leads to a slight decay of heat waves after a half-century of increase. The UHI effect projected by RCP 8.5 will be stronger at hot temperatures but weaker at low temperatures, whereas the UHI effect projected by RCP 2.6 will stay the same as the present.

Yet, no widely accepted definition of climate security exists to date. In this paper, we present a mathematical model that defines and assesses climate security as a function of 37 indicators of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The model combines the indicators using statistical methods and fuzzy logic which encapsulates the subjective part of the assessment, to derive an overall climate security score from 0 to 1, and then rank 187 countries. A sensitivity analysis points to those indicators with the highest potential to improve climate security and indicates regional priorities for action. It turns out that globally the highest priorities are the economy which is necessary for climate adaptation, population growth which should be contained, political rights, renewable energy use, and sea level rise. Although several results such as the high ranks of Scandinavian countries are intuitive, the model uncovers unexpected facts such as the higher rank of Uruguay than Denmark and Japan or the higher rank of Costa Rica than Italy. However, a closer look at the intermediate results reveals that Uruguay and Costa Rica are far superior to Denmark, Japan, and Italy in the areas of water and energy.","[Phillis, Yannis A.; Chairetis, Nektarios; Grigoroudis, Evangelos; Kanellos, Fotis D.; Kouikoglou, Vassilis S.] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Prod Engn & Management, Khania 73100, Greece",Technical University of Crete,"Phillis, YA (corresponding author), Tech Univ Crete, Sch Prod Engn & Management, Khania 73100, Greece.",phillis@dpem.tuc.gr,"Grigoroudis, Evangelos/D-7716-2013","Grigoroudis, Evangelos/0000-0001-8613-9350",,,,,23,8,8,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

This revealed overlooked socio-ecological feedbacks between drivers that frustrated interventions to sustain homegarden livelihoods, including increased wild animal incursions thwarting household climate adaptation and disaster recovery; global organic and fair trade incentives reducing food security and livelihood resilience; and national seed and animal regulations counteracting homegarden sustainability programs. Despite these pressures, households maintained homegarden systems for their cultural, aesthetic and eating preferences. An ecosystem services approach can complement sustainable livelihood approaches by identifying overlooked environmental and cultural benefits; reveal livelihood feedbacks from drivers of ecosystem change; avoid unintended consequences from interventions; and capitalise on synergies between stakeholder priorities.","[Landreth, Nicholas] New South Wales Off Environm Heritage, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; United Nations Univ, Tokyo, Japan",Office of Environment & Heritage - New South Wales; United Nations University,"Landreth, N (corresponding author), New South Wales Off Environm Heritage, 59 Goulburn St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia.",nicholas.landreth@environment.nsw.gov.au,"Saito, Osamu/AAU-1495-2021; Saito, Osamu/AAH-6091-2020","Saito, Osamu/0000-0002-0697-9593",,,,,23,18,19,5,68,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-9182,1465-3311,,AUST GEOGR,Aust.

Conventionally, adaptation is understood as adjustments in behavior either to mitigate harm or to exploit opportunities emerging from climate change. The idea features prominently in scientific analyses as well as in policy programs. Despite its growing popularity over the years, the concept has also received critique. Social scientists in particular take issue with the implicit assumptions about human behavior and fitness advantages (or optimal behavior) that come with the term. Clearly, not all human and animal behavioral responses are optimal or display fitness advantages. To the contrary, sub-optimal and maladaptive behavior is rather widespread. Explaining the possibility of maladaptive or sub-optimal behavior led scholars to introduce the idea of traps. Trap situations refer to a mismatch between behavior and the social and/or ecological conditions in which this behavior takes place. This paper reviews the analytical value of traps for the study of human responses to climate change. It first lays out the theoretical assumptions underpinning the concept. A case study of the Tam Giang Lagoon, in central Vietnam, is used to evaluate how well the trap concept captures the sub-optimality and variety of human responses to climate change.","[Boonstra, Wiebren J.] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Tong Thi Hai Hanh] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Program Air Water & Landscape Sci, Uppsala, Sweden",Stockholm University; Uppsala University,"Boonstra, WJ (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, POB 1096, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",wiebrenboonstra@su.se,"Boonstra, Wiebren Johannes/H-9447-2019","Boonstra, Wiebren Johannes/0000-0002-1191-0574","Swedish Development Agency (SIDA); Swedish Research Council FORMAS [2013-1293, 2009-252]; Mistra (the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research)",Swedish Development Agency (SIDA); Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Mistra (the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research),"We would like to thank Sofie Joosse, Andrew Merrie, and Marc Metian for their valuable comments on earlier versions of this paper.

The climate sustainability index (CLS) was introduced to comprehensively explore the impact of climate change and the interactive effect on human health with air pollution. MethodsIn this study, a county-level panel data in China was collected and used. The generalized additive model (GAM) and geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) was used to explore the interactive and spatial effect on mortality between CLS and PM2.5. Results and discussionsIndividually, when CLS is higher than 150 or lower than 50, the mortality is higher. Moreover, when PM2.5 is more than 35 mu g/m(3), the influence on mortality is significantly increased as PM2.5 concentration rises; when PM2.5 is above 70 mu g/m(3), the trend is sharp. A nonlinear antagonistic effect between CLS and PM2.5 was found in this study, proving that the combined adverse health effects of climate change and air pollution, especially when CLS was lower (below 100) and PM2.5 was higher (above 35 mu g/m(3)), the antagonistic effect was much stronger. From a spatial perspective, the impact of CLS and PM2.5 on mortality varies in different geographical regions. A negative and positive influence of CLS and PM2.5 was found in east China, especially in the northeastern and northern regions, -which were heavily polluted. This study illustrated that climate sustainability, at certain level, could mitigate the adverse health influence of air pollution, and provided a new perspective on health risk mitigation from pollution reduction and climate adaptation.","[Guo, Yanan; Yang, Linsheng; Li, Hairong; Qiu, Leijie; Wang, Li; Zhang, Lantian] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yanan; Yang, Linsheng; Li, Hairong; Wang, Li; Zhang, Lantian] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Wang, L (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Wang, L (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wangli@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [42007414]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA23100400],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),Funding This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42007414) and the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA23100400).,,69,0,0,6,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-2565,,FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH,Front.

Restoration actions and sediment management strategies may help mitigate such challenges by encouraging the vertical accretion of sediment in and horizontal migration of tidal forests and marshes. We used a process-based soil accretion model (Coastal Wetland Equilibrium Model) combined with a habitat classification model (MOSAICS) to estimate the effects of SLR, suspended sediment, and inland habitat migration on estuarine habitats, soil carbon accumulation, and economic value of climate change mitigation of carbon accumulation (social cost of carbon dioxide) in a macrotidal estuary in the northwest USA over 100 years (2011 to 2110). Under present-day sediment levels, we projected that after 100 years, most high salt marsh would remain with < 100 cm SLR, but substantial area converted to transitional (low) salt marsh and mudflat with >= 100 cm SLR. Increasing sediment availability increased the projected resilience of transitional salt marsh to SLR but did not prevent declines in high marsh area. Projected total carbon accumulation plateaued or declined with >= 100 cm SLR, yet the economic value of carbon accumulation continued to rise over time, suggesting that the value of this ecosystem service was resilient to SLR. Doubling or tripling sediment availability increased projected carbon accumulation up to 7.69 and 14.2 kg m(-2) and increased total economic value up to $373,000 and $710,000, respectively. Allowing marsh migration supported conversion of upland to freshwater marsh, with slight increases in carbon accumulation. These results inform climate adaptation planning for wetland managers seeking to understand the resilience of estuarine habitats and ecosystem services to SLR under multiple management strategies.","[Moritsch, Monica M.; Byrd, Kristin B.] US Geol Survey, Western Geog Sci Ctr, 350 N Akron Rd, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Davis, Melanie] Oregon State Univ, US Geol Survey, Oregon Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, 104 Nash Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Good, Anthony] US Geol Survey, Sci & Decis Ctr, 12201 Sunrise Valley Dr,MS 913, Reston, VA 20192 USA; [Drexler, Judith Z.] US Geol Survey, Calif Water Sci Ctr, 6000 J St,Placer Hall, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA; [Morris, James T.] Univ South Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, 715 Sumter St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Woo, Isa] US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, 350 N Akron Rd, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Windham-Myers, Lisamarie] US Geol Survey, Water Mission Area, 345 Middlefield Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Grossman, Eric] US Geol Survey, Pacific Coastal & Marine Sci Ctr, 2885 Mission St, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Nakai, Glynnis] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Billy Frank Jr Nisqually Natl Wildlife Refuge, 100 Brown Farm Rd NE, Olympia, WA 98516 USA; [Poppe, Katrina L.; Rybczyk, John M.] Western Washington Univ, Dept Environm Sci, 516 High St, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Oregon State University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service; Western Washington University,"Moritsch, MM (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Western Geog Sci Ctr, 350 N Akron Rd, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.",monicamoritsch@gmail.com,"; Woo, Isa/P-4885-2018","Moritsch, Monica/0000-0002-3890-1264; Poppe, Katrina/0000-0003-2830-4578; Woo, Isa/0000-0002-8447-9236",U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Northwest Climate Adaptation Science Center; USGS Land Carbon Program; USGS Land Change Science Program,U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Northwest Climate Adaptation Science Center; USGS Land Carbon Program; USGS Land Change Science Program(United States Geological Survey),"This research was funded by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Northwest Climate Adaptation Science Center, the USGS Land Carbon Program and the USGS Land Change Science Program.",,77,0,0,12,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-2723,1559-2731,,ESTUAR COAST,Estuaries Coasts,DEC,2022,45,8,,,,,2293,2309,,10.1007/s12237-022-01087-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-022-01087-5,,MAY 2022,17,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,5O0PB,,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000805547200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Brazilian Amazon is the world's largest rainforest regions and plays a key role in biodiversity conservation as well as climate adaptation and mitigation. The government has created a network of protected areas (PAs) to ensure long-term conservation of the region. However, despite the importance of and positive advances in the establishment of PAs, natural resource depletion in the Brazilian Amazon is pervasive. Methods. We evaluated a total of 4,243 official law enforcement records generated between 2010 and 2015 to understand the geographical distribution of the illegal use of resources in federal PAs in the Brazilian Amazon. We classified illegal activities into ten categories and used generalized additive models (GAMs) to evaluate the relationship between illegal use of natural resources inside PAs with management type, age of PAs, population density, and accessibility. Results. We found 27 types of illegal use of natural resources that were grouped into 10 categories of illegal activities. Most infractions were related to suppression and degradation of vegetation (37.40%), followed by illegal fishing (27.30%) and hunting activities (18.20%). The explanatory power of the GAMs was low for all categories of illegal activity, with a maximum explained variation of 41.2% for illegal activities as a whole, and a minimum of 14.6% for hunting activities. Discussion. These findings demonstrate that even though PAs are fundamental for nature conservation in the Brazilian Amazon, the pressures and threats posed by human activities include a broad range of illegal uses of natural resources. Population density up to 50 km from a PA is a key variable, influencing illegal activities. These threats endanger long-term conservation and many efforts are still needed to maintain PAs that are large enough and sufficiently intact to maintain ecosystem functions and protect biodiversity.","[Kauano, Erico E.; Silva, Jose M.

However, few simulation models have been established based on actual products and rarely have been validated by experiments. In this paper, a four-layer CdTe-based VPV glazing was developed and the corresponding numerical heat transfer model was established with the integration of a dynamic power generation model. The numerical model was then validated against both the results from the WINDOW program and a guarded hot box experiment. Afterward, the validated model was employed to analyze the energy and power generation performance of the VPV glazing in diverse climate zones in China with Harbin, Beijing, Changsha, Guangzhou, and Kunming used as representative cities. The numerical simulation results indicate that the U-value of the proposed VPV glazing is 0.89 W/(m(2).K), which is in good agreement with the experimental results. Compared with a normal double glazing, the average energy reductions achieved with VPV glazing in air conditioning seasons are 128 kWh/m(2), 23 kWh/m(2), 45 kWh/m(2), and 52 kWh/m(2) in Harbin, Beijing, Changsha, and Guangzhou, respectively.

Land use change alters surface runoff and affects basin-wide hydrological processes and water consumption, while climate change modifies precipitation and temperature patterns and consequently evapotranspiration and water supply. In this study, water yield, supply and consumption are simulated in a watershed draining into the Caspian Sea in northern Iran, using the water yield model in the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Service and Tradeoffs (InVEST) tool. The novelty of this study is found in the combined modelling of the impacts of climate and land use change scenarios on water security, translating these results into a water stress indicator, and estimating the associated economic costs of reduced future water supply. The results show substantial spatial variation of the negative impacts of water supply and future water security across the watershed, further increasing the pressure on its inhabitants, their economic activities and ecological values. The estimation of the economic costs of increased water insecurity allows us to inform policy and decision-makers about future investments in climate adaptation and mitigation.","[Daneshi, Alireza; Najafinejad, Ali] Gorgan Univ Agr Sci & Nat Resources, Dept Watershed Management Sci & Engn, Gorgan, Golestan, Iran; [Brouwer, Roy] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Brouwer, Roy] Univ Waterloo, Water Inst, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Brouwer, Roy] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Panahi, Mostafa] Islamic Azad Univ, Fac Nat Resources & Environm, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Zarandian, Ardavan] Res Ctr Environm & Sustainable Dev, Tehran, Iran; [Maghsood, Fatemeh Fadia] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Watershed Management & Engn, Coll Nat Resources, Tehran, Iran; [Maghsood, Fatemeh Fadia] Lund Univ, Ctr Middle Eastern Studies, Lund, Sweden",University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Islamic Azad University; Tarbiat Modares University; Lund University,"Daneshi, A (corresponding author), Gorgan Univ Agr Sci & Nat Resources, Dept Watershed Management Sci & Engn, Gorgan, Golestan, Iran.",alireza.daneshi_s94@gau.ac.ir,"Panahi, Mostafa/W-6848-2019; Brouwer, Roy/M-9437-2013","Brouwer, Roy/0000-0002-0525-2050; Daneshi, Alireza/0000-0002-2855-5468; Maghsood, Fatemeh Fadia/0000-0002-3980-7835; Panahi, Mostafa/0000-0001-7480-6232",Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources (GUASNR); Queen Elizabeth Scholarship - Advanced Scholars (QES-Arthritis Society) program in Canada,Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources (GUASNR); Queen Elizabeth Scholarship - Advanced Scholars (QES-Arthritis Society) program in Canada,"We are grateful to the experts in the Department of Natural Resources of Golestan Province and the professors in the Departments of Watershed Management, Rangeland Management, and Environmental Sciences in the Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources for their time and efforts to complete the survey, which was used for the development of the land use change scenarios.

Municipal level institutions design and implement sustainability action plans, climate action plans and increasingly, climate adaption projects. This article reviews the debates surrounding the role of institutions in sustainable urban governance, as well as the tools available to assess the plurality of actors working within and across institutional boundaries. Sustainability as a guiding principle in urban planning requires a fundamental reorientation of the rationalities that have governed discrete aspects of social, economic and political life in cities. Institutions, in ordering the administrative and management activities of urban governments, are critical in efforts to hasten the adoption of sustainability ideals and in the implementation of associated projects. Urban political institutions engage with new forms of environmental leadership and polycentric forms of environmental governance in response to contextually specific urban characteristics and actor constellations. The extent to which sustainability ideals are institutionalized depends on sound analysis that helps form new understandings of the ways in which human-environment systems are coupled - and how this coupling should inform governance action in support of sustainable urban development.","[Bridges, Allison] Rutgers Univ New Brunswick, Edward J Bloustein Sch Planning & Publ Policy, 33 Livingston Ave, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",Rutgers State University New Brunswick,"Bridges, A (corresponding author), Rutgers Univ New Brunswick, Edward J Bloustein Sch Planning & Publ Policy, 33 Livingston Ave, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",bridges.allison@gmail.com,,"Bridges, Allison/0000-0002-0215-2804",,,,,104,9,9,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0165-0203,1477-8947,,NAT RESOUR FORUM,Nat.

We study climate change effects on the triple bottom line of ecological productivity, fishers' incomes, and fish consumption for an artisanal open-access fishery. We develop and apply an empirical, stochastic bio-economic model for the Senegalese artisanal purse seine fishery on small pelagic fish and compare the simulated fishery's development using four climate projections and two policy scenarios. We find that economic processes of adaptation may amplify the effects of climate variations. The regions' catch potential increases with climate change, induced by stock distribution changes. However, this outcome escalates over-fishing, whose effects outpace the incipiently favorable climate change effects under three of the four climate projections. Without policy action, the fishery is estimated to collapse in 2030-2035 on average over 1000 runs. We propose an easily implementable and overall welfare-increasing intervention: reduction of fuel subsidies. If fuel subsidies were abolished, ecological sustainability as well as the fishery's welfare contribution would increase regardless of the climate projection.","[Lancker, Kira] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Halle Jena Leipzig, Biodivers Econ, Leipzig, Germany; [Deppenmeier, Anna-Lena] Wageningen Univ, Meteorol & Air Qual Dept, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Deppenmeier, Anna-Lena] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, R&D Weather & Climate Modeling, De Bilt, Netherlands; [Demissie, Teferi] NORCE Norwegian Res Ctr AS, NORCE Climate, Bergen, Norway; [Demissie, Teferi] Agr & Food Secur CCAFS East Africa, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Schmidt, Joern O.] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany",Wageningen University & Research; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Norwegian Research Centre (NORCE); CGIAR; University of Kiel,"Lancker, K (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Halle Jena Leipzig, Biodivers Econ, Leipzig, Germany.",kira.lancker@idiv.de,"Schmidt, Jörn Oliver/A-7714-2008","Schmidt, Jörn Oliver/0000-0002-4420-6532; Lancker, Kira/0000-0001-8787-1148",EU; Cluster of Excellence Future Ocean; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig - German Research Foundation [FZT 118]; German Research Foundation (DFG); Leipzig University within the program of Open Access Publishing,EU(European Commission); Cluster of Excellence Future Ocean; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig - German Research Foundation; German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Leipzig University within the program of Open Access Publishing,"We gratefully acknowledge data provision by the Centre of Oceanographic Research of DakarThiaroye (CRODT), the Direction des peches maritimes (DPM), the National Agency of Statistics and Demography (ANSD), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).

In this matter, the role of building managers and opera-tors is crucial to capture the needs of occupants and to adapt the response of the building accordingly. IEA EBC Annex 79 participants conducted 72 interviews with operators and facility managers across 7 coun-tries (Brazil, Canada, Germany, Italy, Poland, Singapore, and USA) covering a wide range of ASHRAE 169 climate zones (from 0 to 5 in the climate classification). This paper presents a qualitative cross-case anal-ysis of operators' perspectives and experiences to identify regional differences. Therefore, the analyses are based on the hypotheses that climate or other country-related aspects would be the main drivers of building operation procedures differences. Results show climatic differences have little influence on building management, while occupants' complaints are very influenced by them. Moreover, operators are lacking clear tools, like guidelines and standards, on how to optimize building management in a climatic-adaptive and occupant-centric manner. Therefore, the development of operation protocols for building sustainable operation respecting climatic context and occupants' control is recommended.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

To conduct this research, first, the homogeneous units were prepared using slope maps, lithology, land use, and erosion forms in a Geographic Information System environment. Then, to optimize the number of homogeneous units, the cluster analysis method was used in Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) software. The diagnostic analysis confirmed the accuracy of cluster analysis inhomogeneous regions. Field operations were carried out in homogeneous units with the establishment of a rainfall simulator and also the application of 30-min rainfall intensity with a return period of 10 years. Also, the collected soil samples were analyzed in the laboratory. After performing statistical analyses in the SPSS environment, the variables affecting erosion were determined and prioritized. Then, through the use of multivariate linear regression and step-by-step and interpolation methods, the equations for estimating the amount of erosion were determined. Finally, the multivariate linear model of plot erosion was prepared using the step-by-step method using two variables of plot slope and land use. The model was selected for estimating erosion after examining different validation methods based on less RE and less RMSE, higher R, low significance coefficient (Sig < 0.05), and also fewer inputs.","[Farajzadeh, S.] Islamic Azad Univ, Teheran Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Khaleghi, M.

To date, however, research has not looked empirically at how everyday urban politics shape the multi-scalar political constraints that prevent municipalities from implementing transformational adaptation. We analyze the Poblenou superblock project in Barcelona, Spain as an effort to enact transformational land use planning linked with climate adaptation efforts. We find that the key driver behind opposition is the everyday political struggle for municipal authority, which materializes in clashing visions for the future city - and who has the political clout to define and own them. We show that urban transformation is at least as much about competitive urbanism and related short-term political gains as it is about the importance of environmental and quality-of-life benefits that are ostensibly the target of interventions. We also highlight how civic and political contestation over the authority of `climate champions' can jeopardize not only transformational adaptation achievements, but also the political survival of champions themselves. We conclude that transformational adaptation can be obstructed not only out of fear for the material and political effects of transformation per se, but also because of the message it conveys as concerns of who has the authority to decide for the common good.","[Zografos, Christos] Johns Hopkins Univ Pompeu Fabra Univ JHU UPF Publ, Barcelona, Spain; [Zografos, Christos] Pompeu Fabra Univ, Dept Polit & Social Sci, GREDS EMCONET, Barcelona, Spain; [Klause, Kai A.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, Barcelona, Spain; [Connolly, James J.

To reduce risk, heatwave plans and cold weather plans have been effectively implemented around the world. However, much of the world's population is not yet protected by such systems, including many data-scarce but also highly vulnerable regions. In this study, we assess at a global level where such systems have the potential to be effective at reducing risk from temperature extremes, characterizing (1) long-term average occurrence of heatwaves and coldwaves, (2) seasonality of these extremes, and (3) short-term predictability of these extreme events three to ten days in advance. Using both the NOAA and ECMWF weather forecast models, we develop global maps indicating a first approximation of the locations that are likely to benefit from the development of seasonal preparedness plans and/or short-term early warning systems for extreme temperature. The extratropics generally show both short-term skill as well as strong seasonality; in the tropics, most locations do also demonstrate one or both. In fact, almost 5 billion people live in regions that have seasonality and predictability of heatwaves and/or coldwaves. Climate adaptation investments in these regions can take advantage of seasonality and predictability to reduce risks to vulnerable populations.","[de Perez, Erin Coughlan; van Aalst, Maarten] Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Ctr, The Hague, Netherlands; [de Perez, Erin Coughlan; Mason, Simon; Nissan, Hannah] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, New York, NY 10027 USA; [de Perez, Erin Coughlan; van Aalst, Maarten; Bischiniotis, Konstantinos] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Aalst, Maarten] UCL, Dept Sci Technol Engn & Publ Policy, London, England; [Pappenberger, Florian; Zsoter, Ervin] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England; [Stephens, Elisabeth; van den Hurk, Bart] Univ Reading, Sch Archaeol Geog & Environm Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [van den Hurk, Bart] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, De Bilt, Netherlands",Columbia University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of London; University College London; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); University of Reading; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute,"de Perez, EC (corresponding author), Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Ctr, The Hague, Netherlands.;de Perez, EC (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, New York, NY 10027 USA.;de Perez, EC (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",coughlan.erin@gmail.com,"Pappenberger, Florian/A-2839-2009; Mason, Simon/AAH-5699-2020; van Aalst, Maarten/X-2017-2018; van den Hurk, Bart/ABI-1654-2020","Pappenberger, Florian/0000-0003-1766-2898; van Aalst, Maarten/0000-0003-0319-5627; van den Hurk, Bart/0000-0003-3726-7086; Coughlan de Perez, Erin/0000-0001-7645-5720; Nissan, Hannah/0000-0002-5340-6739; Zsoter, Ervin/0000-0002-7998-0130; Stephens, Elisabeth/0000-0002-5439-7563",US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [NA13OAR4310184],US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"The authors of this paper would like to extend their gratitude to the humanitarian practitioners who have piloted Forecast-based Financing around the world, and asked the questions that have led to this research.

This paper quantitatively analyzes the data from a large-scale field study across the country conducted from 2008 to 2011 in residential buildings. The study covers nine typical cities located in the five climate zones including Severe Cold (SC), Cold (C), Hot Summer and Cold Winter (HSCW), Hot Summer and Warm Winter (HSWW) and Mild (M) zones. It is revealed that there exists a large regional discrepancy in indoor thermal environment, the worst performing region being the HSCW zone. Human's long-term climate adaptation leads to wider range of acceptable thermal comfort temperature. Different graphic comfort zones with acceptable range of temperature and humidity for the five climate zones are obtained using the adaptive Predictive Mean Vote (aPMV) model. The results show that occupants living in the poorer thermal environments in the HSCW and HSWW zones are more adaptive and tolerant to poor indoor conditions than those living in the north part of China where central heating systems are in use. It is therefore recommended to develop regional evaluation standards of thermal environments responding to climate characteristics as well as local occupants' acclimatization and adaptation in order to meeting dual targets of energy conservation and indoor thermal environment improvement.

Both a terrestrial part and a marine part are usually included, which can be anything from ten to two hundred or more meters. They are usually declared public domain zones, and a protection zone, parallel to the coastal edge, is often determined. The function of the protection zone is to reduce pressures of anthropogenic origin on coastal ecosystems, its services and, simultaneously, mitigate extreme natural phenomena within the inhabited areas of the coast. Protection zones are established according to different types of criteria. In this study, they have been classified into two main groups: scientific/universal criteria and functional/operational criteria. Integrated coastal zone management addresses complex problems for the organization of economic uses and activities, based on the protection of ecosystems, while addressing coastal risks. At present, erosion is one of the most serious issues affecting the coast, a problem that is likely to intensify as a result of sea level rise, which is an effect of climate change. The objective of this paper is to analyze regulations affecting the coast in the Ibero-American Region, paying special attention to the definition of the geographical area. Results of this study are: most laws, especially in the terrestrial area, use arbitrary criteria and metric distances. In the marine environment, the limit of the coastal zone is usually fixed up to 12 nautical miles from the Territorial Sea. On few occasions, natural-physical criteria are used, which take into account the characteristics of the coast and anthropic criteria, such as the socio-economic reality. This means that limits have been established that are politically functional, as well as practices that do not take into account the vulnerability of the area, the functioning of coastal ecosystems or protection against natural risks. We are in no doubt that, faced with the challenge of establishing adaptation measures for the effects of climate change, the search for a new delimitation of the coastal zone should be considered an urgent matter.","[Luisa Perez-Cayeiro, Maria; Adolfo Chica-Ruiz, Juan; Macias Bedoya, Ana] Univ Cadiz, Inst Invest Desarrallo Social Sostenible INDESS, Fac Ciencias Mar & Ambient, Cadiz, Spain; [Arcila Garrido, Manuel] Univ Cadiz, Inst Invest Desarrallo Social Sostenible INDESS, Fac Filosofia & Letras, Cadiz, Spain",Universidad de Cadiz; Universidad de Cadiz,"Perez-Cayeiro, ML (corresponding author), Univ Cadiz, Inst Invest Desarrallo Social Sostenible INDESS, Fac Ciencias Mar & Ambient, Cadiz, Spain.",isa.perez@uca.es,"Bedoya, Ana Macías/AAN-3086-2020; Ruiz, Juan Adolfo J.

Whether depicted as success or failure, both framings can invisibilize the preexisting socioenvironmental processes that render climate-induced migrations necessary-or, conversely, that can inhibit them entirely. Perspectives on displacement and environmental migration from within political ecology and human geography offer an alternative register, looking beyond unidirectional socioeconomic or environmental drivers to document how uneven development reproduces displacements relationally and historically. Drawing on these theorizations, as well as empirical research from agrarian Southeast Asia, this article develops the notion of cumulative socionatural displacements as one approach for conceptualizing socioecologically driven displacement in a world already on the move. We demonstrate this approach through an analysis of displacement in Southeast Asia that begins by tracing the evolving state, market, and agroecological relations that have made mobility integral to agrarian viability while setting the stage for more intense climate impacts. In doing so, we also center the long-term (nonclimatic) environmental changes that are often sidelined in both anthropocentric debates on rural displacements and climate doomsday scenarios. We argue that examining climate-induced migration as just one facet of cumulative socionatural displacements is necessary for overcoming the ontological and political impasses engendered by prevailing narratives that collapse climate migration into convenient but misleading binaries.","[Kelley, Lisa C.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Denver, CO 80217 USA; [Shattuck, Annie] Univ Indiana, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN USA; [Thomas, Kimberley Anh] Temple Univ, Dept Geog & Urban Studies, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Kelley, LC (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Denver, CO 80217 USA.",lisa.kelley@ucdenver.edu; shattuck@iu.edu; kimthomas@temple.edu,,"Kelley, Lisa/0000-0001-6638-4017; Thomas, Kimberley/0000-0002-9600-385X",National Science Foundation [1740135],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),The authors acknowledge funding from the National Science Foundation (Grant No. 1740135).,,48,2,2,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2469-4452,2469-4460,,ANN AM ASSOC GEOGR,Ann.

However, health is reported to be less active in climate adaptation than other sectors. To contribute to better understanding urban health adaptation efforts and identifying gaps we developed a City Climate Health Adaptation Typology and tested it with adaptation actions of 106 large world cities (population > 1 million) reported to a major publiclyavailable adaptation database. We found two-thirds of actions of these ?active adapter? cities were healthassociated. Half were health information activities (e.g., hazard mapping, early warnings); and nearly onethird addressed climate-relevant health determinants in the urban built environment (e.g., green space). Forty percent of cities were in low- or middle-income countries. Our proposed typology provides a systematic framework for monitoring and comparing city health adaptation actions. Reported city actions are suggestive of increasing depth and breadth of urban health-associated adaptation. However, even among these adaptationengaged cities, a health adaptation gap was apparent in key climate health services (e.g., mental health), and in climate-related public health governance and capacity building. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated pressing need for strong public health institutions. We recommend better integration of public health agencies into local climate action planning, enhanced modes of collaboration between health and non-health agencies and with non-governmental actors, and strengthening of city public health adaptive capacity including through networking.","[Sheehan, Mary C.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, 615 North Wolfe St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Sheehan, Mary C.] Johns Hopkins Pompeu Fabra Publ Policy Ctr, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Freire, Mila] Johns Hopkins Sch Adv Int Studies, 1740 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Martinez, Gerardo Sanchez] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Management Engn, UNEP DTU Partnership, UN City, Mamorvej 51, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Johns Hopkins University; Technical University of Denmark,"Sheehan, MC (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, 615 North Wolfe St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",msheeh10@jhu.edu; mfreire2@jhu.edu; gsama@dtu.dk,,"Sanchez Martinez, Gerardo/0000-0002-3290-6195",,,,,64,2,2,9,23,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0013-9351,1096-0953,,ENVIRON RES,Environ.

Estimating the spatial distribution of ISA and vegetation is critical for analyzing urban landscape patterns and their impact on the thermal environment. In this paper, linear spectralmixture analysis (LSMA) is used to extract their respective subpixel land cover composition from bitemporal Landsat images and the accuracy of the fractional covers is assessed with a subpixel confusion matrix at the category level and the map level by comparing with the reference data from high-resolution images. The percent ISA was divided into discrete categories representing different urban development density areas. Mean land surface temperature (LST) is calculated for each ISA category to analyze the thermal characteristics of different levels of development in the urban area of Fuzhou, China. ISA and vegetation variations are also quantified between different ISA categories and different dates. The contribution index is also calculated based on each ISA category to analyze the impact of different landscape patterns on the urban thermal environment. The results show that ISA category is an important determinant of the urban thermal environment. Furthermore, seasonal variations significantly impact the strength of this relationship. In the study area, the contribution indices were highest in the 90%-100% ISA category in summer 2013 and early spring 2001. The analytical methodologies used in this study can help to quantify urban thermal environmental functions under conditions of urban expansion and explore the climate adaptation potential of cities.","[Zhang, Youshui; Liu, Bin; Chen, Yajun] Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Geog, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Youshui; Liu, Bin; Chen, Yajun] Fujian Normal Univ, Key Lab Subtrop Mt Ecol, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China; [Balzter, Heiko] Univ Leicester, Dept Geog, Leicester Inst Space & Earth Observat, Ctr Landscape & Climate Res, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Balzter, Heiko] Univ Leicester, Natl Ctr Earth Observat, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",Fujian Normal University; Fujian Normal University; University of Leicester; University of Leicester,"Zhang, YS (corresponding author), Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Geog, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China.;Zhang, YS (corresponding author), Fujian Normal Univ, Key Lab Subtrop Mt Ecol, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China.",zhangyoushui@sina.com; hb91@le.ac.uk; liubin561@sina.cn; 1433105756@qq.com,"Balzter, Heiko/B-5976-2008","Balzter, Heiko/0000-0002-9053-4684",Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award [2011/R3]; NERC National Centre for Earth Observation; NERC [nceo020005] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [nceo020005] Funding Source: researchfish,Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award(Royal Society of London); NERC National Centre for Earth Observation(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The work of H.

Given that agricultural water use is the largest water consumer throughout the U.S. Southwest, this study sought to answer two specific research questions: (1) How does water consumption vary by crop type on a metropolitan spatial scale? (2) What is the impact of drought on agricultural water consumption? To answer the above research questions, 92 Landsat images were acquired to generate fine-resolution daily evapotranspiration (ET) maps at 30 m spatial resolution for both dry and wet years (a total of 1095 ET maps), and major crop types were identified for the Phoenix Active Management Area. The study area has a subtropical desert climate and relies almost completely on irrigation for farming. Results suggest that there are some factors that farmers and water managers can control. During dry years, crops of all types use more water. Practices that can offset this higher water use include double or multiple cropping practice, drought tolerant crop selection, and optimizing the total farmed area. Double and multiple cropping practices result in water savings because soil moisture is retained from one planting to another. Further water savings occur when drought tolerant crop types are selected, especially in dry years. Finally, disproportionately large area coverage of high water consuming crops can be balanced and/or reduced or replaced with more water efficient crops. This study provides strong evidence that water savings can be achieved through policies that create incentives for adopting smart cropping strategies, thus providing important guidelines for sustainable agriculture management and climate adaptation to improve future food security.","[Myint, Soe W.; Wentz, Elizabeth A.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Aggarwal, Rimjhim] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Zheng, Baojuan] South Dakota State Univ, Geospatial Sci Ctr Excellence, Brookings, SD 57006 USA; [Holway, Jim] Lincoln Inst Land Policy, Babbitt Ctr Land & Water Policy, Phoenix, AZ 85028 USA; [Fan, Chao] Univ Idaho, Dept Geog, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Selover, Nancy J.] Arizona State Univ, Arizona State Climate Off, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Wang, Chuyuan] Towson Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Planning, Towson, MD 21252 USA; [Fischer, Heather A.] Oregon State Univ, Ctr Res Lifelong STEM Learning, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; South Dakota State University; Idaho; University of Idaho; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University System of Maryland; Towson University; Oregon State University,"Myint, SW (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",Soe.Myint@asu.edu; rimjhim.aggarwal@asu.edu; baojuan5@vt.edu; wentz@asu.edu; jholway@lincolninst.edu; cfan@uidaho.edu; selover@asu.edu; cwang@towson.edu; heather.fischer@oregonstate.edu,"; Wang, Chuyuan/I-2662-2018","Aggarwal, Rimjhim/0000-0002-3579-5363; Wang, Chuyuan/0000-0002-6381-6424; Fan, Chao/0000-0002-6037-8940; Fischer, Heather/0000-0003-2530-3529","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA12OAR4310100]; National Science Foundation [DEB-1026865, SES-0951366, SES-0345945, CNS-1639227]",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The study was funded by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (grant number: NA12OAR4310100).

This study evaluated for the first time the performance of the statistical downscaling model (SDSM-DC) at 2m spatial resolution in simulating rainfall in Ghana for the base period 1981-2010. It further analysed the projected changes in seasonal rainfall pattern across different agro-ecological zones for the twenty-first century under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 emission scenarios over Ghana. Ensemble mean of simulated rainfall data (2011-2099) generated by 43 GCMs in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) were used as base factors for local future climate scenarios generation. Performance analysis of SDSM-DC shows a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, percent bias and RMSE observations standard deviation ratio of 0.88, -19 and 0.34, respectively. Generally, seasonal rainfall amount is expected to increase between 10 and 40% in all the agro-ecological zones in Ghana by the end of the twenty-first century. Off-season rainfall in December-February shows more than 100% increase in the Guinea Savannah zone. Rainfall projected under RCP 4.5 was on average 2% higher than RCP 8.5 in all the seasons throughout the century. Based on these results, it is appropriate to suggest a high incidence of flooding across Ghana in the twenty-first century. This could have dire consequences on agriculture which contribute to a large proportion of Ghana's GDP. Therefore, for sustainable food production and security in the twenty-first century, Ghana needs climate adaptation policies and programmes that encourage the design and implementation of early warning systems of meteorological hazards and the introduction of new crop varieties that are flood tolerant.","[Bessah, Enoch] Univ Ibadan, Pan African Univ, Inst Life & Earth Sci Including Hlth & Agr, Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria; [Bessah, Enoch; Agodzo, Sampson K.] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Agr & Biosyst Engn, PMB, Kumasi, Ghana; [Boakye, Emmanuel A.] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Renewable Nat Resources, Dept Silviculture & Forest Management, PMB, Kumasi, Ghana; [Nyadzi, Emmanuel] Wageningen Univ & Res, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Larbi, Isaac] Univ Environm & Sustainable Dev, Sch Sustainable Dev, Dept Water Resources Dev, Somanya, Ghana; [Awotwi, Alfred] Univ Dev Studies, Dept Geoinformat & Spatial Dev, Navrongo, Ghana",University of Ibadan; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; Wageningen University & Research; University for Development Studies,"Bessah, E (corresponding author), Univ Ibadan, Pan African Univ, Inst Life & Earth Sci Including Hlth & Agr, Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria.;Bessah, E (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Agr & Biosyst Engn, PMB, Kumasi, Ghana.",enoch.bessah@gmail.com; emmanuel.boakye@knust.edu.gh; skagodzo7@usa.net; Emmanuel.nyadzi@wur.nl; larbi.i@edu.wascal.org; awor73@yahoo.com,"Larbi, Isaac/GNH-5792-2022; Bessah, Enoch/E-7243-2018","Larbi, Isaac/0000-0001-8748-0649; Bessah, Enoch/0000-0002-2187-2022; Boakye, Emmanuel Amoah/0000-0002-0993-4964; Attoh, Emmanuel Mawuli Nii Armah Nyadzi/0000-0001-6527-852X",,,,,103,6,6,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Vegetation has unavoidably affected the temperature by altering surface properties, while the magnitude of this effect has remained unknown. This study aimed to investigate the patterns of global Ts-Ta and quantify the contribution of vegetation change. Trend analysis, correlation analysis and a trajectory-based method were adopted for the investigation. The results demonstrated that the global Ts-Ta decreased by -0.140 K from 2001 to 2016. The greening trend covered 24.46% of the land and played a profound role in changing Ts-Ta. In particular, vegetation changes resulted in -0.0022 K, -0.0092 K and - 0.0043 K of the Ts-Ta decreases at the global, greening and browning levels, respectively accounting for 11.58%, 35.38% and 20.38% of the total decrease. Physically, vegetation influenced Ts-Ta mainly by altering atmospheric properties, rather than surface properties. Specifically, the greening of the surface reduced the albedo at a rate of -0.0003/year over 20% of the global land and enhanced atmospheric water vapor by 3 x 10(-5) g/m(3) over approximately 40% of the land. Meanwhile, the effect of vegetation change varied with coverage. A reduction in albedo caused by vegetation change occurred equally over different vegetated conditions, while the enhancement of atmospheric water vapor occurred mainly in sparsely (0.10 < NDVI < 0.30) and densely (0.55 < NDVI < 0.70) vegetated regions. Under these conditions, the vegetation change mainly affected Ts-Ta in sparsely vegetated regions (NDVI < 0.4). The results of this study are helpful for understanding the physical mechanism behind changes in global Ts-Ta and support climatic adaptation and environmental management. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Drawing from the climate action and policy mix literatures, this study conceptualizes climate action mix defined as the diverse policy actions adopted by city governments to adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate hazards. This study makes a key contribution by analyzing the relation between the variety of hazards and the diversity of cities' climate action mixes. Deploying a modified Shannon diversity index, we develop a new measure of climate action mix by considering the breadth across different actions, and the depth of these efforts as measured by the progress along the policy cycle. We study an expansive range of mitigation and adaptation actions without imposing any domain or jurisdictional limitations in 162 cities across the United States. The analysis reveals a bifurcation in approaches where some cities have not adopted any policies, while others have a diverse mix of adaptation and mitigation actions in various stages of policy progression. We find that climate hazards drive local action-cities that experience multiple threats react by taking a diverse mix of climate actions. Cities broadly utilize global climate networks that offer policy learning opportunities and local networks that might promote a shared understanding of environmental threats leading to diverse climate action mixes. Finally, a city's capacity to develop climate adaptation and mitigation plans is positively related to a diverse portfolio of climate actions.","[Soni, Anmol] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Baton Rouge, LA USA; [Jose, Justina] San Diego State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, San Diego, CA USA; [Kingsley, Gordon A.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA USA; [Soni, Anmol] Louisiana State Univ, 3047 Business Educ Complex East,501 South Quad Dr, Baton Rouge, LA 70808 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; California State University System; San Diego State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Soni, A (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, 3047 Business Educ Complex East,501 South Quad Dr, Baton Rouge, LA 70808 USA.",anmolsoni@lsu.edu,,"Soni, Anmol/0000-0001-9193-5220",,,,,86,0,0,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1541-132X,1541-1338,,REV POLICY RES,Rev.

However the long-term trends demand adaptation strategies. While a variety of solutions have been suggested, some politically viable, others not, perhaps the most significant barrier to a cohesive approach to climate adaptation is the failure from the public and policy-makers to realize that different areas will be affected differently and that one-size-fits-all policy solutions will not be successful. In addition, as one area may identify and respond to challenges in their location, others should be supportive of those efforts, realizing that while such actions may be neither desirable nor appropriate for them, they may need support for solutions in the future in their areas. This project was designed as a framework to identify solutions and demonstrate differences between small regions and locales based on field conditions. The State of Florida was used as a case example to outline these differences because Florida is faced with significant challenges in the coming years related to water resources, the use of funds and political capital, and the potential for economic disruption. The intent is that the results of this project will lead to a series of recommendations and action steps for policy makers to conserve the state's assets. A similar approach can be used in other states and countries to assess the likely policy and infrastructure needs for different locales.","Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University,"Bloetscher, F (corresponding author), Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA.",h2o_man@bellsouth.net,,,,,,,29,6,6,0,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUN,2012,4,2,,,,,367,388,,10.3390/w4020367,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w4020367,,,22,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,053FE,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000312255600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study uses an index-based approach to calculate Institutional Capacity Indices (ICI) based on selected seven indicators. The results of the index analysis show that institutions have the least financial capacity, followed by lacking physical and human resources. Whereas results show high index value for perception and knowledge, indicating a good understanding of climate change at the institutional level. The overall ICI index value indicates a medium level capacity of institutions in dealing with climate change. Moreover, the study shows that gaps in management, non-availability of financial and physical resources, and lack of training are the key bottlenecks for limited adaptation support from public institutions.

To accomplish this objective, a reservoir management tool was developed. The tool integrates: hydrological ensemble streamflow predictions; a stochastic optimization model; a neural network model; and a water balance model. Five climate projections from a regional climate model, under current (1961-2000) and future (2041-2070) climate scenarios, were used. Adjustments to the reservoirs operating rules were used as an adaptation strategy to limit flooding in the watershed and also in the Montreal Archipelago located downstream of the watershed. A number of constraints in the reservoirs of the Lievre watershed are related to summer recreational activities, which would start earlier in future climate. Modifications of these constraints were simulated to take into account socio-economic impacts of climate change on reservoirs operation. Results show that greater quantities of water would have to be stored in the Lievre River watershed in the future, to decrease the risk of flooding in the Montreal Archipelago. The reservoir located at the downstream end of the watershed would be more vulnerable and its reliability may decrease in the future. Adaptation measures reduced the inter-annual variability of the reservoir level under future climate conditions. The reservoir management tool is an example of a no-regrets strategy, as it will contribute to improve the tools currently available to manage the reservoirs of the Lievre River watershed.","[Alvarez, Uriel Francisco Huaringa; Trudel, Melanie; Leconte, Robert] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Civil Engn, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada",University of Sherbrooke,"Alvarez, UFH (corresponding author), Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Civil Engn, 2500 Boul Univ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada.",U.Huaringa@usherbrooke.ca,,,Quebec's Climate change Action Plan,Quebec's Climate change Action Plan,This research was supported by funds from the 2006-2012 Quebec's Climate change Action Plan.

Riverine communities in the Brazilian Amazon are highly vulnerable to this change, as seasonal hydroclimatic cycles govern their daily lives, integrate their way of life with the environment, and determine the organization of social and agricultural calendars. This work aimed to understand the impacts caused by climate change on the lives of riverine family farmers on the lower Rio Negro. Initially, through the analysis of changes in hydroclimatic trends and, later, through the description of perception, we tried to present the impacts on the ways of life to then know the climate adaptation strategies. The research was carried out in the state of Amazonas, in the riverine communities Tiririca, Maraja, Santo Antonio, and Terra Preta, located in the Rio Negro Sustainable Development Reserve, with 43 subjects through semi-structured and focus group interviews. Historical trends in the seasonality of the hydrological regime, precipitation, and temperature were analyzed, while qualitative data from environmental perception were analyzed using the technique of content analysis. Physical records of local climate variability and environmental perception are, in most cases, compatible and indicate that hydroclimatic cycles are changing. For the riverine people, the rains have been decreasing and there is unanimity in the perception that the increase in temperature is a reality that has affected their way of life at work, education, health, and food. Although communities have been developing spontaneous adaptive strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change, effective public policies need to reinforce these local responses to climate variability, contributing to the quality of life of populations.","[de Vasconcelos, Monica Alves; Guimaraes, David Franklin da Silva] Fed Univ Amazonas UFAM, Grad Program Environm Sci & Sustainabil Amazon, BR-69067005 Manaus, Brazil; [Pereira, Henrique dos Santos] Fed Univ Amazonas UFAM, Ctr Environm Sci, BR-69080900 Manaus, Brazil; [Lopes, Myriam] Univ Aveiro, CESAM, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Lopes, Myriam] Univ Aveiro, Dept Environm & Planning, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade Federal de Amazonas; Universidade Federal de Amazonas; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro,"Pereira, HD (corresponding author), Fed Univ Amazonas UFAM, Ctr Environm Sci, BR-69080900 Manaus, Brazil.",hpereira@ufam.edu.br,"Lopes, Myriam/D-9887-2011","Lopes, Myriam/0000-0002-7624-1279; dos Santos Pereira, Henrique/0000-0002-9113-1166; Alves de Vasconcelos, Monica/0000-0003-0388-5791",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [88881.190486/2018-01];  [CESAM-UIDP/50017/2020];  [UIDB/50017/2020];  [LA/P/0094/2020],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); ; ; ,"The authors thank the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) scholarship ((PDSE-CAPES Process N. 88881.190486/2018-01) for the sandwich Ph.D. scholarship of M.A.V. at the Aveiro University, Portugal.

The present study attempts to understand these processes over India by separating the 'dynamic' and 'thermodynamic' components of precipitation extremes using a suite of observed and reanalysis datasets. The former is mainly due to changes in atmospheric motion, while the latter is driven mainly by the changes associated with atmospheric moisture content. Limited studies have attributed dynamic and thermodynamic contributions to precipitation extremes, and their primary focus has been on the horizontal atmospheric motion component of the water budget. Our study, on the other hand, implements the decomposition of vertical atmospheric motion, based on the framework proposed by Oueslati et al. (Sci Rep 9: 2859, 2019), which has often been overlooked, especially for India. With the focus on two major and recent extreme events in the Kerala and Uttarakhand regions of India, we show that the vertical atmospheric motion has a more significant contribution to the events than the horizontal atmospheric motion. Further, decomposition of the vertical atmospheric motion shows that the dynamic component overwhelms the thermodynamic component's contribution to these extreme events, which is found to be negligible. Using a threshold method to define extreme rainfall, we further extended our work to all India, and the results were consistent with those of the two considered events. Finally, we evaluate the contributions from the recently made available CMIP6 climate models, and the results are interestingly in alignment with the observations. The outcomes of this study will play a critical role in the proper prediction of rainfall extremes, whose value to climate adaptation can hardly be overemphasised.","[Sudharsan, Naveen; Karmakar, Subhankar] Indian Inst Technol, Environm Sci & Engn Dept, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Karmakar, Subhankar] Indian Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Program Climate Studies, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Karmakar, Subhankar] Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Urban Sci & Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Fowler, Hayley J.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Hari, Vittal] UFZ, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Hydrosyst, Leipzig, Germany",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Newcastle University - UK; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Hari, V (corresponding author), UFZ, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Hydrosyst, Leipzig, Germany.",vittal.hari@ufz.de,"Hari, Vittal/AAS-4759-2020","Hari, Vittal/0000-0001-8754-0488; Sudharsan, Naveen/0000-0002-1328-110X","Department of Science & Technology (SPLICE-Climate Change Programme), Government of India [DST/CCP/CoE/140/2018, 00000000000010013072, 18192442]; Fulbright-Kalam Fellowship [2338/FKPDR/2018]; Wolfson Foundation; Royal Society as a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award [WM140025]; European Research Council (INTENSE) [ERC-2013-CoG-617329]","Department of Science & Technology (SPLICE-Climate Change Programme), Government of India; Fulbright-Kalam Fellowship; Wolfson Foundation; Royal Society as a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award; European Research Council (INTENSE)","The work presented here is supported by Department of Science & Technology (SPLICE-Climate Change Programme), Government of India (Project reference number DST/CCP/CoE/140/2018, Grant Number: 00000000000010013072 (UC ID: 18192442)).

However, there are still many deficiencies in the design and technology of existing systems, especially in terms of the integration of architectural performance defects that cannot respond to occupants' comfort, flexibility, and energy-saving requirements throughout the building's life cycle. This research takes modular prefabricated steel structural systems as its research object and sets the detailed design of an integrated modular envelope system as the core content. First, the researcher chose two types of thermal insulation materials, high insulation panels and aerogel blankets, in order to study the construction details of integrated building envelopes for modular prefabricated buildings. Focusing on the weakest heat point, the thermal bridge at the modular connection point, this work used construction design and research to build an experimental building and full-scale model; the goal was to explore and verify the feasibility of the climate-responsive construction technique called reverse install. Second, as a response to climate change, building facades were dynamically adjusted by employing different modular building envelope units such as sunshades, preheaters, ventilation, air filtration, pest control, and other functional requirements in order to improve the building's climate adaptability. Finally, based on the above structural design and research, this study verified the actual measurements and simulation, as well as the sustainability performance of the structure during the operational phase, and provided feedback on the design. The results highlight the environmental performance of each construction detail and optimized possibilities for an integrated envelope design for modular prefabricated buildings during both the design and renovation phases.","[Li, Junjie; Wang, Wanlin; Huang, Jie; Chen, Xinxing; Wang, Jiayi] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Architecture & Design, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Lu, Shuai] Shenzhen Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University; Shenzhen University,"Lu, S (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China.",lyushuai@szu.edu.cn,,"Lu, Shuai/0000-0003-3772-1613","Fundamental Funds for China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017T100035]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51708019, 51678324]",Fundamental Funds for China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the Fundamental Funds for China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project (Project no. 2017T100035) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 51708019 and 51678324).,,36,8,8,8,56,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-8434,1687-8442,,ADV MATER SCI ENG,Adv.

The research centre was financed by the German Science Foundation (DFG) and included the study of landscape formation in north-western Namibia. One focus of our research was on the transitional area between the Namib Desert and the dry savannah in the Marienfluss Valley - Hartmann Valley region. When the research project was initiated, this region with a total area of approx. 5600 km(2) was 'terra incognita' from a geomorphological point of view. For this reason the entire recent Quaternary development of relief including current morphodynamics was studied. In the context of the issue of 'shifting desert margins', dune fields at the eastern margin of the Namib Desert in NW Namibia south of the Angolan border were studied during several years of field observation using geomorphological relief analysis in the field, aerial photographs and pictures taken when flying over the area. In the absence of meteorological stations, the genesis of the dunes has been inferred on the basis of calculated wind-flow patterns. In this way it was possible to show that the distribution of dunes in the study area is determined by a change in wind direction over the South Atlantic. The changes in dune forms since 1964 were identified by means of multi-temporal analysis of aerial photographs; reshaping by man through the beginnings of tourism in recent years could be observed directly. The transformation of dunes in heavy thunderstorms is also described.","[Hartmann, Kerstin; Brunotte, Ernst] Univ Cologne, Sect Appl Geomorphol & Landscape Studies, Dept Geog, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Hartmann, K (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Sect Appl Geomorphol & Landscape Studies, Dept Geog, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",,,,,,,,17,3,3,1,13,GEBRUDER BORNTRAEGER,STUTTGART,"JOHANNESSTR 3A, D-70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0372-8854,,,Z GEOMORPHOL,Z.

The focus then shifted from climatic adaptation to problems of nutrition, disease, and stress. However, many questions about human environmental patterns, especially in reference to their evolution, were abandoned rather than resolved. Assumptions about cold protective functions of low surface area/body mass ratio are entrenched in physical anthropology, despite lack of experimental validation. Since heat loss is controlled by vasoregulation and tissue insulation, a simple physics model of SA:mass may not apply. The issue merits investigation, as do the assumed thermal advantages of foreshortened extremities. Physiological assessment remains our primary research tool. In cold climate natives, elevated basal metabolic rates now appear to be genetically induced. During cold exposure, the body manages heat conservation through well known channels but also by specialized thermogenic functions such as metabolism in brown adipose tissue (BAT). The powerful protective capacity of BAT is largely unexplored either within or between populations of cold exposed human adults. An irony of our profession is that many biological variables seem to have minor effects when compared to behavioral cold protections. This is partly because biological anthropologists may have made incorrect assumptions about what most threatens the well being of cold climate people. Contrasts in environmental behaviors when comparing northern cultures such as Inuit, Athabaskan, and Norse are particularly instructive. Adaptations to life in the cold may ultimately reveal their secrets through biocultural research design modeling of environmental research. With both practical and theoretical gains still wide open, the field needs renewed attention from human biology.","SUNY Buffalo, Dept Anthropol, Buffalo, NY 14261 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Steegmann, AT (corresponding author), SUNY Buffalo, Dept Anthropol, 380 MFAC, Buffalo, NY 14261 USA.",atsjr@buffalo.edu,,,,,,,36,44,46,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1042-0533,1520-6300,,AM J HUM BIOL,Am.

Although it requires further refinement, this practical framework provides a useful baseline for generating awareness and understanding of the complexity and diversity of variables that impinge on resilience. It has potential value for the evaluation, benchmarking, monitoring, and reporting of marine system resilience. The necessity for such a framework is a consequence of the levels of complexity and uncertainty associated with climate change and other global change stressors in marine social-ecological systems, and the problems involved in assessing their resilience. There is a need for: (1) methodologies that bring together knowledge from diverse sources and disciplines to investigate the complexity and uncertainty of interactions between climate, ocean, and human systems and (2) frameworks to facilitate the evaluation and monitoring of the social-ecological resilience of marine-dependent sectors. Accordingly, our main objective is to demonstrate the virtues of combining a case study methodology with complex adaptive systems approaches as a means to improve understanding of the multifaceted dynamics of marine sectors experiencing climate change. The resilience indicator framework, the main product of the methodology, is developed using four case studies across key Australian marine biodiversity and resource sectors already experiencing impacts from climate and other global changes. It comprises a set of resilience dimensions with a candidate set of abstract and concrete resilience indicators. Its design ensures an integrated approach to resilience evaluation.","[Davidson, Julie L.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog & Environm Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Davidson, Julie L.; van Putten, Ingrid E.; Nursey-Bray, Melissa; Holbrook, Neil J.] Univ Tasmania, Australias Climate Change Adaptat Res Network Mar, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Davidson, Julie L.; Holbrook, Neil J.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [van Putten, Ingrid E.] Univ Tasmania, CSIRO Wealth Oceans Natl Res Flagship, CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Leith, Peat] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Nursey-Bray, Melissa] Univ Adelaide, Discipline Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Madin, Elizabeth M.] Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Madin, Elizabeth M.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania; University of Adelaide; University of Technology Sydney; Macquarie University,"Davidson, JL (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog & Environm Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",,"Leith, Peat/ABB-2829-2021; van putten, ingrid/AAV-1301-2021; Holbrook, Neil J/M-7544-2013; McLean, Laurence JA/C-7367-2014; Nursey-Bray, Melissa/J-8183-2019","van putten, ingrid/0000-0001-8397-9768; Holbrook, Neil J/0000-0002-3523-6254; Nursey-Bray, Melissa/0000-0002-4121-5177",Australia's Climate Change Adaptation Research Network for Marine Biodiversity and Resources; Office Of Internatl Science &Engineering; Office Of The Director [0853117] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Australia's Climate Change Adaptation Research Network for Marine Biodiversity and Resources; Office Of Internatl Science &Engineering; Office Of The Director(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)),"The authors wish to express their sincere gratitude for the constructive feedback of two reviewers, whose comments and input have contributed in a substantial way to the refinement and ultimate quality of the paper.

Proper management of the water resources in agriculture, and taking appropriate action or avoiding inappropriate activities in this area could significantly reduce anthropogenic stress and thus have a positive impact on the ecohydrology of the country. Questions arise about whether state regulations and the activities of government institutions support farms in the effective management of water resources, There are also questions about how farmers deal with the challenges of water management that result from climate change. In order to answer these questions, the following research tools were used: analysis of existing data, a review of the literature and legal acts, as well as a quantitative research method - a questionnaire. The study shows that despite the lack of - or negligible - support of government institutions, Polish farmers are trying to cope with the consequences of climate change on water management themselves; this is especially true for large and medium-sized agricultural enterprises. However, the farmers still have not realized that their individual decisions reduce the economic efficiency of their production but that they also negatively impact ecosystems, hydrology, and other economic entities whose activity depends on the quality of the water resource.

It is novel, being the first research in this area to be based on a conceptual econometric framework within which multiple stages are explicitly developed, and for which empirical evidence is gathered. We use this approach to examine the role of material, social status, and power inequality in influencing spontaneous adaptation choices in urban settings of China's Yangtze River delta. This framework differentiates two vital stages in adaptation decision making at the household level which allows us to examine, first, how social inequality shapes the severity of climate impact and, second, how social inequality interacts with this experience to influence responses to these impacts. We pilot this approach in selected metropolitan areas of Shanghai and Nanjing. Our results show that all dimensions of social inequality are significantly associated with experiences of climate change and adaptation choice. Application of our conceptual framework provides policymakers and planners with a new and useful tool that can be used to formulate better policy measures that either enable the disadvantaged to adapt in situ or provide these groups with real opportunities and capacities to migrate.","[Tan, Yan; Liu, Xuchun; Hugo, Graeme] Univ Adelaide, Discipline Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Tan, Y (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Discipline Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",yan.tan@adelaide.edu.au,,"Tan, Yan/0000-0002-4013-1713",Australian Research Council [DP110105522],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This study was supported by the Australian Research Council Discovery project (DP110105522).

Climate information plays a critical role in adaptation to these threats. Yet its accessibility and use may differ dramatically between groups of farmers, highlighting the need to understand the different paths of information exchange within communities. In this study, we examined weather and climate information sharing networks of both male and female farmers, and their perceived barriers to information access and use through a survey in three provinces in Papua New Guinea. The results provided insights about the most prominent actors as well as information sharing relationships, highlighting key gender differences. Women demonstrated stronger information connectivity with family and friends, capitalizing on close-knit networks. Conversely, the men's network showed the potential to bridge between external information sources like media, and community leaders, church groups, and friends and family. To ensure equitable communication and use of information for climate adaptation, it is important to strike a balance between the strong bonding and open exchange aspects of the network, and consider the central sources and perceived hurdles affecting access and use of this information.","[Friedman, Rachel S.] Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Sci, Inst Climate Energy & Disaster Solut, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Mackenzie, Ellis; Sloan, Tom; Sweaney, Nicole] Sustineo Pty Ltd, Deakin, Australia; [Sweaney, Nicole] Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Sci, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University; Australian National University,"Friedman, RS (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Sci, Inst Climate Energy & Disaster Solut, HC Coombs Bldg,9 Fellows Rd, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",rachel.friedman@anu.edu.au,"Friedman, Rachel S/L-8645-2016","Friedman, Rachel S/0000-0002-9437-9239",Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research [ASEM/2017/026],Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research,This work was supported by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ASEM/2017/026).,,61,2,2,4,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Knowing the relationship between inhabitable rooms with their specific climate is crucial for users' climate adaptation, especially in a global warming context. This research analyses the influence of EN 15251:2007, EN 16798-1:2019, and ASHRAE 55-2017 standards on an office building located in 65 cities. The effects of climate change have been considered in the energy performance of current, 2050, and 2100 scenarios. Also, 780 dynamic simulations were performed so that a cluster analysis was carried out to determine the similarity relationships among the various zones. The results show that the model of the EN 16798-1:2019 standard was the option achieving a greater energy saving in current and future scenarios, and the use of energy was greatly reduced in those zones characterized by having a greater cooling energy consumption. Moreover, the differences of energy consumption between the adaptive models in the cities and years generated that the clusters presented differences among all cities, so such scenarios are required to be considered for future interventions. This research is the transition towards the goals proposed by the European Union for 2050.","[Bienvenido-Huertas, David] Univ Seville, Dept Graph Express & Bldg Engn, E-41012 Seville, Spain; [Sanchez-Garcia, Daniel; Rubio-Bellido, Carlos] Univ Seville, Dept Bldg Construct 2, E-41012 Seville, Spain; [Oliveira, Miguel Jose] Univ Algarve, Inst Super Engn, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal",University of Sevilla; University of Sevilla; Universidade do Algarve,"Bienvenido-Huertas, D (corresponding author), Higher Tech Sch Bldg Engn, Ave Reina Mercedes 4A, Seville, Spain.",jbienvenido@us.es; sangardaniel@gmail.com; carlosrubio@us.es; mjolivei@ualg.pt,"Bienvenido-Huertas, David/I-2976-2018; Oliveira, Miguel José/T-2877-2017; Rubio-Bellido, Carlos/K-1861-2014; Sánchez-García, Daniel/T-2234-2017","Bienvenido-Huertas, David/0000-0003-0716-8589; Oliveira, Miguel José/0000-0002-3042-0802; Rubio-Bellido, Carlos/0000-0001-6719-8793; Sánchez-García, Daniel/0000-0002-3080-0821",,,,,45,13,13,0,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

There has been little work directed towards the large-scale possibilities of decentralised water systems and their implications on the functioning of the centralised (potable) water system. This study includes both a historical and future (scenario) analysis of decentralised developments. Integrated morphological socio-technical scenarios are combined with quantitative water flows for a case study (the Province of Limburg, the Netherlands) and examined by a transdisciplinary group of experts. The study shows how SUWM measures which focus on climate adaptation and circularity can have a significant impact on existing centralised potable water systems. In turn, influencing the total water and peak demands and thus resulting in different utilisation rates. This can result in more system failures (e.g., longer residence time, bacterial growth, reduced self-cleaning capacity), significant changes in the centralised infrastructure (e.g., more wells), increasing water bills (e.g., inequalities), and the preservation of aquifers for future generation. Different scenarios either have regime-reproducing or regime-diversifying impacts. SUWM measures are studied in isolation and thus externalities are not fully considered. Therefore, when planning for decentralised SUWM solutions, a systems thinking approach is recommended, which takes into account externalities.","[van Duuren, Diederik; de Bruin, Erwin] WML, Limburglaan 25, NL-6229 GA Maastricht, Netherlands; [van Duuren, Diederik] Maastricht Univ, Int Ctr Integrated Assessment & Sustainable Dev I, Kapoenstr 2, NL-6211 KR Maastricht, Netherlands; [van Alphen, Henk-Jan; Koop, Steven H.

During recent warm, dry summers several thermoelectric power plants in Europe and the southeastern United States were forced to reduce production owing to cooling-water scarcity(2-4). Here we show that thermoelectric power in Europe and the United States is vulnerable to climate change owing to the combined impacts of lower summer river flows and higher river water temperatures. Using a physically based hydrological and water temperature modelling framework in combination with an electricity production model, we show a summer average decrease in capacity of power plants of 6.3-19% in Europe and 4.4-16% in the United States depending on cooling system type and climate scenario for 2031-2060. In addition, probabilities of extreme (>90%) reductions in thermoelectric power production will on average increase by a factor of three. Considering the increase in future electricity demand, there is a strong need for improved climate adaptation strategies in the thermoelectric power sector to assure future energy security.","[van Vliet, Michelle T.

Current planting and harvesting cycles indicate the likelihood of close to 10 months of food insecurity and increased climatic variability has exacerbated food security issues by extending already existing periods of seasonal hunger. This degree of food vulnerability may help explain the population's poor nutritional outcomes and lack of dietary diversity. Declining agricultural production has resulted in increased migration as households try to cover expenses. Although temporary migration enables families to meet immediate consumption needs, it shrinks on-farm labor capacity, which may negatively impact future harvests and reduce the quantity and diversity of household food consumption. Greater crop diversity, water retention and irrigation systems, and climate-adapted crops have the potential to decrease the impact of seasonality and increased climate variability on food and livelihood security.

The port adaptation investment to climate change-related disaster might also be affected by such TOC intra- and inter-port coopetition. This paper examines analytically how the TOC market structure could affect ports' adaptation investment. More specifically, it considers two landlord-type ports within a region that compete with each other. The two ports are subject to uncertain disaster threats and have an asymmetric number of TOCs. The analytical and numerical results suggest that more TOCs at the own port and the competing port have opposite impacts on the port's adaptation investment. An inter-port TOC joint venture would decrease the adaptation at both ports. Moreover, the TOC market structure is found to moderate the effect of disaster uncertainty on port adaptation. That is, TOC intra- and inter-port coopetition can strengthen or weaken ports' sensitivity to disaster occurrence uncertainty. Finally, the regional welfare is found to increase monotonely with the two ports' total adaptation. It is suggested that the regulators encourage new TOC entries while restricting inter-port TOC joint ventures. The cases with heterogeneous disaster uncertainties at the two ports are also examined.","[Wang, Kun; Yang, Hangjun] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Anming] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of International Business & Economics; University of British Columbia,"Yang, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",hangjunyang@uibe.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Anming/0000-0002-9457-8414; Wang, Kun/0000-0002-2137-9457",Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [19YJC790136]; Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),"Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC))",We are very grateful to two anonymous referees and two guest editors (Amit Batabyal and Henk Folmer) whose comments have led to a significant improvement of the paper.

The intention is to provide information on where best to concentrate cultural heritage site preservation resources in the future.","[Carroll, Paul; Aarrevaara, Eeva] Lahti Univ Appl Sci, Fac Technol, Niemenkatu 73, Lahti 15100, Finland",Lahti University of Applied Sciences,"Carroll, P (corresponding author), Lahti Univ Appl Sci, Fac Technol, Niemenkatu 73, Lahti 15100, Finland.",paul.carroll@lamk.fi; eeva.aarrevaara@lamk.fi,,"Aarrevaara, Eeva/0000-0003-3515-6083; Carroll, Paul/0000-0003-4716-5913",,,,,22,19,19,0,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3263,,GEOSCIENCES,Geosciences,SEP,2018,8,9,,,,,,,322,10.3390/geosciences8090322,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences8090322,,,10,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geology,GY1ZG,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000448335800014,View Full Record in Web of Science

This calls for adaptation as a key climate change response. But adaptation is surrounded by problems. Finance is uncertain and fragmented, mainstreaming into development is complicated, and technical solutions often overshadow existing social relations and institutions. From a gender perspective, and as a critical research initiative to support the building of sustainability science as an umbrella field, this article raises three pertinent questions on adaptation in the global South: what is its purpose, how can development inform it, and what institutions in terms of rights and responsibilities are core to it? Focusing on sub-Saharan small-scale agriculture, three main points emerge. Regarding the purpose, adaptation should be a transformative pathway out of poverty, ill-health, and food insecurity. Regarding development, adaptation can learn from how development theory, policy, and practice have addressed women, gender, and environment in varied settings and debates. Regarding core institutions, adaptation must address gender regimes that regulate access to, use of, and control over resources, especially those defining land distribution, labour division, and strategic decision-making power. To conclude, I propose gender-informed research questions for further inquiry.","[Jerneck, Anne] Lund Univ, Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies, Box 170, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Jerneck, A (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies, Box 170, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",anne.jerneck@lucsus.lu.se,,"jerneck, anne/0000-0002-1429-8739","Rush for Land in Africa [2012/7689]; Swedish Research Council Formas through the Linnaeus grants LUCID, Lund University Centre of Excellence for integration of Social and Natural Dimensions of Sustainability [259-2008-1718]","Rush for Land in Africa; Swedish Research Council Formas through the Linnaeus grants LUCID, Lund University Centre of Excellence for integration of Social and Natural Dimensions of Sustainability","I am grateful to colleagues in the LUCID consortium who commented on an early draft of this article.

This study analyzes the capacity of small-scale irrigation systems dependent on the Asian monsoon to adapt to variability in river discharge caused by climate change. Our study is motivated by the Pumpa irrigation system, a small-scale irrigation system located in Nepal that is a model for this type of system. We developed an agent-based model in which we simulated the decisions farmers make about the irrigation strategy to use according to available water flow. Given the uncertainty associated with how climate change may affect the Asian monsoon, we simulated the performance of the system under different projections of climate change in the region (increase and decrease in rainfall, reduction and expansion of the monsoon season, and changes in the timing of the onset of the monsoon). Accordingly to our simulations, farmers might need to adapt to rainfall intensification and a late onset in the monsoon season. The demands for collective action among farmers (e.g. infrastructure repair, meetings, decisions, etc.) might increase considerably due to climate change. Although our model suggests that investment in new infrastructure might increase the performance of the system under some climate change scenarios, the high inequality among farmers when water availability is reduced might hinder the efficiency of these measures due to a reduction of farmers' willingness to cooperate. Our modeling exercise helps to hypothesize about the most sensitive climate change scenarios for smallscale irrigation farming in Nepal and helps to frame a discussion of some possible solutions and fundamental trade-offs in the process of adaptation to improve for food and water security under climate change.

These improved varieties contribute towards attainment of household and national food security. This paper aims to understand what influences households' decision to adopt, speed of uptake and extent of use of improved sorghum varieties (ISVs). Data from 452 households were analysed using Double Hurdle and Duration models. Study revealed that consumption expenditure levels, income and tropical livestock unit are important determinants of three household's adoption decisions. Access to agricultural credit, distance to administration centres and adoption intensity depicts unexpected a priori. The findings also show that households are credit constrained and use own or neighbour's home saved seeds to expand the use of ISVs. Study concludes that the three facets of ISVs' adoption are influenced by different combination of determinants. Due to the vastness and rough terrain in Tharaka Nithi County, agricultural credit lenders should come up with effective low cost, sustainable and scalable outreach strategies. Policies targeting to derisk sorghum value chain with an aim of incentivizing financial institutions increase their lending appetite to cash-constrained smallholder farmers and agro-dealers should be implemented.","[Mwangi, Backson; Macharia, Ibrahim; Bett, Eric] Kenyatta Univ, Dept Agr Econ, POB 43844, Nairobi, Kenya",Kenyatta University,"Mwangi, B (corresponding author), Kenyatta Univ, Dept Agr Econ, POB 43844, Nairobi, Kenya.",mbacksonmwangi@gmail.com,"Macharia, Ibrahim Ndegwa/AAD-9040-2022","Macharia, Ibrahim/0000-0002-0154-8890; Bett, Eric/0000-0001-8769-1622",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) through African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) through African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),The authors are grateful for the financial support received from German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) through African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) that made it possible to produce and publish this research work.,,43,3,3,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The environmental and economic impacts of the combined emerging treatment technologies are evaluated. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and economic assessment of the total cost considering both capital and operating cost are performed to evaluate the environmental and economic impacts, respectively. The environmental impact evaluation demonstrated that A(2)O + MBR and A(2)O + MFC processes are the most environmentally friendly processes in the construction and operation stages, respectively. Detailed analyses of the dominant environmental impact categories showed that the total volume for the construction stage, the effluent quality, and methane emission for the operation stage are important parameters. The results of economic impact showed that A(2)O and A(2)O + MFC processes have the lowest capital cost and operational cost, respectively. Furthermore, it can be inferred that A(2)O + MFC is the most economic process based on total economic impact, which included both the capital and the operational cost over 20 years.

For an agrarian and climate-sensitive developing country like India, CC is an additional burden, as rapid population growth, industrialisation and depletive exploitation of resources are already exerting pressure on eco-logical and socio-economic systems. It is in this context that this study was undertaken to gain insights into the CC sce-nario in Aravalli district of Gujarat state (India), its impacts on smallholder farmers, the adoption of climate smart agriculture (CSA) practices, current policy options and programs, as well as the challenges confronting sustainability of CSA practices. An electronic review of published peer-reviewed journal articles and reports from scientific databases (Scopus, Web of Science Core collection, Science Direct and Google scholar) indicated that CC has negatively impacted smallholder farmers in Aravalli district with a poised potential to exacerbate inequality, derail smallholder farmers' livelihoods, and thereby hampering sustainable economic growth.The major reported impacts have been witnessed as droughts, disparities in precipitation patters, heat waves and temperature extremes, floods, emergence of resistant agricultural pests and increased prevalence of crop diseases. In response, smallholder farmers have adopted certain water, land, livestock, and crop oriented CSA management practices to cope-up with the impacts of CC. Being a nascent district, most national, state and district policies and program interventions are at proposal and initial execution stages. The review highlights the need to undertake more empirical research to gain a deeper understanding of the emerging patterns ofCSA and their impacts on agricultural development and livelihoods of farmers in Aravalli district.","[Angom, Juliet] Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amrita Sch Sustainable Dev, Amritapuri, India; [Viswanathan, P.

CMIP5 simulations indicate a compound risk of extreme hot temperatures in western Europe from both warming and increasing temperature variance. CMIP6 simulations, however, indicate only a moderate increase in temperature variance that does not covary with warming. To explore this intergenerational discrepancy in CMIP results, we decompose changes in monthly temperature variance into those arising from changes in sensitivity to forcing and changes in forcing variance. Across models, sensitivity increases with local warming in both CMIP5 and CMIP6 at an average rate of 5.7 ([3.7, 7.9]; 95% c.i.) x 10(-3)degrees C per W m(-2) per degrees C warming. We use a simple model of moist surface energetics to explain increased sensitivity as a consequence of greater atmospheric demand (similar to 70%) and drier soil (similar to 40%) that is partially offset by the Planck feedback (similar to-10%). Conversely, forcing variance is stable in CMIP5 but decreases with warming in CMIP6 at an average rate of -21 ([-28, -15]; 95% c.i.) W-2 m(-4) per degrees C warming. We examine scaling relationships with mean cloud fraction and find that mean forcing variance decreases with decreasing cloud fraction at twice the rate in CMIP6 than CMIP5. The stability of CMIP6 temperature variance is, thus, a consequence of offsetting changes in sensitivity and forcing variance.

We asked how tree canopy cover and impervious surface cover interact to influence daytime and nighttime summer air temperature, and how effects vary with the spatial scale at which land-cover data are analyzed (10-, 30-, 60-, and 90-m radii). A bicycle-mounted measurement system was used to sample air temperature every 5 m along 10 transects (similar to 7 km length, sampled 3-12 times each) spanning a range of impervious and tree canopy cover (0-100%, each) in a midsized city in the Upper Midwest United States. Variability in daytime air temperature within the urban landscape averaged 3.5 degrees C (range, 1.1-5.7 degrees C). Temperature decreased nonlinearly with increasing canopy cover, with the greatest cooling when canopy cover exceeded 40%. The magnitude of daytime cooling also increased with spatial scale and was greatest at the size of a typical city block (60-90 m). Daytime air temperature increased linearly with increasing impervious cover, but the magnitude of warming was less than the cooling associated with increased canopy cover. Variation in nighttime air temperature averaged 2.1 degrees C (range, 1.2-3.0 degrees C), and temperature increased with impervious surface. Effects of canopy were limited at night; thus, reduction of impervious surfaces remains critical for reducing nighttime urban heat. Results suggest strategies for managing urban land-cover patterns to enhance resilience of cities to climate warming.","[Ziter, Carly D.; Turner, Monica G.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Integrat Biol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Pedersen, Eric J.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Biol, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada; [Kucharik, Christopher J.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agron, 1575 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kucharik, Christopher J.] Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Ziter, Carly D.] Concordia Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H4B2A7, Canada",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Memorial University Newfoundland; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Concordia University - Canada,"Ziter, CD; Turner, MG (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Integrat Biol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.;Ziter, CD (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H4B2A7, Canada.",carly.ziter@concordia.ca; turnermg@wisc.edu,"Turner, Monica G/B-2099-2010","Turner, Monica G/0000-0003-1903-2822; Ziter, Carly/0000-0002-3731-9678","US National Science Foundation [DEB-1440297, DEB-1038759]; University of Wisconsin-Madison Vilas Trust; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada doctoral fellowship; Garden Club of America Zone VI Fellowship in Urban Forestry",US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Wisconsin-Madison Vilas Trust; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada doctoral fellowship(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Garden Club of America Zone VI Fellowship in Urban Forestry,"We thank C.

This study includes prospects for development of the global energy system along with analysis of decarbonization strategies for the largest players in the oil and gas market, and defines conceptual directions to improve strategic planning systems of oil and gas companies in order to ensure sustainability in the context of a global energy transition. The theoretical background of this study is based on the fundamental concepts and methods of strategic planning, as well as modern approaches to strategic planning in the oil and gas industry. This study makes three contributions. First, we maintain that a broad, systematic understanding of the consequences of energy system transformation and defining its role in the new market should be the crucial task of players in the oil and gas industry, and we clarify the opportunities and threats of transitioning to decarbonization. Second, the study results contribute to the development of the design theory of strategic planning systems by improving well-known methods and approaches with reference to global energy transformation.

These plans layout how a community is vulnerable to existing and future changes in climate as well as what actions they propose taking to prepare. The actions included in these plans provide insight into what local governments feel they have the ability to undertake, as well as what actions they believe are important to building resilience. To date, little to no analysis has been conducted on the content of these plans, leaving researchers, practitioners, and those supporting communities with limited understanding of what gaps need to be filled or how best to support locally prioritized climate action. This paper analyzes the content of 43 stand alone climate adaptation plans from US local communities to identify the types of actions proposed and how those actions compare to what researchers indicate the communities should be prioritizing based on regional climate projections. The results indicate that local communities include numerous and varied actions in their adaptation plans and that the majority of communities are selecting actions that are theoretically appropriate given projected changes in regional climate. Yet some types of actions, such as building codes and advocacy, are not being widely used. These results contrast with previous studies, which found that local communities focus primarily on capacity building approaches. Findings also demonstrate that plans rarely contain significant details about how actions will be implemented, raising questions about whether plans will translate into real-world projects.","[Stults, Missy] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Woodruff, Sierra C.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Curriculum Environm & Ecol, Venable Hall,Campus Box 3275, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine,"Stults, M (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",Missy.stults@gmail.com; sscheleg@live.unc.edu,,,National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Partial financial support for this research was provided by the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship Program.,,75,32,32,0,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Especially groundwater dependent vegetation will be affected. These impacts within the landscape may negatively affect the connectivity within ecological networks. With an integrated surface- and groundwater model and a climate robust traits-based vegetation model, we simulated the implementation of water conservation measures in a stream valley catchment in the Netherlands. We assessed the impacts of conservation measures on groundwater levels, seepage flux, and vegetation composition for the current climate and two climate scenarios, with a global temperature increase of 2 A degrees C and an increase (+6 %) or decrease (-2 %) in annual precipitation. Our model showed that water conservation measures on average increased groundwater levels, although there were large spatial differences. At the same time, water conservation decreased the seepage flux in the stream valley, thereby decreasing the supply of nutrient-poor groundwater. These negative impacts on seepage flux will be amplified in a future climate. Semi-terrestrial vegetation along the streams will benefit from water conservation measures and increasingly so in a future climate. Other vegetation types showed a wide array of responses depending on spatially-differentiated changes in groundwater level and seepage fluxes. Our results highlight the importance of integrating spatially-explicit hydrology-vegetation interactions into models that evaluate climate adaptation measures. Customized water conservation measures can contribute to minimize negative effects of climate change on groundwater dependent vegetation and ensure the robustness of ecological networks.","[van der Knaap, Yasmijn A.

Despite the importance of UFZs, the stability of their annual temperature between winter and summer has seldom been investigated. With an understanding of the thermal impacts that planning decisions can have, it is essential to know how UFZs can be designed to regulate temperatures in the urban environment. 690 UFZs were identified using ALOS images in 2009 in Beijing. Land surface temperature (LST) was extracted from daytime Landsat TM (2002) and ASTER (2009) images. The regional LST variation of 31 district-sized sub-regions was correlated to the types of UFZs in the region and structural features of the region such as area, size, diversity, complexity and connectivity. Results showed that: (1) UFZ types, in order from highest to lowest LST variation, were commercial, campus, high density residential, water, recreational, low density residential, road, preservation, and agricultural zones; (2) the regional LST variation was positively correlated with the area of campus, commercial, high density residential, water, and road zones, but negatively correlated with the area of agricultural and low density residential zones; (3) increased connectivity and complexity decreased regional LST variations. The results indicated that the stability of annual temperatures was determined not only by the UFZ type and size but also by the connectivity and complexity. These results are clearly useful and essential pieces of information that can be applied in urban planning to improve climate adaptability. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Either climate change or reservoir operations are among the main drivers of changes in the flow regime of rivers globally. Using modeled unregulated and simulated regulated streamflow under historical and future climate scenarios, this study evaluated potential changes to the flow regime due to climate change and reservoir operations for the major tributaries of the San Joaquin River Basin, California United States. We selected a set of Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) to evaluate historical and projected future trends of streamflow dynamics: rise and fall rates, durations and counts of low and high pulses, and the magnitude of extremes. Results show that most indicators have pronounced departures from baseline conditions under anticipated future climate conditions given existing reservoir operations. For example, the high pulse count decreases during regulated flow conditions compared to increased frequency under unregulated flow conditions. Finally, we observed a higher degree of flow regime alteration due to reservoir operations than climate change. The degree of alteration ranges from 1.0 to 9.0% across the basin among all future climate scenarios, while reservoir operations alter the flow regime with a degree of alteration from 8.0 to 25%.

In this study, we examined sociodemographic differences in access to green spaces of different sizes for 14,385 census block groups in 12 U.S. cities using a 'just sustainabilities' framework. We classified green spaces into street-level greenery (XS), neighborhood parks (S-L; walking and cycling access), and large parks (XL; walking, cycling, and driving access). We ran spatial filtering models at the census block group level using different thresholds based on transportation modes. We uncovered a complex picture of inequality, with consistent injustices for XS green space, and fewer injustices for S-L and XL green space based on socioeconomic status and age, and some instances of just distributions for S-L and XL green space based on race/ethnicity. Our findings present a concerning picture for 'just sustainabilities': the green space type that is most often part of sustainability and climate adaptation strategies-street greenery-is unjustly distributed, likely as a result of structural racism in U.S. institutions.

A literature review permitted the systematization of thermal renovation adaptive strategies (TRAS) in which ARTs can be useful. The facade reversible changes (outputs) required for each strategy were identified, as well as the possible adaptation mechanisms to obtain them. The technologies responding within the recognized adaptation mechanisms were described and compared, their readiness level identified and their role within the TRAS was assigned. An approach to assess the suitability of each ART regarding TRAS for existing facades was conceived. It uses the criteria of aesthetic change, additional space and demolition needs, localization and area of intervention. The role of each ART within each TRAS, here systematized, will support the definition of the ART's operational range for each application and climate, and will promote the research and development of these technologies for thermal renovation of buildings' facades.

However, African cities are diverse and different across re-gions, scales, and contexts, despite some resemblance of urban problems. This paper addresses the generalisation of climate change issues and urban planning responses in African cities by: (i) exploring how climate impact, specifically flooding is different in one African city in terms of shaping the urban space; and (ii) examining the usefulness of city-focused and driven urban planning responses in addressing these risks. Using Accra, Ghana's capital, as a case study and mixed methods approach, findings indicate that despite the commonality of flood events across African cities, Accra's case is caused by a complex web of locally induced factors such as limited understanding of the geography and hydrology of the city by urban planning authorities, poor practice of informality, and changing weather patterns. Yet, the limited understanding of local driving causes of flooding in Accra has contributed to the use of unworkable top-down general responses (e.g., evictions and demolitions). The case of Accra demonstrates that increased preparedness (involving individuals, households, and institutions) is required to enhance adaptation to flood events rather than the current top-down response approach. In this case, we argue that a general approach to urban planning to address flood events across African cities may not work in all situations. Areas requiring further research are proffered, notably ways for capturing, integrating, and disseminating local knowledge in internationally funded flood planning and management initiatives.","[Gaisie, Eric] La Trobe Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Melbourne, Australia; [Gaisie, Eric; Cobbinah, Patrick Brandful] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",La Trobe University; University of Melbourne,"Gaisie, E (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Melbourne, Australia.",e.gaisie@latrobe.edu.au; patrick.cobbinah@unimelb.edu.au,,"Gaisie, Eric/0000-0002-0816-4048",,,,,70,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Findings COVID-19 and climate destruction signal urgent global challenges. Library best practices are positioned to respond to climate change. Literature indicates how libraries preserve, share and cross-link cultural and scientific knowledge. With wildfires, drought, flooding and other extreme or slow-onset weather events presenting dangers, it is imperative that libraries take joint action toward facilitating sustainable and open access to relevant information. Practical implications An initiative could create an easily-accessible, open, linked, curated, secure and stakeholder-respectful database for global biocultural heritage-documenting traditional knowledge, local knowledge and climate adaptation traditions. Social implications Ongoing stakeholder involvement from the outset should acknowledge preferences regarding whether or how much to share information. Ethical elements must be embedded from concept to granular access and metadata elements. Originality/value Rooted in the best practices and service orientation of library science, the proposal envisions a sustained response to a common global challenge. Stewardship would also broadly assist the global community by preserving and providing streamlined access to information of instrumental value to addressing climate change.","[Lerski, Martha B.] Lehman Coll, Leonard Lief Lib, Bronx, NY 10468 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Lehman College (CUNY),"Lerski, MB (corresponding author), Lehman Coll, Leonard Lief Lib, Bronx, NY 10468 USA.",martha.lerski@lehman.cuny.edu,,"Lerski, Martha/0000-0002-7436-3969",,,,,92,0,0,3,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0418,1758-7379,,J DOC,J.

Environmental heterogeneity can affect natural populations and lead to covariation between environment and allele frequencies. Drosophila melanogaster is known to harbor polymorphisms that change both with latitude and seasons. Identifying the role of selection in driving these changes is not trivial, because nonadaptive processes can cause similar patterns. Given the environment changes in similar ways across seasons and along the latitudinal gradient, one promising approach may be to look for parallelism between clinal and seasonal changes. Here, we test whether there is a genome-wide correlation between clinal and seasonal changes, and whether the pattern is consistent with selection. Allele frequency estimates were obtained from pooled samples from seven different locations along the east coast of the United States, and across seasons within Pennsylvania. We show that there is a genome-wide correlation between clinal and seasonal variations, which cannot be explained by linked selection alone. This pattern is stronger in genomic regions with higher functional content, consistent with natural selection. We derive a way to biologically interpret these correlations and show that around 3.7% of the common, autosomal variants could be under parallel seasonal and spatial selection. Our results highlight the contribution of natural selection in driving fluctuations in allele frequencies in natural fly populations and point to a shared genomic basis to climate adaptation that happens over space and time in D. melanogaster.","[Rodrigues, Murillo F.; Vibranovski, Maria D.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biosci, Dept Genet & Evolutionary Biol, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Rodrigues, Murillo F.] Univ Oregon, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Cogni, Rodrigo] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biosci, Dept Ecol, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; University of Oregon; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Rodrigues, MF (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biosci, Dept Genet & Evolutionary Biol, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, Brazil.;Rodrigues, MF (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",murillo.rodrigues@alumni.usp.br,"Rodrigues, Murillo F/AAS-5096-2021; Cogni, Rodrigo/C-3962-2016","Rodrigues, Murillo F/0000-0001-7508-1384; Cogni, Rodrigo/0000-0001-9907-9297; Vibranovski, Maria/0000-0001-8313-9726","Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) [13/25991-0, 17/02206-6, 15/20844-4, 16/01354-9, 17/06374-0]; CNPq [307015/2015-7, 307447/2018-9]; Royal Society",Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Royal Society(Royal Society of London),"We would like to thank all the members of the Cogni Lab for input and support throughout the development of this work.

Scholarly debates about the representation of climate change in the mass media have largely concentrated on journalistic norms, expertise and ideology, on the role of imagery or on narrow aspects of language use. This study takes a different approach by focusing on how the story of climate change is told in the UK through mainstream newspaper editorials. Four climate change stories that have shaped the UK's national conversation on climate change are identified as Lukewarmer, Ecoactivist, Smart Growth Reformer and Ecomodernist. The narrative representation of climate change of these four stories as captured in the editorials of five UK national newspapers in 2001, 2007 and 2015 is then analysed using a multi-faceted ecolinguistic framework. Our analysis shows that the partisan divide on climate change between politically 'left' and 'right' broadsheets is much less in 2015 when compared with 2001. It identifies the salience of the Ecomodemist story across a broad political spectrum of print media in 2015. The Ecomodernist story emphasises technology and energy innovation responses to climate change, whilst also recognising that adaptation to extreme weather events is necessary. These two story-elements are present across different climate change stories, thus highlighting investment in climate adaptation and in energy R&D as responses to climate change that are less exposed to ideological contention.","[Norton, Cherry] 1 Antrim Rd, London NW3 4XS, England; [Hulme, Mike] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England",University of Cambridge,"Norton, C (corresponding author), 1 Antrim Rd, London NW3 4XS, England.",cherry.norton@mac.com; mh903@cam.ac.uk,"Hulme, Mike/F-9012-2010","Hulme, Mike/0000-0002-1273-7662",,,,,224,4,4,8,58,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0016-7185,1872-9398,,GEOFORUM,Geoforum,AUG,2019,104,,,,,,114,136,,10.1016/j.geoforum.2019.01.017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2019.01.017,,,23,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,IN5GO,,Green Submitted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000478704100012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Carefully planned conservation management is thought necessary to support biodiversity adaptation to CC, but could also contribute to CC mitigation. This paper presents a methodology for assessing direct emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG: CO2, CH4 and N2O) from 12 UK priority habitats in 26 Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) using readily available data. Background emissions are estimated on the basis of published field research. The contribution of conservation management to GHG emission reduction is estimated using the IPCC GHG accounting methodology and other methods. Management Data Acquisition surveys carried out at selected SACs provided data on management practises for Scotland and Wales. Climate change mitigation actions identified in this study for priority habitats included livestock removal or change in stocking density, with GHG reduction potential of up to 3 tCO(2)e/animallyear, afforestation of acid grasslands-up to 19.4 tCO(2)e/ha/year, wetland restoration-0.3-0.8 tCO(2)e/ha/year and cessation of moorland burning-6.9 tCO(2)e/ha/year. Estimated GHG emissions from priority habitats can be used to identify win:win management options that co-deliver GHG mitigation, climate adaptation and conservation benefits for consideration by policy makers and conservation managers.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the agronomic performance of three cultivars subjected to different production pruning times in Botucatu/SP, where 2-year old peach trees were evaluated, grown at a spacing of 6.0 x 4.0 meters. The experimental design was a split plot design with four blocks, using the cultivars Douradao, BRS Kampai and BRS Rubimel, and the subplots corresponded to pruning times in May, June, July and August. Ten plants were used per plot, with the four central plants considered useful and the remaining considered as margins. Pruning in June and July showed the best results in terms of percentage of fruit set and production. The cultivar BRS Rubimel showed the best percentage of fruit set when pruned in June (44.96%), and best fruit production when pruned in July (18.7 kg plant(-1)). Pruning in May anticipated the harvest of cultivar BRS Rubimel by 13 days whereas pruning carried out in July and August provided late harvests for cultivars Douradao and BRS Kampai.","[Ferraz, Rafael Augusto] Univ Estadual Paulista, UNESP, Fac Ciencias Agron, Curso Doutorado Hort, Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [Leonel, Sarita; Segantini, Daniela Mota; Tecchio, Marco Antonio] UNESP, Fac Ciencias Agron, Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [Correa Antunes, Luis Eduardo] EMBRAPA Clima Temp, Pelotas, RS, Brazil",Universidade Estadual Paulista; Universidade Estadual Paulista; Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA),"Ferraz, RA (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, UNESP, Fac Ciencias Agron, Curso Doutorado Hort, Botucatu, SP, Brazil.",rafaelferraz86@hotmail.com; sarinel@fca.unesp.br; dani_segantini@hotmail.com; tecchio@fca.unesp.br; luis.antunes@embrapa.br,"Antunes, Luis Eduardo Corrêa/C-5426-2013","Antunes, Luis Eduardo Corrêa/0000-0002-0341-1476; Tecchio, Marco Antonio/0000-0001-7868-2265",,,,,17,2,2,1,4,UNIV ESTADUAL LONDRINA,LONDRINA,"CAXIA POSTAL 6001, LONDRINA, PARANA 86501-990, BRAZIL",1676-546X,1679-0359,,SEMIN-CIENC AGRAR,Semin.-Cienc.

Urban green space has crucial biophysical buffering capacities, but also affects social interactions and human well-being. This paper considers the social dimension of urban green space, through an assessment focused on park use, function, and meanings, and compares results to categories of cultural ecosystem services. We develop a mixed-method approach for assessment of uses and social meanings of parkland and pilot this method in 2140 acres of parkland in waterfront neighborhoods surrounding New York City's Jamaica Bay, an area heavily affected by Hurricane Sandy. This method combines observation of human activities and signs of prior human use with structured interviews of park users. We find that urban parkland is a crucial form of 'nearby nature' that provides space for recreation, activities, socialization, and environmental engagement and supports place attachment and social ties. We show that parks, through their use by and interactions with humans, are producing vital cultural ecosystem services that may help to strengthen social resilience. Certain services were more easily detectable than others via our assessment technique, including recreation, social relations, and sense of place. The assessment method was designed to be spatially explicit, scalable, and replicable; natural resource managers engaged in park management and/or resilience planning could apply this method across individual sites, in particular districts-such as vulnerable waterfront areas, and citywide. This study demonstrates a way in which cultural ecosystem services and an understanding of social meaning could be incorporated into park management and, resilience planning.

Quantifying and assessing the risk potentially induced by climate change has great significance for cities to undertake positive climate adaptation and risk prevention. However, most of the previous studies focus on global, national or regional dimensions, only a few have attempted to examine climate change risk at an urban scale and even less in the case of a recent literature review. As a result, a quantitative assessment of climate change risk for cities remains highly challenging. To fill this gap, the article makes a critical review of the recent literature on urban-scale climate change risk assessment, and classifies them into four major categories of studies which jointly constitute a stepwise modelling chain from global climate change towards urban-scale risk assessment. On this basis, the study summarizes the updated research progresses and discusses the major challenges to be overcome for the seamless coupling of climate simulation between different scales, the reproduction of compound climate events, the incorporation of non-market and long-lasting impacts and the representation of risk transmission insides or beyond a city. Furthermore, future directions to advance quantitative assessment of urban-scale climate change risk are highlighted, with fresh insights into improving study methodology, enriching knowledge of climate change impact on city, enhancing abundance and accessibility to data, and exploring the best practice to provide city-specific climate risk service.","[Ye, Bin; Liu, Junguo; Zheng, Yi] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Jingjing] Harbin Inst Technol Shenzhen, Sch Econ & Management, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Nan] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Anal & Environm Impacts Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Southern University of Science & Technology; Harbin Institute of Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Jiang, JJ (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol Shenzhen, Sch Econ & Management, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",jiangjingjing@hit.edu.cn,"Liu, Junguo/B-3021-2012","Liu, Junguo/0000-0002-5745-6311","National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFE0206200]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71803074]; Science and Technology Planning Project of Shenzhen City [JCYJ20190806144415100, JCYJ20190809162809440]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Planning Project of Shenzhen City,"This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFE0206200), National Natural Science Foundation of China (71803074), and Science and Technology Planning Project of Shenzhen City (JCYJ20190806144415100 and JCYJ20190809162809440).

As multiple UN policy frameworks stress, DRR is crucial to mitigate the mounting environmental and socioeconomic costs of disasters globally. However, specialized DRR guidelines are needed for biodiverse, multi-hazard regions like mountains. Ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) emphasizes ecosystem conservation, restoration, and sustainable management as key elements for DRR. We propose that integrating the emerging field of Eco-DRR with community-based DRR (CB-DRR) will help address the increasing vulnerabilities of mountain people and ecosystems. Drawing on a global mountain synthesis, we present paradoxes that create challenges for DRR in mountains and examine these paradoxes through examples from the 2015 Nepal earthquakes. We propose four principles for integrated CB- and Eco-DRR that address these challenges: (1) governance and institutional arrangements that fit local needs; (2) empowerment and capacity-building to strengthen community resilience; (3) discovery and sharing of constructive practices that combine local and scientific knowledge; and (4) approaches focused on well-being and equity. We illustrate the reinforcing relationship between integrated CB- and Eco-DRR principles with examples from other mountain systems worldwide. Coordinated community and ecosystem-based actions offer a potential path to achieve DRR, climate adaptation, sustainable development, and biodiversity conservation for vulnerable ecosystems and communities worldwide.","[Klein, Julia A.; Steger, Cara E.; Reid, Robin; Boone, Randall B.; Thorn, Jessica] Colorado State Univ, Campus Delivery 1476, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Tucker, Catherine M.] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Nolin, Anne] Univ Nevada, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Hopping, Kelly A.] Boise State Univ, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Yeh, Emily T.; Bourgeron, Patrick] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Pradhan, Meeta S.] Mt Inst, Himalayan Program, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Taber, Andrew] UN Food & Agr Org, Rome, Italy; [Molden, David; Ghate, Rucha; Choudhury, Dhrupad] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Alcantara-Ayala, Irasema] Natl Autonomous Univ Mexico UNAM, Inst Geog, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Lavorel, Sandra] CNRS, Grenoble, France; [Mueller, Birgit] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Gret-Regamey, Adrienne; Seidl, Roman] ETH, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Castellanos, Edwin] Univ Valle Guatemala, Guatemala City, Guatemala; [Chen, Xiaodong] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Dong, Shikui] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Keiler, Margreth] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Yager, Karina] SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",Colorado State University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; Idaho; Boise State University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Universidad del Valle de Guatemala; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Beijing Normal University; University of Bern; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Klein, JA (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Campus Delivery 1476, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",Julia.klein@colostate.edu; tuckerc@ufl.edu; cara.steger@colostate.edu; anolin@unr.edu; Robin.Reid@mountain.org; kellyhopping@boisestate.edu; emily.yeh@Colorado.EDU; mpradhan@mountain.org; Andrew.taber@fao.org; David.Molden@icimod.org; Rucha.Ghate@icimod.org; Dhrupad.Choudhury@icimod.org; Irasema@igg.unam.mx; sandra.lavorel@ujf-grenoble.fr; birgit.mueller@ufz.de; gret@ethz.ch; Randall.Boone@Colostate.edu; Patrick.Bourgeron@colorado.edu; ecastell@uvg.edu.gr; chenxd@email.unc.edu; dongshikui@sina.com; margreth.keiler@giub.unibe.ch; R.Seidl@oeko.de; karina.yager@stonybrook.edu,"Alcantara, Irasema/GPW-8040-2022; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; chen, xia/GXM-5435-2022; Keiler, Margreth/F-4258-2012; chen, xi/GXH-3653-2022; Boone, Randall B/N-6566-2013; Grêt-Regamey, Adrienne/HPE-6858-2023; Dong, Shikui/GQA-6626-2022; Grêt-Regamey, Adrienne/AAZ-7546-2021; chen, xia/GYR-3948-2022; Alcántara-Ayala, Irasema/G-8639-2017; Tucker, Catherine May/G-5333-2012; YEH, EMILY/O-7909-2014","Keiler, Margreth/0000-0001-9168-023X; Boone, Randall B/0000-0003-3362-2976; Grêt-Regamey, Adrienne/0000-0001-8156-9503; Grêt-Regamey, Adrienne/0000-0001-8156-9503; Alcántara-Ayala, Irasema/0000-0003-0794-1201; Molden, David/0000-0003-3201-9518; Muller, Birgit/0000-0001-8780-4420; Klein, Julia/0000-0003-1486-7994; Castellanos, Edwin/0000-0001-9775-0518; Yager, Karina/0000-0003-4938-5012; Seidl, Roman/0000-0002-6658-8789; Hopping, Kelly/0000-0002-0557-0526; Tucker, Catherine May/0000-0003-3151-5376; Thorn, Jessica/0000-0003-2108-2554; YEH, EMILY/0000-0002-4401-2404",NSF [DEB-1414106]; Mountain Research Initiative,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Mountain Research Initiative,We thank the mountain experts from the Mountain Sentinels Collaborative Network who contributed survey data.

Based on the unique physical, institutional, and economic characteristics of water, this work's first contribution is to characterize a road forward for research innovations that enable better integration of water science, water economics, and water policy. Meeting water's sustainable development and justice goals calls for several research innovations that humanity awaits. The advances called for in this work include deep uncertainty management, red team reviews, innovative water rights design, accelerating SDG achievement, valuing water infrastructure, valuing natural water retention, incentivizing water conservation, improving financial perfor-mance of rural water systems, water network modularization, non-price scarcity signals, optimization model calibration, remote sensing, transboundary benefit sharing, optimal growth, and water valuation. The work's second contribution is to present a prototype scalable basin scale hydroeconomic analysis (HEA) as a framework for integrating these above innovations when they occur. Results of the HEA show that losses from a 50% shortage in the basin's surface water supply can continue to protect 93% of total economic benefits across economic sectors if an efficient water trading system is established to move water from lower to higher valued uses when shortages occur. The work concludes by noting that great advances remain needed for better and longer lives.","[Ward, Frank A.] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agr Business, Water Sci & Management Program, Las Cruces, NM 88011 USA",New Mexico State University,"Ward, FA (corresponding author), New Mexico State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agr Business, Water Sci & Management Program, Las Cruces, NM 88011 USA.",fward@nmsu.edu,,,,,,,125,0,0,25,25,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

However, while farmers' perception is increasingly understood as being a key determinant, a conceptual framework that includes this focus of analyses is currently not available. Against this background, this study analyzes the agricultural adaptation context in two Tanzanian villages building on a newly developed agricultural adaptation and perception model (AAP). The AAP contains five dimensions as a frame of reference for empirical adaptation models: non-climatic determinants of vulnerability (1), general trends in livelihood strategies (2), perception of climatic trends (3), climate impacts in agriculture (4) and potentials and obstacles for adaptation (5). Empirical data were collected by applying various tools of rapid rural appraisal, a stakeholder workshop and supplementary interviews. The qualitative data were coded along the dimensions of the AAP and analyzed by means of qualitative content analysis. The results show that adaptation levels, sensitivities of the farming systems as well as perception and narratives about climatic and yield dynamics differ considerably among the two farming communities. Furthermore, farmers' adaptation responses are influenced by both their framing of climatic trends as well as the multiple benefits that the local agricultural systems provide. Thus, for improving food security in the face of climate change, farmers' perceptions and the multi-functionality of agricultural systems need to be explicitly recognized by agronomic adaptation research, and adaptation policy making should involve detailed vulnerability assessments.","[Below, Till B.] Deutsch Gesell Int Zusammenarbeit GIZ GmbH, Competence Ctr Climate Change, Dag Hammarskjold Weg 1-5, D-65760 Eschborn, Germany; [Schmid, Julia C.; Sieber, Stefan] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF eV, Inst Socioecon, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany",Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF),"Below, TB (corresponding author), Deutsch Gesell Int Zusammenarbeit GIZ GmbH, Competence Ctr Climate Change, Dag Hammarskjold Weg 1-5, D-65760 Eschborn, Germany.",Till.Below@notmail.org; julia.schmid@zalf.de; stefan.sieber@zalf.de,,"Schmid, Julia Christiane/0000-0003-4990-8717; Sieber, Stefan/0000-0002-4849-7277",,,,,64,65,67,0,76,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

In this study, a year-long thermal comfort field survey was conducted in rural folk houses in 11 rural areas in the Guangdong Province, the hot-humid area of southern China. The subjective responses of residents were recorded via questionnaires, and all ambient environment parameters were measured. The results show that air speed was greater and relative humidity was lower in the semi-open spaces. The clothing insulation of the survey respondents varied with indoor operative temperatures from 0.27 do to 1.2 clo during the non-summer season and remained steady at 0.30 clo during the summer season. The thermal neutral, acceptable and preferred indoor operative temperatures were determined for the interior and semi-open spaces in the summer and non-summer. Compared to those of the interior spaces, the thermal neutral temperature was 0.6-1.3 degrees C lower and the upper limit of 80% acceptable temperature was decreased by 0.8-4.7 degrees C in the semi-open spaces. The acceptable temperature in the summer for the rural residents was found to be 0.2-1 degrees C higher than that of the urban residents in the same climate. Psychological factors such as local culture, expectations and perceived control might be the reasons for these differences.

Decrease in productivity of certain crops as a consequence of changing climate has already been observed. In West Africa, a region extremely vulnerable to climate change, various studies predicted significant reduction in productivity of the major crops because of future warming and shift in precipitation patterns. However, most studies either follow statistical approaches or involve only specific sites. Here, using a process-based crop model at a regional scale, we project the future changes in cereal crop yields as a result of climate change for West African countries in the absence of agricultural intensification for climate adaptation. Without adaptation, the long-term mean of crop yield is projected to decrease in most of the countries (despite some projected increase of precipitation) by the middle of the century, while the inter-annual variability of yield increases significantly. This increase of yield variability is attributed to an increase of inter-annual variability of growing season temperature and/or precipitation in future climate scenarios. The lower mean yield and larger year-to-year variation together make the regional food security extremely volatile. For a comprehensive understanding of climate change impact on crop yield, the distribution of temperature and precipitation over specific growth stages, in addition to growing season averages, should be accounted for. Although uncertainties are rife in calibrating and running a process-based crop model at regional scale, the present study offers insight into potential vulnerabilities of the agricultural system in specific countries or West Africa as a whole because of regional climate change.","[Ahmed, Kazi Farzan; Wang, Guiling; Yu, Miao] Univ Connecticut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Ahmed, Kazi Farzan; Wang, Guiling; Yu, Miao] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Storrs, CT USA; [Koo, Jawoo; You, Liangzhi] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Ahmed, KF (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",kfa09002@engr.uconn.edu,"Koo, Jawoo/HNR-9802-2023; Koo, Jawoo/F-9397-2010","Koo, Jawoo/0000-0003-3424-9229","National Science Foundation [AGS-1049017, AGS-1048967]; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences [1049017] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"Funding support for this study was provided by National Science Foundation (AGS-1049017, AGS-1048967).

Understanding how neighborhoods affect heat mortality fills an important gap between studies of individual susceptibility to heat and broadly comparative studies of temperature-mortality relationships in cities. OBJECTIVES: We estimated neighborhood effects of population characteristics and built and natural environments on deaths due to heat exposure in Maricopa County, Arizona (2000-2008). METHODS: We used 2000 U.S. Census data and remotely sensed vegetation and land surface temperature to construct indicators of neighborhood vulnerability and a geographic information system to map vulnerability and residential addresses of persons who died from heat exposure in 2,081 census block groups. Binary logistic regression and spatial analysis were used to associate deaths with neighborhoods. RESULTS: Neighborhood scores on three factors-socioeconomic vulnerability, elderly/isolation, and unvegetated area-varied widely throughout the study area. The preferred model (based on fit and parsimony) for predicting the odds of one or more deaths from heat exposure within a census block group included the first two factors and surface temperature in residential neighborhoods, holding population size constant. Spatial analysis identified clusters of neighborhoods with the highest heat vulnerability scores. A large proportion of deaths occurred among people, including homeless persons, who lived in the inner cores of the largest cities and along an industrial corridor. CONCLUSIONS: Place-based indicators of vulnerability complement analyses of person-level heat risk factors.

As the severe scarcity of water resources because of climate change, water conservation through efficient irrigation has turned into a vital strategy for tea sector in solving this rising challenge. This paper analyzes irrigation water use efficiency of small-scale tea farms in Vietnam and identifies its determinants applying stochastic frontier analysis. Results showed that under decreasing returns to scale, the mean irrigation water use efficiency was 42.19 %, indicating the existence of substantial water waste. If farmers become more efficient in using water, saving 57.81 % of irrigation water is possible unaccompanied by reducing the observed output. The factors affecting tea farms' irrigation water use efficiency were investigated by Tobit model. Gender, water shortage awareness, soil and water conservation practice, off-farm income share, extension services access and well water utilization showed significant influence on the efficiency of irrigation water. The study' results provide insights to policymakers in implementing better water resource management amid climate change.","[Nguyen Bich Hong; Yabe, Mitsuyasu] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Environm Econ Lab,Higashi Ku, 6-10-1 Hakozaki, Fukuoka, Japan; [Nguyen Bich Hong] Thai Nguyen Univ Econ & Business & Adm, Thai Nguyen, Vietnam",Kyushu University; Thai Nguyen University,"Hong, NB (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Environm Econ Lab,Higashi Ku, 6-10-1 Hakozaki, Fukuoka, Japan.;Hong, NB (corresponding author), Thai Nguyen Univ Econ & Business & Adm, Thai Nguyen, Vietnam.",nguyen.bich.hong85@gmail.com,"Hong, Nguyen/AAK-1056-2020",,"Monbukagakusho scholarship [26310311]; Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology; Setsutaro Kobayashi Memorial Fund; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26310311] Funding Source: KAKEN","Monbukagakusho scholarship(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Setsutaro Kobayashi Memorial Fund; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was funded in 2014 by the Monbukagakusho scholarship (Study Number 26310311), the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology and the Setsutaro Kobayashi Memorial Fund.

The risk factors are very high and the impacts will raise the developmental impediments of safeguarding livelihood security and poverty eradication in Sub-Saharan Africa. Adaptation to climate and ecological variation, though recognized as pressing and necessary, operates in the context of numerous uncertainties and unknowns. Previous studies on climate adaptation tried to identify universal patterns of coping rather than differentiating between agro ecological zones, villages and types of households. This paper uses case studies from two rural communities in the Savanna agro ecological zone of Ghana to explore smallholder farmers' responses to climate and ecological variation effects on their livelihood activities that have emerged since the mid-1980s. Results suggest that smallholder farmers use various coping, on-farm and off-farm adaptation strategies to ameliorate the negative impacts of climate and ecological changes on their livelihood. Coping measures such as selling household assets, migration of the entire households and decreasing food consumption/changing diets can be damaging. On -farm adaptation strategies such as varying planting dates, use of drought tolerant crop varieties, soil conservation strategies are based on farmers indigenous knowledge passed down from generations. To ensure sustainability of local adaptation strategies, there is the need for exchange of knowledge between and among smallholder farmers and formal institutions through the recognition and empowerment of local residents and collective actions.","[Aniah, Philip; Kaunza-Nu-Dem, Millar Katherine] Univ Dev Studies, POB 1350, Tamale, Ghana; [Ayembilla, Joseph A.] Millar Inst Transdisciplinary & Dev Studies, Bolgatanga, Ghana",University for Development Studies,"Aniah, P (corresponding author), Univ Dev Studies, POB 1350, Tamale, Ghana.",philipaniah@yahoo.co.uk,,"Aniah, Philip/0000-0001-8729-5398",,,,,65,31,31,2,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,APR,2019,5,4,,,,,,,e01492,10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e01492,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e01492,,,25,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,HW8VZ,31049426,"gold, Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000466970300044,View Full Record in Web of Science

The health sector is a significant contributor to climate change, making up approximately 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Yet most nurses do not learn about the health dangers of climate change in their education or in practice, and therefore are ill-equipped to lead action on climate change. When educated about climate change, nurses can effectively lead climate adaptation and mitigation strategies aimed at creating healthier populations. As the most trusted professionals and making up 40% of the health-care workforce, nurses have the potential to impact behavior change and launch a movement around climate solutions. Health Care Without Harm and the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments partnered on the Nurses Climate Challenge'' with the aim of nurses educating 5,000 health professionals on climate and health. In the Nurses Climate Challenge, nurses register as Nurse Climate Champions and gain access to online resources to plan and host educational sessions about climate change. After educating, Nurse Climate Champions return to the online platform to track their progress. Within 10 months, over 540 Nurse Climate Champions from 6 continents, 16 countries, and 42 U.S. states registered for access to the resources. To date, the champions have educated over 5,250 colleagues and students about climate and health.

During the growing season, precipitation will decrease by up to 7.5% and temperature will increase by up to 4.2 degrees C by 2100.

The snow amount will be reduced under RCP 8.5 by more than 40% for the long term, consequently impacting the streamflow temporal dynamics. In addition, our results suggest that hydrological processes in the lower portions of the catchment are more sensitive to climate change.

In public debate in the Netherlands, too high ambitions and a 'piling-up' of policy objectives are often mentioned as causes of non-conformance of quantitative housing objectives. However, despite such non-conformance, a plan or policy may still function well by informing the decision-making process and invoking scrutiny of conflicting objectives. This paper aims to understand how municipalities cope with the implementation of housing developments with pluralistic policy objectives. Therefore, the performance of the policy objective to accelerate the production of housing is studied by exploring how value conflicts between this quantitative and qualitative objectives are addressed. A survey among Dutch municipalities and two additional in-depth case studies reveal that the non-conformance of the acceleration of the housing production not only results from exogenous processes, but is also a result of accumulating policy decisions favouring qualitative ambitions. The case studies reveal that municipalities especially struggle with trade-offs between qualitative and quantitative objectives. This result shows the relevance of additional research that focus on value conflicts in public policy implementation processes.","[Jonkman, Arend] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Management Built Environm, Delft, Netherlands; [Meijer, Rick] Univ Utrecht, Human Geog & Spatial Planning, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Hartmann, Thomas] TU Dortmund Univ, Sch Spatial Planning, Dortmund, Germany; [Hartmann, Thomas] Univ JE Purkyne, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic",Delft University of Technology; Utrecht University; Dortmund University of Technology; University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Jonkman, A (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Dept Management Built Environm, Delft, Netherlands.",a.r.jonkman@tudelft.nl; rick@stadkwadraat.nl; thomas.hartmann@tu-dortmund.de,,,Dutch National Science Foundation NWO [438.17.158],Dutch National Science Foundation NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"The research is based on the Grond voor Wonen [Land for housing] research project at Wageningen University and Research, funded by the Dutch National Science Foundation NWO (438.17.158).",,48,1,1,3,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,MAR,2022,114,,,,,,,,105957,10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105957,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105957,,,11,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6D8EO,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000882918000009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Together with up-to-date observations and characterizations of Arctic ice state, they are essential to business strategic planning, climate adaptation, and risk mitigation. In this study, the monthly Arctic sea ice extents from 12 global climate models are utilized to obtain projected FIASYs and their dependency on different emission scenarios, as well as to examine the nature of the ice retreat projections. The average value of model-projected FIASYs is 2054/2042, with a spread of 74/42 years for the medium/high emission scenarios, respectively. The earliest FIASY is projected to occur in year 2023, which may not be realistic, for both scenarios. The sensitivity of individual climate models to scenarios in projecting FIASYs is very model-dependent. The nature of model-projected Arctic sea ice coverage changes is shown to be primarily linear. FIASY values predicted by six commonly used statistical models that were curve-fitted with the first 30 years of climate projections (2006-2035), on other hand, show a preferred range of 2030-2040, with a distinct peak at 2034 for both scenarios, which is more comparable with those from previous studies.","[Peng, Ge; Matthews, Jessica L.; Sun, Liqiang] North Carolina State Univ, North Carolina Inst Climate Studies, Asheville, NC 28801 USA; [Wang, Muyin] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Wang, Muyin] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Vose, Russell] NOAA, Natl Ctr Environm Informat, Asheville, NC 28801 USA",North Carolina State University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Peng, G (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, North Carolina Inst Climate Studies, Asheville, NC 28801 USA.",jlmatthe@ncsu.edu; lsun4@ncsu.edu; muyin.wang@noaa.gov; russell.vose@noaa.gov; lsun4@ncsu.edu,"Vose, Russell/GSI-5687-2022; Matthews, Jessica L/D-5478-2014; Wang, Muyin/K-4006-2014; Peng, Ge/D-8003-2014","Matthews, Jessica L/0000-0002-6968-3474; Wang, Muyin/0000-0001-5233-4588; Peng, Ge/0000-0002-1986-9115","NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) through the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites-North Carolina (CICS-NC) [NA14NES432003]; Cooperative Institute for Satellite Earth System Studies (CISESS) [NA19NES4320002]; Arctic Research Project of the NOAA Climate Program Office; Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) under NOAA [NA15OAR4320063, 2019-1037]",NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) through the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites-North Carolina (CICS-NC); Cooperative Institute for Satellite Earth System Studies (CISESS); Arctic Research Project of the NOAA Climate Program Office; Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) under NOAA,"Ge Peng, Jessica L.

The necessary quantum leap in knowledge generation should build on the innovation capacity of farmers themselves. A novel citizen science methodology, triadic comparisons of technologies or tricot, was implemented in pilot studies in India, East Africa, and Central America. The methodology involves distributing a pool of agricultural technologies in different combinations of three to individual farmers who observe these technologies under farm conditions and compare their performance. Since the combinations of three technologies overlap, statistical methods can piece together the overall performance ranking of the complete pool of technologies. The tricot approach affords wide scaling, as the distribution of trial packages and instruction sessions is relatively easy to execute, farmers do not need to be organized in collaborative groups, and feedback is easy to collect, even by phone. The tricot approach provides interpretable, meaningful results and was widely accepted by farmers. The methodology underwent improvement in data input formats. A number of methodological issues remain: integrating environmental analysis, capturing gender-specific differences, stimulating farmers' motivation, and supporting implementation with an integrated digital platform. Future studies should apply the tricot approach to a wider range of technologies, quantify its potential contribution to climate adaptation, and embed the approach in appropriate institutions and business models, empowering participants and democratizing science.","[Van Etten, Jacob; Calderer, Lluis; Steinke, Jonathan] CATIE, Biovers Int, Turrialba 7170, Costa Rica; [Beza, Eskender] Wageningen Univ & Res, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Van Duijvendijk, Kees] Wageningen Univ & Res, Green Econ & Land Use Wageningen Econ Res, Alexanderveld 5, NL-2585 DB The Hague, Netherlands; [Fadda, Carlo; Kidane, Yosef Gebrehawaryat] ILRI, Biovers Int, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Fantahun, Basazen] Ethiopian Biodivers Inst, POB 30726, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Kidane, Yosef Gebrehawaryat] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Pisa, Italy; [Van de Gevel, Jeske] ICRAF, Biovers Int, POB 30677, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Gupta, Arnab; Mathur, Prem Narain; Mittra, Sarika] Biovers Int, G-1,B Block,NASC Complex,DPS Marg,Pusa Campus, New Delhi 110012, India; [Mengistu, Dejene Kassahun] Mekelle Univ, Dept Dryland Crop & Hort Sci, POB 231, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Kiambi, Dan] ABCIC, POB 100882-00101,Keiyo Chemilil Rd,Parklands, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mercado, Leida] Trop Agr Res & Higher Educ Ctr CATIE, Turrialba 7170, Costa Rica; [Mittra, Sarika] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr Madison, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Mollel, Margaret J.] Natl Plant Genet Resources Ctr, POB 3024, Arusha, Tanzania; [Rosas, Juan Carlos] Zamorano Panamer Agr Sch, Apartado Postal 93, Tegucigalpa 11101, Honduras; [Steinke, Jonathan] Humboldt Univ, Thaer Inst, Dept Agr Econ, Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Suchini, Jose Gabriel] Trop Agr Res & Higher Educ Ctr CATIE, 1 Av 7-01,Zona 5, Esquipulas, Guatemala; [Zimmerer, Karl S.] Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, 302 Walker Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Zimmerer, Karl S.] Penn State Univ, Earth & Environm Syst Inst, 302 Walker Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Alliance; Bioversity International; CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza; Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; Alliance; Bioversity International; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Alliance; Bioversity International; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF); Alliance; Bioversity International; Mekelle University; CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Humboldt University of Berlin; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Van Etten, J (corresponding author), CATIE, Biovers Int, Turrialba 7170, Costa Rica.",j.vanetten@cgiar.org,"Mercado, Leida Y/R-1276-2016","Kidane, Yosef Gebrehawaryat/0000-0002-6876-7158; GUPTA, Arnab/0000-0002-5672-5735; Steinke, Jonathan/0000-0001-5742-702X; van Etten, Jacob/0000-0001-7554-2558; Fadda, Carlo/0000-0003-3075-6207",USAID Development Innovation Ventures,USAID Development Innovation Ventures(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"This article is a contribution to the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture, and Food Security, which is a partnership of CGIAR and Future Earth.

There are, however, many challenges to applying a socio-ecological agenda to urban climate resilience and thereby re-framing ES delivery as community and people focused, a knowledge gap extensively outlined in the environmental governance literature. In this paper, we aim to contribute to this re-assesment of urban environmental governance by examining the City of Melbourne's approach to urban renaturing governance from a place-based perspective. Here we focus on the city's internationally-acclaimed urban forest strategy (UFS), investigating how and to which extent the governance arrangements embedded within the UFS draw strength from diverse perspectives and allow for institutional arrangements that support situated reflexive decision making and co-creation. We find that Melbourne's UFS governance process fosters green placemaking by re-focusing climate adaptation solutions from technological strategies to situated socio-ecological principles such as human well-being and community-based decision making. In this sense, this case provides valuable insight for the broader UGI governance field regarding the opportunities and challenges associated with a socio-cultural approach to urban re-naturing and ES delivery.","[Gulsrud, Natalie Marie] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Hertzog, Kelly] City Melbourne, Urban Forester, 120 Swanston St, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Shears, Ian] City Melbourne, Urban Sustainabil, 120 Swanston St, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia",University of Copenhagen,"Gulsrud, NM (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",nagu@ign.ku.dk; Kelly.Hertzog@melboume.vic.gov.au; Ian.Shears@melbourne.vic.gov.au,"Gulsrud, Natalie Marie/C-9277-2015","Gulsrud, Natalie Marie/0000-0003-0845-1466",,,,,85,84,85,7,110,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0013-9351,1096-0953,,ENVIRON RES,Environ.

However, cropland expansion, on one hand, disturbs the existing land use/cover (LULC) and, on other hand, many socio-economic and biophysical factors affect this process. This study was based on the Kabul River Basin to answer two questions: Firstly, what was the change in LULC since 2001 to 2010 and, secondly, what are the drivers of cropland change. We used the spatial calculating model (SCM) for LULC change and binomial logistic regression (BLR) for drivers of cropland change. The net change shows that cropland, grassland, water-bodies, and built-up areas were increased, while forest, unused, and snow/ice areas were decreased. Cropland was expanded by 13%, which was positively affected by low and plain landforms, slope, soil depth, investment on agriculture and distance to the city, while it was negatively affected by plateaus and hill landforms, dry semi-arid, moist semi-arid, and sub-humid zones, precipitation, population, and the distance to roads and water. Climate adaptation measures, cropland protection in flood prone zones, population and rural migration control, farmer access to credit, irrigation, and inputs are necessary for agricultural deployment.","[Najmuddin, Omaid; Deng, Xiangzheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Najmuddin, Omaid; Deng, Xiangzheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Najmuddin, Omaid] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Bhattacharya, Ruchira] Natl Inst Rural Dev & Panchayati Raj, Hyderabad 500030, Andhra Pradesh, India","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Najmuddin, O (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Najmuddin, O (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Najmuddin, O (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",omaid_najmuddin@yahoo.com; dengxz.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn; ruchi.jnu16@gmail.com,"Bhattacharya, Ruchira/AAG-9610-2021; Deng, Xiangzheng/N-1335-2018","Bhattacharya, Ruchira/0000-0002-7735-3301; ","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA 0602500]; China National Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar [71225005]; Bureau of International Cooperation, Chinese Academy of Sciences [131A11KYSB 20130023]; CAS-TWAS President Fellowship Program","National Key Research and Development Program of China; China National Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar; Bureau of International Cooperation, Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); CAS-TWAS President Fellowship Program","This research was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant No. 2016YFA 0602500), China National Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar (grant No. 71225005), the Bureau of International Cooperation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant no. 131A11KYSB 20130023), and the CAS-TWAS President Fellowship Program.",,73,17,17,2,34,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2018,10,2,,,,,,,423,10.3390/su10020423,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10020423,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FX3BB,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000425943100146,View Full Record in Web of Science

Next to the economic challenges, there are equally important factors that hinder renovating the existing residential building stock and adding newly constructed high performance buildings. Under these circumstances this paper summarises the findings of a cross-comparative study of the societal and technical barriers of nZEB implementation in 7 Southern European countries. The study analyses the present situation and provides an overview on future prospects for nZEB in Southern Europe. The result presents an overview of challenges and provides recommendations based on available empirical evidence to further lower those barriers in the European construction sector. The paper finds that the most Southern European countries are poorly prepared for nZEB implementation and especially to the challenge opportunity of retrofitting existing buildings. Creating a common approach to further develop nZEB targets, concepts and definitions in synergy with the climatic, societal and technical state of progress in Southern Europe is essential. The paper provides recommendations for actions to shift the identified gaps into opportunities for future development of climate adaptive high performance buildings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

These transitions are complex and difficult to predict - the product of water managers acting in response to numerous biophysical, regulatory, political, and financial factors within institutional constraints. Gaining a better understanding of how these transitions occur is crucial for continuing to improve water management. This paper presents a replicable methodology for analyzing how urban water utilities transition toward sustainability. The method combines standardized quantitative measures of variables that influence transitions with contextual qualitative information about a utility's unique decision making context to produce structured, data-driven narratives. Data-narratives document the broader context, the utility's pretransition history, key events during an accelerated period of change, and the consequences of transition. Eventually, these narratives should be compared across cases to develop empirically-testable hypotheses about the drivers of and barriers to utility-level urban water management transition. The methodology is illustrated through the case of the Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (WASD) in Miami-Dade County, Florida, and its transition toward more sustainable water management in the 2000s, during which per capita water use declined, conservation measures were enacted, water rates increased, and climate adaptive planning became the new norm.","[Treuer, Galen] Univ Miami, Abess Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Policy, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Koebele, Elizabeth] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Deslatte, Aaron] Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Publ Adm, De Kalb, IL USA; [Ernst, Kathleen] Univ Tennessee, Bredesen Ctr Interdisciplinary Grad Educ, Knoxville, TN USA; [Garcia, Margaret] Tufts Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Manago, Kim] Colorado Sch Mines, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USA",University of Miami; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Northern Illinois University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Tufts University; Colorado School of Mines,"Treuer, G (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Abess Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Policy, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",g.treuer@umiami.edu,,"Garcia, Margaret/0000-0002-2864-2377; Koebele, Elizabeth/0000-0001-9133-2710; Ernst, Kathleen/0000-0002-4726-0331","National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) - National Science Foundation [DBI-1052875]; National Science Foundation [EAR-1204762, EAR-12040235, DG1E-0951782, IGERT-0966093, EEC-1444926]; United States Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA ) [2012-67003-19862]; National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Reinventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure [EEC-1028968]; Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences [1052875, 1639145] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) - National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); United States Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA ); National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Reinventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"Thank you to Sara Hughes, Jessica Bolson and Deserai Anderson Crow for their invaluable help reviewing this manuscript and for their advice throughout this process.

More than ever, resource-users will need to anticipate, and prepare for, climate-related changes, and institutions will need to be particularly supportive, if resource industries and the extended social systems dependent on them are to be sustained. I examine the capacity of cattle-graziers in Australia to cope and adapt to climate variability as a precursor for understanding their vulnerability to climate change by assessing: (i) their perception of risk, (ii) their capacity to plan, learn and reorganise, (iii) their proximity to the thresholds of coping, and (iv) their level of interest in adapting to change. Graziers perceived themselves to be resilient to climate variability in their perceptions of climate risk, reorganising capacity, coping, and interest in adapting. Their dependency on the grazing resource and use of seasonal climate forecasts were significant influences, suggesting that resilience could be enhanced. Facilitated collaborative learning amongst graziers and other stakeholders may assist to develop strategic skills, increasing climate awareness, developing financial security and adopt climate tools such as seasonal climate forecasts. Enhanced strategies for coping with climate variability will provide a way for encouraging gradual, incremental adjustments for climate adaptation. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The research analyzes the factors that determine the vulnerability of the elderly population in households affected by recurrent floods in the city of Monterrey (Mexico) and its adaptability to hazards. The methodology is based on an analysis of survey data and the use of GIS at neighborhood. The results indicate that the vulnerability of aging in place (housing and neighborhood) affected by recurrent floods is explained by the factors, environmental pressure, functional competence, advanced aging, exclusion social and capacity for risk management. The distribution of vulnerable elderly population shows a greater focus on neighborhoods demographically aging city center and suburban neighborhoods highly marginalized of Monterrey. It is concluded that the deficiencies in risk management and limited adaptability of the elderly to recurrent floods favors their vulnerability to climate change.","[Chavez-Alvarado, Rosalia] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Chavez-Alvarado, Rosalia] Tecn Acad Colegio Frontera Norte, Sede Monterrey, Mexico; [Sanchez-Gonzalez, Diego] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Geog, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Chavez-Alvarado, R (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.;Chavez-Alvarado, R (corresponding author), Tecn Acad Colegio Frontera Norte, Sede Monterrey, Mexico.",rosaliadf@gmail.com; diego.sanchezg@uam.es,"Sanchez-Gonzalez, Diego/F-4384-2016","Sanchez-Gonzalez, Diego/0000-0002-4174-4546",,,,,68,6,7,3,14,UNIV AUTONOMA ESTADO MEXICO,TOLUCA,"CIUDAD UNIVERSITARIA, TOLUCA, CP 50100, MEXICO",1405-7425,,,PAPELES POBLAC,Papeles Poblac.,,2016,22,90,,,,,9,42,,10.22185/24487147.2016.90.033,http://dx.doi.org/10.22185/24487147.2016.90.033,,,34,Demography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Demography,EP5KA,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000397416200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

A case-crossover study in Guangzhou, China",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,High temperature; Work injury; Case-crossover study; Occupational health; Climate change,CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEAT EXPOSURE; TEMPERATURE; STRESS; MODELS; HEALTH,"Background: Despite increasing concerns about the health effects of climate change, the extent to which workers are affected by hot weather is not well documented. This study aims to investigate the association between high temperatures and work-related injuries using data from a large subtropical city in China. Methods: We used workers' compensation claims to identify work-related injuries in Guangzhou, China during 2011-2012. To feature the heat effect, the study period was restricted to the warm seasons in Guangzhou (1 May-31 October). We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study to examine the association between ambient outdoor temperatures, including daily maximum and minimum temperatures, and cases of work-related injury. The relationships were assessed using conditional Poisson regression models. Results: Overall, a total of 5418 workers' compensation claims were included over the study period. Both maximum and minimum temperatures were significantly associated with work-related injuries, but associations varied by subgroup. One degrees C increase in maximum temperature was associated with a 1.4% (RR = 1.014, 95%CIs 1.012-1.017) increase in daily injury claims. Significant associations were seen for male and middle-aged workers, workers in small and medium-sized enterprises, and those working in manufacturing sector. And 1 degrees C increase in minimum temperature was associated with 1.7% (RR = 1.017, 95%CIs 1.012-1.021) increase in daily injury claims. Significant associations were observed for female and middle-aged workers, workers in large-sized enterprises, and those working in transport and construction sectors. Conclusions: We found a higher risk of work-related injuries due to hot weather in Guangzhou, China. This study provides important epidemiological evidence for policy-makers and industry that may assist in the formulation of occupational safety and climate adaptation strategies.","[Sheng, Rongrong; Li, Changchang; Wang, Qiong; Yang, Lianping; Bao, Junzhe; Wang, Kaiwen; Ma, Rui; Huang, Cunrui] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Zhongshan Rd 2, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Gao, Chuansi] Lund Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Design Sci, Div Ergon & Aerosol Technol,Thermal Environm Lab, Lund, Sweden; [Lin, Shao] SUNY Albany, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Rensselaer, NY USA; [Lin, Shao] SUNY Albany, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Rensselaer, NY USA; [Zhang, Ying] Univ Sydney, Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Bi, Peng] Univ Adelaide, Discipline Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Fu, Chuandong] Guangdong Prov Work Injury Rehabil Hosp, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; Lund University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; University of Sydney; University of Adelaide,"Huang, CR (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Zhongshan Rd 2, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Fu, CD (corresponding author), Guangdong Prov Work Injury Rehabil Hosp, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",fucd168168@163.com; huangcr@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"Gao, Chuansi/AAD-5270-2019; Gao, Chuansi/C-6904-2011; Huang, Cunrui/ABI-3312-2020; Zhang, Ying/ABE-2275-2021","Gao, Chuansi/0000-0001-7386-692X; Gao, Chuansi/0000-0001-7386-692X; Zhang, Ying/0000-0001-6214-2440; Bi, Peng/0000-0002-3238-3427","Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China [2016A030313216]; Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research [CRRP2016-10MY-Huang]","Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China [2016A030313216] and the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research [CRRP2016-10MY-Huang].",,41,43,45,5,26,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1438-4639,1618-131X,,INT J HYG ENVIR HEAL,Int.

A growing critique, however, challenges the simplicity of ideas that identify climate as an agent of past societal change; arguing instead that the value of historical climate-society research lies in understanding human vulnerability and resilience, as well as how past societies framed, responded and adapted to climatic phenomena. We work across this divide to present the first critical analysis of climate-society relationships in southeast Africa over the last millennium. To achieve this, we review the now considerable body of scholarship on the role of climate in regional societal transformation, and bring forward new perspectives on climate-society interactions across three areas and periods using the theoretical frameworks of vulnerability and resilience. We find that recent advances in paleoclimatology and archaeology give weight to the suggestion that responses to climate variability played an important part in early state formation in the Limpopo valley (1000-1300), though evidence remains insufficient to clarify similar debates concerning Great Zimbabwe (1300-1450/1520). Written and oral evidence from the Zambezi-Save (1500-1830) and KwaZulu-Natal areas (1760-1828) nevertheless reveals a plurality of past responses to climate variability. These were underpinned by the organization of food systems, the role of climate-related ritual and political power, social networks, and livelihood assets and capabilities, as well as the nature of climate variability itself. To conclude, we identify new lines of research on climate, history and society, and discuss how these can more directly inform contemporary African climate adaptation challenges.

Brad; Smith, Martin D.",,,Coastal sustainability depends on how economic and coastline responses to climate change affect each other,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,US EAST-COAST,"Human-induced climate change is predicted to accelerate sea level rise and alter storm frequency along the US east coast. Rising sea level will enhance shoreline erosion, and recent work indicates changing storm patterns and associated changes in wave conditions can intensify coastal erosion along parts of a coastline. Investigations of coastal response to climate change typically consider natural processes in isolation - neglecting repeated changes to the coastline from human actions, primarily through shoreline nourishment projects, which add sand to the shoreline to counteract erosion. In a model coupling economically driven shoreline nourishment with wave-and sea level rise-driven coastline change, and accounting for dwindling sediment resources for nourishment, coastline response depends dramatically on the relationship between patterns of property value and erosion. Simulations show that when nourishment costs rise with depletion of sand resources, coastline change is tied to the interaction between patterns of erosion and property value. Simulations show that when high property values align with highly erosive locations, sand resources are depleted rapidly and nourishment in lower property value towns is quickly abandoned. Although our model simulates a particular coastal morphology, the result that future behavior of the coastline and the economic viability of nourishment in a given town depend on the regional interaction between patterns of property value and erosion is likely applicable to many coastal configurations. More broadly, coupling economic and physical models reveals equity and sustainability implications of coastal climate adaptation as well as patterns of coastline change that a physical model alone would overlook.

In this study we report on the relationships between weather and tourism activities in the Queenstown-Lake Wanaka region, South Island, New Zealand. Key stakeholder interviews and a workshop form the empirical basis of this paper. Coping range application ideas derived from ecological management literature are used to develop a framework to understand and inform thinking and strategies around how tourism businesses and destinations are currently responding to the weather and perhaps could in future respond to climate change. Results show that within a destination individual businesses have widely varying relationships with the weather, with each type of activity operating within its own coping range to particular environmental gradients, for example temperature. Coping, which can be observed outside the 'ideal' range of a particular environmental gradient, requires business adjustments so as to cope with increasingly marginal conditions, up to a Critical Stop Point - the ultimate threshold. The data suggest that increased need for adjustments impacts on business viability, and more planned adaptation measures would be necessary to increase viability under increasingly detrimental climatic conditions. Discussion at a destination level workshop indicates that at and beyond thresholds, keystone industry and destination level strategic adaptation planning is required to ensure the viability of the destination as a whole.

With the largest rain-fed lowland area in the world, flooding is considered as the most important abiotic stress to rice production in India. With climate change, it is expected that the frequency and severity of the floods will increase over the years. These changes will have a severe impact on the rain-fed agriculture production and livelihoods of millions of farmers in the flood affected region. There are numerous flood risk adaptation and mitigation options available for rain-fed agriculture in India. Procuring, maintaining and distributing the newly developed submergence-tolerant rice variety called Swarna-Sub1 could play an important role in minimizing the effect of flood on rice production. This paper assesses the quantity and cost of a flood-tolerant rice seed variety- Swarna-Sub1, that would be required during the main cropping season of rice i.e., kharif at a district level for 17 major Indian states. The need for SS1 seeds for rice production was assessed by developing a geospatial framework using remote sensing to map the suitability of SS1, to help stakeholders prepare better in managing the flood risks. Results indicate that districts of Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh will require the highest amount of SS1 seeds for flood adaptation strategies. The total estimated seed requirement for these 17 states would cost around 370 crores INR, less than 0.01 percent of Indian central government's budget allocation for agriculture sector.","[Koppa, Nisha] Int Water Management Inst, New Delhi 110012, India; [Amarnath, Giriraj] Int Water Management Inst, Battaramulla 10120, Sri Lanka",CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI); CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI),"Amarnath, G (corresponding author), Int Water Management Inst, Battaramulla 10120, Sri Lanka.",nishakoppaa@gmail.com; a.giriraj@cgiar.org,,"Amarnath, Giriraj/0000-0002-7390-9800","CGIAR Research Program (CRP); Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR Research Program (CRP) on Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE); CGIAR Trust Fund","CGIAR Research Program (CRP)(CGIAR); Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR Research Program (CRP) on Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE)(CGIAR); CGIAR Trust Fund(CGIAR)","This research was funded by the CGIAR Research Program (CRP) on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), and CGIAR Research Program (CRP) on Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE), which is carried out with support from the CGIAR Trust Fund and through bilateral funding agreements.

However, for successful adaptation to occur, an accurate recognition and understanding of the climate signal by key stakeholders (farmers, seed suppliers and agricultural extension services) is an essential precursor. This paper presents evidence based on fieldwork with smallholder maize producers and national seed network stakeholders in Malawi from 2010 to 2011, assessing understandings of rainfall changes and decision-making about maize cultivar choices. Our findings show that preferences for short-season maize cultivars are increasing based on perceptions that season lengths are growing shorter due to climate change and the assumption that growing shorter-season crops represents a good strategy for adapting to drought. However, meteorological records for the two study areas present no evidence for shortening seasons (or any significant change to rainfall characteristics), suggesting that short-season cultivars may not be the most suitable adaptation option for these areas. This demonstrates the dangers of oversimplified climate information in guiding changes in farmer decision-making about cultivar choice.","[Sutcliffe, Chloe; Dougill, Andrew J.; Quinn, Claire H.] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Sutcliffe, C (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",chloesutcliffe@hotmail.com; a.j.dougill@leeds.ac.uk; c.h.quinn@leeds.ac.uk,"Sutcliffe, Chloe/GWC-6886-2022; mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020; Sutcliffe, Chloe/GZG-3359-2022; Quinn, Claire/AAU-8184-2020","Sutcliffe, Chloe/0000-0002-8035-1964; Sutcliffe, Chloe/0000-0002-8035-1964; Dougill, Andrew/0000-0002-3422-8228; Quinn, Claire/0000-0002-2085-0446",ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was funded by the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy.,,62,46,46,0,42,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Human and envi-ronmental effects of climate change are already widespread. Large-scale disruptive disasters and weather-related events have downstream and cascading effects on livelihoods, national economies, population health and global human rights. These effects create human displacement and migration crises with far-reaching implications for children. Displacement and migration, both within and across national borders, have sequelae for the physical and mental health of children. Young children are vulnerable-both physiologically and develop-mentally immature-and dependent on others for safety and resources. They also are least responsible for the climate crisis. Child health threats stemming from displacement and migration exemplify questions of social and intergenerational injustice inherent in the climate crisis. Pediatric health care providers are increasingly called upon to care for children and ensure access to care for children who have experienced displacement from climate change, even as dire predictions for the future are escalating climate adaptation efforts. Pediatric health care pro-viders have a role in these efforts-to identify and advocate for those children most at risk from climate change and to bolster clinical care and education strategies to prevent harm to our patients and children. This paper provides a global perspective on climate change for pediatric providers, including how cli-mate change reflects and reinforces colonial legacies that harm child health. We provide action steps for those providers who care for children who have been displaced in the U.S. and who advocate for children's health globally.","[Uddin, Raisa] Emory Univ, Pediat Residency Program, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Philipsborn, Rebecca] Emory Univ, Div Gen Pediat, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Philipsborn, Rebecca] Childrens Healthcare Atlanta, Atlanta, GA USA; [Philipsborn, Rebecca; Thompson, Lisa M.] Emory Univ, Gangarosa Dept Environm Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Smith, Daniel; Mutic, Abby; Thompson, Lisa M.] Emory Univ, Nell Hodgson Woodruff Sch Nursing, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Emory University; Emory University; Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA); Emory University; Emory University,"Thompson, LM (corresponding author), 1520 Clifton Rd,Suite 226, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",lisa.thompson@emory.edu,"Thompson, Lisa M./H-2059-2019","Thompson, Lisa M./0000-0002-8001-2057; Smith, Daniel/0000-0003-4471-8885",,,,,61,3,3,4,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1538-5442,1538-3199,,CURR PROB PEDIATR AD,Curr.

For the case study area of Axios Delta, Northern Greece, a water deficit in the agricultural sector, an unmet environmental flow and a reduced capacity for urban supply during drought conditions are observed. An egocentric network analysis based on desk-study and a series of semi-structured stakeholder interviews reveals how weak stakeholder ties lead to ineffective multilevel governance and, as a result, low water efficiency practices. There is a lack of understanding of other users' priorities as well as of the risks related to climate change and/or seasonal variability. This is reflected in the flat rate abstraction licence for agricultural purposes which reduces environmental flow to below acceptable standards. There is no transboundary cooperation between Greece and the Republic of North Macedonia which hinders an integrated management approach. A limited exchange of information to support an evidence-based allocation plan is observed. Suitable interventions identified through a DPSIR approach are evaluated in a multi-criteria analysis considering cost effectiveness, delivered benefits as well as ease of implementation. Suitable technical practices include the development of a local and catchment-scale monitoring network for surface water and groundwater, climate-adaptive agriculture and treated-water reclamation. Updated management policies involve the institutional prioritisation of environmental flow through an adaptive allocation plan as well as the strengthening of transboundary cooperation. This research shows how the coordination of aggregated diverging interests in multilevel multi-stakeholder environments appears to be key in supporting positive water budgets in an uncertain climate future.

They are often nutrient rich(1), generate lower emissions and impacts on land and water than many terrestrial meats(2), and contribute to the health(3), wellbeing and livelihoods of many rural communities(4). The Blue Food Assessment recently evaluated nutritional, environmental, economic and justice dimensions of blue foods globally. Here we integrate these findings and translate them into four policy objectives to help realize the contributions that blue foods can make to national food systems around the world: ensuring supplies of critical nutrients, providing healthy alternatives to terrestrial meat, reducing dietary environmental footprints and safeguarding blue food contributions to nutrition, just economies and livelihoods under a changing climate. To account for how context-specific environmental, socio-economic and cultural aspects affect this contribution, we assess the relevance of each policy objective for individual countries, and examine associated co-benefits and trade-offs at national and international scales. We find that in many African and South American nations, facilitating consumption of culturally relevant blue food, especially among nutritionally vulnerable population segments, could address vitamin B-12 and omega-3 deficiencies. Meanwhile, in many global North nations, cardiovascular disease rates and large greenhouse gas footprints from ruminant meat intake could be lowered through moderate consumption of seafood with low environmental impact. The analytical framework we provide also identifies countries with high future risk, for whom climate adaptation of blue food systems will be particularly important. Overall the framework helps decision makers to assess the blue food policy objectives most relevant to their geographies, and to compare and contrast the benefits and trade-offs associated with pursuing these objectives.","[Crona, Beatrice I.; Wassenius, Emmy; Jonell, Malin; Short, Rebecca; Daw, Tim M.] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Crona, Beatrice I.; Wassenius, Emmy; Jonell, Malin; Troell, Max] Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Global Econ Dynam & Biosphere, Stockholm, Sweden; [Koehn, J.

This paper aims to reconsider urban density as a spatial planning instrument to develop effective densification policies, planning and design strategies in terms of surface urban heat island (SUHI) mitigation in Istanbul. The quantitative research embraced a four-stage methodology including grid-based sampling design, decoding the taxonomy of urban density-matrix (UDM), land surface temperature mapping, and ANOVA tests. Tests were conducted on the UDM consisting of nine building typologies representing the horizontal and vertical urban density. The research indicated that the impact of urbanisation on SUHI can be mitigated by controlling densities and urban forms based on quantitative findings. The highest temperatures were recorded in areas with high-coverage-mid-rise and mid-coverage-mid-rise development. The different levels of SUHI in different building typologies having the same density indicated the mitigation potentials of the built-form in Istanbul's local urban warming. Low coverage and high-rise building forms were an optimal solution for mitigating SUHI in densely populated urban areas. The research gives insight into an ongoing debate among urban professionals in Istanbul concerning the impacts of density and the urban form for climate adaptation. It enables professionals to understand the impact of urban planning decisions on microclimate and integrate them into the operational processes. Considering quantitative research findings as a strong foundation for developing policy recommendations and using them as a guideline may create new opportunities for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. The study has an original value for exploring design strategies to improve microclimate and promoting sustainable urban development.","[Okumus, Deniz Erdem] Yildiz Tech Univ, City & Reg Planning Dept, Istanbul, Turkey; [Terzi, Fatih] Istanbul Tech Univ, Urban & Reg Planning Dept, Istanbul, Turkey",Yildiz Technical University; Istanbul Technical University,"Okumus, DE (corresponding author), Yildiz Tech Univ, City & Reg Planning Dept, Istanbul, Turkey.",denizer@yildiz.edu.tr; terzifati@itu.edu.tr,"Erdem Okumus, Deniz/AAZ-6710-2020; Terzi, Fatih/O-1756-2013","Erdem Okumus, Deniz/0000-0003-2671-0126; Terzi, Fatih/0000-0002-1292-576X","Scientific Research Projects Department of Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey [42088]; Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)","Scientific Research Projects Department of Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey; Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK))","This paper was produced from the PhD thesis conducted by the corresponding author under the supervision of the second author.

The research presented here is developed in the Mediterranean Basin, specifically in the Basilicata Region (southern Italy). The region is characterized by a very long history of intensive anthropization endowed by the high diversity of relatively geologically young soil types that consequentially created a vastity of spatial mosaics, which contributed to the composition of its archeolandscapes and endorsed some specific characteristics of the Mediterranean region, that evolved to respond to the human impact, including grazing, cultivation, and fires. Those key elements lead to the crucial issues of the region investigated here as soil erosion, salinization, loss of organic carbon, loss of biodiversity, and landslides, which together with deforestations, depopulation, and wildfires, define the exact framework of degradation and marginality. The evaluation of the sensitivity to degradation was performed (i) firstly at the regional scale, through a MEDALUS (Kosmas et al. 1999) approach, by implementing 6 main indicators (Soil Quality Index, Climate Quality Index, Vegetation Quality Index, Management Quality Index, Landslide Risk Index, Water Availability Index), and (ii) secondly at the mid-regional scale, through remote sensing by evaluation of the NDVI differencing thresholds in time intervals, covering a 20 years' time span going from 2000 to 2020. The study helped to define the in-progress land degradation trends and scenarios of the region, which must be the evidence-based foundation of integrated landscape planning strategies in marginal territories, implemented through a Decision Support System (DSS) based both on ecological, climate-adaptive, and environmental indicators, and on social, cultural, and economic development co-creation strategies.","[Gabriele, Marzia; Brumana, Raffaella; Previtali, Mattia] Politecn Milan, Dept ABC, Via Giuseppe Ponzio 31, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Cazzani, Alberta] Politecn Milan, Dept DaStU, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 26, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Gabriele, M (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept ABC, Via Giuseppe Ponzio 31, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",marzia.gabriele@polimi.it; raffaella.brumana@polimi.it; mattia.previtali@polimi.it; alberta.cazzani@polimi.it,,"gabriele, marzia/0000-0002-2357-9049",,,,,114,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1866-9298,1866-928X,,APPL GEOMAT,Appl.

Nature-based solutions are multifunctional, and so their planning and implementation are by necessity interdisciplinary. As such, to support urban transitions with nature-based solutions, the role of intermediary actors deserves research attention. Intermediaries play key roles in linking between sectors, across different levels of government and between disciplines and policy domains. We identified three key points for research and planning nature-based solutions through intermediaries as key agents for change: intermediaries are creators of enabling institutional spaces needed for mainstreaming nature-based solutions in cities; intermediaries as actor configurations are dynamic over time and in context, and intermediation has to be understood as a fundamental governance activity in cities that want to scale up their climate adaptation planning with nature-based solutions. Using a case study of the development and initial implementation of the metropolitan urban forest strategy in Melbourne Australia, we analyze the multi-actor landscape that emerged, through the lens of intermediation. We systematically investigated which actors, partnerships and platforms acted as intermediaries in the transformative agenda of the Urban Forest strategy, how these actors interacted over the course of the strategy's development and how their roles and functions shifted during the early implementation stages of the strategy. We found that an 'ecology of intermediaries' adopted a range of roles to support key functions including building collaboration, informing and disseminating policy learning, and strengthening political support. While intermediaries' roles and functions shifted across the strategy's development, their contributions were critical in the complex metropolitan governance context. Collaborative planning and governance for nature-based solutions in cities require intermediaries to remain topical, focused and inclusive/open to new ideas and lessons from innovations both emerging and driven.","[Frantzeskaki, Niki] Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Urban Transit, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Bush, Judy] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Swinburne University of Technology; University of Melbourne,"Frantzeskaki, N (corresponding author), Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Urban Transit, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",nfrantzeskaki@swin.edu.au,,"Bush, Judy/0000-0002-7847-6610", [20202810-4555],,"NF notes that the conducted interviews have received a Research Ethics Approval with Reference number 20202810-4555.

Yet the controls are shaped and interact at multiple spatiotemporal scales, from which macrosystem patterns in SOM emerge. Theory on SOM turnover recognizes the resulting spatial and temporal conditionality in the effect sizes of controls that play out across macrosystems, and couples them through evolutionary and community assembly processes. For example, climate history shapes plant functional traits, which in turn interact with contemporary climate to influence SOM dynamics. Selection and assembly also shape the functional traits of soil decomposer communities, but it is less clear how in turn these traits influence temporal macrosystem patterns in SOM turnover. Here, we review evidence that establishes the expectation that selection and assembly should generate decomposer communities across macrosystems that have distinct functional effects on SOM dynamics. Representation of this knowledge in soil biogeochemical models affects the magnitude and direction of projected SOM responses under global change. Yet there is high uncertainty and low confidence in these projections. To address these issues, we make the case that a coordinated set of empirical practices are required which necessitate (1) greater use of statistical approaches in biogeochemistry that are suited to causative inference; (2) long-term, macrosystem-scale, observational and experimental networks to reveal conditionality in effect sizes, and embedded correlation, in controls on SOM turnover; and (3) use of multiple measurement grains to capture local- and macroscale variation in controls and outcomes, to avoid obscuring causative understanding through data aggregation. When employed together, along with process-based models to synthesize knowledge and guide further empirical work, we believe these practices will rapidly advance understanding of microbial controls on SOM and improve carbon cycle projections that guide policies on climate adaptation and mitigation.","[Bradford, Mark A.; Wood, Stephen A.; Addicott, Ethan T.; Fenichel, Eli P.; Fields, Nicholas; Gonzalez-Rivero, Javier; Jevon, Fiona, V; Oldfield, Emily E.; Polussa, Alexander; Ward, Elisabeth B.] Yale Univ, Yale Sch Environm, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Wood, Stephen A.] Nature Conservancy, 1815 N Lynn St, Arlington, VA USA; [Maynard, Daniel S.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Univ Str 16, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Wieder, William R.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Wieder, William R.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Yale University; Nature Conservancy; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Bradford, MA (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Yale Sch Environm, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",mark.bradford@yale.edu,"Bradford, Mark A/G-3850-2012; Jevon, Fiona/ABB-9955-2020","Bradford, Mark A/0000-0002-2022-8331; Jevon, Fiona/0000-0002-3586-7566; Maynard, Daniel/0000-0003-0142-9100; WIEDER, WILLIAM/0000-0001-7116-1985","U.S. National Science Foundation [DEB-1926482, DEB-1926413]; U.S. Department of Energy [BSS DE-SC0016364]",U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"MAB, AP, SAW, WRW, NF, JGR and FJ were supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation's Macrosystem Biology and NEON-Enabled Science program grants DEB-1926482 and DEB-1926413.

We used a space-for-time substitution method to quantify N pools, processes, and fluxes along a hydrological gradient. Further, we linked N pools and processes and investigated not only surface but also subsurface sediments. Our results showed a gradual decrease in total N (TN) and mineralization rates (PNmin), but an increase in potential rates of nitrification (PNR) and denitrification (PDNR) under an elevated hydrological gradient, except for TN and PNmin in the subsurface sediment, which accumulated on the interaction zone between the high and middle tidal flats. Most sedimentary ammonium N (NH4+) and nitrate N (NO3-) concentrations were similar; however, NH4+ accumulated on the subsurface of the middle tidal flat. NO3- fluxes (from -0.54 to -0.35 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) were uptake fluxes in the intertidal flats, but NH4+ fluxes (-2.48-3.54 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) changed from uptake to efflux in the seaward direction. Structural equation modeling of the effects of inundation frequency, underground biomass, total carbon (TC), electrical conductivity (EC), and clay proportion on the N processes revealed that these accounted for 67%, 82%, and 17% of the variance of PDNR, PNmin, and PNR, respectively. Inundation frequency, underground biomass, TC, EC, and PNmin effects on N pools accounted for 53%, 69%, and 98% of the variance of NH4+, NO3-, and TN, respectively. This suggests that future sea level rise may decrease N storage due to increase in coupled nitrification-denitrification and decrease in N mineralization, and the NH4+ flux may change from sink to source in intertidal ecosystems.","[Hu, Weifang; Zhang, Wenlong; Zhang, Linhai; Tong, Chuan; Sun, Zhigao; Chen, Yuehmin; Zeng, Congsheng] Fujian Normal Univ, State Key Lab Subtrop Mt Ecol, Minist Sci & Technol & Fujian Prov, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Hu, Weifang; Zhang, Wenlong; Zhang, Linhai; Tong, Chuan; Sun, Zhigao; Chen, Yuehmin; Zeng, Congsheng] Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China",Fujian Normal University; Fujian Normal University,"Chen, YM; Zeng, CS (corresponding author), Fujian Normal Univ, State Key Lab Subtrop Mt Ecol, Minist Sci & Technol & Fujian Prov, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China.;Chen, YM; Zeng, CS (corresponding author), Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China.",weifanghyx@163.com; zhangwenlong027@163.com; mary12maryzhang@126.com; tongch@fjnu.edu.cn; zhigaosun@163.com; ymchen@fjnu.edu.cn; cszeng@fjnu.edu.cn,"H, W/GRJ-4606-2022","Hu, Weifang/0000-0003-0542-9685",Public Service Foundation of Science and Technology Department of Fujian Province [2017R1034-6]; National Science Foundation of China [41877335]; Program for Innovative Research Teams of Fujian Normal University [IRTL1205],Public Service Foundation of Science and Technology Department of Fujian Province; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Innovative Research Teams of Fujian Normal University,"The study was partly supported by the Public Service Foundation of Science and Technology Department of Fujian Province (Grant No: 2017R1034-6), the National Science Foundation of China (41877335), and the Program for Innovative Research Teams of Fujian Normal University (No. IRTL1205).",,72,5,5,0,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

In the future, food production will continually decrease because of aggravated effects of climate change, causing food production to continually decrease. Food production will be unable to satisfy the demand of the global population, leading to a food-security crisis. As the world population continues to increase, the shortage of food will become increasingly severe, particularly for those located in climate impact hotspots of tropical, subtropical, small-island countries, and countries that are dependent on imports to meet domestic demand such as Taiwan. Numerous Taiwanese studies have suggested that agricultural and fishery productivity has declined because of climate variation, which may cause changes and instability in food quantity and quality, and increase deficiency and uncertainty in the food supply. Therefore, to discuss the risks posed by climate change to the stability of food supply and demand, this paper, taking Taiwan as a case, explored the impact of climate variation on food security and future adaptation strategies. TaiCCAT's supportive system for decision-making (TSSDA) was adopted here to assess and analyze the current situations of agricultural and fisheries production and supply, as well as future food supply risks, in addition to evaluating the deficiencies in the existing climate adaptation strategies in order to plan and revise feasible future adaptation alternatives. Based on the rule of risk management, the adaptation strategies recommended in this study were differentiated into two categories: proactive adaptation and planned adaptation. Proactive adaptation is emphasized to counter the uncertainty of food production, which increases the difficulty of production and necessity to import food. Conversely, planned adaptation can be used to manage the uncertainty of food supply to implement adjustments in production and marketing, as well as to mitigate the impact of climate variation.","[Ho, Ching-Hsien; Lu, Hsueh-Jung] Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Environm Biol & Fisheries Sci, 2 Beining Rd, Keelung 202, Taiwan; [Ho, Ching-Hsien; Yagi, Nobuyuki] Univ Tokyo, Dept Global Agr Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Lur, Huu-Sheng; Lin, Ying-Ting] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agron, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Yao, Ming-Hwi; Liao, Fang-Ching] Execut Yuan, Council Agr, Taiwan Agr Res Inst, 189 Zhongzheng Rd, Taichung 41362, Taiwan; [Lu, Hsueh-Jung] Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Ctr Excellence Oceans, 2 Beining Rd, Keelung 202, Taiwan",National Taiwan Ocean University; University of Tokyo; National Taiwan University; Agricultural Research Institute of Taiwan; National Taiwan Ocean University,"Lu, HJ (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Environm Biol & Fisheries Sci, 2 Beining Rd, Keelung 202, Taiwan.;Lu, HJ (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Ctr Excellence Oceans, 2 Beining Rd, Keelung 202, Taiwan.",hjlu@ntou.edu.tw,,,National Science Council of the Republic of China (Taiwan) [NSC 104-2621-M-002-002],"National Science Council of the Republic of China (Taiwan)(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This study was supported by a research grant awarded by the National Science Council (NSC 104-2621-M-002-002) of the Republic of China (Taiwan).

To date, adaptation, mitigation and development related to key climate-sensitive sectors have often been treated separately. This paper uses qualitative document analysis, content analysis, expert interviews and a multi-stakeholder workshop to: examine the extent to which policies in climate-sensitive sectors align in framing adaptation, mitigation and development action; and identify key areas of policy coherence in Ghana. The paper answers the following questions: (i) To what extent are Ghana's agriculture, energy, water, forest and wildlife sector policies aligned with climate adaptation, mitigation and development? (ii) What is the extent of policy coherence amongst climate-sensitive sector policies? (iii) Where are the key intervention points available to enhance CCD activities? Findings demonstrate that Ghana's climate-sensitive sector policies in agriculture, water, energy, forest and wildlife arenas have elements that demonstrate good alignment with adaptation, mitigation, and development priorities. However, as yet, there is only limited coherence between climate-sensitive sector policies. The paper identifies the following intervention points: (i) the need to attach greater importance to the threat posed by climate change to agriculture; and (ii) the need to address the lack of inter-agency and inter-ministerial approaches for building partnerships with other stakeholders. Multi-stakeholder workshop discussions highlighted significant challenges relating to limited coordination amongst institutions and agencies, limited institutional capacity and a lack of resources in ensuring coherence. This requires strengthening of national institutions such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide appropriate mechanisms to ensure effective collaboration amongst climate-sensitive sectors to deliver triple wins. The EPA could exert greater influence by nominating climate champions in sector ministries.","[Antwi-Agyei, Philip] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Sci, Dept Environm Sci, PMB, Univ PO, Kumasi, Ghana; [Dougill, Andrew J.; Stringer, Lindsay C.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Leeds,"Antwi-Agyei, P (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Sci, Dept Environm Sci, PMB, Univ PO, Kumasi, Ghana.",philiantwi@yahoo.com; a.j.dougill@leeds.ac.uk; l.stringer@leeds.ac.uk,"Antwi-Agyei, Philip/AAI-7392-2020","Antwi-Agyei, Philip/0000-0002-8599-474X","Department for International Development (DfID) under the Climate Impact Research Capacity and Leadership Enhancement (CIRCLE) programme; Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, the University of Leeds, UK [ES/K006576/1]; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish","Department for International Development (DfID) under the Climate Impact Research Capacity and Leadership Enhancement (CIRCLE) programme; Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, the University of Leeds, UK; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","This research is supported by funding from the Department for International Development (DfID) under the Climate Impact Research Capacity and Leadership Enhancement (CIRCLE) programme.

Previous studies, mainly based on theoretical models and remote sensing interpretation at regional scales, have revealed cropland expansion in high-altitude areas on the TP and identified the agro-pastoral transition zone as the major cropland expansion area. However, few studies have investigated whether farmers and herders reclaim cropland and which factors affect their reclamation decisions. This study aimed to investigate the impact of climate change on the decisions of farmers and herders regarding cropland reclamation in the eastern TP, with Zamtang County considered in a case study. By adopting the participatory rural appraisal method, data were collected from interviews with 169 households in Zamtang County, and the determinant factors of cropland reclamation decisions were examined with the assistance of a probit model. The results showed that (1) cropland reclamation increased from agricultural villages and agro-pastoral villages to pastoral villages with increasing altitude under the effects of climate warming and population pressure. Thus, this case study confirmed the findings of previous studies based on theoretical models and remote sensing interpretation. (2) The perception of changes in precipitation and spring frost, borrowed money, and government subsidies imposed significant negative effects on the reclamation decisions of farmers and herders. The income obtained from gathering Cordyceps fungi, distance from residence to town, and number of plots attained significant positive correlations with reclamation decisions. This study provides a reference for local governments regarding the implementation of measures to promote the livelihood transition of farmers and herders, which could help relieve population pressure and reduce the ecological risks related to cropland reclamation.","[Wu, Shihai; Yan, Jianzhong; Yang, Liu; Cheng, Xian; Wu, Ya] Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Chongqing 400716, Peoples R China",Southwest University - China,"Yan, JZ (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Chongqing 400716, Peoples R China.",yanjzswu@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571093, 41761144081]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program [2019QZKK0603]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41571093, 41761144081) and the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (No. 2019QZKK0603).",,103,6,6,11,97,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

In this paper, we investigate how changes in mean values and variability of weather variables may affect rice yield using panel data for 30 districts of Tamil Nadu State from 1971 to 2018. We estimate a fixed-effects regression model with panel-corrected standard errors. Results show that rainfall and temperature have a statistically significant impact on rice yield. Furthermore, weather variability, measured as standard deviations of temperature and rainfall, has a negative effect on rice yields. We use the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project-5 outputs and dynamically downscaled the weather outputs using the regional climate model. The results of the climate model showed that the rise in temperature and disruptions in rainfall patterns including both excessive and deficient rainfall events in Tamil Nadu will continue in the future under different climate scenarios. Projected changes in the weather variables are likely to decrease rice yield in Tamil Nadu from 0.7 to 6.3% under the low emission scenario and 4.1 to 20.1% in the high emission scenario during 2022-2050 (relative to 1971-2018).

The current study attempts to develop an alternative approach to classify the shifting cultivation areas using an ensemble technique, integrating multiple spectral indices in three states of northeast India (NEI), such as Assam, Manipur, and Meghalaya. The adopted approach integrates green cover and leaf water content changes during shifting cultivation land preparation in Landsat imagery. The deforested burned area patches were identified based on threshold values using Landsat data-derived indices on vegetation, burned area and leaf water, and digital elevation model (DEM). The ensemble approach provided shifting cultivation maps with good overall accuracy (> 83%). The maximum shifting cultivation area was observed in Assam (126.87 km(2)), followed by Meghalaya (51.53 km(2)) and Manipur (46.04 km(2)) in 2016. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and NDVI difference performed better than other vegetation indices. The ensemble approach can be applied in other regions with minor modifications in threshold values, thus having the potential for accounting to shifting cultivation dynamics on an operational basis. Future research may include blending local traditional knowledge and modern scientific solutions for improved forest and land resources planning for the benefit of inhabitants and the mountain environment under the climate change scenarios.","[Das, Pulakesh] World Resources Inst India, Sustainable Landscape & Restorat, New Delhi 110016, India; [Behera, Mukunda Dev; Mudi, Sujoy; Jagadish, Buddolla] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Ctr Oceans Rivers Atmosphere & Land Sci, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Barik, Saroj Kanta; Adhikari, Dibyendu; Behera, Soumit Kumar; Chauhan, Puneet Singh] Natl Bot Res Inst, Lucknow 226001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Sarkar, Swarup] Vidyasagar Univ, Dept Remote Sensing & GIS, Midnapore 721102, India; [Joshi, Santa Ram] North Eastern Hill Univ, Dept Biotechnol & Bioinformat, Shillong 793022, Meghalaya, India; [Sarma, Kiranmay] GGS Indraprastha Univ, Univ Sch Environm Management, New Delhi 110078, India; [Srivastava, Prashant Kumar] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI); Vidyasagar University; North Eastern Hill University; GGS Indraprastha University; Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Behera, MD (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Ctr Oceans Rivers Atmosphere & Land Sci, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",mdbehera@coral.iitkgp.ac.in,"Das, Pulakesh/AAV-4225-2021; BARIK, SAROJ KANTA/ADR-1820-2022","Das, Pulakesh/0000-0002-0508-7219; BARIK, SAROJ KANTA/0000-0002-1795-9539","National Mission on Himalayan Studies (Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change [MoEF CC], India) [NMHS/LG-2016/005]","National Mission on Himalayan Studies (Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change [MoEF CC], India)","This work was funded by the National Mission on Himalayan Studies (Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change [MoEF & CC], India), Grant No. NMHS/LG-2016/005.",,39,4,4,0,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2666-7193,,TREES FOREST PEOPLE,Trees For.

But what is it that is understood by climate change, and by whom? What frame of reference is drawn upon to communicate meaningfully about climate change? Do particular subgroups within our society hold different understandings, or have the debate and the prolific dissemination of information about this issue coalesced around a core perception or image of what climate change is? To answer these questions, we conceptualized climate change within the theory of social representations as emergent socially constructed knowledge. We analyzed word association data collected in Australia from persons identifying as having a scientific, government, or general public background (N = 3300). All respondents were asked to write the first words that came to mind when they thought about climate change. Comparative analyses of the word associations reveal that respondents from different backgrounds define climate change in different ways. The results suggest that there is a common core set of concepts shared by the different groups, but there are also a great many differences in how climate change is framed and conceived by respondents. The results are discussed in relation to what they imply for responses to climate change by these social groups and in relation to interventions designed to encourage climate adaptation.","[Moloney, Gail] So Cross Univ, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia; [Leviston, Zoe; Price, Jennifer; Stone-Jovicich, Samantha; Blair, Duncan] CSIRO, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Lynam, Timothy] CSIRO, Social & Econ Sci Program, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Southern Cross University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Moloney, G (corresponding author), So Cross Univ, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia.",,"Stone-Jovicich, Samantha/G-3689-2011; Leviston, Zoe/G-5460-2010; Blair, Duncan/G-2026-2014; Price, Jennifer C/D-3004-2011; Moloney, Gail/P-4631-2015","Stone-Jovicich, Samantha/0000-0003-0839-0333; Leviston, Zoe/0000-0002-4969-7916; Blair, Duncan/0000-0002-1654-9511; Price, Jennifer C/0000-0001-9252-399X; Moloney, Gail/0000-0002-3022-9637",Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and their Climate Adaptation Flagship,Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and their Climate Adaptation Flagship,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and their Climate Adaptation Flagship.

This makes sense because society's main challenge in an altering the environment is to adapt to the inevitable changes. However, applying the concept of resilience to devise adaptation strategies reveals that social-ecological resilience acquires different meanings depending on the social context. There is no straightforward application of resilience. In this contribution, it will be argued that giving meaning to the concept of resilience in adaptation strategies requires making normative choices. These choices concern whether there is a public interest in adaptation, the distribution of private and public responsibilities, and striking a balance between individual rights and general interests. Because these normative choices can be questioned and revised, it is important that they are made explicit to enable a democratic debate on the direction that adaptation strategies should take. Simply referring to the concept of resilience in an adaptation strategy does not suffice, but occludes this discussion. Through formulating and applying a condensed scheme of politico-theoretical approaches that underpin diverging adaptation approaches, this contribution reveals the various underlying normative assumptions and explicates the relevant political choices. Three Dutch adaptation strategies serve as empirical examples. They illustrate the importance of the societal context in giving meaning to resilience in the development of adaptation strategies.","[Keessen, Andrea M.; Van Rijswick, Helena F. M.

In this study, areas with climatic conditions suitable for sustaining permafrost in the Daisetsu Mountains are projected using bias-corrected and downscaled climate model outputs and statistical relationships between surface air temperatures and permafrost areas. Using freezing and thawing indices, the size of the area in the Daisetsu Mountains where climatic conditions were suitable for permafrost were estimated to be approximately 150 km(2) in 2010. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, this area is projected to decrease to about 30 km(2) by 2050 and it is projected to disappear by around 2070. Under the RCP2.6 scenario, the area is projected to decrease to approximately 20 km(2) by 2100. The degradation of mountain permafrost could potentially affect the stability of trekking trails due to slope displacement, and it may also have deleterious effects on current alpine ecosystems. It is therefore important to accurately monitor changes in the mountain ecosystem environment and to implement measures to adapt to an environment that is projected to change significantly in the future.","[Yokohata, Tokuta; Iwahana, Go; Uchida, Masao] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Earth Syst Div, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Iwahana, Go] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Sone, Toshio] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Saito, Kazuyuki] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Ishizaki, Noriko N.] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Kubo, Takahiro; Oguma, Hiroyuki] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Biodivers Div, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Kubo, Takahiro] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England; [Kubo, Takahiro] Durrell Inst Conservat & Ecol DICE, Sch Anthropol & Conservat, Canterbury, Kent, England",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; Hokkaido University; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; University of Oxford,"Yokohata, T (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Earth Syst Div, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.",yokohata@nies.go.jp,"Uchida, Masao/C-3673-2013; Yokohata, Tokuta/N-4540-2019","Yokohata, Tokuta/0000-0001-7346-7988","TOUGOU, the Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [JPMXD0717935715]; Climate Change Adaptation research programs at National Institute for Environmental Studies; JSPS KAKENHI [18H03353, 25350417]; Arctic Challenge for Sustainability II (ArCS II) [JPMXD1420318865]; Decarbonized and Sustainable Society Research Program at National Institute for Environmental Studies; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [18H03353] Funding Source: KAKEN","TOUGOU, the Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Climate Change Adaptation research programs at National Institute for Environmental Studies; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Arctic Challenge for Sustainability II (ArCS II); Decarbonized and Sustainable Society Research Program at National Institute for Environmental Studies; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We gratefully acknowledge helpful discussions with Dr. Kiyoshi Takahashi.

The nonparametric statistical Mann-Kendall (MK), Sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) test, Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF), and Probability Distribution Function (PDF) were used to determine the spatiotemporal monsoon precipitation trends and variability over the study period. The results show that higher precipitation occurs during June, July and August (peak monsoon period), while low precipitation was detected in May (onset month), September and October (withdrawal monsoon period), respectively. Moreover, abrupt change in precipitation is observed after 1990 with a significant (95% confidence level) increasing trend from 2000 to 2020. Decadal precipitation experienced the highest fluctuation during 2011-2020, a positive shift and increased frequency in recent decades. The spatial trends for monthly and seasonal precipitation vary from station to station and region to region due to a fluctuated shift of climatic dynamics. During dry conditions, less cloud liquid water suppressed relative humidity and high air temperature were exhibited, thus implying less precipitation in the region. However, the wet years revealed strong moisture/water vapour into the inland regions from the ocean, increased relative humidity, and suppressed air temperature. In addition, no significant relationship was found between El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and monsoon onset timing with precipitation variability over Myanmar.

Design: We use a framework for policy space analysis which distinguishes between policy context, process and characteristics. Setting: We focus on the Indian edible oils sector and on factors shaping the policy space at a national level. Participants: The study is based on the analysis of policy documents and semi-structured interviews with key experts and stakeholders in the edible oils sector. Results: We find opportunities associated with the emergence of multisectoral policy frameworks for climate adaptation and non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention at a national level which explicitly include the oils sector, the existence of structures for sectoral policy coordination, some supportive factors for the translation of nutrition evidence into practice, and the possibility of integrating nutrition-sensitive approaches within current state-led agricultural interventions. However, the trade-offs perceived across sustainability, NCD prevention and food security objectives in the vegetable oils sector are considered a barrier for policy influence and implementation. Sustainability and nutrition advocates tend to focus on different segments of the value chain, missing potential synergies. Moreover, policy priorities are dominated by historical concerns for food security, understood as energy provision, as well as economic and strategic priorities. Conclusions: Systematic efforts towards identifying synergistic approaches, from agricultural production to distribution of edible oils, as well as increased involvement of nutrition advocates with upstream policies in the oils sector, could increase policy influence for advocates of both nutrition and sustainability.","[Cuevas, Soledad; Shankar, Bhavani] SOAS Univ London, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H OXG, England; [Cuevas, Soledad; Shankar, Bhavani] Leverhulme Ctr Integrat Res Agr & Hlth, London, England; [Downs, Shauna M.] Rutgers Sch Publ Hlth, Newark, NJ USA; [Ghosh-Jerath, Suparna; Aafrin] Indian Inst Publ Hlth Delhi, Publ Hlth Fdn India, Gurgaon, India",Public Health Foundation of India,"Cuevas, S (corresponding author), SOAS Univ London, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H OXG, England.;Cuevas, S (corresponding author), Leverhulme Ctr Integrat Res Agr & Hlth, London, England.",soledad.cuevas@soas.ac.uk,,"Downs, Shauna/0000-0003-2161-3343; Shankar, Bhavani/0000-0001-8102-321X; Cuevas Garcia-Dorado, Soledad/0000-0002-4897-5240","Wellcome Trust under its 'Our Planet, Our Health' initiative [103905/Z/14/Z]","Wellcome Trust under its 'Our Planet, Our Health' initiative","This research was funded by a grant from the Wellcome Trust (grant number 103905/Z/14/Z) under its 'Our Planet, Our Health' initiative.

This study was conducted to determine the influence of harvest date and hybrid maturity on the yield and quality of maize biomass for anaerobic methane production. In 2004 and 2005, maize hybrids of widely contrasting maturity were grown on a loamy sand soil (Haplic Luvisol) near Braunschweig, Germany. Whole-plant yield was determined several times after female flowering and the biomass analysed for nutrient composition. The specific methane yield (SMY) was measured using 201 batch digesters. In both experimental years, the late energy maize prototypes had a lower concentration of fat and protein, but higher concentration of ash, detergent fibre, and lignin as compared with the climatically adapted medium-early hybrids. Despite substantially different nutrient concentration among the maize hybrids, no clear-cut association existed between chemical composition and specific methane yield. Contrary to the medium-early hybrids, the late hybrids attained both maximum specific methane yield and maximum methane hectare yields at the final harvest date. In the very long growing season of 2004, the highest individual methane yield of 9370 N m(3) ha(-1) was obtained by the hybrid with the latest maturity used in the study. It appears that late energy maize, which can take full advantage of the growing season, is better suited for biogas production, provided that the whole-plant dry matter concentration is high enough to produce good quality silage.

To face increasing coastal risks, various adaptation options are considered by atoll countries and territories, including in particular hard protection (preferred option to date), Nature-based Solutions (increasingly used) and island raising (considered a longer-term solution and a potential alternative to international migration, e.g. in the Maldives). Internal relocation within the same atoll island or atoll, which refers to long-term community movement from one threatened island area or island to a safer island area or island, has previously been disregarded by scholars as a potentially relevant climate adaptation strategy. However, in low-lying coastal areas, it offers real potential to address the dual context of increasing climate risks and the shrinking of the solution space. This paper assesses the potential of internal relocation for atolls by applying to Rangiroa Atoll, French Polynesia, Central Pacific, a two-fold assessment framework questioning its physical relevance (are some islands high enough to host settlements in the future?) and its societal feasibility (are the political-institutional and socio-economic conditions in place? Are people willing to relocate?). The findings show that internal relocation is both relevant and feasible on Rangiroa Atoll and should therefore serve as a pillar to develop robust in situ adaptation pathways in this atoll.","[Duvat, Virginie K.

The model uncertainty has been well represented by multi-model ensemble through the implementation of Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIPs). However, the uncertainty from internal variability is usually quantified by statistical fitting due to insufficient initial-condition ensembles for each global climate model (GCM), resulted in an underestimation of the uncertainty. In this study, Single Model Initial-condition Large Ensembles (SMILEs) that represent internal variability based on GCMs with different initial conditions, are combined with CMIP5 and CMIP6 GCMs to separate the uncertainty of seasonal soil drought projection over China. All three datasets show that internal variability dominates uncertainty for the near-term drought projection, and the internal variability uncertainty is exceeded by model uncertainty for the long-term projection. By using SMILEs as a benchmark, we revisit the method from Hawkins and Sutton (2009; hereafter, HS09) and find that this method performs well for drought projection at national scale over China. For drought projections at regional scale, however, HS09 method underestimates the uncertainty of internal variability for drought frequency, duration and intensity by 27%-54%, 15%-47% and 16%-31%, respectively. Our study highlights the importance of the selected approach for addressing the internal variability in the near-term projection of regional extremes and related adaptations.","[Chen, Sisi; Yuan, Xing] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Yuan, X (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xyuan@nuist.edu.cn,"Yuan, Xing/G-8392-2011","Yuan, Xing/0000-0001-6983-7368",NationalNatural Science Foundation of China [41875105]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFA0606002]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province for Distinguished Young Scholars [BK20211540],NationalNatural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province for Distinguished Young Scholars,"This work was supported by NationalNatural Science Foundation of China (41875105), National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFA0606002), and Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province for Distinguished Young Scholars (BK20211540).",,58,7,7,19,57,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

Human wellbeing is influenced by the heath of the environment through numerous pathways and is increasingly being included as a desired outcome in environmental management. However, the contributors to wellbeing can be subjective and the values and perspectives of decision-makers can affect the aspects of wellbeing that are included in planning. We used Q methodology to examine how a group of individuals in fisheries management prioritize components of wellbeing that may be important to coastal communities in the California Current social-ecological system (SES). The California Current SES is an integrated system of ecological and human communities with complex linkages and connections where commercial fishing is part of the culture and an important livelihood. We asked individuals that sit on advisory bodies to the Pacific Fisheries Management Council to rank 36 statements about coastal community wellbeing, ultimately revealing three discourses about how we can best support or improve wellbeing in those communities. We examine how the priorities differ between the discourses, identify areas of consensus, and discuss how these perspectives may influence decision-making when it comes to tradeoffs inherent in climate adaptation in fisheries. Lastly, we consider if and how thoughts about priorities have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.","[Nelson, Laura K.; Koehn, Laura E.; Levin, Phillip S.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bogeberg, Molly; Levin, Phillip S.] Nat Conservancy Washington, 74 Wall St, Seattle, WA 98121 USA; [Cullen, Alison] Univ Washington, Evans Sch Publ Policy, Box 353055, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Strawn, Astrea] Nat Conservancy Oregon, 821 SE 14th Ave, Portland, OR 97214 USA; [Levin, Phillip S.] Univ Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Box 355685, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Nature Conservancy; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Nature Conservancy; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Nelson, LK (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",lknelson@uw.edu; molly.bogeberg@tnc.org; alison@uw.edu; laura.koehn216@gmail.com; astrea.strawn@gmail.com; pslevin@uw.edu,"Nelson, Laura/HGT-9729-2022","Nelson, Laura/0000-0002-0085-7675; Cullen, Alison/0000-0003-2389-859X",Lenfest Ocean Program,Lenfest Ocean Program,This work was supported by the Lenfest Ocean Program.,,104,2,2,0,1,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1872-7859,2212-9790,,MARIT STUD,Marit.

Quantifying impacts of climate change on pavement service life can assist road authorities in planning for climate adaptation and, eventually, build climate resilience into road infrastructure design and management. In this study, a novel data-driven methodology is developed in order to quantify impacts of climate change on pavement service life in locations where Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) data are continuously measured, by means of: 1) training a supervised model (linear regression or Artificial Neural Networks, ANN) using historical climate data, maintenance, and traffic data as the candidate inputs and pavement layer stiffness back calculated from FWD testing as the outputs; 2) predicting layer stiffness using statistically downscaled future climate projections for three Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 global climate models and three greenhouse gas concentration scenarios for four future 20-year periods; and 3) estimating changes in pavement stiffness and service lives due to climate change. A case study performed on a pavement section in Minnesota has shown that pavement layer stiffness will have a long-term reduction under future climate and the investigated pavement will lose up to 22.5% service life at the end of the century (2080-2099) from the 20 years' service life compared to the baseline climate (1979-1998).","[Qiao, Yaning] China Univ Min & Technol, State Key Lab Geomech & Deep Underground Engn, Res Ctr Digitalized Construct & Knowledge Engn, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yang] Univ Nottingham, Inst Adv Mfg, Nottingham, England; [Zhu, Yuefeng] Shijiazhuang Tiedao Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat, Shaoxing, Peoples R China; [Lemkus, Trent] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Math & Stat, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Stoner, Anne M.

J,"Benjamin, L",,,,"Benjamin, Lisa",,,Group Companies and Climate Justice,CURRENT LEGAL PROBLEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,International law; institutional change; customary international law; subsequent practice; authority,LIMITED-LIABILITY,"A string of corporate litigation cases in the United Kingdom highlights the role of corporate group structures in complicating efforts to impose liability on parent companies for the activities of their subsidiaries, particularly where those subsidiaries are located in the Global South. Corporate group structures serve to insulate parent companies against liability for actions of their subsidiaries. This is the case even where economic benefits accrue to parent companies, which are often incorporated in the Global North. These group structures cabin liability for environmental and climate harms within subsidiary companies through reliance on company law principles such as limited liability and separate legal personality. These company law principles allow parent companies to enjoy corporate profits from the activities of their subsidiaries but disavow liability for any environmental damage resulting from such activities. This dichotomy has obvious equity implications, which are exacerbated in the extractive industries and in the context of climate change. Negative climate impacts are and will be felt predominantly in the Global South. In addition, environmental damage removes avenues of climate adaptation for vulnerable populations. But company law principles are not impervious to these equity challenges. These principles have never been absolute and courts have consistently found exceptions to them, although those exceptions have fluctuated in effectiveness and frequency over the years. Recent decisions by the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court in the United Kingdom imposed duties on parent companies for environmental damage caused by their subsidiaries. Cases following the decision in Chandler v Cape Industries illustrate tension between company law as interpreted in the Global North, and climate and environmental justice as experienced in the Global South. Climate change forces a reconceptualization of company law, including transnational corporate liability. This paper argues that these reconsiderations are not only appropriate, but given the contested histories of many of these companies in the Global South, long overdue.","[Benjamin, Lisa] Lewis & Clark Law Sch, Portland, OR 97219 USA",,"Benjamin, L (corresponding author), Lewis & Clark Law Sch, Portland, OR 97219 USA.",,,,,,,,99,1,1,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0070-1998,2044-8422,,CURR LEGAL PROBL,Curr.

Increasing population, urbanization and changing climatic patterns have great impact on urban water systems, such as surface and underground water resources. Although water insecurity is faced by all, population with lower socio-economic strata tend to be worst affected by the water woes. In this regard, it is imperative to assess water insecurity as sensitivity of residents towards water supply and management in the city at sub-administrative levels. The paper, thus, attempts to assess the rising water insecurity in Haldwani, a medium-sized city located on the foothills of Uttarakhand Himalayas (India), in conjugation with demographic and institutional water supply from the available secondary data sets. Using statistical and GIS-based spatial analysis, the study attempts to evolve a water sensitivity scale at ward level, simultaneously identifying lower socio-economic wards in the city through demographic sensitivity. The result is the delineation of those wards and population that show high water insecurity at the city's administrative level, thus aiding in further facilitation of equitable water management at the urban level. From the study, it is evident that marginal populations continue to face water stresses since they are highly dependent upon water and water supplied by the city is insufficient for their daily needs. These wards also show high demographic vulnerability with respect to low literacy and high unemployment rate. The city faces threats of climate change as well; decreasing precipitation as well as shifting hot months will further escalate the problem. A continuation of this trend will worsen the water security in the city making the marginal population most vulnerable to the foreseen risks. The paper, thus, elaborates a methodological approach to assess the municipal water supply along with demographic patterns to aid in equitable and climate-adaptive water management in the city.","[Habeeb, Riyan; Gupta, Yashi; Chinwan, Himanshu] Ctr Ecol Dev & Res CEDAR, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Barker, Elizabeth] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Habeeb, R (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol Dev & Res CEDAR, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India.",contact.riyan1001@gmail.com,"Habeeb, Riyan/GPC-7742-2022","Habeeb, Riyan/0000-0001-9705-7342",,,,,26,12,12,0,3,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2509-8810,2509-8829,,J GEOVIS SPAT ANAL,J.

Climate-induced changes in soil properties can lead to changes in soil functions and their importance for soil protection. These possible changes have been evaluated within the German part of the EU Interreg IVb project Climate Proof Areas in two pilot regions in the Wesermarsch (Germany). The evaluation of eight different soil sub-functions was carried out using the evaluation method TUSEC-B based on soil information gained from soil maps for present (Status Quo) and climate-adapted soil properties. Four different climate scenarios for 2050 were considered. The evaluation results of the individual soil functions have been summarized to an overall evaluation result using the maximum principle. The evaluation results for the Status Quo show that large areas of the pilot regions are important for soil protection regarding both the individual soil function evaluation and the summarized evaluation. The adaptation of climate-influenced evaluation parameters results in an increase of the importance of protection of the soils for some sub-regions and in a decrease for others, depending on the scenario. The differences in the extent and direction of changing evaluation results mainly depend on changes in soil organic matter content and groundwater level. They are different for the individual soil functions and regarding the overall evaluation result, but show the influence of climate change on soil functions. On the basis of these results, it is recommended to consider climate-induced changes in soil functions within spatial planning processes such as area-wide coastal protection or water management measures (e.g., dike or reservoir construction), to avoid the loss of soils with valuable functions that are worth protecting.","[Madena, Kirsten; Giani, Luise] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, WG Soil Sci Inst Biol & Environm Sci, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Bormans, Helge] Univ Siegen, Dept Civil Engn, D-57068 Siegen, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Universitat Siegen,"Madena, K (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, WG Soil Sci Inst Biol & Environm Sci, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",kirsten.madena@uni-oldenburg.de; helge.bormann@uni-siegen.de; luise.giani@uni-oklenburg.de,"Bormann, Helge/C-1880-2008","Bormann, Helge/0000-0001-7740-4554",European Union,European Union(European Commission),"The work presented here has been developed within the German part of the Interreg IVb (NSRP) project Climate Proof Areas funded by the European Union.

Current interventions are short-term and curative in nature, hence unsustainable. Some of the most arid and semi-arid lands are located within the Kenyan Rift system, which has an estimated geothermal potential of about 7000 to 10,000 MWe, out of which only 200 MWe has been developed, and about 5000 MWe planned by 2030. Recent power sector reforms have built institutional structures that will accelerate development of geothermal energy. The paper analyses the potential use of geothermal energy resources in eastern Baringo lowlands between Lake Bogoria and Silali prospects, which has an estimated potential of >2700 MWe, in creating the necessary adjustments needed to adapt to the impacts of recurrent droughts by locals. Opportunities for direct and indirect uses of geothermal energy exist in climate vulnerable sectors, such as, agriculture, fisheries, water, livestock production as well as alternative income generating activities such as, tourism, micro enterprises, aloe, honey and beeswax production, fabric dyeing and others using resources sourced from within a 50 km radius. The possibility of accelerated geothermal development and proposed utilisation schemes in causing maladaptation if unsustainably implemented is also discussed. The paper draws a Lindal diagram adapted to the study area showing potential utilisation in the above sectors, and new flow diagram showing potential for cascaded use of geothermal hot water through the different processes. An estimated capacity of 100 MWt and 100 MWe can be used in the potential utilisation schemes discussed in this article to meet local adaptation and lighting needs and much less in a cascaded process. Potential barriers and possible solutions are also discussed. The study concludes that geothermal energy is a vital option for adaptation in the study area if sustainably used. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Pakistan is one of the most important South Asian countries and has been affected tremendously through several impacts namely; temperature rise, drought, pest-diseases, health issues, seasonal and lifestyle change and it has the potential to continue doing so in future. We conducted a survey to explore the adaptation and mitigation alertness to climate change among all provinces and areas (urban, peri-urban and rural) of Pakistan from general public since they are directly affected by climate change. In Pakistan, climate change is essentially caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the foremost sources of rise in the GHG emissions are human activities, such as deforestation and emissions from various sectors; transportation, industrialization, urbanization, waste, agriculture livestock & forestry and energy usage. All of these have a significant impact on climate change in all areas and provinces. The study determines that all the areas in Pakistan played an increased role in climate change, but rural, peri-urban, and small cities turned out to be in worst situation due to lack of attention and ignorance. Datum produced from this study can pave a way for assisting in preparing, instructing, and guiding national and international decision makers in order to upgrade the levels of adaptation and mitigation policy making and its implementation in South Asia specially and at global scale generally.

To achieve these synergies, policies must target efforts to regions that best correspond with development objectives. This study designs a targeting strategy for irrigation expansion in southern Mexico-a region long considered to have strong potential for sustainable irrigation development. We use an integrated farm typology and decision tree approach to identify priority municipalities for irrigation expansion. We use multivariate statistics to examine the relationships among farm characteristics in 933 municipalities, classifying each according to four farm types: lowland, midland, midland-irrigated, and highland. We then partition municipalities into 11 farm-type subgroups, each ranked by priority level for receiving irrigation interventions following Mexico's National Water Program guidelines. Results identify a 'highest-priority' subgroup of 73 municipalities comprised mostly of midland and highland farm types. These types are characterized by low irrigation use, small farmland areas, high vulnerability to climate, high marginalization (poverty), strong representation from indigenous communities, low maize yield, and high rates of subsistence production. Findings provide a crucial first approximation of where irrigation expansion would best address water policy priorities and sustainable development objectives in southern Mexico. This study also provides a useful framework for scaling organizations tasked with targeting development efforts across large spatial scales.","[LaFevor, Matthew C.; Frake, April N.] Univ Alabama, Dept Geog, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Frake, April N.] Michigan State Univ, Ctr Global Change & Earth Observat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Couturier, Stephane] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Geog, Lab Anal Geoespacial LAGE, Ciudad Univ,Apdo Postal 20850, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Couturier, Stephane] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Complejidad, Res Ctr Complex Sci, C3, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; Michigan State University; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"LaFevor, MC (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Geog, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",mclafevor@ua.edu; afrake@ua.edu; andres@igg.unam.mx,,"LaFevor, Matthew/0000-0002-0988-4768",,,,,81,5,5,3,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2021,13,17,,,,,,,2393,10.3390/w13172393,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13172393,,,18,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,UO3CD,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000694574700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aims of this study were (1) to develop a participatory approach for identifying and evaluating management options for river basin climate adaptation and (2) to apply and evaluate the approach in four case-study river basins across the Mediterranean. As part of the approach, a diverse group of stakeholders joined a series of workshops and consultations in four river basins located in Cyprus, Slovenia, Spain and Tunisia. In each river basin, stakeholders expressed their views on challenges in their river basins, as well as options to tackle these challenges. We used the information on challenges, as well as the factors contributing to these challenges to develop a fuzzy cognitive map for each basin. These maps were converted into mathematical models and were used to assess the impact of a total of 102 suggested management options for the four river basins. We linked the options and their estimated impacts with a multi-criteria analysis to identify the most preferred options. The approach was positively evaluated by the participating stakeholders and allowed the link of stakeholders' knowledge and perceptions about their river basin with their preferences for options to adapt the management of their river basins to future conditions.","[Verkerk, Pieter Johannes; de Arano, Inazio Martinez; Robert, Nicolas; Varela, Elsa] European Forest Inst, Mediterranean Reg Off, St Antoni M Claret 167, Barcelona 08025, Spain; [Sanchez, Anabel; Broekman, Annelies] Ctr Ecol Res & Forestry Applicat, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Libbrecht, Steven] Prospex Bvba, Vlugestal 6, B-3140 Keerbergen, Belgium; [Bruggeman, Adriana; Giannakis, Elias; Zoumides, Christos] Cyprus Inst, Energy Environm & Water Res Ctr, 20 Konstantinou Kavafi St, CY-2121 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Daly-Hassen, Hamed; Jebari, Sihem] Natl Res Inst Rural Engn Water & Forests, Rue Hedi Karray, Ariana 2080, Tunisia; [Kok, Kasper] Wageningen Univ, Soil Geog & Landscape Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Klemencic, Aleksandra Krivograd; Magjar, Manca; Smolar-Zvanut, Natasa] Inst Water Republ Slovenia, Dunajska Cesta 156, SI-1121 Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Klemencic, Aleksandra Krivograd] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Civil & Geodet Engn, Jamova 2, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia",Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Universite de Carthage; Wageningen University & Research; University of Ljubljana,"Verkerk, PJ (corresponding author), European Forest Inst, Mediterranean Reg Off, St Antoni M Claret 167, Barcelona 08025, Spain.",hans.verkerk@efi.int; anabel@creaf.uab.es; steven.libbrecht@prospex.com; a.broekman@creaf.uab.cat; a.bruggeman@cyi.ac.cy; dalyhassen.hamed@iresa.agrinet.tn; e.giannakis@cyi.ac.cy; sihem.jebari@gmail.com; kasper.kok@wur.nl; aleksandra.krivograd-klemencic@fgg.uni-lj.si; manca.magjar@gmail.com; inazio.martinez@efi.int; nicolas.robert@gmx.net; natasa.smolar-zvanut@gov.si; elsa.varela@upc.edu; c.zoumides@cyi.ac.cy,"Varela, Elsa/GQH-7805-2022; Daly-Hassen, Hamed/ABF-8116-2020; Bruggeman, Adriana/J-6345-2013; Giannakis, Elias/AAU-5598-2020; varela, elsa/B-3928-2017; Zoumides, Christos/M-9586-2018","Varela, Elsa/0000-0001-9312-6187; Daly-Hassen, Hamed/0000-0001-8712-6252; Bruggeman, Adriana/0000-0002-6475-5221; Giannakis, Elias/0000-0002-1779-9811; varela, elsa/0000-0001-9312-6187; Zoumides, Christos/0000-0003-0998-3878; Broekman, Annelies/0000-0002-8961-0467; Verkerk, Pieter Johannes/0000-0001-5322-8007; Sanchez-Plaza, Anabel/0000-0001-6676-5119; Kok, Kasper/0000-0002-6319-9227",EU [612385],EU(European Commission),"This work has been funded through the EU 7th framework project BeWater (grant agreement 612385).

Successful climate adaptation and sustainable forest management require a better understanding of the interactions between hydrology, climate, and vegetation. This paper provides a perspective on the changing water cycle in the BPE from an interdisciplinary team of researchers, seeking to identify the critical knowledge gaps. Our review suggests the BPE will likely become drier and undergo more frequent disturbance and shifts in vegetation. The forest will contract to the north, though the southern boundary of the ecotone will remain in place. We expect detrimental impacts on carbon sequestration, water quality, wildlife, and water supplies. Ecosystem interactions are complex, and many processes are affected differently by warming and drying, thus the degree and direction of change is often uncertain. However, in the short term at least, human activities are the dominant source of change and are unpredictable but likely decisive. Current climate, hydrological, and ecological monitoring in the BPE are limited and inadequate to understand and predict the complex responses of the BPE to human activities and climate change. This paper provides a case study of how hydrological processes critically determine ecosystem functioning, and how our ability to predict system response is limited by our ability to predict changing hydrology.

The data was collected between October 2019 and February 2020 using an online questionnaire. We invited 10289 households to participate and received 939 responses. The online questionnaire consisted of two main parts - (1) an online choice experiment and (2) questions on the sociodemographic characteristics of the responding households. The choice experiment confronted households with twelve consecutive choice tasks. Each choice task consisted of three options with a varying degree of avalanche and rock fall risk reduction due to improved forest management. The options further differed with respect to the way the charges for the improved forest management are determined and assigned to the households. We additionally included a cost attribute to estimate the respondents' willingness to pay. At the end of the choice experiment we asked five de-briefing questions and eight attitudinal questions. Additionally, we asked the responding households to state their willingness to take risks. The sociodemographic characteristics collected in the second part of the questionnaire allowed us to analyse their impact on the choices we observed in the first part of the questionnaire.

Climate change (CC) may lead to new trade-offs between agricultural functions or aggravate existing ones, but suitable agricultural management may maintain or even improve the ability of agroecosystems to supply these functions. Hence, it is necessary to identify relevant drivers (e. g., cropping practices, local conditions) and their interactions, and how they affect agricultural functions in a changing climate. The goal of this study was to use a modeling framework to analyze the sensitivity of indicators of three important agricultural functions, namely crop yield (food and fiber production function), soil erosion (soil conservation function), and nutrient leaching (clean water provision function), to a wide range of agricultural practices for current and future climate conditions. In a two-step approach, cropping practices that explain high proportions of variance of the different indicators were first identified by an analysis of variance-based sensitivity analysis. Then, most suitable combinations of practices to achieve best performance with respect to each indicator were extracted, and trade-offs were analyzed. The procedure was applied to a region in western Switzerland, considering two different soil types to test the importance of local environmental constraints. Results show that the sensitivity of crop yield and soil erosion due to management is high, while nutrient leaching mostly depends on soil type. We found that the influence of most agricultural practices does not change significantly with CC; only irrigation becomes more relevant as a consequence of decreasing summer rainfall. Trade-offs were identified when focusing on best performances of each indicator separately, and these were amplified under CC. For adaptation to CC in the selected study region, conservation soil management and the use of cropped grasslands appear to be the most suitable options to avoid tradeoffs.","[Klein, Tommy; Holzkaemper, Annelie; Calanca, Pierluigi; Fuhrer, Juerg] Agroscope Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Klein, Tommy; Holzkaemper, Annelie; Calanca, Pierluigi; Fuhrer, Juerg] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; University of Bern,"Klein, T (corresponding author), Agroscope Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",tommy.klein@alumni.ulg.ac.be,,"Calanca, Pierluigi/0000-0003-3113-2885",Swiss National Science Foundation [NRP61]; EU [505539],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); EU(European Commission),This study was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation in framework of the National Research Program NRP61.

J,"Everard, M",,,,"Everard, Mark",,,"Managing socio-ecological systems: who, what and how much? The case of the Banas river, Rajasthan, India",CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY,,,English,Review,,,,,,,SCIENCE; CATCHMENT; FRAMEWORK; ECONOMICS; SERVICES,"Addressing socio-ecological linkages is essential for diagnosing and proposing solutions to complex sustainability challenges, such as river-basin management, climate adaptation and broader sustainability problems. 'Who?' is integral to an inclusive approach, 'What?' dimensions of supportive ecosystems are included, and 'How much?' of the value of ecosystem services informs management decisions? In complex systems, such as catchments, these questions have to be addressed within inclusive governance arrangements, shaping technology choices and affecting societal and ecosystem outcomes. Historic communal water stewardship in the Banas catchment (Rajasthan, India) balanced the recharge of groundwater from monsoon runoff with its exploitation for irrigation and other uses. However, contemporary mechanised extraction of groundwater, and dam-based and other transfer schemes moving water out-of-catchment to urban, agricultural and other intensive users, now favours influential sectors of society. These intensive water management measures also deplete groundwater, prioritising immediate benefits whilst undermining the vitality and functioning of supporting ecosystems. This creates a degenerative cycle within the socio-ecological system, though this may be reversed with the development of governance systems based on a systemic overview of whole-system functioning. Sustainable stewardship, as practiced historically, needs to be adapted to contemporary conditions by emphasising connections amongst all stakeholders, the foundational capital of overall catchment functioning, and net societal and ecosystem benefits.","[Everard, Mark] Univ West England UWE, Coldharbour Lane,Frenchay Campus, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",University of West England,"Everard, M (corresponding author), Univ West England UWE, Coldharbour Lane,Frenchay Campus, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",mark.everard@uwe.ac.uk,,,Lloyd's Register Foundation,Lloyd's Register Foundation,"The author is grateful for co-funding by Lloyd's Register Foundation, a charitable foundation helping to protect life and property by supporting engineering-related education, public engagement and the application of research.",,46,3,4,2,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1877-3435,1877-3443,,CURR OPIN ENV SUST,Curr.

Characterizing the climatic zones allows estimation of energy requirements in buildings and develop climate adapted energy polices. Climatic zones can be defined by using the statistical cluster analysis. Data from weather stations can be used after standardization with zero mean and unit variance, to confirm that all variables are weighted equally in the cluster analysis. In this paper, a novel atlas for 19 climatic zones is presented that represent a variety of bioclimatic design strategies and recommendations, for passive design, based on a clustering analysis in Iran. The clustering analysis is based on the statistical analysis of daily temperature and relative humidity from 1995 to 2014. The results visualize 19 different climate zones for Iran and indicate the dominance of passive design strategies. As a result, Iran was divided into eight climatic clusters. The results showed that each of the studied clusters require specific strategies in providing indoor comfort. The outputs of this study shed the light on the importance of up-to-date climate characterization and the effectiveness of climate mapping and recommendations to inform decision makers.","[Roshan, Gholamreza] Golestan Univ, Dept Geog, Gorgan, Golestan, Iran; [Farrokhzad, Mohammad] Golestan Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Architecture, Gorgan, Golestan, Iran; [Attia, Shady] Univ Liege, Fac Appl Sci, Dept UEE, Sustainable Bldg Design Lab, Liege, Belgium",University of Liege,"Farrokhzad, M (corresponding author), Golestan Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Architecture, Gorgan, Golestan, Iran.",m.farrokhzad@gu.ac.ir,"Attia, Shady/M-4942-2013","Attia, Shady/0000-0002-9477-5098",Council of Iran National Science Foundation,Council of Iran National Science Foundation,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The work was partially supported by the Council of Iran National Science Foundation under grant No. 96005935.

In addition to quantification of risk today, the role of aggravating factors such as high population growth and changing climate conditions matters, too. We present the open-source software CLIMADA (CLIMate ADAptation), which integrates hazard, exposure, and vulnerability to compute the necessary metrics to assess risk and to quantify socio-economic impact. The software design is modular and object oriented, offering a simple collaborative framework and a parallelization strategy which allows for scalable computations on clusters. CLIMADA supports multi-hazard calculations and provides an event-based probabilistic approach that is globally consistent for a wide range of resolutions, suitable for whole-country to detailed local studies. This paper uses the platform to estimate and contextualize the damage of hurricane Irma in the Caribbean in 2017. Most of the affected islands are non-sovereign countries and also rely on overseas support in case disaster strikes. The risk assessment performed for this region, based on remotely available data available shortly before or hours after landfall of Irma, proves to be close to reported damage and hence demonstrates a method to provide readily available impact estimates and associated uncertainties in real time.","[Aznar-Siguan, Gabriela; Bresch, David N.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Zurich, Switzerland; [Aznar-Siguan, Gabriela; Bresch, David N.] Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss),"Aznar-Siguan, G (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Zurich, Switzerland.;Aznar-Siguan, G (corresponding author), Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, Zurich, Switzerland.",aznarsig@ethz.com,"Bresch, David N./D-5298-2018","Bresch, David N./0000-0002-8431-4263",,,,,42,32,32,0,4,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

However, little attention has been paid to how policy experiments, a flexible and ex ante method of policy appraisal, obtain influence over political decision-making. To address this gap, an exploratory framework has been developed that facilitates systematic analysis of multiple experiments, allowing hypotheses to be tested regarding how an experiment's institutional design can influence the views of political decision-makers. Cash's categories of effectiveness are used to describe an experiment's conceptual influence; being how credible, salient, and legitimate decision-makers perceive an experiment to be. The hypotheses are tested using 14 experiment cases found relevant to climate adaptation in the Netherlands, with complete survey responses from over 70 respondents. The results show that although, in general, the experiments had medium to high influence on decision-makers, institutional design does have a noticeable impact. Organisers should make choices carefully when designing an experiment, particularly in order to maintain relevance during an experiment's implementation and to build community acceptance. Suggestions for future research include a comparison of experiment effects with the effects of non-experimental forms of appraisal, such as piloting or ex ante impact assessment.","[McFadgen, Belinda] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, De Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Huitema, Dave] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Environm Policy Anal, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Huitema, Dave] Netherlands Open Univ, Dept Sci, Fac Management Sci & Technol, Valkenburgerweg 177, NL-6419 AT Heerlen, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Open University Netherlands,"McFadgen, B (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, De Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",belinda.mcfadgen@vu.nl; dave.huitema@ivm.vu.nl,,"Huitema, D./0000-0002-0139-3913",Knowledge for Climate Change Programme of the Netherlands' Government,Knowledge for Climate Change Programme of the Netherlands' Government,The authors wish to acknowledge the support of the Knowledge for Climate Change Programme of the Netherlands' Government.,,44,16,16,4,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-2687,1573-0891,,POLICY SCI,Policy Sci.,JUN,2018,51,2,,,SI,,161,187,,10.1007/s11077-017-9276-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11077-017-9276-2,,,27,"Public Administration; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,GI5BY,31007287,"hybrid, Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000434387100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

We focus on results typical for environmental fluid mechanics studies at a city scale that include characteristic wind flow patterns and dispersion of reactive scalars. This is achieved by developing a code based on the Java language, which converts the typical four-dimensional structure (spatial and temporal dependency) of data results in the Keyhole Markup Language (KML) format. The visualization techniques most often used are revisited and implemented into the conversion tool. The potential of the tool is demonstrated in a case study of smog formation due to an intense traffic emission in Rotterdam (The Netherlands). It is shown that the Google Earth can provide a computationally efficient and user-friendly means of data representation. This feature can be very useful for visualization of pollution at street levels, which is of great importance for the city residents.

The model-based HRES consists of solar photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, and battery banks with grid connectivity. Three scenarios, 101 sub-scenarios, and three management cases were defined to optimally design the system using a novel dual-scale optimization approach. At the system scale, the power-pinch analysis was applied to minimize both the size of components and the outsourced needed electricity (NE) from Vietnam's electrical grid. At a local-scale, economic and environmental models were integrated, and the system was graphically optimized using a novel objective function, combined enviro-economic costs (CEECs). The results showed that the optimal CEECs were $850,710/year, $1,030,628/year, and $1,693,476/year for the management cases under good, moderate, and unhealthy air qualities, respectively. The smallest CEEC was obtained when 47% of the demand load of the membrane bioreactor was met using the HRES and the rest was supplied by the grid, resulting in 6,800,769 kg/year of CO2 emissions.","[Tuan-Viet Hoang; Ifaei, Pouya; Nam, Kijeon; Rashidi, Jouan; Hwangbo, Soonho; Oh, Jong-Min; Yoo, ChangKyoo] Kyung Hee Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Deptartment Environm Sci & Engn, Coll Engn, Seocheon Dong 1, Yongin 446701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Hwangbo, Soonho] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Proc & Syst Engn Ctr PROSYS, Soltofts Plads 229, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Kyung Hee University; Technical University of Denmark,"Hwangbo, S; Yoo, C (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Deptartment Environm Sci & Engn, Coll Engn, Seocheon Dong 1, Yongin 446701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.;Hwangbo, S (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Proc & Syst Engn Ctr PROSYS, Soltofts Plads 229, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",tuanvietxda@gmail.com; pooya_if@hotmail.com; spirit1058@gmail.com; Jouanra@gmail.com; hwsoonho@gmail.com; jmoh@khu.ac.kr; ckyoo@khu.ac.kr,"Hwangbo, Soonho/AAA-2827-2021; 유, 창규/AAJ-1226-2020; Ifaei, Pouya/AAD-8907-2019","Ifaei, Pouya/0000-0002-6898-8583; Yoo, ChangKyoo/0000-0002-9406-7649; Hwangbo, Soonho/0000-0003-2208-9301","Development of algae management using stream structures in the stream - MOLIT (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport) [18AWMP-B098640-04]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [NRF-2017R1E1A1A03070713]; Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) as Graduate School specialized in Climate Change","Development of algae management using stream structures in the stream - MOLIT (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT); Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) as Graduate School specialized in Climate Change","This subject was supported by Development of algae management using stream structures in the stream (code 18AWMP-B098640-04) funded by MOLIT (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport).

The thermodynamic reactions of two BiPV facade concepts were comparatively studied using two simulation domains: building energy simulations and computational fluid dynamics. The reliability of the theoretical methods was also evaluated. Good agreement between the simulation results and experimental data was noted through dynamic outdoor tests, empirically val-idating the study; standard statistical indicators were calculated and employed to assess the consistency between the experimental and simulation results. The used numerical approach can reliably predict the thermo-responsive capabilities of PCM-based BiPV facades with respect to the overall tendencies. The parameter variation techniques revealed modifications in the overall thermal and energy performance of the facade system. The most undesirable instance of overheating was predicted when using RT27; therefore, the PCM is considered inappropriate in this case. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

For example, about USD 900 billion should be invested annually in the energy sector up to 2030 to meet this target. Climate finance provides opportunities for investments in climate-smart projects. Such investments could enhance Africa's adaptive capacity, food security and economic growth. Nonetheless, Africa lags behind in the access and utilisation of these funds. Climate finance readiness plays a major role in enhancing access to these funds. This paper analyses policy and institutional frameworks that would enhance Kenya's readiness for climate finance. Publicly available scholarly articles, government and development partners reports were profiled using the following key words: Kenya, climate change, climate mitigation and climate adaptation. Then the keywords; climate finance, climate policy and legislation were used to identify the most relevant publications. These were reviewed to assess Kenya's readiness for climate finance. The study finds that considerable efforts have been made to enhance Kenya's readiness for climate finance as evidenced by the formulation of climate-related policies, legislation and the creation of institutions tasked to address climate change. Nonetheless, some policy areas could be enhanced. For instance, the role of the private sector could be better recognised and supported. This study provides an important reference for the government, development partners and private sector involved in negotiations and decision making on climate financing in Kenya.","[Kiremu, Mercy] Western Inst Technol Taranaki, Sch Maori Enterprise Business & Technol, New Plymouth, New Zealand; [Scrimgeour, Frank] Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Mutegi, James] African Plant Nutr Inst, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mumo, Richard] Botswana Int Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math & Stat Sci, Palapye, Botswana",University of Waikato,"Kiremu, M (corresponding author), Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Res Ctr Environm & Hlth, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",kangaikiremu@gmail.com,"Scrimgeour, Frank/G-3474-2013","Scrimgeour, Frank/0000-0002-9409-7143; MUMO, Richard/0000-0003-2309-2609; Kiremu, Mercy Kangai Gatabi/0000-0002-6967-9635",,,,,31,1,1,9,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2765-8511,,,SUSTAIN ENVIRON,Sustain.

Claiming to be transformative and pluralistic, NbS aim to resolve societal problems through a focus on nature, which is understood to be a benign ally. This uncritical framing of nature may have unintended and inequitable consequences that undermine the emancipatory potential of NbS. In this paper, we highlight the need to pay attention to epistemic and power dimensions that tend to be hidden in NbS. We assume that nature is neither passive nor external to human society, but is instead expressed in frames (reifying modes of expression) that reflect both knowledge and power in social encounters where NbS are used. Drawing upon five cases, we analyse how particular ways of framing nature express and reinforce the power relations that structure people's interactions. Each of the five cases relies on a nature-based frame to produce knowledge on climate adaptation, peacebuilding and justice. The analysis reveals how frames of nature are enacted in particular contexts, and how this conditions the potential for societal transformation towards sustainability and pluralistic knowledge. We demonstrate how frames of nature can constrain or enable opportunities for various groups to respond to environmental change. We discuss how the NbS paradigm might better incorporate diverse, situated knowledge and subjectivities, and conclude that this will require a more critical evaluation of NbS practice and research.","[Woroniecki, Stephen] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies TEMA, Environm Change Unit TEMAM, Linkoping, Sweden; [Brink, Ebba; Islar, Mine; Krause, Torsten; Vargas, Ana-Maria] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden; [Wendo, Hausner] Adaptat Consortium, Nairobi, Kenya; [Vargas, Ana-Maria] Swedish Int Ctr Local Democracy, Visby, Gotland, Sweden; [Mahmoud, Yahia] Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, Lund, Sweden",Linkoping University; Lund University; Lund University,"Woroniecki, S (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies TEMA, Environm Change Unit TEMAM, Linkoping, Sweden.",stephen.woroniecki@liu.se,"Vargas, Ana/GSE-1963-2022","Woroniecki, Stephen/0000-0003-1894-2859; Brink, Ebba/0000-0001-5865-2536",,,,,142,27,27,2,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

Unprecedented climate variability is interacting with long-term trends, all against a backdrop of rising anthropogenic use of marine space. The growth of maritime activities is taking place without the full understanding of complex interactions between natural and human-induced changes, leading to a progressive decline of biodiversity and degradation of marine ecosystems. Against this complex interplay, marine managers and policy makers are increasingly calling for new approaches and tools allowing a multi-scenario assessment of environmental impacts arising from the complex interaction between natural and anthropogenic drivers, also in consideration of multiple marine plans objectives. Responding to this need, for the Adriatic Sea we developed a GIS-based Bayesian Network to evaluate the probability (and related uncertainty) of cumulative impacts under four 'what-if' scenarios representing different marine management options and climate conditions. We addressed issues concerning consequences of potential planning measures, as well as management programmes required to achieve environmental status targets, as required by relevant EU acquis. Results from the scenario analysis highlighted that an integrated approach to maritime spatial planning is required, combining more sustainable management options of marine spaces and resources with climate adaptation strategies. This approach to planning would allow to reduce human pressures on the marine environment and rise resilience of natural ecosystems to climate and human-induced disturbances, which would result in an overall decrease of cumulative impacts.

Long-term climate adaptation in these regions has received increasing attention, with recent initiatives aiming to increase resilience to climate change at timescales of years to decades. Less focus has been given to weather and short-term climate information. However, users are principally interested in shorter timescales (hours to seasons) where actions can immediately reduce the impacts of severe weather events. Focusing on the priority sectors of agriculture and food security, water and disaster management, this paper uses a systematic literature review approach to analyse 61 empirical case studies drawn from academic literature and projects across SSA. We identify the main users of climate services and outline current practices and reported benefits. Barriers that impede the delivery and uptake of climate services are identified and potential strategies for overcoming them outlined based on the reporting of successful practices. Our findings show that greater capacity building of personnel working for National Meteorological and Hydrological Services and Agricultural Extension staff and reinforcing and sustaining collaboration between different stakeholders (climate scientists, hydrologists, extension workers, farmers and other user groups), are essential factors for improving the uptake and utility of weather and climate services to enhance resilience to climate shocks in SSA.","[Nkiaka, Elias; Taylor, Andrea; Dougill, Andrew J.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Taylor, Andrea] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Antwi-Agyei, Philip] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Kumasi, Ghana; [Fournier, Nicolas; Ticehurst, Helen] Met Off, Fitzroy Rd, Exeter, Devon, England; [Bosire, Emily Nyaboke; Mutai, Bethwel] Univ Nairobi, Dept Meteorol, Nairobi, Kenya; [Konte, Oumar; Toure, Awa] Agence Natl Aviat Civile & Meteorol, Dakar, Senegal; [Lawal, Kamoru Abiodun] Nigerian Meteorol Agcy, Numer Weather & Climate Predict Unit, Abuja, Nigeria; [Mwangi, Emma] Kenya Meteorol Dept, Nairobi, Kenya; [Warnaars, Tanya] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Lancaster, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; Met Office - UK; University of Nairobi; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH),"Nkiaka, E (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",e.nkiaka@leeds.ac.uk,"Antwi-Agyei, Philip/AAI-7392-2020; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Antwi-Agyei, Philip/0000-0002-8599-474X; Mutai K, Bethwel/0000-0002-5627-564X; /0000-0001-5146-4946; Taylor, Andrea/0000-0002-8949-1234; Lawal, Kamoru Abiodun/0000-0002-8198-8844; Mwangi, Emmah/0000-0003-3838-0849","UK Research and Innovation as part of the Global Challenges Research Fund, Africa SWIFT programme [NE/P021077/1]; NERC [NE/P000673/1, NE/P021077/1] Funding Source: UKRI","UK Research and Innovation as part of the Global Challenges Research Fund, Africa SWIFT programme; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This work was supported by UK Research and Innovation as part of the Global Challenges Research Fund, Africa SWIFT programme-grant number NE/P021077/1.",,87,42,42,6,19,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

This paper simulated the microclimatic effects in four study areas with different streetscape fabrics in Shanghai to compare the microclimatic conditions with a system of multi-dimensional street morphological indices using ENVI-met 4.3 software. At the street network fabric level, the results showed that streets with a south-north orientation, a small junction spacing, and a street network with better connectivity were conducive to mitigation of the air temperature heating intensity in the street space and improving the ventilation effect; at the street-site level: The indices of Build-to-line ratio (BL), Height-width ratio (H/W), and Sky view factors (SVF) played different roles that affected the distribution characteristics of the microclimate factors. The BL value of the streets between 0.5 and 0.8 generally had a positive relationship with the air temperature. The SVF value of the streets was positively correlated with the microclimate index, while the H/W values were negatively correlated with them. The morphological indicators of different levels also had a synergistic effect on the microclimatic impact of the street space fabric. This comparative analysis of microclimatic characteristics at the medium spatial scale will provide useful suggestions for urban climate adaptability in urban spatial morphology optimization in future urbanization development.","[Jiang, Yunfang; Han, Xuemei; Song, Danran] East China Normal Univ, Ctr Modern Chinese City Studies, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yunfang; Han, Xuemei] Shanghai Inst Ecochongming, Res Ctr Eco Civilizat, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yunfang; Song, Danran] East China Normal Univ, Inst Innovat & Strateg Studies, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Shi, Tiemao] Shenyang Jianzhu Univ, Inst Spatial Planning & Design, Shenyang 110168, Liaoning, Peoples R China",East China Normal University; East China Normal University; Shenyang Jianzhu University,"Jiang, YF (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Ctr Modern Chinese City Studies, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.;Jiang, YF (corresponding author), Shanghai Inst Ecochongming, Res Ctr Eco Civilizat, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.;Jiang, YF (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Inst Innovat & Strateg Studies, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.;Shi, TM (corresponding author), Shenyang Jianzhu Univ, Inst Spatial Planning & Design, Shenyang 110168, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",yfjiang@re.ecnu.edu.cn; hxm511513@126.com; tiemaos@sjzu.edu.cn; danransong@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China project [51878279, 51878418, 51578344]; Key base Project of Humanities and Social Sciences from Ministry of Education in China [16JJD790012]; project Research on the innovation environment of Shanghai from the Institute for Innovation and Strategic Studies of ECNU [41300-120212-10006/002]; Thinktank project from the Shanghai Institute of Eco-Chongming [13900-50401-515110/001/012]",National Natural Science Foundation of China project(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key base Project of Humanities and Social Sciences from Ministry of Education in China; project Research on the innovation environment of Shanghai from the Institute for Innovation and Strategic Studies of ECNU; Thinktank project from the Shanghai Institute of Eco-Chongming,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China project (Grant Nos. 51878279; 51878418, and 51578344), the Key base Project of Humanities and Social Sciences from Ministry of Education in China (Grant No. 16JJD790012).

A series of panel mixed ordered Probit models are estimated to examine the influence of individual/household social demographics, land use characteristics, and weather characteristics on individuals' home-based trip chaining complexity. A thermal index, the universal thermal climate index (UTCI), is used in this study instead of using directly measured weather variables in order to better approximate the effects of the thermal environment. The effects of UTCI are segmented into different seasons to account for the seasonal difference of UTCI effects. Moreover, a spatial expansion method is applied to allow the impacts of UTCI to vary across geographical locations, as individuals in different regions have different weather/climate adaptions. The effects of weather are examined in subsistence, routine, and discretionary trip chains. The results reveal that the 'ground covered with snow' condition is the most influential factor on the number of trips chained per trip chain among all other weather factors. The variation of UTCI significantly influences trip chaining complexity in autumn but not in spring and winter. The routine trip chains are found to be most elastic towards the variation of UTCI. The marginal effects of UTCI on the expected number of trips per routine trip chain have considerable spatial variations, while these spatial trends of UTCI effects are found to be not consistent over seasons.","[Liu, Chengxi; Susilo, Yusak O.; Karlstrom, Anders] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Transport Sci, Teknikringen 10, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Liu, CX (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Transport Sci, Teknikringen 10, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",chengxi@abe.kth.se,"Liu, Chengxi/Y-6557-2019; Susilo, Yusak O/M-3707-2013","Liu, Chengxi/0000-0001-6966-9077; Susilo, Yusak O/0000-0001-7124-7164",,,,,42,19,19,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0049-4488,1572-9435,,TRANSPORTATION,Transportation,SEP,2016,43,5,,,,,843,867,,10.1007/s11116-015-9623-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11116-015-9623-0,,,25,"Engineering, Civil; Transportation; Transportation Science & Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Engineering; Transportation,DT1TV,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000381265900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Extreme heat events, the focus of this paper, have been consistently reported as the leading cause of weather-related mortality in the United States in recent years. In order to fully understand impact potentials and analyze risk in its individual components both the spatially and temporally varying patterns of heat and the multidimensional characteristics of vulnerability have to be considered. In this paper we present a composite index aggregating these factors to assess heat related risk for the U.S. National Capital Region in 2010. The study reveals how risk patterns are in part driven by the geographic variations of vulnerability, generally showing a clear difference between high-risk urban areas and wide areas of low risk in the suburban and rural environments. This pattern is particularly evident for the core center of the study area around the District of Columbia, which is largely characterized by high index values despite not having experienced the peak of the heat stress as compared to other regions in the metropolitan area. The article aims to set a framework for local-level heat stress risk assessment that can provide valuable input and decision support for climate adaptation planning as well as emergency managers aiming at risk reduction and optimization of resource distribution.

However, vulnerability assessments are challenging because of the complexity of multifaceted biophysical, human and institutional factors, interacting at different scales and levels within socio-ecological systems. Using a participatory approach across levels and genders, this paper explores the vulnerability of livestock- and forest-based livelihoods to climate variability and change in Lake Faguibine, northern Mali, where drastic ecological, political and social changes have occurred. Our results show that the distribution of vulnerabilities within livelihoods and groups shifted when the ecosystem evolved from a lake to a forest. New vulnerability drivers have emerged, related to resources availability, access and power relations. In addition, political interests and psychological barriers hinder the local transition to an equitable and sustainable use of forest ecosystem services. Divergent perceptions, social identities, interests and power explained why different actors-governmental and non-governmental, men and women, local, sub-national and national-differed in their vulnerability assessments. This is exemplified in the way actors at different levels and of different gender analysed the effects of herders' mobility and in the way women analysed men's migration. This case study confirms the need for participatory and gender-sensitive vulnerability assessments across different scales and levels that consider the interaction between socio-ecological systems and the dynamics and distribution of vulnerability across different social sub-systems.","[Djoudi, Houria; Brockhaus, Maria; Locatelli, Bruno] CIFOR, Bogor, Indonesia; [Locatelli, Bruno] CIRAD, Montpellier, France",CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); CIRAD,"Djoudi, H (corresponding author), CIFOR, Bogor, Indonesia.",h.djoudi@cgiar.org,"Locatelli, Bruno/C-9957-2009","Locatelli, Bruno/0000-0003-2983-1644; Brockhaus, Maria/0000-0001-7348-4921",European Commission [EuropeAid/ENV/2004-81719],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"The authors thank all participants and interviewees in the local communities (Tin Aicha, Ras El Ma), Goundam, Timbuktu and Bamako.

In recent years, most of the smallholder farming areas have experienced perennial droughts, poor rainfall distribution and crop failures and these have been attributed to climate change and variability. Cultivation of dambos, which are seasonal wetlands, presents a climate change and variability adaptation option for smallholder farmers. This synthesis analyses the role of dambo cultivation in climate change and variability adaptation and discusses future directions for sustainable dambo utilization. The data on current dambo farming practices were collected from literature, surveys and field observations. The results showed that farmers grow crops in dambos as an adaptive strategy to climate change and variability and have largely abandoned upland fields where yields are <1 t ha(-1) in preference of dambos where yields average 2-3 t ha(-1). Dambo cultivation offers a buffer against crop failures and has resulted in improved household food security. We conclude that dambo cultivation is a potentially beneficial farmer-driven climate change and variability adaptation strategy. However, if not properly designed and managed, dambo cultivation may result in their degradation hence there is need for further research to evaluate options for sustainable dambo utilization as intensification of dambo agriculture is important for food security.","[Nyamadzawo, G.] Bindura Univ Sci Educ, Dept Environm Sci, Bindura, Zimbabwe; [Nyamadzawo, G.; Wuta, M.; Nyamugafata, P.] Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Soil Sci & Agr Engn, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Nyamangara, J.] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Matopos Res Stn, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe; [Chirinda, N.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Agroecol, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark",University of Zimbabwe; CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT); Aarhus University,"Nyamadzawo, G (corresponding author), Bindura Univ Sci Educ, Dept Environm Sci, Box 1020, Bindura, Zimbabwe.",gnyama@yahoo.com,"Nyamangara, Justice/HFZ-7630-2022","Nyamangara, Justice/0000-0002-5249-7747; Nyamadzawo, George/0000-0001-8048-935X; Chirinda, Ngonidzashe/0000-0002-4213-6294","International Foundation of Science (IFS) [C/4569-1]; DAAD [A/10/03022]; Climate Food and Farming (CLIFF) network under CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)","International Foundation of Science (IFS)(International Foundation for Science); DAAD(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Climate Food and Farming (CLIFF) network under CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR)","This work was supported by the International Foundation of Science (IFS) [grant C/4569-1]; DAAD Fellowship [grant number A/10/03022] and the Climate Food and Farming (CLIFF) network under the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).",,56,19,20,0,72,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1473-5903,1747-762X,,INT J AGR SUSTAIN,Int.

Climate adaptation decisions can involve tradeoffs between different system outcomes. Thus, it is important for decision makers to consider the potential changes in monetary value attributed to the observed changes in physical flows from these events, since the value to society of a unit change in an outcome varies widely between thing like food and energy production, water quality, and carbon sequestration.Methods: We develop a valuation tool (FEWSVT) that applies theoretically sound valuation techniques to estimates changes in value for four parameters within the food-energy-water nexus. We demonstrate the utility of the tool through the application of a case study that analyzes the monetary changes in value of a modelled heat wave scenario relative to historic (baseline) conditions in two study regions in the United States.Results: We find that food (corn and soybeans) comprises the majority (89%) of total changes in value, as heatwaves trigger physical changes in corn and soybeans yields. We also find that specifying overly simplified and incorrect valuation methods lead to monetary values that largely differ from FEWSVT results that use accepted valuation methods.Discussion: These results demonstrate the value in considering changes in monetary value instead of just physical flows when making decisions on how to distribute investments and address the many potential impacts of climate change-induced extremes.","[Chang, Joseph W.; Ando, Amy W.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Champaign, IL 61801 USA; [Chen, Mengye] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Norman, OK USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Chang, JW (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Champaign, IL 61801 USA.",josephweichang@gmail.com,,,"U.S. National Science Foundation's Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy and Water Systems (INFEWS/T1) [1856012]; USDA-NIFA W4133 Multistate Research Grant [1008843]","U.S. National Science Foundation's Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy and Water Systems (INFEWS/T1); USDA-NIFA W4133 Multistate Research Grant","Major funding for this paper came from the U.S. National Science Foundation's Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy and Water Systems (INFEWS/T1 Grant #1856012).

A Medline bibliographic database search was also performed. Reference lists were reviewed to identify additional relevant data sources. Key references were examined by both authors. Results We propose, and evaluate, the evidence for a 'mitochondrial efficiency hypothesis' i.e. that ancestral changes in mitochondrial coupling efficiency enhanced the successful adaptation of South Asians to environmental stressors by maximizing the conversion of energy to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) rather than heat. This adaptation may be disadvantageous when South Asians are physically inactive and consume high-caloric diets. There is evidence that common mitochondrial mutations vary geographically. Mutations, including those affecting the function of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs), may influence the balance of energy and heat production. These may influence basal metabolic rate (BMR), energy efficiency, the tendency to gain weight and hence metabolic disease. UCP gene polymorphisms are related to differences in BMR between African-Americans and Europeans. Similar data for South Asians are lacking but the few studies comparing BMR indicate that South Asians have a lower BMR, which is explained by a lower lean body mass, and higher fat mass. Once adjusted for body composition, BMR is similar. A high fat mass, per se, is a strategy for reducing energy use while conserving body size. Indians in the USA had higher oxidative phosphorylation capacity than Northern European Americans. Conclusion The evidence justifies full exploration of this mitochondrial effeciency hypothesis in South Asians, which may also be relevant to other warm-climate adapted populations.","[Rafnsson, Snorri B.] Univ Edinburgh, Publ Hlth Sci Sect, Sch Clin Sci & Community Hlth, Edinburgh EH8 9AG, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Populat Hlth Sci, Edinburgh EH8 9AG, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh,"Rafnsson, SB (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Publ Hlth Sci Sect, Sch Clin Sci & Community Hlth, Teviot Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9AG, Midlothian, Scotland.",S.B.Rafnsson@ed.ac.uk,"Rafnsson, Snorri/AAH-1371-2020","Rafnsson, Snorri/0000-0002-7985-912X",,,,,74,42,43,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0300-5771,1464-3685,,INT J EPIDEMIOL,Int.

This study builds a theoretical link between the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), an international carbon trading scheme, and local sustainable development in China. This article uses a panel data set of the attributes of 4,429 CDM projects hosted in China from 2004 to 2015, together with socio-economic factors at the provincial level. The study's findings support the contention that the dual objectives of carbon emission reduction and sustainable development benefits cannot be fulfilled simultaneously, though technology may remedy this trade-off, and the effect of the CDM on local sustainable development varies across Chinese regions. This article helps elucidate the localizing process of climate justice and contributes to justice theories and the literature while aiding public managers and practitioners in international climate governance. Key policy insights Emission reductions for investment countries of CDM were achieved at the expense of local SD benefits in China. CDM exacerbated the differences among Chinese regions in achieving SD goals due to uneven economic and social conditions. Technology innovation can remedy the negative impact of CDM, governments thus should attach importance to technology and use CDM projects to accelerate technological transfers and innovation. Local governments should be encouraged to formulate and use local policies and processes to guide actions on CDM and to ensure their consistence with the prospect of the international mechanism by including the essence of justice. Developing countries should improve their institutional or organizational capacity to promote sustainable social development and to better tackle climate change. Investment of CDM projects or other international mechanisms should expand the budget expenditure, not limited to simple carbon trade, for improving the climate adaptation capacity of developing countries.","[Xu, Jingyuan] Fudan Univ, Inst Global Publ Policy, LSE Fudan Res Ctr Global Publ Policy, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yue] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Social & Publ Adm, Guangdong Res Ctr NPO, Guangzhou, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Guangdong University of Foreign Studies,"Zhang, Y (corresponding author), Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Social & Publ Adm, Guangdong Res Ctr NPO, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",yzhang0101@gdufs.edu.cn,,"XU, Jingyuan/0000-0003-0352-9930; Zhang, Yue/0000-0003-1838-5933",China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2020M681193],China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),This work was supported by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [Grant Number 2020M681193].,,72,3,3,3,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

We used a simple crop modelling approach to derive expected future changes in regional climate suitability for crops. To determine if different starch-rich and pulse crops are currently underresearched or overresearched, we examined the global relation between crop-specific research output (number of publications) and the total nutrient output available for human consumption. Our analysis shows that current research investments are mostly associated with the current energy output of crops. Other things equal, investment levels tend to be slightly lower for crops better adapted to future climates and tend to decrease as crop nutrient richness increases. Among starch-rich crops, maize, barley, and rice receive substantially more research investment than justified by their current nutrient output. Sweetpotato, potato, and wheat show substantial current research deficits. Sweetpotato is most strongly underresearched in regions with improving climate suitability. For potato, research deficits occur in regions where these crops will experience less suitable climate conditions. For wheat, the deficits are distributed equally across regions with negative and positive climate effects. Three crops are significantly over-researched, namely maize, rice, and barley. Among pulses, cowpea, and lupin are generally overresearched. Common bean is highly underresearched, but these deficits concentrate in areas where it will likely suffer from climate change. Lentil, broad bean, and chickpea are underresearched, with deficits concentrating in regions where these crops will tend to benefit from future climates. Agricultural research investment allocations will need to consider additional factors not taken into account in this study, but our findings suggest that current allocations need reconsideration to support climate adaptation and enhance healthy human nutrition.","[Manners, Rhys] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Agr Econ Stat & Business Management, Ave Puerta Hierro 2, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Manners, Rhys] Res Ctr Management Agr & Environm Risks CEIGRAM, Madrid, Spain; [van Etten, Jacob] Biovers Int, CATIE 7170-30501, Turrialba, Cartago, Costa Rica",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Alliance; Bioversity International,"Manners, R (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Agr Econ Stat & Business Management, Ave Puerta Hierro 2, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",rhys.manners@upm.es; j.vanetten@cgiar.org,,"van Etten, Jacob/0000-0001-7554-2558; , Rhys/0000-0003-0213-5462",CGIAR Trust Fund,CGIAR Trust Fund(CGIAR),"This work was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from the CGIAR Trust Fund and through bilateral funding agreements.

Mitigating the devastating effects of floods to the community and critical infrastructures entails competing financial requirements at the different levels of government. Hence, the main objective of this study was to examine the financial optimality of disaster risk reduction measures by integrating Markov decision processes (MOP for short) with geographic information system (GIS). Conducted in the core suburbs of Brisbane City, we organised the MDP variables using the following: 1) flood risk levels as the states of the urban system; 2) Queensland's disaster risk reduction measures as the action variables; 3) percentage of government expenditures by disaster risk reduction category as the state transition probabilities; 4) total lost earnings to businesses affected by the flood events as the reward variables; and 5) the weighted average riskless rate of return, the weighted average rate of return, and rate of return for a riskier asset as discounting factors. We analysed 36 MDP scenarios at four-level iteration and then calculated the expectimax values to find the optimal policy. The results from the analyses revealed that the Commonwealth government optimised the use of its natural disaster risk reduction expenditures to recovery while the State government focused on mitigation. When both government expenditures combined, the mitigation measure was identified as the optimum natural disaster risk reduction policy. The methodology presented in this study allowed a spatial representation and computationally feasible integration of complex flood disaster risk model with government expenditures and business earnings. The insights from this integrated approach emphasise the viability of finding optimum expenditures, and re-examine if necessary, in implementing natural disaster risk reduction policies and climate adaptation strategies.

However, the impact of climatic zones on UHI remains unclear. This study, therefore, aimed at investigating how climatic zones affect spatiotemporal variations, trends and potential drivers of surface UHI intensity (SUHII) based upon 253 Chinese cities in five climatic zones: middle temperate zone (MTZ), south temperate zone (STZ), north subtropical zone (NSZ), middle subtropical zone (MSZ), and south subtropical zone (SSZ) during 2001-2020. The results showed that the SUHII ranged from-2.59 to 6.20 degrees C, average daytime SUHII showed higher seasonal fluctuations and larger variation than nighttime and summer daytime had the highest seasonal and annual SUHII variation (SUHIISAV). Cities in NSZ, MSZ, and SSZ had high average daytime SUHIISAV and a large proportion had significant increasing trends (TrendSI) (P<0.05) from 2001-2020, while the nighttime showed opposite rule in general. Random forest (RF) model explained 68% of day/night SUHIISAV on average. Except for city area, which greatly impacted day/night SUHIISAV in all periods and climatic zones, other drivers more significantly influenced SUHII in certain periods and climatic zones, e.g. aerosol optical depth (AOD) in winter nighttime in MTZ and STZ.

We conducted a 3-year experiment at eight US National Estuarine Research Reserves using a standardized implementation protocol and subsequent monitoring to evaluate effects of sediment placement on vegetation in low and high marsh, and compared this to control and reference plots. Sediments added to experimental plots were sourced from nearby quarries, were sandier than ambient marsh soils, and had more crab burrowing, but proved effective, suggesting that terrestrial sources can be used for tidal marsh restoration. We found strong differences among sites but detected general trends across the eight contrasting systems. Colonization by marsh plants was generally rapid following sediment addition, such that TLP plot cover was similar to control plots. While we found that 14-cm TLP plots were initially colonized more slowly than 7-cm plots, this difference largely disappeared after three years. In the face of accelerated sea-level rise, we thus recommend adding thicker sediment layers. Despite rapid revegetation, TLP plots did not approximate vegetation characteristics of higher elevation reference plots. Thus, while managers can expect fairly fast revegetation at TLP sites, the ultimate goal of achieving reference marsh conditions may be achieved slowly if at all. Vegetation recovered rapidly in both high and low marsh; thus, TLP can serve as a climate adaptation strategy across the marsh landscape. Our study illustrates the value of conducting experiments across disparate geographies and provides restoration practitioners with guidance for conducting future TLP projects.","[Raposa, Kenneth B.] Narragansett Bay Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, POB 151, Prudence Isl, RI 02872 USA; [Woolfolk, Andrea; Fountain, Monique C.; Wasson, Kerstin] Elkhorn Slough Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, Watsonville, CA USA; [Endris, Charlie A.] Moss Landing Marine Labs, 8272 Moss Landing Rd, Moss Landing, CA USA; [Moore, Gregg; Burdick, David M.] Univ New Hampshire, Jackson Estuarine Lab, Durham, NH USA; [Tyrrell, Megan] Waquoit Bay Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, 131 Waquoit Highway, Waquoit, MA USA; [Swerida, Rebecca] 580 Taylor Ave, Annapolis, MD USA; [Lerberg, Scott] William & Mary, Chesapeake Bay VA Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, 1375 Great Rd, Gloucester Point, VA USA; [Puckett, Brandon J.] North Carolina Coastal Reserve & Natl Estuarine Re, 101 Pivers Isl Rd, Beaufort, NC USA; [Ferner, Matthew C.] San Francisco Bay Natl Estuarine Res Reserve & San, 3150 Paradise Dr, Tiburon, CA USA; [Hollister, Jeffrey] Atlantic Ecol Div, US Environm Protect Agcy, Narragansett, RI USA; [Champlin, Lena; Krause, Johannes R.; Watson, Elizabeth B.] Drexel Univ, Acad Nat Sci, 1900 Benjamin Franklin Pkwy, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Krause, Johannes R.] Florida Int Univ, SW 8Th St, Miami, FL 11200 USA; [Haines, Dustin] Lake Super Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, Superior, WI USA; [Gray, Andrew B.] Univ Calif Riverside, 900 Univ Dr, Riverside, CA USA",Moss Landing Marine Laboratories; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Drexel University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Raposa, KB (corresponding author), Narragansett Bay Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, POB 151, Prudence Isl, RI 02872 USA.",kenneth.raposa@dem.ri.gov,,"Champlin, Lena/0000-0002-1195-4278; Ferner, Matthew/0000-0002-4862-9663",,,,,67,0,0,8,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-2723,1559-2731,,ESTUAR COAST,Estuaries Coasts,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s12237-022-01161-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-022-01161-y,,JAN 2023,21,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,7V9GW,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000913121200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

More insight into the climatic impacts (especially those of precipitation) on cold season residential electricity consumption (REC) is needed. This study quantified the climatic impacts on REC, with a focus on precipitation, and projected the associated changes under representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 climate change scenarios in Lanzhou and Lhasa, two cities in China with distinctive cold season climates. The climatic impacts on REC in both cities are driven by heating-related demand. A stronger precipitation impact during the cold season was observed in both cities, since precipitation (particularly snowfall) boosts electricity consumption during the cold season. As the two cities become warmer and wetter, increased precipitation will offset the impact of warming on REC, with Lanzhou being more strongly affected. Based on the projections for Lanzhou, the offsetting effect will be more pronounced during the cold season across all scenarios, and will be particularly strong under RCP 2.6. For the remainder of the year, the effects of increased precipitation and warming will have competing importances under the RCP 4.5 scenario, whereas temperature effects will generally dominate the climatic impacts under the RCP 8.5 scenario. These results provide new insights for future cold season climate-energy studies and can be used to improve regional climate adaptation policies. We also propose a method to project climate-based REC changes which is compatible with potential early-warning projects to protect against extreme weather-induced power outages.","[Xia, Cuihui; Yao, Tandong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Big Sci Program Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xia, Cuihui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yao, Tandong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface Pr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hou, Haowen] Tencent AI Platform Dept, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Wang, Pengling] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; China Meteorological Administration","Xia, CH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Big Sci Program Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Xia, CH (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xiacuihui@itpcas.ac.cn,,"Xia, Cuihui/0000-0002-5648-5014",,,,,46,0,0,6,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-6463,,FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ,Front.

We developed a proposal for a National Blueprint Framework (NBF) with 24 water-related indicators, centered on SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation for all), each with a specific target. We applied the NBF to 28 EU Member States (EU-28) and conclude that: The current SDG 6 indicators are useful for monitoring progress toward water-related targets but their usefulness can be improved by focusing more on their practical implementation. The extension of SDG 6 with complementary indicators (e.g. for the circular economy of water) and quantitative policy targets is urgently needed. This will benefit the communication process and progress at the science-policy interface. SDG indicators can be improved in a (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound) manner and by setting clear policy targets for each indicator, allowing for measuring distance-to-targets. This allows country-to-country comparison and learning, and accelerates the SDG implementation process. We propose 24 water-related indicators centered on SDG 6, with complementary indicators including quantitative policy targets. The approach is doable, easily scalable, and flexibly deployable by collecting information for the EU-28. Main gaps in the EU-28 are observed for water quality, wastewater treatment, nutrient, and energy recovery, as well as climate adaptation to extreme weather events (heat, droughts, and floods). The framework was less successful for non-OECD countries due to lack of data and EU-centric targets for each indicator. This needs further research.","[Essex, B.; Koop, S. H. A.; Van Leeuwen, C.

The effects of demographic and contextual factors on thermal perception have been extensively studied, yet in previous studies, confounding variables have not been commonly controlled; it is also not known how these factors interact with each other. The current study leverages on the largest global thermal comfort database to date and explores the impacts of available demographic and contextual factors, including gender, ventilation mode, building typology, season and climate, on occupants' thermal sensation, along with their two-way and three-way interaction effects. Results indicate that all tested demographic and contextual factors except ventilation mode significantly affect occupants' thermal sensation. Under the same indoor environmental and outdoor climatic conditions, males perceive the environment as being significantly warmer than females in all contexts; males' thermal sensitivity is also consistently lower than females'. Thermal sensations in multifamily housing are significantly lower and closer to neutral than in office buildings under the same exposure conditions, yet it is likely to be the combined effects of building typology and ventilation mode. All else being equal, occupants in office buildings have less seasonal variation in thermal sensation than classrooms and multifamily housing. Residents in a warmer climate deem the same indoor thermal environment significantly cooler than residents in a cooler climate; this climatic adaptation is more pronounced in females than in males. Occupants' sensitivity to indoor air temperature, humidity and air movement significantly vary between different ventilation modes under different seasons.","[Zhang, Fan] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Engn & Built Environm, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia; [de Dear, Richard] Univ Sydney, Sch Architecture Design & Planning, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",Griffith University; University of Sydney,"Zhang, F (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Engn & Built Environm, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia.",fan.zhang@griffith.edu.au; richard.dedear@sydney.edu.au,"Zhang, Fan/J-1106-2019; de Dear, Richard/AAP-8963-2020","Zhang, Fan/0000-0002-3031-8218; de Dear, Richard/0000-0002-3414-290X",,,,,83,20,20,3,21,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

One strategy is irrigation, which allows for crops to be grown outside their optimal climate growing regions and which buffers against climate variability. Although irrigation is a positive climate adaptation mechanism for agriculture, it has a potentially negative effect on water resources as it can lead to groundwater depletion and diminished surface water supplies. This study quantifies how crop yields are affected by climate variability and extremes and the impact of irrigation on crop yield increases under various growing-season climate conditions. To do this, we use historical climate data and county-level rainfed and irrigated crop yields for maize, soybean, winter and spring wheat over the US to analyze the relationship between climate, crop yields, and irrigation. We find that there are optimal climates, specific to each crop, where irrigation provides a benefit and other conditions where irrigation proves to have marginal, if any, benefits. Furthermore, the relationship between crop yields and climate has changed over the last decades, with a changing sensitivity in the relationship of soybean and winter wheat yields to certain climate variables, like crop reference evapotranspiration. These two conclusions have important implications for agricultural and water resource system planning, as it implies there are more optimal climate conditions where irrigation is particularly productive and regions where irrigation should be reconsidered as there is not a significant agricultural benefit and the water could be used more productively.","[Li, X.; Troy, T.

Governance approaches and regulatory frameworks determine who has access to water, for what purpose, and when. In the northeastern United States, water governance has historically been conducted by states through a combination of statutory guidance and common law. However, it is unclear what effect if current governance approaches will be sufficient for achieving resource conservation and equitable allocation in a changing climate. To provide insight into these issues, we conducted the first review of freshwater governance in the 12 states that comprise the U.S. Northeast. Specifically, we examine their heterogeneous approaches to surface and groundwater use, permitting and reporting, and scarcity provisions. Using agriculture as the sector of focus, we show through narrative review and quantitative analysis that change in the proportion of cropland that is irrigated in each state does not differ based on governance approach. We also suggest that future decades may bring regulatory shifts relevant to agriculture, changes in enforcement, increased competition between agriculture and other users, and greater potential competition between states for water resources. This case study raises the question: how should we prepare for the time when competition for, or degradation of, a resource surpasses the ability of existing governance mechanisms to ensure conservation and equitable distribution?","[Schattman, Rachel E.] Univ Maine, Sch Food & Agr, 5722 Deering Room 115, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Niles, Meredith T.] Univ Vermont, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, 350 March Life Sci,Carrigan Wing,109 Carrigan Dr, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Aitken, Hannah M.] Univ Vermont, Extens Vegetable & Small Fruit Program, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Aitken, Hannah M.] Burnt Rock Farm, Huntington, VT USA",University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Vermont; University of Vermont,"Schattman, RE (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Sch Food & Agr, 5722 Deering Room 115, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",rachel.schattman@maine.edu; mtniles@uvm.edu; hannahmaitken@gmail.com,,"Niles, Meredith/0000-0002-8323-1351; Schattman, Rachel/0000-0001-7177-3914","University of Vermont College of Agriculture and Life Sciences; University of Vermont Extension; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Project through the Maine Agricultural & Forest Experiment Station [ME0-1022424]","University of Vermont College of Agriculture and Life Sciences; University of Vermont Extension; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Project through the Maine Agricultural & Forest Experiment Station","This work was made possible through the support of the University of Vermont College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the University of Vermont Extension.

As part of the review, we address common questions associated with climate adaptation and realignment treatments that run counter to a broad consensus in the literature. These include the following: (1) Are the effects of fire exclusion overstated? If so, are treatments unwarranted and even counterproductive? (2) Is forest thinning alone sufficient to mitigate wildfire hazard? (3) Can forest thinning and prescribed burning solve the problem? (4) Should active forest management, including forest thinning, be concentrated in the wildland urban interface (WUI)? (5) Can wildfires on their own do the work of fuel treatments? (6) Is the primary objective of fuel reduction treatments to assist in future firefighting response and containment? (7) Do fuel treatments work under extreme fire weather? (8) Is the scale of the problem too great? Can we ever catch up? (9) Will planting more trees mitigate climate change in wNA forests? And (10) is post-fire management needed or even ecologically justified? Based on our review of the scientific evidence, a range of proactive management actions are justified and necessary to keep pace with changing climatic and wildfire regimes and declining forest heterogeneity after severe wildfires. Science-based adaptation options include the use of managed wildfire, prescribed burning, and coupled mechanical thinning and prescribed burning as is consistent with land management allocations and forest conditions.

Their unsatisfactory development is attributed to the lack of climatic adaptation which causes some abnormalities in bud differentiation. The development of reproductive spurs is erratic, leading to vegetative shoots, and the flower index is very low. The purpose of this work is to understand the flower differentiation problem. An assessment was made through morphological and histological studies, also an analysis of climatic data was performed in an attempt to identify the responsible factors. The number of chilling hours recorded was about 695. Defoliation was delayed and happened during the second week of January. Bud break was advanced by 10 d in comparison with the average period. The spurs density (12 and 23 spurs per m of twigs) was similar to the values observed in normal situation. The buds carried by these spurs evolved into vegetative shoots for all variety X rootstock combination used in this study. The average of this transformation was 47 and 50% for 'Golden Delicious' and 'Starking Delicious', respectively. A flowering index obtained was very low (1.3 kg per tree). Anatomical observations carried out on buds collected in October showed that differentiation was undertaken and the floral primordium was already formed with some abnormalities in flower development in later stage. At anthesis, internal structures of the buds showed primordia disorganized. Reproductive organs presented pistil abortion with low microsporogenesis. Xylem vessel elements were not observed at the base of the bud and vascular connection was not established. This problem in flower development occurred at this stage which was affected by external factors. The winter was characterized by periods of high temperatures which affect negatively the accumulation of chilling units. The mode of action of temperature, notably of chilling on the formation of flowering organs and vessels, remains to be determined.","Ctr Reg Meknes, Inst Natl Rech Agron, Meknes 50000, Morocco; Univ & Perfezionamento St Anna, Scuola Super, I-56100 Pisa, Italy; Univ Pisa, Fac Agr, Dipartimento Coltivaz & Difesa Specie Legnose, I-56100 Pisa, Italy",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; University of Pisa,"Oukabli, A (corresponding author), Ctr Reg Meknes, Inst Natl Rech Agron, BP 578, Meknes 50000, Morocco.",,,,,,,,19,32,33,2,19,HEADLEY BROTHERS LTD,ASHFORD,"INVICTA PRESS, ASHFORD TN24 8HH, KENT, ENGLAND",1462-0316,,,J HORTIC SCI BIOTECH,J.

We investigated recent disturbance intensities in Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) forests in Slovakia (Central Europe) with different management objectives in 2000-2017 based on Landsat imagery. We focused on 122 strict reserves without any management, their actively managed surroundings (500 m and 2000 m buffers), and managed production forests beyond the buffer areas. We used generalized additive mixed models to test for differences in temporal trends of disturbance intensity among these management categories. We found that disturbance intensity was increasing in all management categories during the studied period. The increase was more pronounced in the managed forests (compound annual disturbance rate 1.76% year(-1)) and the 2000 m buffer (2.21% year(-1)) than in the strict reserves (0.58% year(-1)). The predicted cumulative disturbance during the 18-year period was 9.9% in the reserves and 30.5% in the 2000 m buffer. We found that forests in nature reserves can be more resistant to disturbances than forests managed for timber production, despite management efforts to control disturbances in managed forests. Our findings can help reconcile the different perceptions of natural disturbances and their management in Central Europe and support climate-adapted management strategies that consider natural disturbances as an indispensable component of ecosystem dynamics.","[Potterf, Maria] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Potterf, Maria] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Life Sci Syst, Hans Carl Von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Bavaria, Germany; [Svitok, Marek] Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Ecol & Environm Sci, Dept Biol & Gen Ecol, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96001, Slovakia; [Svitok, Marek] Univ South Bohemia, Dept Ecosystem Biol, Fac Sci, Braniovsko 1760, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Mezei, Pavel; Jarcuska, Benjamin; Jakus, Rastislav; Blazenec, Miroslav] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Forest Ecol, L Stura 2, Zvolen 96001, Slovakia; [Jakus, Rastislav; Hlasny, Tomas] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, ETM, Kamycka 1176,6 Suchdol, Prague 16521, Czech Republic",University of Jyvaskyla; Technical University of Munich; Technical University Zvolen; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Slovak Academy of Sciences; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Potterf, M (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland.;Potterf, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Life Sci Syst, Hans Carl Von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Bavaria, Germany.",maria.potterf@gmail.com; svitok@tuzvo.sk; pavel.mezei@outlook.com; benjamin.jarcuska@gmail.com; rasti.jakus@gmail.com; blazenec@ife.sk; hlasny@fld.czu.cz,"Blazenec, Miroslav/AAD-4479-2019","Blazenec, Miroslav/0000-0001-9743-614X","Stefan Schwarz fund of the Slovak Academy of Sciences; Slovak Research and Development Agency, Slovakia [APVV15-0761, APVV19-0606, APVV-18-0347]; Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education and the Slovak Academy of Sciences [VEGA 02/0076/19]; ERDF [ITMS 313011 1721]; Operational Programme Research, Development and Education (OP RDE) [EVA4.0, CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000803]","Stefan Schwarz fund of the Slovak Academy of Sciences(Slovak Academy of Sciences); Slovak Research and Development Agency, Slovakia(Slovak Research and Development Agency); Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education and the Slovak Academy of Sciences(Slovak Academy of Sciences); ERDF(European Commission); Operational Programme Research, Development and Education (OP RDE)","Stefan Schwarz fund of the Slovak Academy of Sciences; by the Slovak Research and Development Agency, Slovakia (APVV15-0761, APVV19-0606, APVV-18-0347, APVV-18-0347); by the Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education and the Slovak Academy of Sciences under contract VEGA 02/0076/19; by the Operational Programme Integrated Infrastructure (OPII) funded by the ERDF (ITMS 313011 1721) and by the Operational Programme Research, Development and Education (OP RDE) (Grant EVA4.0, CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000803).",,92,0,0,11,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0015-752X,1464-3626,,FORESTRY,Forestry,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1093/forestry/cpac045,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/forestry/cpac045,,NOV 2022,12,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,6D2VG,,Green Published,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000882554200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We use a comprehensive dataset for the 483 sub-districts (Upazilas) in Bangladesh, tracking disaster risk reduction and adaptation funding provided to each sub-district by the central government during fiscal years' 2010-11 to 2013-14, disaggregated by the various types of social protection programs. We assess to what extent the primary determinants of such funding flows such as current hazard risk, socio-economic vulnerability, and political economy considerations contribute to these funding allocation decisions. We find that flood hazard risk and socio-economic vulnerability are both positively correlated with the sub-district fiscal allocations. We find that political factors do not seem to significantly correlate with these allocations and neither does proximity to the centres of Dhaka and Chittagong. Public spending for adaptive disaster risk reduction, as investigated here, can be a useful complementary intervention tool to other DRR programs, such as insurance or broader social transfers, provided that it is allocated rationally. Broadly, this appears to be the case in Bangladesh. We leave the measuring of the relative efficacy and efficiency of each financing tool for future work. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, epidemiological and public health studies of flooding events have focused on mental health effects, vector-borne diseases, and infectious enteric disease due to floodwater contact (i.e. typically low consumption rates). The inherent nature of groundwater (i.e. out of sight, out of mind) and the widely held belief that aquifers represent a pristine source of drinking water due to natural attenuation may represent the perfect storm causing direct consumption of relatively large volumes of surface flood contaminated groundwater. Accordingly, the current study sought to systematically identify and synthesize all available peer-reviewed literature pertaining to the nexus between surface flooding, groundwater contamination and human gastroenteric outcomes. Just 14 relevant studies were found to have been published during the period 1980-2017, thus highlighting the fact that this potentially significant source of climate-related exposure to environmental infection has remained understudied to date. Studies differed significantly in terms of type and data reporting procedures, making it difficult to discern clear trends and patterns. Approximately 945 confirmed cases of flood-related enteric disease were examined across studies; these concurred with almost 10,000 suspected cases, equating to approximately 20 suspected cases per confirmed case. As such, no regional, national or global estimates are available for the human gastrointestinal health burden of flood-related groundwater contamination. In light of the demonstrable public health significance of the concurrent impacts of groundwater susceptibility and climate change exacerbation, strategies to increase awareness about potential sources of contamination and motivate precautionary behaviour (e.g. drinking water testing and treatment, supply interruptions) are necessary. Mainstreaming climate adaptation concerns into planning policies will also be necessary to reduce human exposure to waterborne sources of enteric infection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Silvicultural practices can alter treetree interactions and thus influence forest structure and composition. However, knowledge of the interacting effects of competitive and abiotic stress in tree communities is still limited. We assessed growth dynamics of European beech Fagus sylvatica in oligo- to eutrophic lowland beech forests by quantifying variation in the importance and intensity of competitive interactions among adult trees along a productivity gradient defined by nutrient availability and hydrological characteristics. We further predicted changes in competition indices with various levels of crowding for different forest types. Basal area growth of 1819 canopy trees was analysed using forest inventory data. Competition response of adult trees was inconsistent among forest types. For small timber trees, the intensity (absolute effect) and importance (effect relative to abiotic constraints) of competition decreased with increasing abiotic stress. Growth responses of medium and large timber trees, however, revealed an opposite trend. Thus, in tree communities, competition effects did not follow a general pattern, because tree maturation altered the responsiveness of trees to environmental stress. Resource dependency of competition effects was most pronounced for large timber trees, with lowest sensitivity to changes in crowding conditions occurring on fertile sites. For small and medium timber trees, however, competition effects were strongest in dense stands, with lowest sensitivity to changes in crowding conditions on resource-limited sites. Synthesis and applications. Treetree interactions in beech forests showed a clear pattern which depended on tree maturation and resource supply. This highlights the importance of considering tree size-related changes along environmental gradients in regional growth models. Our findings indicate that management practices could facilitate both timber production and nature conservation demands by adapting thinning approaches to age- and resource-related tree growth patterns.

It is also leading to huge, and growing, levels of energy consumption. One important research challenge is therefore to identify how existing variation in climate adaptation cultures might be harnessed in fighting the further spread of this assumption. Examining how different groups see their relationship with air-conditioning could be part of this and Doha, the capital of Qatar, provides an excellent place in which to explore the potential of such a strategy. Air-conditioning was eagerly adopted by Qataris after the nationalisation of their oil and gas reserves soon made them some of the wealthiest people in the world. In recent years, however, local officials have started to consider the social and environmental benefits of other ways of living with the desert heat. This paper reports on a project that sought to produce an engaging body of evidence by comparing how older Qatari nationals, expatriate professionals, and younger Qatari nationals spoke of their ongoing relationship with air-conditioning. In so doing, it reflects on different ways of defining the purpose of empirical research in human geography to highlight the continued value of being curious about the hitherto unknown subjectivities that await us in the field. In this case, this was despite the popularity of conceptually informed analysis in cultural studies of air-conditioning and the critical commentator position in relevant accounts of urban change in the region.","[Hitchings, Russell] UCL, Dept Geog, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Hitchings, R (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Geog, London WC1E 6BT, England.",r.hitchings@ucl.ac.uk,,,Qatar National Research Fund [NPRP 7-1495-6-042],Qatar National Research Fund(Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF)),"The project discussed in this paper was supported by the Qatar National Research Fund [grant number NPRP 7-1495-6-042] as part of a broader examination of air-conditioning in Qatar that involved collaboration with Tim Winter, Jiat-Hwee Chang, Trinidad Rico and Donald McNeill.

Multiple studies havepredicted thepotential risks posed by rapidly expanding glacial lakes in the Sagarmatha (Mt. Everest) National Park and Buffer Zone of Nepal. People's perceptions of such cryospheric hazards can influence their actions, beliefs, and responses to those hazards and associated risks. This study provides a systematic approach that combines household survey data with ethnography to analyze people's perceptions of GLOF risks and the socioeconomic and cultural factors influencing their perceptions. A statistical logit model of household data showed a significant positive correlation between the perceptions of GLOF risks and livelihood sources, mainly tourism. Risk perceptions are also influenced by spatial proximity to glacial lakes and whether a village is in potential flood zones. The 2016 emergency remediation work implemented in the Imja Tsho (glacial lake) has served as a cognitive fix, especially in the low-lying settlements. Much of uncertainty and confusions related GLOF risks among locals can be attributed to a disconnect between how scientific information is communicated to the local communities and how government climate change policies have been limited to awareness campaigns and emergency remediation efforts. A sustainable partnership of scientists, policymakers, and local communities is urgently needed to build a science-driven, community-based initiative that focuses not just in addressing a single GLOF threat but develops on a comprehensive cryospheric risk management plan and considers opportunities and challenges of tourism in the local climate adaptation policies.","[Sherpa, Sonam Futi; Shrestha, Milan; Eakin, Hallie; Boone, Christopher G.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Shrestha, M (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",milan.shrestha@asu.edu,"Shrestha, Milan/C-3145-2012; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Shrestha, Milan/0000-0003-4758-515X; Boone, Christopher/0000-0001-7643-0806; Eakin, Hallie/0000-0001-8253-1320","National Science Foundation [ICER-1516912]; CNH-L: Science-Driven, Community-Based Approach to Reducing Glacier Lake Outburst Flood Risks-a multi-disciplinary research project of University of Texas, Austin; Arizona State University; University of Colorado, Boulder","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); CNH-L: Science-Driven, Community-Based Approach to Reducing Glacier Lake Outburst Flood Risks-a multi-disciplinary research project of University of Texas, Austin; Arizona State University; University of Colorado, Boulder","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under the Grant No. ICER-1516912, CNH-L: Science-Driven, Community-Based Approach to Reducing Glacier Lake Outburst Flood Risks-a multi-disciplinary research project of University of Texas, Austin (PI: Deane McKinney), Arizona State University (Co-PI: Milan Shrestha), and University of Colorado, Boulder (Co-PI: Alton Byers).

Weassessed the projected impacts of climate change on the yield of seven major crop types (viz wheat, barley, maize, potato, sugar beet, rice and rye) grown in Europe using a systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis of data reported in 41 original publications from an initial screening of 1748 studies. Our approach adopted an established SR procedure developed by the Centre for Evidence Based Conservation constrained by inclusion criteria and defined methods for literature searches, data extraction, meta-analysis and synthesis. Whilst similar studies exist to assess climate impacts on crop yield in Africa and South Asia, surprisingly, no comparable synthesis has been undertaken for Europe. Based on the reported results (n =729) we show that the projected change in average yield in Europe for the seven crops by the 2050s is + 8%. For wheat and sugar beet, average yield changes of + 14% and + 15% are projected, respectively. There were strong regional differences with crop impacts in northern Europe being higher (+ 14%) and more variable compared to central (+ 6%) and southern (+ 5) Europe. Maize is projected to suffer the largest negative mean change in southern Europe (-11%). Evidence of climate impacts on yield was extensive for wheat, maize, sugar beet and potato, but very limited for barley, rice and rye.

This study constructs and analyzes a 34-year-dataset (1982-2015) of hydro-climatic variables and satellite-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the YRD. A seasonal-trend decomposition technique based on loess (STL), and a structural change analysis were coupled to detect regime shifts of regional hydroclimate and vegetation in the YRD from 1982 through to 2015. During this period the YRD exhibited a significant warmer-drier-greening trend and experienced four regime shifts of its hydroclimate-vegetation system, with the four shift periods roughly centered in 1989, 1998, 2004, and 2012. Partial correlation analysis revealed that temperature was the dominant factor promoting vegetative growth in spring and autumn (all PNDVI-TEM greater than 0.65), and streamflow impacted the NDVI mainly in summer. Temperature and precipitation were the dominant controls of vegetative growth during the growing season prior to 2002, and thereafter precipitation and streamflow alternately became the main moisture-influencing factors of vegetative growth. Streamflow played an important complementary role on vegetative growth, particularly in near riverine areas when drought exceeds a certain threshold. Additionally, climate shifts determined the changing trend of NDVI across the region, while the effect of land use change is localized and predominant in the northeastern part of the study region. These findings offer an insight into appropriate water regulation of the Yellow River and on climatic adaptation within the YRD.","[Niu, Beibei; Zhang, Zixuan; Yu, Xinyang; Li, Xinju] Shandong Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhen] Wuhan Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Loaiciga, Hugo A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Peng, Sha] Hubei Univ Econ, Sch Low Carbon Econ, Wuhan 430205, Peoples R China",Shandong Agricultural University; Wuhan University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Hubei University of Economics,"Li, XJ (corresponding author), Shandong Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China.",xinjuli@sdau.edu.cn,"Wang, Zhen/V-2219-2019; Wang, Zhen/V-2047-2019; Niu, Beibei/AAA-2144-2020","Wang, Zhen/0000-0002-7902-4093; Niu, Beibei/0000-0002-0197-5454",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41807004]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M622237],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41807004) and project funded by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2017M622237).,,41,3,5,9,44,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

We assessed this in a paediatric population from a highly urbanized tropical city-state. Methods: We analysed all reports of HPIV infections in children <5 years old obtained from a major specialist women and children's hospital in Singapore. Assuming a negative binomial distribution and using multivariable fractional polynomial modelling, we examined the relations between climate variability, air quality and the risk of HPIV infections, adjusting for time-varying confounders. Results: We identified 6393 laboratory-confirmed HPIV infections from 2009 to 2019. Every 1 <degrees>C decline in temperature was associated with a 5.8% increase (RR: 0.943, 95% Confidence Interval [95% CI]: 0.903-0.984) in HPIV infection risk 6 days later. Every 10% decrease in relative humidity was associated with a 15.8% cumulative increase in HPIV risk over the next 6 days (cumulative RR: 0.842, 95% CI: 0.771-0.919). Rainfall was positively associated with HPIV risk 2 days later (RR: 1.021, 95% CI: 1.000-1.043). A within-year seasonal rise of HPIV was driven by HPIV-3 and HPIV-1 and preceded by a seasonal decline in temperature. Gender was an effect modifier of the climate-HPIV relationship. Air quality was not associated with HPIV risk. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a close association between HPIV infection risk and tropical climate variability. The climate dependence and seasonal predictability of HPIV can inform the timing of community campaigns aimed at reducing infection risk and the development of hospital resources and climate adaption plans.","[Soh, Stacy; Aik, Joel] Natl Environm Agcy, Environm Epidemiol & Toxicol Div, 40 Scotts Rd,Environm Bldg 13-00, Singapore 228231, Singapore; [Loo, Liat Hui; Maiwald, Matthias] KK Womens & Childrens Hosp, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, 100 Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 229899, Singapore; [Loo, Liat Hui; Maiwald, Matthias] Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, 8 Coll Rd, Singapore 169857, Singapore; [Jamali, Natasha] Natl Environm Agcy, Environm Monitoring & Modelling Div, 40 Scotts Rd 13-00, Singapore 228231, Singapore; [Maiwald, Matthias] Yong Loo Lin Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, NUHS Tower Block,1E Kent Ridge Rd Level 11, Singapore 119228, Singapore; [Aik, Joel] Duke NUS Med Sch, Prehosp & Emergency Res Ctr, 8 Coll Rd, Singapore 169857, Singapore",KK Women's & Children's Hospital; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Aik, J (corresponding author), Natl Environm Agcy, Environm Epidemiol & Toxicol Div, 40 Scotts Rd,Environm Bldg 13-00, Singapore 228231, Singapore.",stacy_soh@nea.gov.sg; loo.liat.hui@kkh.com.sg; Natasha_Jamali@nea.gov.sg; matthias.maiwald@singhealth.com.sg; joel_aik@nea.gov.sg,,"Maiwald, Matthias/0000-0001-5448-8417; Soh, Stacy/0000-0002-4503-7419",,,,,28,1,1,1,5,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1438-4639,1618-131X,,INT J HYG ENVIR HEAL,Int.

In D. melanogaster, the cosmopolitan inversion In(3R)Payne exhibits latitudinal clines on multiple continents. As many fitness traits show similar clines, it is tempting to hypothesize that In(3R)P underlies observed clinal patterns for some of these traits. In support of this idea, previous work in Australian populations has demonstrated that In(3R)P affects body size but not development time or cold resistance. However, similar data from other clines of this inversion are largely lacking; finding parallel effects of In(3R)P across multiple clines would considerably strengthen the case for clinal selection. Here, we have analysed the phenotypic effects of In(3R)P in populations originating from the endpoints of the latitudinal cline along the North American east coast. We measured development time, egg-to-adult survival, several size-related traits (femur and tibia length, wing area and shape), chill coma recovery, oxidative stress resistance and triglyceride content in homokaryon lines carrying In(3R)P or the standard arrangement. Our central finding is that the effects of In(3R)P along the North American cline match those observed in Australia: standard arrangement lines were larger than inverted lines, but the inversion did not influence development time or cold resistance. Similarly, In(3R)P did not affect egg-to-adult survival, oxidative stress resistance and lipid content. In(3R)P thus seems to specifically affect size traits in populations from both continents. This parallelism strongly suggests an adaptive pattern, whereby the inversion has captured alleles associated with growth regulation and clinal selection acts on size across both continents.","[Kapun, M.; Schmidt, C.; Durmaz, E.; Flatt, T.] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Schmidt, P.

Through our research and design project; we have outlined the need to break free from the uncanny feeling caused by the specific phenomena which make territories more fragile and vulnerable to extreme weather and climate events. The design process illustrated, which involved a small town in central-western Sardinia, is an example of how the construction of a new urban landscape and architecture can take place starting, not only from the contingent risks of emergency situations, but rather from the recognition of any potential risks. With the goal of setting up an open and sustainable territorial plan, the case study has been designed as an approach to climate adaptation even if in Sardinia the link between climate change and flood risk has not been studied in depth and no evidence of this link has yet emerged. The project scenarios of an urban plan for one of the local governments in Sardinia, highlighted in the paper, has been conceived as a path of coevolution between new urban transformations and ecological dynamics of the environment.","[Sanna, Gianfranco; Serreli, Silvia; Biddau, Giovanni Maria] Univ Sassari, Dept Architecture Design & Urban Planning, I-07100 Sassari, Italy",University of Sassari,"Biddau, GM (corresponding author), Univ Sassari, Dept Architecture Design & Urban Planning, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",giasanna@uniss.it; serreli@uniss.it; gmbiddau@uniss.it,,"BIDDAU, Giovanni Maria/0000-0001-6879-8942",University of Sassari,University of Sassari,The paper is funded with the support of the University of Sassari through the one-off fund for research 2019.,,34,0,0,2,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2020,12,20,,,,,,,8714,10.3390/su12208714,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12208714,,,30,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OI2OL,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000583124400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In East Asia, a variety of initiatives have emerged in recent years with different levels of institutional support. Focusing on Taipei, where a vibrant urban agriculture movement has been unleashed in recent years, this article examines the ongoing outcomes of the city's new 'Garden City Initiative', which supports the establishment of urban gardens including community gardens, rooftop gardens and school gardens. Based on interviews and participant observations during the initial period of advocacy, planning and implementation between 2014 and 2017, this study examines the background of the programme, the involvement of governmental and non-governmental actors and the programme's ongoing implementation. Based on the findings, the article further reflects upon their implications for the practices of urban governance in the face of contemporary environmental, political and social challenges. The case of Taipei suggests a model in which policy formation and implementation may require opportunistic actions involving a variety of actors and organisations in both institutions and the civil society. Rather than dramatic changes or instant institutional realignment, the effort may require strategic adaptation of the existing bureaucratic structure, while mobilising its strengths and resources. In addition, despite the critical role of civil society organisations, the Taipei case also illustrates a considerable public-sector investment, distinct from the predominant model of neoliberal governance that has been associated with urban gardening programmes elsewhere.","[Hou, Jeffrey] Univ Washington, Dept Landscape Architecture, Box 355734, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Hou, J (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Landscape Architecture, Box 355734, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jhou@uw.edu,,,,,,,52,25,25,5,48,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0042-0980,1360-063X,,URBAN STUD,Urban Stud.,MAY,2020,57,7,,,SI,,1398,1416,,10.1177/0042098018778671,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0042098018778671,,,19,Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,LN4MU,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000532914400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite that cities cover only < 3% of the Earth's land surface area, they emerged as focal points of human activities, and confront numerous environmental challenges as a result of changes in landscapes, hydroclimate, ecosystems, and biodiversity. In particular, the built environment usually experiences exacerbated heat stress induced by global climate and landscape changes, commonly known as the urban heat island effect. Urban irrigation, as a climate adaptation and mitigation strategy, is effective in cooling the built environment, but exhibits large uncertainties in the trade-off between water use and heat mitigation capacity. Here we show the efficiency of cooling effect induced by irrigation of urban vegetation, represented by a novel metric, viz. urban water capacity, analogous to the heat capacity, across the contiguous United States (CONUS) during summertime via numerical simulations. The urban water capacity is calculated as the average irrigation depth per degree of urban temperature reduction; the values are 4.52 +/- 0.77 mm day(-1) degrees C-1 and 7.27 +/- 1.27 mm day(-1) degrees C-1 (mean +/- standard deviation) for surface and near-surface air cooling, respectively, over the CONUS. The robustness of urban water capacity is further exemplified in an extreme heat wave event, during which the warming anomaly is partially offset by the additional cooling from urban irrigation. Estimates of water capacity provide a quantitative metric for evaluating the efficacy of irrigation in urban planning under current heat stress and future warming.","[Wang, Chenghao; Wang, Zhi-Hua] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainable Engn & Built Environm, POB 875306, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Yang, Jiachuan] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Wang, ZH (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainable Engn & Built Environm, POB 875306, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",zhwang@asu.edu,"Wang, Chenghao/O-7961-2017; Jiachuan, Yang/ABE-5045-2020","Wang, Chenghao/0000-0001-8846-4130; yang, jiachuan/0000-0002-3890-5628",U.S. National Science Foundation,U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The authors would like to acknowledge high-performance computing support from Cheyenne provided by National Center for Atmospheric Research's Computational and Information Systems Laboratory, sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation.",,45,25,25,9,41,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0198-9715,1873-7587,,COMPUT ENVIRON URBAN,Comput.

As part of an ongoing collaborative modeling research program in the river system, researchers conduct annual interviews with key local water managers to characterize local climate adaptation strategies and implementation barriers, and identify science information needs to prioritize ongoing research activities. This article presents new findings from a third wave of interviews conducted with the same water managers following the historic 2017 wet year. Comparison of these data suggests that managers increased their adaptation efforts described during previous consecutive drought years (2015 and 2016). In 2017, comparatively fewer managers described climate uncertainty as an implementation barrier, exemplifying recent hydroclimate variability as the new normal climate for which they should plan. An assessment of recent conditions reveals that recent water years bound historical observations and are consistent with estimated paleoclimate extremes in terms of magnitude, but not persistence, of both dry and wet conditions. Comparison to projected future climate conditions affirms managers' perspectives that increased hydroclimate variability, inclusive of drought and flood extremes, defines the new normal climate anticipated for the region. To support long-term adaptation planning, managers requested that researchers prioritize simulations of alternative water management strategies that account for nonstationary climate patterns and quantify implications system-wide. This article illustrates how interdisciplinary research that integrates local knowledge with applied climate science research can support adaptive water management in snow-fed river systems.","[Sterle, Kelley] Univ Nevada, Global Water Ctr & Cooperat Extens, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Hatchett, Benjamin J.] Desert Res Inst, Div Atmospher Sci, Reno, NV USA; [Hatchett, Benjamin J.] Western Reg Climate Ctr, Reno, NV USA; [Singletary, Loretta] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ & Cooperat Extens, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Pohll, Greg] Desert Res Inst, Div Hydrol Sci, Reno, NV USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); Desert Research Institute NSHE; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); Desert Research Institute NSHE,"Sterle, K (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Global Water Ctr & Cooperat Extens, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",ksterte@unr.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Earth Sciences Water Sustainability and Climate program [1360506]; U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) [2014-67003-22105]; U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) [G14AP00076]; Southwest Climate Adaptation Science Center (SWCASC); NIFA [2014-67003-22105, 688130] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Earth Sciences Water Sustainability and Climate program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA); U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)(United States Geological Survey); Southwest Climate Adaptation Science Center (SWCASC); NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"The authors acknowledge local water managers across the Truckee-Carson river system who contributed substantively to this study.

However, in order to maximize outcomes, both scholars and practitioners are increasingly calling for more integrated and synergetic approaches. Unfortunately, related research remains scarce and fragmented, and there is a lack of systematic investigation into the necessary institutional conditions and processes. Against this background, this paper develops a framework to assess and support the joint institutionalization of climate adaptation and mitigationhere called adaptigationin city administrations. This pioneering framework draws upon four key features of bureaucracies: organizational structure, visions and goals, actors, and technology and tools. Illustrated by pilot applications to the cities of Wurzburg (Germany) and Mwanza (Tanzania), the framework provides a robust basis for future research, policy recommendations, and the development of context-specific guidelines for national and local decision-makers and officials. It highlights the importance of (i) clearly defined procedures for the implementation of adaptigation into urban planning processes (e.g., with the active involvement of stakeholders in the form of working groups or roundtable discussions), (ii) locally relevant goals and visions, established in collaboration with stakeholders, and (iii) the creation of mitigation and adaptation structures that are supported by the appropriate level of human resources, both within and outside city administrations. In this context, global, supranational, and national institutions play an important role in supporting institutionalization by providing targeted funding and promoting adaptigation, which requires the development of integrated goals, visions, and legislation.","[Goepfert, Christian; Lang, Werner] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Energy Efficient & Sustainable Design & Bldg, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Wamsler, Christine] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainable Studies LUCSUS, Box 170, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Technical University of Munich; Lund University,"Gopfert, C (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Inst Energy Efficient & Sustainable Design & Bldg, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",christian.goepfert@tum.de; Christine.wamsler@lucsus.lu.se; w.lang@tum.de,"Lang, Werner X./Q-2152-2018; Göpfert, Christian Peter/A-6173-2016","Lang, Werner X./0000-0002-6593-8388; Göpfert, Christian Peter/0000-0002-1399-8020",,,,,95,25,25,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Similar to the qanat, the aflaj taps into the natural water table and uses a gravity system to channel water through underground channels to villages. Traditional techniques of water management, such as the aflaj, represents a way of adapting to and coping with difficult climates which have persisted for millennia. However, knowledge systems have often 'decayed' with the onset of modernity. These management systems, which developed concurrently with early Omani date palm cultivation, have defined customary and hereditary water rights which are in decline. This article uses Ostrom's Common Pool Resource (CPR) framework, which prioritises the collective management of shared resources to maximise the benefit for all involved and avoid diminishing benefits that are created by the pursuit of individual goals. Using this framework, this article's evaluation of the literature found that traditional aflaj management systems have a great capacity to evolve and, therefore, the aflaj represents both a dying system, and a potential for climate adaptation. Historically, Oaf have been managed by ancient water users associations, which provide social controls and govern usage norms. The findings of this review are that the aflaj system's ability to respond to pressures of modernity from competing institutions, including markets, and embedded social capital mechanisms will influence its capacity to mitigate uncertain hydrology and climate. This article suggests ways in which the management of the aflaj can adapt to a multiple institutional framework to 'transform' collective water management.","[Remmington, Grace] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, South Pk Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of Oxford,"Remmington, G (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, South Pk Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",g.e.remmington@cranfield.ac.uk,,,,,,,44,6,6,5,40,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0140-1963,1095-922X,,J ARID ENVIRON,J.

We undertake a political analysis of CA in Zambia that combines a qualitative case study of a flagship CA initiative with a quantitative analysis of a nationally representative dataset on agricultural practices. This analysis moves from an investigation of the knowledge politics to a study of how the political agendas of the actors involved are shaping agrarian practices. From its initial focus on CA as soil conservation and sustainable agriculture, the framing of the initiative has evolved to accommodate shifting trends in the policy arena. In tandem with the increased focus on climate adaptation, we see an increased emphasis on private sector-led modernisation. The initiative has shifted its target group from the poorest smallholders to prospective commercial farmers, and has forged connections between its farmer-to-farmer extension network and private input suppliers and service providers. The link between CA and input intensification is reflected in national statistics as a significantly higher usage of herbicides, pesticides and mineral fertilizer on fields under CA tillage compared to other fields. We argue that the environmental and participation agendas are used to buttress CA as an environmentally and socially sustainable agricultural development strategy, while the prevailing practice is the result of a common vision for a private sector-led agricultural development shared between the implementing organisation, the donor and international organisations promoting a new green revolution in Africa.","[Westengen, Ola Tveitereid] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragr, N-1430 As, Norway; [Nyanga, Progress; Chibamba, Douty] Univ Zambia, Sch Nat Sci, Geog & Environm Studies Dept, Pb 32379, Lusaka, Zambia; [Guillen-Royo, Monica] Univ Oslo, Ctr Technol Innovat & Culture, Pb 1108, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Banik, Dan] Univ Oslo, Ctr Dev & Environm, Pb 1116, N-0317 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; University of Zambia; University of Oslo; University of Oslo,"Westengen, OT (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragr, N-1430 As, Norway.",ola.westengen@nmbu.no,,"Nyanga, Progress H/0000-0002-7554-7129",Research Council of Norway,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"This research is funded by the Research Council of Norway.

The Three-North Shelter Forest Program, the largest ecological afforestation program worldwide, was launched in 1978 and will last until 2050 in the Three-North regions (accounting for 42.4 % of China's territory). Shelter forests of the Three-North Shelter Forest Program have exhibited severe decline after planting in 1978 due to lack of detailed climatic classification. Besides, a comprehensive assessment of climate adaptation for the current shelter forests was lacking. In this study, the aridity index determined by precipitation and reference evapotranspiration was employed to classify climatic zones for the afforestation program. The precipitation and reference evapotranspiration with 1-km resolution were estimated based on data from the tropical rainfall measuring mission and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer, respectively. Then, the detailed climatic classification for the afforestation program was obtained based on the relationship between the different vegetation types and the aridity index. The shelter forests in 2008 were derived from Landsat TM in the Three-North regions. In addition, climatic zones and shelter forests were corrected by comparing with natural vegetation map and field surveys. By overlaying the shelter forests on the climatic zones, we found that 16.30 % coniferous forests, 8.21 % broadleaved forests, 2.03 % mixed conifer-broadleaved forests, and 10.86 % shrubs were not in strict accordance with the climate conditions.

Based on the results from simulating a neighborhood design proposed for New Cairo, Egypt, we develop a conceptual framework and an environmental simulation workflow aimed at achieving Climate Change-conscious Urban Neighborhood Design (C3UND). Central to the C3UND approach is the coupling of neighborhood outdoor simulation and building indoor simulation and taking into account climate change scenarios as projected by today's meteorological modeling. Utilizing two existing software systems, ENVI-met for urban neighborhood outdoor simulation and Ecotect for building indoor simulation, we demonstrate how a workflow can be implemented to play out climate change scenarios on urban neighborhoods and the buildings located within. The C3UND simulation framework and workflow was further applied to a neighborhood site at the Sheffield University campus in England with weather data input of the present day (2012) and of the 2050s generated by the CCWorldWeatherGen tool. Our current study suggests that environmental simulation of climate change scenarios at an urban neighborhood scale is currently achievable but not without considerable gaps. Use of additional three-dimensional virtual neighborhood models, for instance, is required to bring outdoor and indoor simulation outcomes together through graphic overlay to enable more intuitive and holistic understanding of potential climate change impacts. The implications of the C3UND framework for sustainable urban and architecture design are discussed, leading to a list of research questions to be further investigated.","[Peng, Chengzhi; Elwan, Amr] Univ Sheffield, Sch Architecture, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Peng, CZ (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Sch Architecture, Arts Tower,Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",c.peng@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Peng, Chengzhi/0000-0001-8199-0955","Egyptian Government PhD Scholarship through the Military Technical College, Cairo, Egypt","Egyptian Government PhD Scholarship through the Military Technical College, Cairo, Egypt","The second author of the paper is supported by an Egyptian Government PhD Scholarship awarded through the Military Technical College, Cairo, Egypt.",,34,9,9,0,40,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0037-5497,1741-3133,,SIMUL-T SOC MOD SIM,Simul.-Trans.

Defining such a critical role for vernacular studies has led to different approaches in the design of the contemporary architecture of Iran. The first approach of integrating vernacular and contemporary designs has focused on local people, their needs, local construction, and building materials. The revival of vernacular architectural design and building elements has been at the forefront of this approach in Iran. However, recent use in Iran has concentrated on the symbolic/abstract reuse of vernacular building forms. Vernacular architecture is known to merely provide for the functional requirements of buildings, and not for aesthetic purposes. Conversely, in the second approach, vernacular building elements are considered to be symbols of local identity. This paper will argue that although the symbolic reuse of vernacular features may not uphold the functional expectations of the vernacular form, this reuse is useful in reviving architectural identity. In addition, underscoring such a different role for vernacular building features in contemporary architecture might help to expand the realm of vernacular studies. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the conversion of vernacular architecture in Iran by focusing on the instance of wind-catchers. Wind-catchers typically were used in residential buildings and are considered potent symbols of climate adaptation. In contemporary architecture, however, a form of wind-catcher has been used as a symbol for local architectural identity. Through this transformation, the essential nature of the wind-catcher has found new life in the contemporary architecture of Iran.","[Sani, Rafooneh Mokhtarshahi; Shotorbani, Payam Mahasti] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Architecture, Mersin, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Sani, RM (corresponding author), Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Architecture, Mersin, Turkey.",r.mokhtarshahi@emu.edu.tr; payam.mahasti@cc.emu.edu.tr,,,,,,,42,2,2,0,3,OPEN HOUSE INT,GREAT BRITAIN,"URBAN INTERNATIONAL PRESS, PO BOX 74, GATESHEAD, TYNE & WEAR, GREAT BRITAIN, NE9 5UZ, ENGLAND",0168-2601,,,OPEN HOUSE INT,Open House Int.,JUN,2013,38,2,,,,,76,87,,,,,,12,Architecture; Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Architecture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,183HB,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000321804000008,View Full Record in Web of Science

New perspectives posit that socio-cognitive factors may be as or more important in motivating individuals to take adaptive actions. Recent research indicates that incorporating insights from motivation theory can enhance theorization of adaptive capacity. Yet unexplored, and what we propose here, is the addition of social identity to models of adaptive capacity and adaptation. To apply this conceptual framework, the first author undertook in-depth interviews with a sample of farmers who had participated in broader surveys the previous year to explore their perceptions of their social identity, climate-related information and its sources, and climate risk. These interviews elicited compelling evidence that social identity mediates between risk perception and adaptation through its influence on motivation. Interviews revealed significant links between social identity and perception of information, risk perception and adaptation, of which the most salient were the relative credibility and legitimacy of information sources (related to us vs. them social group differentiation); the role of coffee organizations; and ethnicity and geographic marginalization. Strong in-group identity and perceptions of potentially influential out-groups such as the scientific community appear to particularly influence perception and use of information. These findings have rich policy implications for adaptation management and merit further investigation to identify how, where and why social identity plays a role in climate-risk perception, motivation and adaptation in other geographic areas of vulnerability worldwide.

It also identified the factors affecting the productivity of strawberry. The research also put fingers on identifying different marketing channels prevalent in strawberry supply chain. Primary data were collected from 110 farmers engaged in strawberry cultivation using a well-structured and field pre-tested questionnaire. Descriptive statistics was used to explain the socioeconomic characteristics of the farm households while multiple regression analysis was employed to examine the factors affecting the production of strawberry. The results purported that per acre yield and farm gate price received were 244 mounds and Rs. 1964/40 kg, respectively. Total revenue from strawberry cultivation was estimated as Rs. 478234 and net profit gained from one acre of strawberry was Rs. 250979. Growing strawberry is profitable enterprise as returns are more than double against the cost incurred. The Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) was calculated to be 2.10. The results revealed that the education, land holding, dummy of sowing time, climate adaptation and mitigation, and access to loan were contributing positively and significantly to strawberry production. However, owing the existence of fruits and vegetables market far away from farm showed a negative impact on yield. It is need of the time that educated farmers should be encouraged to engage in the strawberry farming. Policy makers and extension workers should motivate the farmers to increase the acreage under cultivation of strawberry. Farmers should be given guidelines regarding the adaptation measures to cope the vulnerabilities of climate. Easy and timely availability of loan should be ensured to the farmers. Finally, output markets should be developed nearby growing areas to fetch higher prices and reduce transportation cost and post-harvest losses.","[Ali, Asghar; Usman, Muhammad; Bashir, Muhammad Khalid; Arsalan, Muhammad] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Ghafoor, Abdul] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Business Management Sci, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Usman, Muhammad] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Hort Sci, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Javed, Muhammad Ishaq] Ayub Agr Res Inst, Agr Econ Sect, Faisalabad, Pakistan",University of Agriculture Faisalabad; University of Agriculture Faisalabad; University of Agriculture Faisalabad,"Usman, M (corresponding author), Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Faisalabad, Pakistan.;Usman, M (corresponding author), Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Hort Sci, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",usmanghani99@hotmail.com; khalid450@uaf.edu.pk,"Bashir, Muhammad Khalid Khalid/H-9729-2014; Usman, Muhammad/F-1633-2016","Bashir, Muhammad Khalid Khalid/0000-0001-5572-2666; Usman, Muhammad/0000-0002-9827-7838","U.S.-Pakistan Center for Advanced Studies in Agriculture and Food Security (USPCAS-AFS); University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan; Punjab Agricultural Research Board (PARB) [971]","U.S.-Pakistan Center for Advanced Studies in Agriculture and Food Security (USPCAS-AFS); University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan; Punjab Agricultural Research Board (PARB)","The first author acknowledged the financial support of U.S.-Pakistan Center for Advanced Studies in Agriculture and Food Security (USPCAS-AFS), University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan and Punjab Agricultural Research Board (PARB) for this research work under the Project NO. 971.",,31,0,0,0,2,"UNIV AGRICULTURE, FAC VETERINARY SCIENCE",FAISALABAD,"UNIV AGRICULTURE, FAC VETERINARY SCIENCE, FAISALABAD, 00000, PAKISTAN",0552-9034,2076-0906,,PAK J AGR SCI,Pak.

Detecting Barriers and Quantifying Restoration Benefits,PLOS ONE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY; GENE FLOW; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT; PATTERNS; MATTERS; MODEL,"Landscape connectivity is crucial for many ecological processes, including dispersal, gene flow, demographic rescue, and movement in response to climate change. As a result, governmental and non-governmental organizations are focusing efforts to map and conserve areas that facilitate movement to maintain population connectivity and promote climate adaptation. In contrast, little focus has been placed on identifying barriers-landscape features which impede movement between ecologically important areas-where restoration could most improve connectivity. Yet knowing where barriers most strongly reduce connectivity can complement traditional analyses aimed at mapping best movement routes. We introduce a novel method to detect important barriers and provide example applications. Our method uses GIS neighborhood analyses in conjunction with effective distance analyses to detect barriers that, if removed, would significantly improve connectivity. Applicable in least-cost, circuit-theoretic, and simulation modeling frameworks, the method detects both complete (impermeable) barriers and those that impede but do not completely block movement. Barrier mapping complements corridor mapping by broadening the range of connectivity conservation alternatives available to practitioners. The method can help practitioners move beyond maintaining currently important areas to restoring and enhancing connectivity through active barrier removal. It can inform decisions on trade-offs between restoration and protection; for example, purchasing an intact corridor may be substantially more costly than restoring a barrier that blocks an alternative corridor. And it extends the concept of centrality to barriers, highlighting areas that most diminish connectivity across broad networks. Identifying which modeled barriers have the greatest impact can also help prioritize error checking of land cover data and collection of field data to improve connectivity maps. Barrier detection provides a different way to view the landscape, broadening thinking about connectivity and fragmentation while increasing conservation options.","[McRae, Brad H.] Nature Conservancy, N Amer Reg, Seattle, WA USA; [Hall, Sonia A.] Nature Conservancy, Washington Chapter, Wenatchee, WA USA; [Beier, Paul] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Beier, Paul] No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Theobald, David M.] Natl Pk Serv, Inventory & Monitoring Div, Ft Collins, CO USA",Nature Conservancy; Northern Arizona University; Northern Arizona University; United States Department of the Interior,"McRae, BH (corresponding author), Nature Conservancy, N Amer Reg, Seattle, WA USA.",bmcrae@tnc.org,"Hall, Sonia/HLH-3458-2023; Beier, Paul/K-9294-2013","Beier, Paul/0000-0002-4297-4343; Hall, Sonia A/0000-0002-3442-814X",North Pacific Landscape Conservation Cooperative [13170BG105]; Great Northern Landscape Conservation Cooperative [60181AG501],North Pacific Landscape Conservation Cooperative; Great Northern Landscape Conservation Cooperative,"This project was funded by the North Pacific Landscape Conservation Cooperative (www.fws.gov/nplcc; grant #13170BG105) and the Great Northern Landscape Conservation Cooperative (greatnorthernlcc.org; grant #60181AG501).

The carbon value of such management has the potential to provide additional income to rural communities and provide biodiversity and climate adaptation co-benefits. Here, we quantify the carbon stores in a 49,300-ha landscape centered on the cloud forest-grassland transition of the high Andes in Manu National Park, Peru. Aboveground carbon densities were measured across the landscape by field sampling of 70 sites above and below the treeline. The forest near the treeline contained 63.4 +/- A 5.2 Mg C ha(-1) aboveground, with an additional 13.9 +/- A 2.8 Mg C ha(-1) estimated to be stored in the coarse roots, using a root to shoot ratio of 0.26. Puna grasslands near the treeline were found to store 7.5 +/- A 0.7 Mg C ha(-1) in aboveground biomass. Comparing our result to soil data gathered by Zimmermann and others (Ecosystems 13:62-74, 2010), we found the ratio of belowground:aboveground carbon decreased from 15.8 on the puna to 8.6 in the transition zone and 2.1 in the forest. No significant relationships were found between carbon densities and slope, altitude or fire disturbance history, though grazing (for puna) was found to reduce aboveground carbon densities significantly. We scaled our study sites to the study region with remote sensing observations from Landsat. The carbon sequestration potential of improved grazing management and assisted upslope treeline migration was also estimated. Afforestation of puna at the treeline could generate revenues of US $1,374 per ha over the project lifetime via commercialization of the carbon credits from gains in aboveground carbon stocks. Uncertainties in the fate of the large soil carbon stocks under an afforestation scenario exist.","[Gibbon, Adam; Malhi, Yadvinder; Fisher, Joshua B.] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Silman, Miles R.; Farfan, William R.; Garcia, Karina C.] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, Winston Salem, NC 27106 USA; [Meir, Patrick; Zimmermann, Michael; Dargie, Greta C.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Farfan, William R.; Garcia, Karina C.] Univ Nacl San Antonio Abad, Cuzco, Peru",University of Oxford; Wake Forest University; University of Edinburgh; Universidad Nacional de San Antonio Abad del Cusco,"Gibbon, A (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",a.e.gibbon@gmail.com,"Farfan-Rios, William/J-9881-2015; Meir, Patrick/J-8344-2012; Zimmermann, Michael/F-7547-2010","Farfan-Rios, William/0000-0002-3196-0317; Zimmermann, Michael/0000-0002-5162-2008; Fisher, Joshua/0000-0003-4734-9085","Blue Moon Fund; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/F010680/1, NE/G018278/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/G018278/1, NE/F010680/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Blue Moon Fund; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We thank the Blue Moon Fund for support.

Thirteen of these technologies, i.e. auto-responsive technologies (ARTs), were studied for climatic suitability on opaque facades under current and future weather conditions. An expeditious method, that can be used as a pre-design tool, is presented, which allows mapping out the potential use of ARTs in different climates allocating them to thermal adaptive strategies (TAS). Using the Climate consultant tool 6.0, building bioclimatic charts (BBCs) based on hourly weather data, were generated to determine the best passive design strategies (PDS) for nine locations. Correspondence between TAS and some PDS, based on the weather conditions in which they are effective, was proposed in order to assess the ARTs' climatic suitability, i.e., the time percentage in which the analysed strategy, employing specific ARTs, can contribute to occupants' comfort. Cold climates present short suitability times concerning all the studied TAS. Higher suitability times for TAS, exclusively for cooling, were found in Equatorial and Arid climates, which are expected to increase worldwide in the future. The solar reflectance adaptation strategy is expected to increase its suitability time and achieve a more balanced mode of usage (similar heating and cooling times).

Current approaches to study these impacts typically focus on the effect of temperature on all-cause diarrhea while excluding precipitation and diarrhea etiology while not providing actionable adaptation strategies. We develop a partially mechanistic, systems approach to estimate future diarrhea prevalence and design adaptation strategies. The model incorporates downscaled global climate models, water quality data, quantitative microbial risk assessment, and pathogen prevalence in an agent-based modeling framework incorporating precipitation and diarrhea etiology. It is informed using water quality and diarrhea data from Hubli-Dharwad, India a city with an intermittent piped water supply exhibiting seasonal water quality variability vulnerable to climate change. We predict all-cause diarrhea prevalence to increase by 4.9% (Range: 1.5-9.0%) by 2011-2030, 11.9% (Range: 7.1-18.2%) by 2046-2065, and 18.2% (Range: 9.1-26.2%) by 2080-2099. Rainfall is an important modifying factor. Rotavirus prevalence is estimated to decline by 10.5% with Cryptosporidium and E. coli prevalence increasing by 9.9% and 6.3%, respectively, by 2080-2099 in this setting.

In order to better understand how and where major ecological and climatic changes will affect our forested ecosystems, tools based on landscape sensitivity analysis need to be developed to help inform sustainable forest management. This study was undertaken in the Northern Jarrah Forest (NJF) region in the Mediterranean climate of southwest Western Australia. Extreme drought and multiple heatwaves in 2010/2011 resulted in large-scale tree canopy dieback in the NJF. In this study, we used Landsat satellite imagery to (1) accurately map the damaged areas, (2) produce a damage probability model and (3) compare the model with a probability model derived from data collected through an airborne flight survey. We found that the Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was a good indicator of drought/heat induced damage in the NJF region. Both probability models identified the same set of topography and climate-related factors for determining the probability of drought/heat damage within the landscape. Extrapolation of the Landsat satellite method-based model, however, produced a more deterministic and useful drought/heat damage sensitivity map for the NJF region. The techniques and tools developed, and applied, in this study can readily be transferred to other regions around the world and can assist in the sustainable management and timely climate adaptation efforts to accommodate our future forests.","[Brouwers, N.

Localized and timely risk assessments can facilitate coastal communities' preparedness and response to imminent hurricanes. Existing assessment methods focused on hurricane risks at large spatial scales, which were not specific or could not provide actionable knowledge for residents or property owners. Fragility functions and other widely utilized assessment methods cannot model the complex relationships between building features and hurricane risk levels effectively. Therefore, we develop and test a building-level hurricane risk assessment with deep feedforward neural network (DFNN) models. The input features of DFNN models cover the meta building characteristics, fine-grained meteorological, and hydrological environmental parameters. The assessment outcomes, that is, risk levels, include the probability and intensity of building/property damages induced by wind and surge hazards. We interpret the DFNN models with local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). We apply the DFNN models to a case building in Cameron County, Louisiana in response to a hypothetical imminent hurricane to illustrate how the building's risk levels can be timely assessed with the updating weather forecast. This research shows the potential of deep-learning models in integrating multi-sourced features and accurately predicting buildings' risks of weather extremes for property owners and households. The AI-powered risk assessment model can help coastal populations form appropriate and updating perceptions of imminent hurricanes and inform actionable knowledge for proactive risk mitigation and long-term climate adaptation.","[Wang, Yan] Univ Florida, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, POB 115706, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Univ Florida, Florida Inst Built Environm Resilience, Coll Design Construct & Planning, Gainesville, FL USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Wang, Y (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, POB 115706, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.;Wang, Y (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Florida Inst Built Environm Resilience, POB 115706, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",yanw@ufl.edu,"Gao, Shangde/GRJ-9813-2022","Gao, Shangde/0000-0003-2218-2872",University of Florida faculty start-up funds,University of Florida faculty start-up funds,"This material is based upon work supported by the University of Florida faculty start-up funds.

An essential element is the availability of accurate observations of sea level. Sea level data in the Republic of Ireland, prior to the establishment of the National Tide Gauge Network in the mid-2000s, are limited but belie a wealth of historical data available in archival form. In this study, we digitize records located in Cork Harbour, Ireland, from 1842 and show how short-duration (6-8 weeks), high-quality data with a large interval to the present can accurately inform tidal and mean sea level changes. We consider error sources in detail. We estimate for the main M2 tidal constituent that the accuracy of these historical measurements is 1% and 2 min for amplitude and phase, respectively, once adjustments for seasonal and nodal effects are made. Our mean sea level estimates are accurate to the 2 cm level, once adjustments for atmospheric and seasonal effects are made. Our results show tidal stability with a 2% change in the amplitude of the M2 component, 4 min change in the phase over a period of 177 years, and mean sea level rise of 40 cm in the Cork Harbour area from 1842 to 2019, approximately in line with global mean sea level trends plus local glacial isostatic adjustment. More broadly, we show that with careful seasonal, nodal, and atmospheric corrections, together with knowledge of benchmark provenance, these historic, survey-oriented data can accurately inform of sea level changes.","[Pugh, David T.; Hogarth, Peter; Woodworth, Philip L.] Natl Oceanog Ctr, Joseph Proudman Bldg,6 Brownlow St, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Bridge, Edmund] Off Publ Works, Jonathan Swift St, Trim, Co Meath, Ireland; [Edwards, Robin] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dublin, Co Dublin, Ireland; [Westbrook, Guy] Marine Inst, Oranmore, Co Galway, Ireland; [McCarthy, Gerard D.] Maynooth Univ, Dept Geog, ICARUS, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland",NERC National Oceanography Centre; Trinity College Dublin; Marine Institute Ireland; Maynooth University,"McCarthy, GD (corresponding author), Maynooth Univ, Dept Geog, ICARUS, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.",gerard.mccarthy@mu.ie,,"McCarthy, Gerard Daniel/0000-0002-2363-0561",A4 project - Irish Marine Institute under the Marine Research Programme - Irish Government [PBA/CC/18/01],A4 project - Irish Marine Institute under the Marine Research Programme - Irish Government,"Sea level data archaeology is an interesting and scientifically rewarding pursuit, but it is neither simple nor usually direct.

An apt adaptation strategy to cope with climate change calls for informed people's participation, which was rarely investigated in the western Himalayas. Having been better informed, people in developed areas adopt better actions against climate change that are well guided by their perception. In contrast, Rajouri in Jammu and Kashmir represents a relatively impoverished and climate change-vulnerable region. Therefore, we gauged people's perceptions and actions in this area from a household survey from 717 randomly selected individuals. Further, consistency of perception was compared with meteorological records on temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and aboveground biomass from 1983 to 2013. The findings revealed that temperature increased significantly while changes in rainfall, wind speed, and relative humidity were insignificant. Although people sensed a rise in temperature and deforestation correctly, most of them differ with respect to rainfall, wind speed, and humidity. They reported rising pollution and traffic but no change in crop productivity or crop varieties. Of the respondents, 91% considered climate change as a risk, 86.8% reported reactive actions to it, and 82.8% reported proactive actions. Locals from varied socioeconomic backgrounds are not much informed about climate change; hence, the reasonability of their responses and positive adaptation actions needs further research. To engage people in climate adaptation actions, we suggest disseminating precise scientific information about local climate through awareness programs and by engaging them in climate change activities through suitable organizations.","[Zeeshan, Mohd; Zhang, Huanyuan; Sha, Liqing; Palingamoorthy, Gnanamoorthy; Phyo, Zayar] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Mengla, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Huanyuan; Azeez, P.

These parametric tools are calculative market devices used to commodify risk and facilitate its distantiated exchange via insurance markets. Yet the environmental estimates they generate are frequently wrong, sometimes grossly so. This paper investigates what happens after calculative market devices fail, analyzing so-called ex gratia (from grace) practices in which insurers make payouts to aggrieved clients even when none are due under contractual terms. Though these payments are commonly deployed to dispel discontent, these public secrets of the industry have gone unnoticed in insurance scholarship. This paper documents numerous ex gratia payouts in parametric programs across Africa, disputing the myth of autonomous insurance markets that function according to formal, transparent rules administered by dispassionate calculative devices. Instead, these discretionary monetary transfers reintroduce human decision making in informal, black-boxed ways, cloaking the inadequacy of the parametric contracts they shore up. Far from incidental, I argue that these practices have been constitutive of the parametric insurance market's persistence and expansion. Though ex gratia payments sometimes give rise to negotiations over indemnification with aggrieved collectivities, these unfold on insurers' terms, informalizing power and delegitimizing complaint. The growing emphasis on parametric insurance as a tool for climate adaptation makes it all the more important to excavate the mechanics and politics of ex gratia, and to relinquish expectations that geospatial algorithms alone can resolve questions of post-disaster redistribution.","[Johnson, Leigh] Univ Oregon, Dept Geog, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of Oregon,"Johnson, L (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Geog, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",leighj@uoregon.edu,,,Swedish Research Council [2015-01694],Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"Foremost thanks go to the insurance and development practitioners who continue to open their worlds to me, and to long-term collaborators at the International Livestock Research Institute.

The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro and in vivo the relative efficacy of the three main anthelmintics used to control gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) in hair sheep. Naturally infected ewes and lambs experimentally infected with 100 larvae (L-3) of Haemonchus contortus and Cooperia curticei per kg body weight were used. Sheep were treated with 10 mg kg(-1) albendazole, 7,5 mg kg(-1) levamisole or 0,2 mg kg-1 ivermectin. Positive faecal samples were cultured to obtain infective larvae (L3). Larvae of C. curticei and H. contortus were tested in vitro and data were analyzed using the PROBIT procedure. Also, the relative anthelmintic efficacy was evaluated by faecal egg reduction test (FECRT). The results of the FECRT showed 30% of levamisole efficacy while efficacies of and 87%. 64% and 65% were observed for ivermectin, albendazole and commercial combination of ivermectin + levamisole (Iv+L), respectively.

Earth system modeling is needed to help understand changes in interacting subsystems, elucidate the influence of human activities, and explorepossible future changes. Integrated assessment of environment and human development is arguably the mast difficult and most important systems problem faced. To illustrate this approach, we present results from the integrated global system model (IGSM), which consists of coupled submodels addressing economic development, atmospheric chemistry, climate dynamics, and ecosystem processes. An uncertainty analysis implies that without mitigation policies, the global average surface temperature may rise between 3.5 degrees C and 7.4 degrees C from 1981-2000 to 2091-2100(90% confidence limits). Polar temperatures, absent policy, are projected to rise from about 6.4 degrees C to 14 degrees C (90% confidence limits). Similar analysis of four increasingly stringent climate mitigation policy cases involving stabilization of greenhouse gases at various levels indicates that the greatest effect of these policies is to lower the probability of extreme changes. The IGSM is also used to elucidate potential unintended environmental consequences of renewable energy at large scales. There are significant reasons for attention to climate adaptation in addition to climate mitigation that earth system models can help inform. These models can also be applied to evaluate whether climate engineering is a viable option or a dangerous diversion. We must prepare young people to address this issue: The problem of preserving a habitable planet will engage present and future generations. Scientists must improve communication if research is to inform the public and policy makers better.","[Prinn, Ronald G.] MIT, Ctr Global Change Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Prinn, Ronald G.] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Prinn, RG (corresponding author), MIT, Ctr Global Change Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",rprinn@mit.edu,,,"US Department of Energy; US National Science Foundation; Federal, Industrial, and Foundation Sponsors of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change","US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Federal, Industrial, and Foundation Sponsors of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change","I thank the two anonymous, reviewers whose comments helped to improve the paper significantly.

First, over the course of a year, sample dwellings and short-term on-site indoor physical environment measurements were selected from the local climate. Then, three building materials, namely, brick, wood, and rammed earth, and different structural forms were selected to simulate the indoor thermal environment, ventilation conditions, and energy consumption of traditional dwellings. The study also summarised the advantages and disadvantages of the physical environment of traditional dwellings in response to climate characteristics. The results showed that the fluctuation in indoor temperature and humidity of typical dwellings in the North Dong region is approximately 5 degrees C, which is 14% lower than that outdoors. Traditional Dong dwellings have good indoor conditioning abilities. Traditional wood structure dwellings can save 26% and 39% of energy per year compared with those of raw earth and brick wood, respectively. Traditional dwellings in the Dong region are well adapted to the local climate in terms of form, materials, and structure and contribute to climate-responsive buildings in the harsh climatic conditions of the region. The solutions used in these dwellings can also be used to design new climate-responsive buildings; however, the indoor thermal comfort is not entirely satisfactory.

As extreme weather events become more frequent and intense, home insurance has been identified by governments as a critical tool for climate adaptation and disaster resilience. However, the growing research literature on the interactions between household insurance and extreme climatic events has not previously been systematically reviewed. In this paper, we analyse 175 original peer-reviewed empirical research papers on this subject, published between 2009 and 2018. We identify areas of research focus, themes, spatial and temporal patterns, and knowledge gaps, and examine policy implications of these findings. We find that an overall focus on flood insurance leaves unanswered questions about the different insurantial challenges posed by storms and wildfire. We suggest existing technocratic and calculative insurance narratives obscure the political and moral assumptions embedded within them, and that these assumptions warrant further investigation in the context of socially legitimate insurance against the impact of extreme weather events.","[Lucas, Chloe H.; Booth, Kate I.; Garcia, Carolina] Univ Tasmania, Geog Planning & Spatial Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Lucas, CH (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Geog Planning & Spatial Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",chloe.lucas@utas.edu.au; kate.booth@utas.edu.au; carolina.garcia@utas.edu.au,"Lucas, Chloe/E-7835-2019; Booth, Kate/J-7622-2014","Lucas, Chloe/0000-0002-0834-1622; Booth, Kate/0000-0002-3102-6356",Australian Research Council [DP170100096],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DP170100096.",,86,1,1,2,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Here, a North American-scale convection- permitting model which is able to realistically simulate MSCs4 is used to investigate their change by the end-of-century under RCP8.5 (ref. (5)). A storm-tracking algorithm(6) indicates that intense summertime MCS frequency will more than triple in North America. Furthermore, the combined effect of a 15-40% increase in maximum precipitation rates and a significant spreading of regions impacted by heavy precipitation results in up to 80% increases in the total MCS precipitation volume, focussed in a 40 km radius around the storm centre. These typically neglected increases substantially raise future flood risk.

The current vegetation is a mosaic of different age communities and of various floristic components. Since a few decades, certain sections of the island have been put under protection in order to ensure the preservation of a minimum of biodiversity. These areas, protected or considered as such, are controlled by the Coastal and Lakeside Conservatory, the Regional Natural Parks of Martinique and the National Forestry Board. They concern the different vegetational stages that are conditioned by the bioclimate which typifies the Lesser Antilles. These areas harbour a variety of physiognomically distinct floristic units and occupy different positions on the dynamic scale.

This paper focuses on the Vipava Valley, a sub-Mediterranean agricultural area highly vulnerable to CC, describing the stakeholder landscape approach undertaken to define stakeholder responsibility level in terms of implementing adaptation measures; and it identifies the key challenges facing stakeholder networks at individual measure levels. The strategy for agricultural CC adaptation follows the structure proposed by the European Commission and clearly defines the necessary stakeholder landscape for implementing agricultural CC adaptation measures and indicators for adaptation strategy monitoring and evaluation. The challenges identified in relation to stakeholder interaction cannot be solved by strategy alone; a facilitated approach to policy implementation is necessary, its success being dependent on the ability of the social landscape to develop a firm implementation of a monitoring programme for adaptation to CC at the local municipality level.","[Cvejic, R.; Istenic, M.

Its impacts include erratic and unpredictable seasonal rainfall, floods and cyclones. These impacts are more magnified in marginal rainfed agricultural areas characterized by low and erratic precipitation leading to low and unpredictable levels of crop production. Adaptation to these impacts is increasingly being advocated as a more sustainable response that enhances livelihoods. Through an examination of key debates from climate-science scholars, this paper examines the social research and action priorities that can be pursued in order to build the resilience of rural communities who rely on rainfed agriculture for their livelihoods. The paper examines the nature of adaptation processes and subsequently identifies research themes, action priorities and approaches that can generate more robust responses to climate change at various levels. The study found out that despite the weaknesses identified in Zimbabwean water and agricultural policies, there are a number of specific actions that researchers, policy-makers and communities can take to enhance adaptation capacity. Systematic assessment of rural risk and vulnerability and participatory identification of possible solutions can enable the rural poor to get better access to options, assets and the services they require to improve their livelihoods. This also enables the identification and improvement of more adaptation options that the farmers themselves have already been trying out for many years. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To measure the carbon emissions along the urban supply chain in terms of sectoral and urban horizons, this study tries to build a systematic carbon accounting framework to quantify sectoral indirect upstream supply chain emissions for effective urban carbon mitigation. An urban Three-Tier carbon accounting model has been established based on the Economic input-output life cycle assessment (EIO-LCA) method, concerning Tier 1: direct emissions; Tier 2: emissions from purchased secondary energy resource; and Tier 3: complete supply chain emissions. A case study of Chongqing city was conducted to identify the critical sectors of three tiers that contribute most to total carbon emissions, covering 28 economic sectors during 2002-2007. The results showed that emissions of Tier 1 and Tier 2 included in most protocols only occupy a small fraction (27.8%) of the total emissions of all 3 tiers, especially for industrial sectors. It is concluded that the existing climate-control protocols have underestimated the emissions of each sector and particularly, Tier 3 emissions have to be incorporated when formulating effective urban management strategies and climate adaptation planning. By incorporating the Three-Tier carbon footprint into sectoral input-output accounting framework, this study developed carbon sector specific categorizations to pursue emissions mitigation pathways not just within their own economic activity but also across their supply chain.","[Wang, Saige; Chen, Bin] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Chen, B (corresponding author), 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",chenb@bnu.edu.cn,"Chen, Bin/A-6951-2012","Chen, Bin/0000-0002-5488-6850","National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of China [71725005]; National Key Research & Development Program [2016YFA0602304]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573021, 71628301]; special fund of State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control [18L03ESPC]",National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); National Key Research & Development Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); special fund of State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control,"This work was supported by the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of China (71725005), National Key Research & Development Program (2016YFA0602304), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71573021, 71628301), and special fund of State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control (18L03ESPC).",,64,17,18,6,62,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.

The application of a crisp classification of land-cover types to analyse urban landscape patterns and land surface temperature (LST) in detail presents a challenge, mainly due to the complex characteristics of urban landscapes. In this article, sub-pixel percentage impervious surface areas (ISAs) and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) were extracted from bitemporal Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) data by linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA). Their accuracy was assessed with proportional area estimates of the impervious surface and vegetation extracted from high-resolution data. A range approach was used to classify percentage ISA into different categories by setting thresholds of fractional values and these were compared for their LST patterns. For each ISA category, FVC, LST, and percentage ISA were used to quantify the urban thermal characteristics of different developed areas in the city of Fuzhou, China. Urban LST scenarios in different seasons and ISA categories were simulated to analyse the seasonal variations and the impact of urban landscape pattern changes on the thermal environment. The results show that FVC and LST based on percentage ISA can be used to quantitatively analyse the process of urban expansion and its impacts on the spatial-temporal distribution patterns of the urban thermal environment. This analysis can support urban planning by providing knowledge on the climate adaptation potential of specific urban spatial patterns.","[Zhang, Youshui; Harris, Angela] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Zhang, Youshui] Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Geog, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China; [Balzter, Heiko] Univ Leicester, Ctr Landscape & Climate Res, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Balzter, Heiko] Univ Leicester, Natl Ctr Earth Observat, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Manchester; Fujian Normal University; University of Leicester; University of Leicester,"Zhang, YS (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",zhangyoushui@sina.com,"Balzter, Heiko/B-5976-2008; Harris, Angela/C-6076-2011","Balzter, Heiko/0000-0002-9053-4684; Harris, Angela/0000-0002-2184-0274",China Scholarship Council (CSC) [201208350005]; Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award [2011/R3]; Natural Environment Research Council [nceo020005] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [nceo020005] Funding Source: UKRI,China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award(Royal Society of London); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),This research was supported by a grant from the China Scholarship Council (CSC) [No. 201208350005].

They host high climate mitigation potential and acute climate adaptation vulnerabilities. Scholarship flags conventional urban planning approaches to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C as inadequate. Yet urban sustainability transitions literature features few examples of functioning alternative governance and planning paradigms. This paper assesses one such approach, new municipalism: social movements centred on a democratic transformation of the local economy and state. We combine attention to urban sustainability transitions and new municipalism research to interrogate whether and how the latter can facilitate the provision of leadership and institutional arrangements that enable urban transformation to sustainability. Our desk study considers two prominent examples of new municipalism in Spain, where Barcelona en Comu and Ahora Madrid arose as anti-austerity movements to combat neoliberal urban agendas during the 2010s. We find that the praxis of collective decision-making associated with new municipalism does offer inclusive, innovative policy pathways and the potential to implement experimental knowledge and learning in complex real-world settings at the urban scale. We argue, however, that powerful neoliberal mechanisms impose structural constraints on the very push for deep political change that new municipalist movements embody. By linking transformative climate governance needs with new municipalism movements and wider political economic structuring forces, we explicate the tensions and contested dynamics of institutionalising progressive social movements in the multi-scalar governance of urban sustainability transformation.","[Sareen, Siddharth] Univ Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway; [Waagsaether, Katinka Lund] Univ Bergen, Bergen, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger; University of Bergen,"Sareen, S (corresponding author), Univ Stavanger, Dept Media & Social Sci, Kjell Arholms Gate 23, N-4021 Stavanger, Norway.",siddharth.sareen@uis.no,"Sareen, Siddharth/W-7168-2018","Sareen, Siddharth/0000-0002-0826-7311",Research Council of Norway [321421],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: JPI Climate, ROLES (Responsive Organising for Low Emission Societies) project, and the Research Council of Norway, grant 321421 (ROLES).",,62,2,2,7,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0042-0980,1360-063X,,URBAN STUD,Urban Stud.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/00420980221114968,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00420980221114968,,SEP 2022,19,Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,4J4RT,,Green Published,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000851252800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The integration of future climate projections from general circulation models (GCMs) in the simulations of a hydrologic model, such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), is widely considered as one of the most dependable approaches to assess the impacts of climate alteration on hydrology. The main objective of this study was to assess the potential impacts of climate alteration on the hydrology of the Yarra River catchment in Victoria, Australia, using the SWAT model. The climate projections from five GCMs under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios-RCP 4.5 and 8.5 for 2030 and 2050, respectively-were incorporated into the calibrated SWAT model for the analysis of future hydrologic behaviour against a baseline period of 1990-2008. The SWAT model performed well in its simulation of total streamflow, baseflow, and runoff, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values of more than 0.75 for monthly calibration and validation. Based on the projections from the GCMs, the future rainfall and temperature are expected to decrease and increase, respectively, with the highest changes projected by the GFDL-ESM2M model under the RCP 8.5 scenario in 2050. These changes correspond to significant increases in annual evapotranspiration (8% to 46%) and decreases in other annual water cycle components, especially surface runoff (79% to 93%). Overall, the future climate projections indicate that the study area will become hotter, with less winter-spring (June to November) rainfall and with more water shortages within the catchment.","[Das, Sushil K.; Tariq, Muhammad Atiq Ur Rehman; Muttil, Nitin] Victoria Univ, Coll Engn & Sci, POB 14428, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia; [Ahsan, Amimul; Khan, Md.

Currently, urban soil sealing and conventional rainwater management, which were planned to quickly move rainwater away from roofs and streets, are increasing the flood risk. Green technologies and approaches would permit a reduction in water abstraction and wastewater production while improving urban hydrological response to heavy rains. The Life+ WATACLIC project has been implemented to promote such sustainable technologies and approaches in Italy, however the results show huge difficulties: apparently water saving and sustainable urban water management have only low interest amongst the general public and even with public administrations and the relevant industrial sectors.

Design/methodology/approach This review article first provides a short introduction to the quasi-experimental approach using the potential outcomes framework and then uses studies on the environmental sustainability of agricultural production to illustrate how quasi-experimental methods have been applied. Papers reviewed consist of studies that estimate the environmental externalities from agricultural production, evaluate agri-environmental and other related policies and programs, and demonstrate issues related to on-farm resource use and climate adaptation. Findings Difference-in-differences (DID) and two-way fixed effects methods that utilize the spatial and temporal variation in panel data are widely used to estimate the causal impact of changes in agricultural production and policy on the environment. Utilizing the discontinuities and limits created by agricultural policies and regulations, local treatment effects on land and other input use are estimated using regression discontinuity (RD) or instrumental variable (IV) methods with cross-sectional data. Originality/value Challenges faced by the food systems have made agricultural sustainability more critical than ever. Over the past three decades, the quasi-experimental approach has become the powerhouse of applied economic research. This review article focuses on quasi-experimental studies on the environmental sustainability of agriculture to provide methodological insights and to highlight gaps in the economics literature of agricultural sustainability.","[Zhang, Wei] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Zhang, W (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",wzb@vt.edu,,"Zhang, Wei/0000-0003-2341-8234",USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [1024040],USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"The author is grateful for the helpful comments from the editor Xian Xin and the referees, Baozhong Su and Johh Bovay.

Tools and frameworks to evaluate the vulnerability of agriculture will be key if a plan to minimise vulnerability and maximise resilience is to be created. We use a framework based on a modification of the well-established IPCC vulnerability model (Marshall and Smajgl 2013) to assess the vulnerability of the livestock industry in Eastern Australia to climate change. Using existing data-sets, we show how the framework can be used to holistically quantify and qualify the current and future exposure of the industry to climate-related events, the biophysical and social sensitivity and impacts likely to be experienced, and the current level of adaptive capacity within the context of the livestock industry in eastern Australia. Results suggest that whilst the industry is likely to be sensitive to changes brought about by climate change, it is not necessarily vulnerable if livestock producers can moderate impacts by enhancing their adaptive capacity. Adaptive capacity is examined at the producer and industry level to understand the scope and potential for climate adaptation planning within the industry itself. We discuss six important challenges that the industry must face if it is to manage its vulnerability. Minimising vulnerability within the industry will require careful consideration of the likely ecological, biophysical and socio-economic impacts and an investment in adaptive capacity across scales.","[Marshall, N.

If places and populations are not vulnerable, or susceptible, to climate change, then the climate-migration relationship may not materialize. The key to understanding and, from a policy perspective, planning for whether and how climate change will impact future migration patterns is therefore knowledge of the link between climate vulnerability and migration. However, beyond specific case studies, little is known about this association in global perspective. We therefore provide a descriptive, country-level portrait of this relationship. We show that the negative association between climate vulnerability and international migration holds only for countries least vulnerable to climate change, which suggests the potential for trapped populations in more vulnerable countries. However, when analyzed separately by life supporting sector (food, water, health, ecosystem services, human habitat, and infrastructure) and vulnerability dimension (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity), we detect evidence of a relationship among more, but not the most, vulnerable countries. The bilateral (i.e., country-to-country) migration show that, on average, people move from countries of higher vulnerability to lower vulnerability, reducing global risk by 15%. This finding is consistent with the idea that migration is a climate adaptation strategy. Still, similar to 6% of bilateral migration is maladaptive with respect to climate change, with some movement toward countries with greater climate change vulnerability.","[Grecequet, Martina; DeWaard, Jack; Hellmann, Jessica J.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [DeWaard, Jack] Univ Minnesota, Dept Sociol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [DeWaard, Jack] Univ Minnesota, Minnesota Populat Ctr, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Hellmann, Jessica J.] Univ Minnesota, Coll Biol Sci, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Abel, Guy J.] Shanghai Univ, Sch Sociol & Polit Sci, Asian Demog Res Inst, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China; [Abel, Guy J.] Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna Inst Demog, Wittgenstein Ctr Demog & Global Human Capital, IIASA,OAW,WU, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Shanghai University; Austrian Academy of Sciences; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Grecequet, M (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",mgrecequ@umn.edu; jdewaard@umn.edu; hellmann@umn.edu; guy.abel@oeaw.ac.at,"Abel, Guy/AAH-1753-2021","Abel, Guy/0000-0002-4893-5687; Hellmann, Jessica/0000-0002-4961-0841",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [R24 HD041023],Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),Grant #R24 HD041023 awarded to the Minnesota Population Center at the University of Minnesota by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.,,20,28,28,7,60,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2017,9,5,,,,,,,720,10.3390/su9050720,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9050720,,,10,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EY6XN,29707262,"Green Accepted, gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000404127800045,View Full Record in Web of Science

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is distinct from white adipose tissue (WAT) for its ability to burn, rather than store, energy. BAT uniquely expresses uncoupling protein-1 (abbreviated as UCP1), which diverts the energy produced by cellular respiration to generate heat. While BAT is found in small mammals, hibernators, and newborns, this depot was thought to regress in humans during early postnatal life. Recent studies revealed that human BAT remains metabolically active throughout childhood and even in adulthood, particularly in response to cold exposure. In addition to the constitutive BAT depots present at birth, BAT cells can be induced within WAT depots under specific metabolic and climatic conditions. These cells, called inducible brown fat, brite, or beige fat, are currently the focus of intense investigation as a possible treatment for obesity. Inducible brown fat is associated with higher bone mineral density, suggesting that brown fat interacts with bone growth in previously unrecognized ways. Finally, BAT may have contributed to climatic adaptation in hominins. Here, I review current findings on the role of BAT in thermoregulation, bone growth, and metabolism, describe the potential role of BAT in moderating the obesity epidemic, and outline possible functions of BAT across hominin evolutionary history.

Given the urgency of the climate challenge, NASA's Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) requires all funded investigators to identify and work with stakeholder organizations at project inception to accelerate the transfer of the products developed by funded research into decision making systems. In this study, we contribute to the literature through the implementation of a quantitative analysis of 908 unique survey responses from funded investigators to explore the maturity of the scientist-stakeholder engagement. The paper employs multiple correspondence analysis to provide evidence to support policy options to increase stakeholder integration into research programs. Despite limitations of the dataset used, we demonstrated that multiple funding rounds, long-standing relationships between the stakeholder and scientist, and the scientific productivity of the Principal Investigator, including the ability to produce datasets and research papers on these datasets, all contribute to carbon products moving from research to operational use. The maturity of relationships between scientists and stakeholders was shown to result improved stakeholder engagement. The use of carbon products should be identified in every stage of the program, and that capacity building is needed to support both existing and newly identified stakeholders better understand and use CMS products. As federal, state, and local policy on climate adaptation and mitigation matures, the need for information on carbon will expand. Building of stakeholder-scientist relationships in CMS results in an effective generation and use of datasets to support this need and prototype ways that improved information needed for decision making can be created.","[Brown, Molly E.; Hurtt, George] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Escobar, Vanessa M.] NASA Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Radiometr Calibrat Lab, NOAA NASA GEO XO, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Younis, Fatima M.] Univ Maryland, Dept Govt & Polit, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Carlo, Edil Sepulveda; McGroddy, Megan; Arias, Sabrina Delgado; Griffith, Peter] NASA Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Sci Syst & Applicat, Greenbelt, MD USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Brown, ME (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",mbrown52@umd.edu,"Hurtt, George/A-8450-2012; Brown, Molly/E-2724-2010","Hurtt, George/0000-0001-7278-202X; Delgado Arias, Sabrina/0000-0003-4411-1717; Brown, Molly/0000-0001-7384-3314",NASA Carbon Monitoring System [80NSSC20K0853],NASA Carbon Monitoring System,This research was funded by a 2018 NASA Grant #80NSSC20K0853 from the NASA Carbon Monitoring System.,,38,1,1,3,3,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

It is also an important path of sustainable social development. However, current research methods for architectural space find it difficult to clarify the internal and external relations of space, and the function of architectural space to adapt to the regional climate and cultural heritage is difficult to quantitatively analyze and measure. This study constructs a new research method of architectural interiors/exteriors, takes the traditional residential buildings in Wu-style architecture in the Jinhua area as a case study, summarizes the types and characteristics of the interiors/exteriors of Wu-style architecture, and reveals the spatial construction rules of the internal and external types realizing environmental sustainability and traditional residences. The results show that: (1) the architecture of the Wu style has five typical types of interior/exterior, and the regional representation of its interior/exterior is affected by both the human and the natural environment; (2) influenced by traditional Confucian culture, the architecture of the Wu style shows a central axial secondary buckling type and an enclosed type of interior/exterior form, which has the value of the times to coordinate the relationship between people in today's society; (3) in terms of ventilation, daylighting, and heat dissipation, Wu-style buildings flexibly use the slender gray space form and wide cornice for the internal and external space transition, which effectively improves the ecological efficiency of the buildings' ventilation, lighting, heat dissipation, etc., and has important reference value for the development and utilization of traditional buildings and the architectural design of new dwellings. At present, this new research method for the internal and external spaces of buildings still has considerable potential and needs to be deepened and improved through further research.","[Yan, Dan; Xu, Minghui; Chai, Binbin; Chen, Zhiwen; Bai, Congxia] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Environm Sci, Jinhua 321004, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Normal University,"Chen, ZW (corresponding author), Zhejiang Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Environm Sci, Jinhua 321004, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",yandan@zjnu.cn; xuminghui199812@163.com; cbb011007@163.com; zjjhczw@zjnu.edu.cn; baixue7189@163.com,,,Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LQ20E080008]; National philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China [18BSH089],Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); National philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China,The research is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (LQ20E080008) and National philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China (18BSH089).,,63,0,0,5,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2022,14,9,,,,,,,5140,10.3390/su14095140,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14095140,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1F8JQ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000795408700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to quantify those impacts, it is necessary to understand the changing dynamics of glacial melting, but also to map how glacial meltwater contributes to current and future water use, which often occurs at considerable distance downstream of the terminus of the glacier. While the dynamics of tropical glacial melt are increasingly well understood and documented, major uncertainty remains on how the contribution of tropical glacial meltwater propagates through the hydrological system, and hence how it contributes to various types of human water use in downstream regions. Therefore, in this paper we present a detailed regional mapping of current water demand in regions downstream of the major tropical glaciers. We combine these maps with a regional water balance model to determine the dominant spatiotemporal patterns of the contribution of glacial meltwater to human water use at an unprecedented scale and resolution. We find that the number of users relying continuously on water resources with a high (> 25%) long-term average contribution from glacial melt is low (391 000 domestic users, 398 km(2) of irrigated land, and 11 MW of hydropower production), but this reliance increases sharply during drought conditions (up to 3.92 million domestic users, 2096 km(2) of irrigated land, and 732 MW of hydropower production in the driest month of a drought year). A large proportion of domestic and agricultural users are located in rural regions where climate adaptation capacity tends to be low. Therefore, we suggest that adaptation strategies should focus on increasing the natural and artificial water storage and regulation capacity to bridge dry periods.","[Buytaert, Wouter] Imperial Coll London, Civil & Environm Engn, London, England; [Buytaert, Wouter] Imperial Coll London, Grantham Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Moulds, Simon] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Acosta, Luis] Natl Drinking Water & Sanitat Regulating Agcy, Lima, Peru; [De Bievre, Bert] Water Fund Quito FONAG, Quito, Ecuador; [Olmos, Carlos] Natl Serv Meteorol & Hydrol SENAMHI, La Paz, Bolivia; [Villacis, Marcos] Escuela Politec Nacl, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Quito, Ecuador; [Tovar, Carolina] Royal Bot Gardens, London, England; [Verbist, Koen M.

This article aims to analyze the resilience of agroecological production systems in San Lucas against this reality, as well as their contribution to the food sovereignty of the population. The investigation is carried out in three grassroots organizations of the Loja Agroecological Network, in which resilience indicators are evaluated based on three dimensions of analysis: farmers' perception of climate change, vulnerability measurement, and responsiveness and recovery. From the latter, the criterion of food sovereignty for an individual analysis is extracted, due to the relevance of its contribution within the analyzed theme. When assessing the response and recovery capacity, it is concluded that the parish's agroecological systems present a vulnerability that ranges from medium to low. Therefore, it is necessary to improve parameters such as vegetation cover, riverine forest conservation, and type of irrigation. In relation to food sovereignty, the research identifies that the food system is based primarily on ancestral customs. Even with limitations, agroecological production systems are a resilient alternative to climate change, due to the productive, cultural and organizational characteristics found in the study.","[Nathali Coronel-Alulima, Tatiana] Red Agroecol Loja, Loja, Ecuador",,"Coronel-Alulima, TN (corresponding author), Red Agroecol Loja, Loja, Ecuador.",tana_coronel@yahoo.es,,,,,,,19,1,1,2,11,"FAC LATINOAMERICANA CIENCIAS SOCIALES-FLACSO, ECUADOR",QUITO,"CALLE PRADERA E7-174 & DIEGO ALMAGRO, QUITO, 00000, ECUADOR",1390-6631,,,LET VERDES,Let Verdes,SEP,2019,,26,,,,,191,212,,10.17141/letrasverdes.26.2019.3806,http://dx.doi.org/10.17141/letrasverdes.26.2019.3806,,,22,Environmental Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,IV6MI,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000484382100011,View Full Record in Web of Science

On the basis of an intensive literature review and field research conducted in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam, the paper proposes a substantial linkage between T-learning and sustainability. It first outlines the environmental changes in Vietnam's Mekong Delta, which appear to serve as disorienting dilemmas that force local people to learn and gradually shift their farming practices to align with a climate-resilient development. The paper relies on the outcomes of household surveys, field observations and focus group discussions to explore the impacts of T-learning on building adaptive capacity and sustainability transition in two community-based projects in Can Tho City and Ca Mau province in the Mekong Delta. Our findings reveal that T-learning enables experts and practitioners to introduce new ideas and accordingly mobilize local people to make changes without inciting doubt, dismay or concern. In an ideal T-learning approach, small-scale farmers learn from being under the supervision of experts in field-based schools that offer real-life experience and encourage learners to shift their livelihoods to eco-friendly agricultural practices. The paper sheds new light on how a critical approach to education for sustainable development through T-learning can be, under specific conditions, one strategy. It concludes that T-learning should be acknowledged as a potentially important part of the broader approach to climate-resilient development in vulnerable grassroots communities.","[Nguyen Minh Quang] Can Tho Univ, Can Tho, Vietnam; [de Wit, Joop] Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands",Can Tho University; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Quang, NM (corresponding author), Can Tho Univ, Can Tho, Vietnam.",nmquang@ctu.edu.vn,,"Nguyen Minh, Quang/0000-0002-6786-2065","Erasmus Open Access Fund of International Institute of Social Studies (ISS), Erasmus University Rotterdam","Erasmus Open Access Fund of International Institute of Social Studies (ISS), Erasmus University Rotterdam","This paper was drawn from our articles published in The Diplomat, Asian Journal of Agriculture and Development, and the Mekong Environment Forum's community based climate adaptation project reports.

Based on this paradigm, policies have been developed at various levels to support the most vulnerable family farmers. Nevertheless, given climate change projections in the region, there is a strong need for a better understanding of climate perceptions, their impact on production, and the adjustments undertaken, to identify the main vulnerabilities and adaptation processes that can be fostered by those policies. Based on this, through qualitative interviews, we aimed to understand the perception of these topics by 54 dryland family farmers in the sub medium Sao Francisco Region. In general, most interviewees reported perceptions of climate change over the past 15-20 years, as well as concerns about the future climate. The last drought (2011-2018) resulted in production losses, which mostly led to reactive adjustments to events. Given the statements, it was observed that there is a perception of the need for planning, so that adaptation alternatives prior to the impacts can be carried out. However, several challenges limit the development of a culture of adaptation, including those related to the use and limitations of public policies. Finally, it discusses the need to update some strategies promoted by the paradigm of Living with the Semiarid to incorporate the perspective of climate change and enable the increase in the adaptive capacities of family fanners so that they can anticipate events (adaptation ex-ante) and not just respond to its impacts (ex-post adaptation).","[Mesquita, Patricia dos Santos; Nogueira, Daniela] Observ Dinam Socioambientais Sustentabilidade & A, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Mesquita, Patricia dos Santos; Nogueira, Daniela] Rede CLIMA Sub Rede Desenvolvimento Reg, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Mesquita, Patricia dos Santos; Cavalcante, Louise; Milhorance, Carolina; Nogueira, Daniela] Univ Brasilia UnB, Ctr Desenvolvimento Sustentavel CDS, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Andrieu, Nadine] Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, Paris, France",Universidade de Brasilia; CIRAD,"Mesquita, PD (corresponding author), Observ Dinam Socioambientais Sustentabilidade & A, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.;Mesquita, PD (corresponding author), Rede CLIMA Sub Rede Desenvolvimento Reg, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.;Mesquita, PD (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia UnB, Ctr Desenvolvimento Sustentavel CDS, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",patriciasmesquita@gmail.com,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,0,"UNIV FEDERAL PARANA, EDITORA",PARANA,"RUA JOAO NEGRAO 280, CURITIBA, PARANA, 80060-200, BRAZIL",1518-952X,2176-9109,,DESENVOLV MEIO AMBIE,Desenvolv.

To determine the climate-change-induced impacts, Mike 3 FlowModel FM was used to simulate hydrodynamic and transport processes in the Persian Gulf in both historical (1998-2014) and future periods (2081-2100). Historical simulation was driven by ERA-Interim data. A statistical approach was employed to modify the values and directions of the future wind field obtained from the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 and 8.5 (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively) scenarios derived from CMCC-CM model of the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The numerical model was calibrated and validated using measured data. Results indicated that in the historical period, residence time ranged between values of less than a month in the Strait of Hormuz and 10 years in the semi-enclosed area close to the south of Bahrain. The changes in wind field based on RCP 8.5 scenario were found to be the most disadvantageous for the Persian Gulf's capacity to flush dissolved pollutants out. Under this scenario, residence time would be 17% longer than that of historical one. This is mainly because the change in the wind field is large enough to overwhelm general circulation, showing a relationship between the residence time and the residual circulation. Impact of change in the wind field according to RCP 4.5 scenario on the modeled residence time is negligible. The numerical outputs also showed that the sea-level rise would slightly decrease the current velocity, resulting in a negligible increase in residence time. The findings of this study are intended to support establishing climate-adaptation management plans for coastal zones of the studied area in line with sustainable development goals.

Hard yellow corn (Zea mays L.) is the main source for food processing; therefore, it is necessary to generate hybrids with yields higher than 2.8 t ha-1 and climatic adaptability. Objective. To evaluate and compare the agronomic behavior of five experimental trilinear hybrids of hard yellow corn maize and the Marginal 28T variety in eight tropical Peruvian locations. Materials and methods. The experiment took place in two phases: from March 2018 to March 2019 in four validation plots in San Martin, and from March to December 2019 in four adaptabilities plots in San Martin, Pucallpa, Loreto, and Amazonas. The evaluated variables were: plant and ear height, size and weight of ear, roots lodging, rust resistance, and yield (t ha-1). A randomized complete block design was applied, with a combined analysis of yield genotype x environment interaction with the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction models. Results. The hybrid HTE6 had the highest ear diameter (4.66 cm), ear weight (190, 76 g), number of rows per ear (14.26), grains per row (37.45), total grain weight (156.21 g), and grain yield (7.21 t ha-1). HTE6 showed superior adaptability in Iquitos (9.2 t ha-1) and San Martin (8.1 t ha-1). In the genotype-environmental interaction, it reached 7.18 t ha-1, with the highest stability in the eight localities. Conclusion. Among the five trilinear hybrids and the Marginal 28T variety, the HTE6 had the best agronomic performance and the highest yield in the eight evaluated locations. Thus, it is considered the more suitable trilinear hybrid for the tropical conditions of Peru.","[Diaz-Chuquizuta, Percy; Hidalgo-Melendez, Edison; Mendoza-Paredes, Melbin] Inst Nacl Innovac Agr INIA, Estn Expt Agr El Porvenir, Jr Martinez de Compagnon 1035, Tarapoto, San Martin, Peru; [Cieza-Ruiz, Isaac] Inst Nacl Innovac Agr INIA, Estn Expt Agr Vista Florida, Km 8 Carretera Chiclayo Ferrenafe Km 8 Picsi, Lambayeque, Peru; [Jara-Calvo, Teofilo Wladimir] Inst Nacl Innovac Agr INIA, Estn Expt Agr Andenes, Ave Micaela Bastidas 314, Cuzco, Peru; [Valdes-Rodriguez, Ofelia Andrea] Colegio Veracruz, Carrillo Puerto 26, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico",,"Valdes-Rodriguez, OA (corresponding author), Colegio Veracruz, Carrillo Puerto 26, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico.",pdiaz023@gmail.com; ehidalgo@inia.gob.pe; mmendoza@inia.gob.pe; icieza@inia.gob.pe; wjara@inia.gob.pe; dra.valdes.colver@gmail.com,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,0,UNIV COSTA RICA,SAN JOSE,"CENTRO INVESTIGACIONES AGRONOMICAS, APDO POSTAL 183-4050, SAN JOSE, 00000, COSTA RICA",,2215-3608,,AGRON MESOAM,Agron.

Exposure to rising temperatures in highly vulnerable regions affects populations, ecosystems, and other elements that may suffer potential losses. Here, we evaluate changes in temperature extremes and future population exposure over SEA at global warming levels (GWLs) of 2.0 degrees C and 3.0 degrees C using outputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. Results indicate that temperature extreme indices are projected to increase over SEA at both GWLs, with more significant magnitudes at 3.0 degrees C. However, daily temperature ranges show a decrease. The substantial increase in total SEA population exposure to heat extremes from 730 million person-days at 2.0 degrees C GWL to 1200 million person-days at 3.0 degrees C GWL is mostly contributed by the climate change component, accounting for 48%. In addition, if global warming is restricted well below 2.0 degrees C, the avoided impacts in population exposure are prominent for most regions over SEA with the largest mitigation in the Philippines. Aggregate population exposure to impacts is decreased by approximately 39% at 2.0 degrees C GWL, while the interaction component effect, which is associated with increased population and climate change, would decrease by 53%. This indicates serious consequences for growing populations concurrent with global warming impacts if the current fossil-fueled development pathway is adhered to. The present study estimates the risks of increased temperature extremes and population exposure in a warmer future, and further emphasizes the necessity and urgency of implementing climate adaptation and mitigation strategies in SEA.","[Sun, Xuerong; Ge, Fei; Chen, Quanliang] Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Plateau Atmosphere & Environm Key Lab Sichuan Pro, Joint Lab Climate & Environm Change, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Fan, Yi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disasters, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Shoupeng] CMA, Key Lab Transportat Meteorol, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Shoupeng] Nanjing Joint Inst Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Chengdu University of Information Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; China Meteorological Administration,"Ge, F (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Plateau Atmosphere & Environm Key Lab Sichuan Pro, Joint Lab Climate & Environm Change, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",figo@cuit.edu.cn,,"Zhu, Shoupeng/0000-0002-4741-1179","National Natural Science Foundation of China [U20A2097, 4210050408]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The National Natural Science Foundation of China (U20A2097, 4210050408).",,93,5,5,19,32,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, high asthma prevalence rates and poor asthma control is attributed to urban air pollution and substandard housing, both of which will be made worse by climate change in the Mid-Atlantic region. Climate change will increase air pollution, worsen indoor environmental conditions, and bring more unpredictable weather, all of which will make asthma more difficult to manage. This article describes a public education project designed to teach vulnerable local communities about climate change and its impact on asthma management. The Climate Ready Philly project provided basic information on the mechanisms of global climate change, presented research on how climate change would impact the city of Philadelphia, and facilitated hands-on activities to help workshop participants learn what they could do to address climate change at home. Our workshops paired healthy homes and energy efficiency strategies, for example, to explore relationships between outdoor and indoor environments, as well as impacts on occupant health. By utilizing climate learning science, our workshops allowed participants to explore relationships between existing health and environmental conditions-such as asthma-and the anticipated impacts of climate change. Using surveys, interviews, and ethnographic data collection, we found that more resources are needed to repair housing infrastructure and help low-income community members access resources that can improve indoor air quality. We conclude by highlighting the need for climate adaptation programs that provide support for housing, in addition to other public infrastructures, which will be needed to reduce the burden of asthma in Philadelphia.","[Kenner, Alison] Drexel Univ, Dept Polit, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kenner, Alison] Drexel Univ, Ctr Sci Technol & Soc, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Skula, Alexandra] Philadelphia Dept Publ Hlth, Div Dis Control, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Mankikar, Deepa] Natl Nurse Led Care Consortium, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Zimmermann, Ian] Drexel Univ, Commun Culture & Media Program, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Nobles, Eliza] Univ Penn, City Planning, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Menzo, Julia] Liberty Lutheran, Community Outreach, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Flaherty, Thomas] Energy Coordinating Agcy, Dev & Mkt, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Zerbo, Russell] Clean Air Council, Philadelphia, PA USA",Drexel University; Drexel University; Drexel University; University of Pennsylvania,"Kenner, A (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",ali.kenner@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,3,3,2,8,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1939-4071,1937-5174,,ENVIRON JUSTICE,Environ.

Rising air temperatures, increasing precipitation in winter, and decreasing precipitation in summer as well as increases in extreme weather events have increased flooding and droughts and further affected water quality in the Miyun Reservoir Watershed (MRW). This study used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model with five downscaled general circulation models (GCMs) to quantify the impact of climate change on hydrology, soil erosion, nutrient cycling, and the performance of Best Management Practices (BMPs) at watershed scale, driven by RCPs 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5. Compared with the baseline scenario, the results indicated that climate variability, especially precipitation and temperature, had great effects on surface runoff, sediment yields, and nutrient losses and further significantly affected BMP efficiency, although the magnitudes of change differed among the RCPs. Monthly sediment and nutrient loads increased substantially in all climate change scenarios, especially in flood season, due to the increase in precipitation intensity. Although BMPs were identified to be not appreciably effective in controlling water balance, they were effective in reducing sediment and nutrient losses. Based on this case, a simulation-optimization framework was applied to develop future watershed management strategies with BMP configurations because of their climate adaptation benefits, water improvement targets, and economical cost. The results indicated that the discrepancy among different climate scenarios was reflected by the number and types of BMPs and their spatial distributions, especially structural BMPs. This study suggests that the increasing frequency of rainfall events may decrease the efficiency of BMPs in the MRW, and watershed management should be adjusted according to changing climate in the future.","[Qiu, Jiali; Shen, Zhenyao; Hou, Xiaoshu; Xie, Hui] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Leng, Guoyong] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Beijing Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Shen, ZY (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",zyshen@bnu.edu.cn,,"Xie, Hui/0000-0002-8648-0177",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51579011]; fund for Innovative Research Group of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [51721093],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); fund for Innovative Research Group of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This project was supported by the funds from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51579011) and the fund for Innovative Research Group of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51721093).,,55,27,27,14,76,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-8574,1872-6992,,ECOL ENG,Ecol.

However, the international adaptive models were not suitable to evaluate the thermal adaptation level of all the climates. To explore thermal adaptive ability and develop thermal comfort models in different climate zones, field studies on thermal comfort in 120 residential buildings in summer and winter have been conducted in 12 cities, representative of four climate zones in eastern China. Those data were gathered using instantaneous subjective questionnaire surveys and objective on-site measurements. The results showed that the predicted neutral temperatures based on MTS in winter in four climate zones were all lower than the predicted neutral temperatures based on PMV, and vice versa in summer. The clothing was mainly affected by the indoor temperature in the severe cold climate; however, it was affected by the outdoor temperature in the warmer climates. Clothing adjustment was more obvious in the warmer climate than in the colder climate. The warmer the climate, the smaller the yearly temperature difference, and the higher a sensitivity of the neutral temperature to outdoor temperature. The adaptive models in the hot summer and cold winter zone (HSCW) and hot summer and warmer winter zone (HSWW) can be used to predict the comfort temperatures of the natural ventilated buildings in the above two climate zones. Different climate zones should develop their own thermal adaptive models. These findings provide support to the climate adaptation theory and can serve as reference for the design of natural ventilated buildings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This is the first empirical study that looks beyond the traditional studies only limited to the adoption of climate change measures by estimating the impact of adopted practices on technical efficiency and computing the actual level of fertilizer at the farm level. For this purpose, face-to-face interviews were conducted for data collection with 196 farmers selected through multiple stage simple random sampling in the wheat-maize mix cropping zone of Punjab province. The results depicted that changing fertilizer was the most commonly adopted strategy (76%) to negate the effects of climate changes on crop production. Stochastic frontier analysis results revealed that the adoption of diversification practices, soil and water conservation practices, and modern input use strategies were influential factors explaining the technical efficiency differential among different farmers. The average technical efficiency score was 0.71 in the locality implying that farmers have an opportunity to increase their farm efficiency by 29% with the present level of inputs. Moreover, adopters of modern input practices with a high index were 27% more efficient than those with a low adaptation index of these climate countering measures. The empirical results also revealed the excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer to counter the climate change impacts at the agricultural farms. This result has important policy implications for government agencies that it is not enough just to guide and motivate the farmers to adopt certain strategies to negate the effect of climate change. They should also be informed about the exact usage level of those suggested measures.","[Shahbaz, Pomi; Boz, Ismet] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Dept Agr Econ, TR-55139 Samsun, Turkey; [ul Haq, Shamsheer] Univ Educ, Dept Econ & Business Adm, Div Management & Adm Sci, Lahore, Pakistan",Ondokuz Mayis University,"Shahbaz, P (corresponding author), Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Dept Agr Econ, TR-55139 Samsun, Turkey.",pomi1781@gmail.com,"SHAHBAZ, POMI/AAM-6128-2020; Haq, Shamsheer ul/AAP-4264-2021","SHAHBAZ, POMI/0000-0002-7384-4664; Haq, Dr. Shamsheer ul/0000-0002-7258-5525",,,,,76,7,7,1,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

Results indicate that beliefs varied with trust, and beliefs in turn had a significant direct effect on perceived risks from climate change. Support for adaptation varied with perceived risks, while attitudes toward GHG reduction (mitigation) were associated predominantly with variation in beliefs. Most farmers were supportive of adaptation responses, but few endorsed GHG reduction, suggesting that outreach should focus on interventions that have adaptive and mitigative properties (e.g., reduced tillage, improved fertilizer management).","[Arbuckle, J.

By contrast, scholars have shown little interest in exploring the case of cross-boundary adaptation spillovers, where adaptation by one country affects other countries. Two decades of the economic literature on climate mitigation may contribute to bridge this research gap because the problem structure of climate mitigation resembles that of adaptation with cross-boundary spillovers. With this in mind, we ask the following research question: Are there lessons to be learned by applying a mitigation perspective to the governance of adaptation with cross-boundary spillovers? After reviewing the relevant adaptation and mitigation literature, the paper applies mitigation insights to an adaptation case with cross-boundary spillovers: climate change-induced eutrophication in the Baltic Sea. Insights on coalition structures, side-payments, issue-linkage, and trade sanctions provide novel perspectives on the governance structures in place. To improve cooperation on providing adaptation as a public good, smaller regional governance arrangements could be more effective, European subsidies for pollution control might be redirected, and progress on eutrophication could be made a precondition for cooperation on other areas. These perspectives depart both from the way the Baltic Sea eutrophication problem is addressed at present, and from the way public goods are addressed in the adaptation literature. They show that some lessons can indeed be learned, calling for further research.","[Roggero, Matteo; Kaehler, Leonhard; Hagen, Achim] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Roggero, M (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany.",matteo.mancini.roggero@gmail.com,,,,,,,92,8,9,5,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Yet there is little knowledge about the adaptive capacity of urban forms to climate stress, or of an appropriate assessment method. Through a case study on the urban heat island (UHI) in Xiamen City, China, we propose a novel approach that integrates several aspects to assess the adaptive capacity of urban form to climate stress. These aspects include the calculation of urban form, the determination of climate stress and land use modeling. Our results demonstrate that this approach is applicable for assessing the adaptive capacity of urban form in the historical, current and future multitime scales. Both urban planning aspects (e.g. population density, land use mix, road density and percentage of green open space) and landscape features (e.g. shape complexity, contiguity and compactness) are found to be key urban form drivers affecting UHI. The adaptive capacity of the urban form to UHI in Xiamen City has been declining dramatically, and is expected to continue to decline in the future as long as adaptation continues to not be integrated in urban land use planning.

In this context, practices of coastal management are active in the spatial ordering of the land and the sea, oftentimes producing sharp lines of demarcation in place of a fluid boundary zone. Similarly, practices of nature conservation can play a significant role in the socio-spatial separation of nature and culture at the coast. This paper places analytical focus on the diverse socio-spatial imaginaries or metageographies and processes of boundary-making underlying practices of coastal protection and nature conservation. Interpretative analysis of a climate adaptation strategy for the Wadden Sea coastal landscape of Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany and interviews with key participants demonstrate the relevance of attention to multiple socio-spatial constructions of the coast in a policy-making context. It is concluded that policy strategies need to engage more explicitly with multiple cultural geographies of the coast, and the spatial implications of distinct stakeholder perspectives. It is further evident that both coastal protection and nature conservation constitute regionally specific and culturally situated practices, which cannot be addressed solely from technical perspectives, specific to individual disciplines and professional ways of working. Providing space for the emergence of new and alternative socio-spatial imaginaries of the coast may facilitate the future management of coastal change.","[Walsh, Cormac] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Walsh, C (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Hamburg, Germany.",cormac.walsh@uni-hamburg.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [WA 3672/1-1],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: WA 3672/1-1",,24,24,24,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-0894,1475-4762,,AREA,Area,JUN,2018,50,2,,,,,177,185,,10.1111/area.12404,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/area.12404,,,9,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,GI0GZ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000434048700005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, little is known about the specific effects of different types of achievement goals and reading instructional practices on reading performance in mainland China. Methods This study used Programme of International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 data to examine the effects of Chinese students' achievement goals and perceived reading instruction on reading performance. Four districts in mainland China, Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang (B-S-J-Z), participated in PISA 2018. A profile of B-S-J-Z students' achievement goals and perceived reading instruction compared with those in other East Asian societies is presented. The relative contributions of different achievement goals, instructional practices at the student and school levels, and their interactive effects on reading performance are then examined by using hierarchical linear modelling. Results The results show that performance and avoidance goals are important for B-S-J-Z students' reading performance when classroom and school teaching environments are considered. The disciplinary climate, adaptative instruction and teachers' stimulation are positively related to reading performance at both the student and school levels. Some cross-level interactions between personal achievement goals and school reading instruction are found. Conclusions The findings suggest that achievement goals and reading instructional practices at both the student and school levels contribute to Chinese students' reading performance. The relationships between school reading instruction practices and students' reading performance vary for different achievement goals.","[Qian, Quan; Lau, Kit-ling] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Qian, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Fac Educ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",422843209@qq.com,,"QIAN, QUAN/0000-0001-7303-0794; Lau, Kit Ling/0000-0002-6696-6524",,,,,51,2,2,15,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0141-0423,1467-9817,,J RES READ,J.

The sector includes small backyard farms, small commercial operations, and very large, complex enterprises. Although there is substantial literature on climate adaptation by crop farmers and large livestock farmers, such information is limited for poultry. This study focuses on the effects of higher temperatures on commercial poultry farms in southwest Nigeria and their adaptation strategies. We use a rich set of in-depth interviews to describe how poultry farmers are adapting to higher temperatures and their reasons for adopting particular practices. In general, interviewees are aware that temperatures have increased over time and that heat stress reduces poultry productivity in terms of weight gain and laying capacity. They are knowledgeable and are not passively enduring the adverse effects of higher temperatures as they have adopted a range of adaptation practices. This study identified three main adaptation strategies: (i) keeping drinking water cool, (ii) keeping the building cool and increasing ventilation, and (iii) giving birds medicines and supplements that help them cope with increased heat. Small farms tend to adopt simple and low-cost practices, and large farms tend to adopt more sophisticated and expensive approaches, in line with the nature of their respective operations. The paper's findings can help address gaps in strategies aiming to help this critically important sector of the food system be robust to future environmental change.","[Sanou, Awa; Kerr, John M.; Hodbod, Jennifer] Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, Nat Resources Bldg,480 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Liverpool-Tasie, Lenis Saweda O.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Justin S Morrill Hall Agr,446 West Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Kerr, JM (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, Nat Resources Bldg,480 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",sanouawa@msu.edu; jkerr@msu.edu; jhodbod@msu.edu; lliverp@msu.edu,,"Hodbod, Jennifer/0000-0001-8899-6583; Liverpool-Tasie, Lenis/0000-0002-2990-5888",United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Feed the Future initiative; Michigan State University AgBioResearch; department of Community Sustainability; Environmental Science and Policy Program at Michigan State University,United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Feed the Future initiative(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Michigan State University AgBioResearch; department of Community Sustainability; Environmental Science and Policy Program at Michigan State University,This research is made possible by the generous support of the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Feed the Future initiative.

A 1-year survey of about 200 residential homes was carried out in eight cities covering the breadth of the region. The acceptable temperature range for the residents in this area was 16.3-28.1 degrees C and the thermal neutral temperature was found to be 27.6 degrees C in summers and 17.5 degrees C in winters. People in different area can vary in their adaptability and comfortableness. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the national comfort parameter introduced in the Code for Design of Heating and Ventilation and Air Conditioning (GB50019-2003). The results found that if air-conditioning system was set to 27.5 degrees C instead of 26 degrees C as required by GBJ19-87: Design Standard of Heating and Ventilation and Air Conditioning, a 16.5% saving of energy consumption could be achieved. The findings demonstrated the role of natural ventilation in the expansion of the thermal comfort zone for the residents, especially during the summer seasons. A climatic adaptability model has been established by this study to contribute to the passive climatic design strategies for a better economic and energy efficiency of buildings.","[Yu, Wei] Chongqing Univ, Fac Urban Construct & Environm Engn, Key Lab Gorges Reservoir Reg Ecoenvironm 3, Minist Educ, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China",Chongqing University,"Yu, W (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Fac Urban Construct & Environm Engn, Key Lab Gorges Reservoir Reg Ecoenvironm 3, Minist Educ, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China.",yuweixscq@126.com,"li, bz/GVR-7133-2022; li, bing/GWQ-9617-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [50838009, 50678179]; National Key Technologies R&D Program of China [2006BAJ01A05]; CSTC [2008AB7110]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Technologies R&D Program of China(National Key Technology R&D Program); CSTC(Natural Science Foundation Project of CQ CSTC),"This paper is based on research projects (50838009 and 50678179) funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China; also funding of the Project (2006BAJ01A05) by the National Key Technologies R&D Program of China and Project (CSTC, 2008AB7110) by the Key Technologies R&D Program of Chongqing, China.",,38,57,57,2,61,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1420-326X,1423-0070,,INDOOR BUILT ENVIRON,Indoor Built Environ.,FEB,2011,20,1,,,,,101,111,,10.1177/1420326X10394495,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1420326X10394495,,,11,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",734HS,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000288325800011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite public perception and funding challenges, all the local government representatives with whom I met incorporated climate change risk assessment, adaptation, and mitigation planning into their work. The mandated Community Risk Register serves as a key planning document developed by each local government authority and is a meaningful way to look at potential climate change health risks. Adaptation and sustainability were common threads in my meetings. These often took the form of going green with transportation, energy efficiency, conserving resources, and building design because the efforts made sense monetarily as future cost savings. Communication strategies targeted a variety of audiences (EHPs, non-EHP government employees, politicians, and the general public) using a broad range of communication channels (professional training, lobbying, conferences and fairs, publications, print materials, Internet resources, social media, billboards, etc).","So Illinois Univ, Dept Hlth Educ & Recreat, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Ratnapradipa, D (corresponding author), So Illinois Univ, Dept Hlth Educ & Recreat, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",dhitinut@siu.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,,,,,13,5,5,0,18,NATL ENVIRON HEALTH ASSOC,DENVER,"720 S COLORADO BLVD SUITE 970, SOUTH TOWER, DENVER, CO 80246 USA",0022-0892,,,J ENVIRON HEALTH,J.

However, the accessibility of UGS cooling services to the residents of cities remains largely unknown, which hinders decision-making regarding the formulation of climate adaptation and urban greening schemes. In the present study, we estimated the number of residents who accessed UGSs for cooling by analyzing the annual changes in such cooling areas during summer across 315 Chinese cities from 2003 to 2015. Approximately 93.3% of the cities showed significant decreasing trends (p < 0.05) of the total UGS area; as such the UGS coverage dropped from 12.23 +/- 0.32% in 2003 to 7.69 +/- 0.22% in 2015. Consequently, with the prevalent loss of UGS, the coverage of cooling spaces decreased from 32.55 +/- 0.76% in 2003 to 24.39 +/- 0.60% in 2015. This has formed a spatial mismatch between the growing urban population and the remaining UGSs. Accordingly, the number of residents of areas outside these cooling spaces increased by 4.23 million per year. In particular, the shortage of cooling services was more significant in cities with < 20,000 USD gross domestic product per capita and < 5 million residents than in the rest of the cities. To minimize the adverse impacts of increasing temperatures, focused greening plans are warranted, specifically in underdeveloped cities.","[Dong, Yulin; Ren, Zhibin; Hu, Nanlin; Guo, Yujie; Jia, Guangliang; He, Xingyuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Environm, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China; [Fu, Yao] Yuxi Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Engn Land Resources, Yuxi 653100, Peoples R China; [Jia, Guangliang; He, Xingyuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Dong, Yulin; Ren, Zhibin; Hu, Nanlin; Guo, Yujie; Jia, Guangliang; He, Xingyuan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography & Agroecology, CAS; Yuxi Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","He, XY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Environm, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China.",hexingyuan@iga.ac.cn,,,"Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences [2020237]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42171109, 32130068]",Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences [grant number 2020237] , the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 42171109, 32130068] .",,47,17,18,17,55,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0160-4120,1873-6750,,ENVIRON INT,Environ.

Yet, the extent of climate integration into evaluation in response to the rapidly approaching stocktake mandate remains unclear. Many United Nations agencies recognize the importance of mainstreaming climate action into food security and broader development programming, which presents an opportunity to learn from experiences documented in United Nations food security evaluation reports. Our goal is to examine how United Nations food security programs are evaluating climate action. Using a systematic search and screening process, we included evaluations that described any aspect of food security, evaluated completed programs, and were published between 2014 and 2019. We examined the extent of climate change mainstreaming into food security evaluation by developing and applying an assessment rubric. We also identified, compared, and characterized evaluation challenges and opportunities using thematic analysis. Of the 136 relevant evaluations, 69% (n = 94) assessed food security programs that integrated climate action. While many evaluations reported adaptation outcomes, considerations of climate action in the evaluation approach were often insufficient. Based on our analysis, challenges to climate evaluation included inadequate resource allocation, weak monitoring and evaluation systems, dependency on food security evaluation, and limited climate focus in programs and evaluations. The assessment rubric provides a tool for understanding and encouraging climate change integration into evaluation, and through this, helps countries prepare for the upcoming global stocktake.","[Lam, Steven; Papadopoulos, Andrew; Harper, Sherilee L.] Univ Guelph, Dept Populat Med, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Dodd, Warren; Skinner, Kelly] Univ Waterloo, Sch Publ Hlth & Hlth Syst, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Berrang-Ford, Lea; Ford, James] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Harper, Sherilee L.] Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Guelph; University of Waterloo; University of Leeds; University of Alberta,"Lam, S (corresponding author), 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.;Dodd, W (corresponding author), 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.;Harper, SL (corresponding author), 11405-87 Ave, Edmonton, AB T6G 1C9, Canada.",lams@uoguelph.ca; wdodd@uwaterloo.ca; sherilee.harper@ualberta.ca,"Ford, James/A-4284-2013","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; Dodd, Warren/0000-0003-0774-7644",Ontario Veterinary College PhD Scholarship; Canadian Institutes of Health Research Doctoral Award,Ontario Veterinary College PhD Scholarship; Canadian Institutes of Health Research Doctoral Award(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),This work was supported by the Ontario Veterinary College PhD Scholarship (to SL) and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Doctoral Award (to SL) .

Extreme temperature indices show increases, larger in the minimum than in the maximum temperatures. Regarding total seasonal precipitation, decreases were found in the north and central Mediterranean climate parts of Israel, with reductions reaching similar to 40%, and increases of the same percentage in the most southern arid parts during winter and spring. An increase in precipitation intensity is shown mostly for the southern arid part of the region, with some indications of extremity also in the north.

One approach that holds prospects for climate risk management is climate-smart agriculture (CSA). CSA has concentrated on crop practices with little attention to livestock especially indigenous (village) chickens as a potential practice that can be combined with crop agriculture. This study considers the adoption of three CSA practices: improved maize seeds (IS), soil management (SM), indigenous chicken (IC) enterprise and their various combinations. Using survey data collected from 300 farming households in semiarid Kenya, we estimate the impact of integrated crop-poultry system adoption on food security and farm income using multinomial endogenous treatment effect models. Robustness checks are conducted using alternative identifica-tion strategies. Results show that, generally, the adoption of IS, SM, IC and their combinations reduces the number of months without enough food and increases farm income. When we consider the magnitude of the impacts, interesting results emerge when a combination of the CSA practices are considered. The highest impact is observed with the joint adoption of SM & IC and IS &IC. Broadly, the empirical findings suggest that integrated systems (in our case crop-poultry integration), deserve both policy and research attention as they provide syn-ergistic benefits that improve climate resilience and household welfare.","[Mulungu, Kelvin] Int Ctr Insect Physiol & Ecol Icipe, Nairobi, Kenya; [Kangogo, Daniel] Stockholm Environm Inst SEI Asia, Bangkok, Thailand",International Centre of Insect Physiology & Ecology (ICIPE),"Mulungu, K (corresponding author), Int Ctr Insect Physiol & Ecol Icipe, Nairobi, Kenya.",kmulungu@icipe.org,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Mulungu, Kelvin/0000-0002-4904-4122",,,,,71,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,NOV,2022,8,11,,,,,,,e11579,10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e11579,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e11579,,,12,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,7I7PC,36411925,"Green Accepted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000904077400009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we present a high-resolution multiproxy speleothem record (stable oxygen and carbon isotope ratios, petrography and magnetic properties) from Rio Martino Cave (Piedmont, Southern Alps, Italy), which covers the first part of the Penultimate Glacial (early MIS 6, 182-157 ka). During early MIS 6, the combination of high climatic precession and obliquity amplified the peak in Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer insolation intensity at ca. 174 ka to almost interglacial levels, leading to northward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the enhancement of the boreal monsoon system. At orbital scale, the hydroclimatic record from Rio Martino closely follows the precession pattern, and shows a wet interstadial phase between 180 and 170 ka, peaking at the precession minimum, characterized by glacial retreat and by the likely development of soils and vegetation up to 1900-2000 m a.s.l. in this alpine sector. This phase can be traced across the Southern Alps, and corresponds to pluvial conditions inferred from Western Mediterranean records, and to the interval of deposition of the cold Sapropel S6 in the eastern Mediterranean. We suggest that the interaction between an intensified northwesterly cold flow (relating to increased ice volume under glacial conditions), and the relatively warm waters of the NW Mediterranean (due to the peculiar atmospheric configuration occurring at the precession minimum) strongly enhanced the autumn cyclogenesis in the Northern Tyrrhenian Sea, fuelling intense precipitation to reach the Southern Alps. The Rio Martino record also shows a prominent sub-orbital variability, the overall structure of which is coherent with hemispheric changes in climate driven by cyclic perturbations of North Atlantic conditions related to the operation of the bipolar seesaw.

The future of these forests will depend on how climate change interacts with management activities. Forest managers are in critical need of strategies to manage the effects of climate change. We co-designed forest management scenarios with forest managers and stakeholders in the Klamath ecoregion of Oregon and California, a seasonally dry forest in the Western US subject to fire disturbances. The resultant scenarios span a broad range of forest and fire management strategies. Using a mechanistic forest landscape model, we simulated the scenarios as they interacted with forest growth, succession, wildfire disturbances and climate change. We analysed the simulations to (a) understand how scenarios affected the fire regime and (b) estimate how each scenario altered potential forest composition. Within the simulation timeframe (85 years), the scenarios had a large influence on fire regimes, with fire rotation periods ranging from 60 years in a minimal management scenario to 180 years with an industrial forestry style management scenario. Regardless of management strategy, mega-fires (>100,000 ha) are expected to increase in frequency, driven by stronger climate forcing and extreme fire weather. High elevation conifers declined across all climate and management scenarios, reflecting an imbalance between forest types, climate and disturbance. At lower elevations (<1,800 m), most scenarios maintained forest cover levels; however, the minimal intervention scenario triggered 5 x 10(5) ha of mixed conifer loss by the end of the century in favour of shrublands, whereas the maximal intervention scenario added an equivalent amount of mixed conifer. Policy implications. Forest management scenarios that expand beyond current policies-including privatization and aggressive climate adaptation-can strongly influence forest trajectories despite a climate-enhanced fire regime. Forest management can alter forest trajectories by increasing the pace and scale of actions taken, such as fuel reduction treatments, or by limiting other actions, such as fire suppression.","[Maxwell, Charles J.; Scheller, Robert M.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Serra-Diaz, Josep M.] Univ Lorraine, AgroParisTech, INRAE, Nancy, France; [Serra-Diaz, Josep M.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ctr Biodivers Dynam Changing World BIOCHANGE, Aarhus, Denmark; [Thompson, Jonathan R.] Harvard Univ, Petersham, MA USA",North Carolina State University; AgroParisTech; INRAE; Universite de Lorraine; Aarhus University; Harvard University,"Maxwell, CJ (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",cjmaxwe3@ncsu.edu,"Scheller, Robert M/B-3135-2009; Serra-Diaz, Josep M/C-3614-2015","Scheller, Robert M/0000-0002-7507-4499; Serra-Diaz, Josep M/0000-0003-1988-1154","National Science Foundation [1353509, 0966376]; Microsoft Research",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Microsoft Research(Microsoft),"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1353509 and 0966376; Microsoft Research",,54,6,7,6,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

This likely lead to poor decisions regarding climate adaptation. Climate warming and farmland responses have synergistic consequences for diffuse nitrogen pollution, which are hypothesized to present different spatio-temporal patterns. In this study, we propose a modeling framework to simulate the synergistic impacts of climate warming and warming-induced farmland shifts on diffuse pollution. Active accumulated temperature response for latitudinal and altitudinal directions was predicted based on a simple agro-climate model under different temperature increments (Delta(0) is from 0.8 degrees C to 1.4 degrees C at an interval of 0.2 degrees C). Spatial distributions of dryland shift to paddy land were determined by considering accumulated temperature. Different temperature increments and crop distributions were inserted into Soil and Water Assessment Tool model, Which quantified the spatio-temporal changes of nitrogen. Warming led to a decrease of the annual total nitrogen loading (2.6%-142%) in the low latitudes compared with baseline, which was larger than the decrease (0.8%-6.2%) in the high latitudes. The synergistic impacts amplified the decrease of the loading in the low and high latitudes at the sub-basin scale. Warming led to a decrease of the loading at a rate of 035 kg/ha/degrees C, which was lower than the synergistic impacts (3.67 kg/ha/degrees C) at the watershed level. However, warming led to the slight increase of the annual averaged NO3 (LAT) (0.16 kg/ha/degrees C), which was amplified by the synergistic impacts (0.22 kg/ha/degrees C). Expansion of paddy fields led to a decrease in the monthly total nitrogen loading throughout the year, but amplified an increase in the loading in August and September. The decreased response in spatio-temporal nitrogen patterns is substantially amplified by farmland-atmosphere feedbacks associated with farmland shifts in response to warming. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, distinguishing the impacts of climate variability and human activities would vastly improve our knowledge of water resources, climate variability and climate adaptation, and watershed management. We propose a new and simple method to determine the impact of human activities within paired datasets under the same or similar weather conditions (SWC). These weather conditions cover one or more meteorological elements such as precipitation, temperature, or evaporation. If there are two or more periods with similar weather conditions but different runoff, the relative runoff and sediment load changes can be considered a consequence of human-induced land surface changes. This study will report on the application of this new method, using the Yan River Basin in China as a case study. We found 10 sets PPs (paired periods) in 1 year intervals and 12 sets of PPs in intervals of 3 years when (1) there was a 2.0% and 1.0% difference of annual precipitation and annual ETO, respectively, (2) the relationship between monthly precipitation and ETO of PPs was significant (P < 0.05) and, (3) there was no overlap of years for the PPs with intervals of 1 and 3 years. We found that the impact of human activities varied greatly between PPs, with the main trend of declining PPs, matched the trends evident from statistical analysis and land use and land cover (LULC) change evaluation. The method is simple and easily applicable to selected periods in most areas and could be extended when more detailed data are available. The result of this method is the impact of all human activities, allowing for further discussion on the contributions of each kind of human activity over time in determining the range which links the research results at different scales, e.g. to define the sediment delivery ratio (SDR) describing soil erosion on catchment slopes and sediment load in the river.

Efforts to adapt to changing climate may occur on many scales and may be undertaken by a variety of stakeholders and do not occur in institutional vacuum. As globalization has increased the exchange of knowledge across space, a greater number of institutions have become involved in adaptation measures encompassing multiple scales. In order to gain insight into how adaptation might unfold into the future, we investigate the interactions between institutions operating at multiple levels in the innovation of new technologies on demand. From a broad sample of cases, we identify four distinct types of adaptation measures and select one corresponding case representing each type to assess the roles of institutions (and other stakeholders) in innovation. We further identify and discuss two findings that cut across all adaptation measures: (1) the need for widespread participation, flexibility, and integration of stakeholders for quick and effective response, and (2) the need to transfer leadership and responsibility from institutionally led adaptation measures to community based measures so that adaptation is sustained into the future. Together, these findings suggest that the types of adaptation measures implemented primarily from the top down may not promote local resilience in the long term; likewise, those measures implemented from the bottom up require some level of collaboration from the top to maximize their effectiveness.

It begins by reviewing existing literature on climate adaptation in agricultural populations and on relationships between soil and rural migration. This is followed by a detailed case study of rural migration patterns that emerged in the Swift Current district of Saskatchewan, Canada, during a period of extended droughts and severe economic conditions in the 1930s. Using a combination of secondary literature, interviews with surviving first-hand observers and GIS modeling, the study shows how the interacting effects of household indebtedness, social capital, government relief programs, and farm-level soil quality helped stimulate population loss in many rural townships across the study area. The study focuses particularly on the role played by differential soil quality across the Swift Current district and how farms situated on sandier soils were typically more sensitive and vulnerable to drought than those situated on clay soils. Higher-than-average rates of population loss were associated with townships containing areas of poorer quality agricultural soils, an association replicable using GIS software and existing soil and population datasets. The findings from the case study are discussed within the context of the broader existing literature, and suggestions are provided on future directions for research, planning, and modeling to assist planners and policymakers concerned with rural adaptation and migration.","[McLeman, Robert A.; Ploeger, S.

It has deep economic, environmental, and social impacts, particularly on vulnerable rural regions in developing countries where agriculture constitutes the backbone of the economy. This study analyzes farmers' preferences regarding the potential implementation of several mitigation and adaptation actions addressing climate change. Data were collected on 370 farmers in the Valle del Carrizo region of northwestern Mexico. Using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology, the farmers' preferred mitigation and adaptation actions were identified and related to their stated attitudes regarding risks using the Multiple Price List (MPL) lotteries approach. Farmers' environmental beliefs and perceptions as key means of understanding concepts of sustainability were related to their preferences. The use of less polluting machinery and investment in improving irrigation infrastructure were identified as the most preferred actions. Environmental opinions reviewed using the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale allowed for the identification of the participants' ecocentric and anthropocentric attitudes, highlighting the commitment of most farmers to the sustainable use of natural resources. Agricultural policies should be developed according to farmers' preferences and behaviors. The design and implementation of measures and policy tools addressing climate change should be inclusive and developed at the micro-level considering farm and farmer typologies.","[Orduno Torres, Miguel Angel; Ornelas Herrera, Selene Ivette] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Inst Res Sustainabil Sci & Technol IS UPC, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Kallas, Zein] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Ctr Res Agrofood Econ & Dev CREDA UPC IRTA, Inst Agrifood Res & Technol, Castelldefels 08860, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; IRTA; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Torres, MAO (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Cataluna, Inst Res Sustainabil Sci & Technol IS UPC, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",miguel.angel.orduno@upc.edu; zein.kallas@upc.edu; selene.ivette.ornelas@upc.edu,"kallas, zein/G-5620-2010","kallas, zein/0000-0003-2870-3691",National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT),National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),The National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) is acknowledged for supporting this research.,,80,10,10,5,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,DEC,2020,99,,,,,,,,105031,10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105031,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105031,,,14,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OY8KH,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000594489500017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Drought is becoming more severe and water scarcer. Thus, action on adaptation to climate impacts is urgently needed. We assess the potential for wastewater reuse as an adaptation measure to cope with water scarcity in Can Tho City, within the heart of the Mekong Delta. We show that wastewater effluent can be used to irrigate at least to 22,719 ha of paddy rice (16% of the rice-cultivated area in the city) at 3 crops per year. The fertilizing properties of the water would eliminate part of the demand for synthetic fertilizers, providing a maximum of 22% of the nitrogen (N) and 14% of the phosphorus (P) requirement for the winter-spring crop. On a yearly basis, recovery of wastewater could reduce the discharge of N by 15-27% and the discharge of P by 8-17%. Such a program would contribute to a decrease in the level of pollution in the local rivers and canal systems, while also reducing the need for expensive tertiary treatment (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Accurate localization and quantification of pervious surfaces and canopy cover are envisaged to implement UGI, address sustainable spatial planning, and include adaptation and mitigation strategies in urban planning practices. This study aims to propose a simple and replicable process to map pervious surfaces and canopy cover and to investigate the reliability and the potential planning uses of UGI maps. The proposed method combines the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), extracted from high-resolution airborne imagery (0.20 m), with digital elevation models to map pervious surfaces and canopy cover. The approach is tested in the Municipality of Trento, Italy, and, according to a random sampling validation, has an accuracy exceeding 80%. The paper provides a detailed map of green spaces in the urban areas, describing quantity and distribution, and proposes a synthesis map expressed as a block-level degree of pervious surfaces and canopy cover to drive urban transformations. The proposed approach constitutes a useful tool to geovisualize critical areas and to compare levels of pervious surfaces and canopy cover in the municipal area. Acknowledging the role of green areas in the urban environment, the paper examines the potential applications of the maps in the policy cycle, such as land use management and monitoring, and in climate-related practices, and discusses their integration into the current planning tools to shift towards performative rather than prescriptive planning.","[Codemo, Anna; Pianegonda, Angelica; Ciolli, Marco; Favargiotti, Sara; Albatici, Rossano] Univ Trento, Dept Civil Environm & Mech Engn, Via Mesiano 77, I-38123 Trento, Italy",University of Trento,"Codemo, A (corresponding author), Univ Trento, Dept Civil Environm & Mech Engn, Via Mesiano 77, I-38123 Trento, Italy.",anna.codemo@unitn.it; angelica.pianegonda@unitn.it; marco.ciolli@unitn.it; sara.favargiotti@unitn.it; rossano.albatici@unitn.it,"Ciolli, Marco/D-8613-2014","Ciolli, Marco/0000-0001-8370-9039; Pianegonda, Angelica/0000-0002-1799-3497; Favargiotti, Sara/0000-0003-3598-1518; Albatici, Rossano/0000-0002-5571-0259",European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [778039]; Municipality of Trento; University of Trento within the UniCitta memorandum of understanding (Project: Trento Urban Transformation-TUT); EIT Climate-KIC under the Climate Innovation Ecosystems 2/2018 grant agreement (Project: System and Sustainable Approach to Virtuous Interaction of Urban and Rural Landscapes-SATURN),European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Municipality of Trento; University of Trento within the UniCitta memorandum of understanding (Project: Trento Urban Transformation-TUT); EIT Climate-KIC under the Climate Innovation Ecosystems 2/2018 grant agreement (Project: System and Sustainable Approach to Virtuous Interaction of Urban and Rural Landscapes-SATURN),"This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant, agreement No. 778039 (Project: Planning and Engagement Arenas for Renewable Energy Landscapes-PEARLS), from the Municipality of Trento and the University of Trento within the UniCitta memorandum of understanding (Project: Trento Urban Transformation-TUT), and from EIT Climate-KIC under the Climate Innovation Ecosystems 2/2018 grant agreement (Project: System and Sustainable Approach to Virtuous Interaction of Urban and Rural Landscapes-SATURN).",,78,1,1,7,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2022,14,10,,,,,,,6149,10.3390/su14106149,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14106149,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1R3DO,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000803253800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper aims to present the latest progress and controversies on the studies of the cooling effects of waterbodies, greenspaces, and parks. In order to do this research, international search engines were employed to systematically search peer-reviewed articles, including the cooling effect of blue-green space and threshold-size-based UHI mitigation studies. After that, the inductive analysis is used to analyze the relevant literature. We found that previous studies concentrated on the correlations between different landscape types, temperature variations and the quantification of cooling intensity, etc. However, threshold-size-based research has received less attention, which limits the ability to make specific recommendations for actionable planning and management - usingthe smallest blue-green space for the best cooling effect. The review also revealed the controversies over the effects of blue-green space size, shape, landscape composition and configuration on cooling effect. Besides, we pointed out that the uncertainties (i.e., the optimal proportion of blue-green space in a park) and the reasons of controversial results of the cooling effect need to be further investigated. We also suggested that more attention should be paid to quantify the contributions of local background climate and landscape characteristics to the cooling effect (threshold-size) of blue-green space.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has identified relevant information as key to enabling appropriate climate adaptation and mitigation action. Information specifically directed to farmers can be found, for example, in specialized farming magazines. While recent studies examine how national news media frame climate change, less-if any-studies have addressed climate framings and coverage in specializedmedia. Media framings are storylines that provide meaning by communicating how and why an issue should be seen as a problem, how it should be handled, and who is responsible for it. This paper analyses the framings and coverage of climate change in two Swedish specialized farming magazines from 2000 to 2009. It examines the extent of the climate change coverage, the content of the media items, and the dominant framings underlying their climate change coverage. The study identifies: increased coverage of climate change starting in 2007; frequent coverage of agriculture's contribution to climate change, climate change impacts on agriculture, and consequences of climate politics for agriculture; and four prominent frames: conflict, scientific certainty, economic burden, and action. The paper concludes that climate change communicators addressing farmers and agricultural extension officers should pay attention to how these frames may be interpreted by different target audiences. Research is needed on how specialized media reports on climate-related issues and how science-based climate information is understood by different groups of farmers and which other factors influence farmers' engagement in climate mitigation and adaptation.","[Asplund, Therese; Hjerpe, Mattias; Wibeck, Victoria] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, SE-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Asplund, Therese; Hjerpe, Mattias; Wibeck, Victoria] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Water & Environm Studies, SE-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University; Linkoping University,"Asplund, T (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, SE-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden.",therese.asplund@liu.se,,"Asplund, Therese/0000-0001-5549-5897; Hjerpe, Mattias/0000-0002-5500-3300",Swedish Farmers' Foundation for Agricultural Research; EU Baltic Sea Region,Swedish Farmers' Foundation for Agricultural Research; EU Baltic Sea Region,We gratefully acknowledge support from the Swedish Farmers' Foundation for Agricultural Research project Competitively strengthened agriculture: communication about climate change and new possibilities and the EU Baltic Sea Region project BalticClimate.

Adaptation to climate change and mitigation of energy poverty,ENERGY AND BUILDINGS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy retrofit; Clustering; Principal components analysis; Energy poverty; Climate change,MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS; BUILDING SECTOR; CONSUMPTION; IMPACT; REGRESSION; PATTERNS; BEHAVIOR,"Energy retrofit of existing buildings was highlighted as an efficient massive action to decrease energy consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases. But, detecting the optimal retrofit strategies for groups of buildings is nowadays a highly complex problem. Their energy consumptions are influenced by building related factors (climate, building envelope, building services and systems) and by user-related ones (building operation and maintenance, occupant behavior, and indoor environmental quality). Detecting the contributions of each factor and grouping buildings with similarities-in order to establish similar retrofit strategies - are the main issues that can be faced by statistical multivariate methods. In this paper, we present a new and broader view to propose retrofit strategies adapted to a climate change scenario and analyzed from the economic and energy-poverty points of view, by using multivariate and clustering techniques that include building-related and user-related metrics influencing the energy consumption of groups of buildings. A group of 10 single-family houses in Argentina were selected as a case-study. The contributions of eleven building-related driving metrics and four user-related ones to the energy consumption were analyzed. Then, the more representative house of the cluster was selected for a retrofit analysis for current weather conditions and for future weather under a climate change scenario. The analysis also included an economic assessment in relation to the energy poverty. The higher CV values found in the user-related metrics highlight the influence of occupants in the energy consumption that can result in huge gaps between real and predicted energy performance of buildings.

These frequent occurrences of floods severely affect one or other parts of the country. In reducing disaster risk and strengthening local initiatives towards climate adaptation, vulnerable communities particularly in rural areas have developed valuable local knowledge for flood resilience. This local knowledge is continuously practiced in facing disasters and it is passed down to the next generations. This study aims to examine measures taken by communities based on local knowledge they possessed from the three stages of disaster management cycle namely, before, during and after disaster. Local knowledge as asserted by scholars could complement scientific knowledge and build a comprehensive disaster risk reduction approach for local context implementation. A mixed method approach was adopted; case study method and household survey involving 90 respondents for quantitative data collection and field observation for collecting qualitative data. Three case study areas in East Coast of Malaysia have been selected for further observation including; 1) Lubok Setol village in Kelantan state; 2) Teladas village in Terengganu state; and 3) Gajah Mati village in Pahang state. Findings from this study indicated that all study cases have developed and adopted local knowledge strategies for flood preparedness and responses including; 1) agriculture techniques and livestock trading; 2) stock piling of food and other necessities; 3) marking flood level as historical record; 4) floodproofing animal shelter; 5) constructing overhead storage cabinet and outdoor hut, and; 6) saving boats for emergencies. As a conclusion, it is proven that local community knowledge plays crucial roles in reducing disaster risks hence contributing towards building a resilient community. (C) 2022 Penerbit UTM Press.

Insurance companies, individual households, humanitarian organizations, governmental authorities, and investors and portfolio owners are increasingly required to account for climate-related physical risks. In response to these societal challenges, we present an extension to the open-source and open-access risk modelling platform CLIMADA (CLImate ADAptation) for modelling economic impacts of wildfires in a globally consistent and spatially explicit approach. All input data are free, public and globally available, ensuring applicability in data-scarce regions of the Global South. The model was calibrated at resolutions of 1, 4 and 10 km using information on past wildfire damage reported by the disaster database EM-DAT. Despite the large remaining uncertainties, the model yields sound damage estimates with a model performance well in line with the results of other natural catastrophe impact models, such as for tropical cyclones. To complement the global perspective of this study, we conducted two case studies on the recent megafires in Chile (2017) and Australia (2020). The model is made available online as part of a Python package, ready for application in practical contexts such as disaster risk assessment, near-real-time impact estimates or physical climate risk disclosure.","[Luthi, Samuel; Fairless, Christopher; Bresch, David N.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Luthi, Samuel; Aznar-Siguan, Gabriela; Bresch, David N.] Zurich Airport, Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, CH-8058 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss),"Luthi, S (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.;Luthi, S (corresponding author), Zurich Airport, Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, CH-8058 Zurich, Switzerland.",samuel.luethi@usys.ethz.ch,"Bresch, David N./D-5298-2018","Bresch, David N./0000-0002-8431-4263; Luthi, Samuel/0000-0003-2884-3467",,,,,56,0,0,0,6,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

Applying the Trajectory of Exposure and Vulnerability approach to Saint-Martin (Caribbean), we more specifically highlight how the causal chain linking historical geopolitical and politicalinstitutional drivers to legal, economic, demographic, sociocultural, planning-related and environmental drivers, created the accumulation of exposure and vulnerability over time and contributed to the propagation and amplification of the impacts of tropical cyclones Irma and Jose? in 2017. We find that historical socialpolitical dynamics involving unsustainable development and settlement patterns, the weakness of local institutions, population mistrust in public authorities, high social inequalities and environmental degradation maintained Saint-Martin on a maladaptive trajectory through powerful reinforcing mechanisms operating both between and during cyclonic events. This study demonstrates that long-term interdisciplinary approaches are required for a better understanding of path dependency and the identification of levers to break it in risk-prone contexts. In Saint-Martin, breaking path dependency requires the alignment of local institutional capacities with national risk reduction policies, the promotion of social justice and involvement of local communities in decision making. This study therefore confirms the relevance of backward-looking approaches to support forward-looking climate adaptation.","[Duvat, Virginie K.

However, to date, this aspect remains poorly understood on both global and regional scales. In this study, the changes in future CDHEs and their population exposures under 1.5 degrees C, 2 degrees C, and 3 degrees C warming were quantified using a Standardized Dry and Hot Index calculated based on the newly released Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate model outputs and global population datasets. It was found that relative to the baseline period (1986-2005), the severity of CDHEs would increase on the global scale and in most regions, such as in Southern Europe, the Mediterranean, Sahara, West Africa, Central America, Mexico, the Amazon, and the west coast of South America under 1.5 degrees C, 2 degrees C, and 3 degrees C of warming. Stabilizing the warming at 1.5 degrees C would constrain the adverse influence of CDHEs on the population suffering from severe CDHEs in most regions (especially in Central Europe, Southern Europe, the Mediterranean, Eastern North America, West Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia). Globally, the population impacted by severe CDHEs (with a constant 2000 population) would increase by 108 and 266 million (149 and 367 million when constant 2080 population is applied) for 2 degrees C and 3 degrees C increase compared to a 1.5 degrees C increase. These findings provide scientific evidence of the benefit of limiting anthropogenic warming to 1.5 degrees C in terms of the socio-economic risks related to CDHEs.","[Liu, Wenbin; Sun, Fubao; Feng, Yao; Sang, Yan-Fang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Fubao] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi, Peoples R China; [Sun, Fubao] Akesu Natl Stn Observat, Res Oasis Agro Ecosyst, Akesu, Peoples R China; [Li, Chao] East China Normal Univ, Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, Minist Educ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jie] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiang] Beijing Normal Univ, Key Lab Environm Change & Natl Disaster, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Wenbin; Sun, Fubao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xinjiang Institute of Ecology & Geography, CAS; East China Normal University; Wuhan University; Beijing Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Sun, FB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Sun, FB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi, Peoples R China.;Sun, FB (corresponding author), Akesu Natl Stn Observat, Res Oasis Agro Ecosyst, Akesu, Peoples R China.;Sun, FB (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China.",sunfb@igsnrr.ac.cn,"sang, yan-fang/I-8277-2016; Liu, Wenbin/AAB-2665-2021; Sun, Fubao/Q-2421-2019","sang, yan-fang/0000-0001-6770-9311; Liu, Wenbin/0000-0002-9569-6762; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China [42025104, 42022005]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFA0606903]; Program for the 'Kezhen-Bingwei' Youth Talents from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences [2020RC004]; Top-Notch Yong Talents Program of China","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Program for the 'Kezhen-Bingwei' Youth Talents from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Top-Notch Yong Talents Program of China","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42025104 and 42022005), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2019YFA0606903), the Program for the 'Kezhen-Bingwei' Youth Talents (2020RC004) from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Top-Notch Yong Talents Program of China (Fubao Sun).

The North-East African part lacks the studies for climate change detection, despite it being one of the most affected parts worldwide. The relationship between the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and climate change is an important factor to understand. To investigate this linkage, we used machine-learning (ML) models based on essential climate variables (ECVs) to investigate the relationship between the GHGs and the rhythm of climate variable change. The article investigates how ML techniques can be applied to climatic data to build an ML model that is able to predict the state of climate variables for the short and long term. By selecting a candidate model, it will help in climate adaptation and mitigation, also determine at what level GHGs should be kept and their corresponding concentrations in order to avoid climate events and crises. The used models are long short-term memory, autoencoders, and convolutional neural network (CNN). Alternatively, the dataset has been selected from U.K. National Centre for Earth Observation and Copernicus Climate Change Services. We compared the performance of these techniques and the best candidate was the Head-CNN; based on performance metrics such as root-mean-squared-error: 5.378, 2.395, and 15.923, mean-absolute-error: 4.157, 1.928, and11.672, Pearson: 0.368, 0.649, and 0.291, and R-2 coefficient: 0.607, 0.806, and 0.539 for the ECVs temperature, CO2, and CH4, respectively.

These variations include the number and intensity of storms, the volume of water flowing within the watershed, the water quality, the average height of lake levels, and the intensity of waves that strike the coastline (Parry, 2007). Yet, the impact of these changing environmental conditions upon water-based outdoor recreation users remains unclear. While climate change exacerbated environmental conditions are becoming progressively evident to both recreationists and resource managers (NPCA, 2009), few studies have sought to assess the extent to which environmental conditions alter outdoor recreation behaviors. This study examined water-based outdoor recreation visitors' perceptions and coping responses associated with water quality conditions affected by climate change on Lake Erie (n = 284). It used a modified version of the stress-coping model (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) to examine the relationships between water quality impact, water quality awareness, and coping. Study results indicated that the more visitors identified water quality as a negative impact on their overall experience, the more aware they were of water quality conditions. Further, the more aware visitors were of water quality conditions, the more they found the need to employ coping responses. From a resource management standpoint, a central concept for maintaining high quality outdoor recreation experiences is the identification of visitor resource perceptions and related impacts (Manning, 2011). Study findings confirmed visitors' perceptions of water quality impacts and awareness resulted in the employment of both cognitive and behavioral coping mechanisms that could be accounted for in future management decisions. From a theoretical perspective, this study took the work of Iwasaki and Schneider (2003), Miller and McCool (2003), Schneider and Hammitt (1995), Schuster et al. (2006), and Propst (2008) to the next logical step in the investigation of environmental conditions and coping within recreational settings.

Societal adaptation is needed to reduce vulnerability from increasingly intense hurricanes. This study quantifies the adaptation effects of potentially policy driven caps on housing densities and agricultural cover in coastal (and adjacent inland) areas vulnerable to hurricane damages in the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal regions of the U. S. Time series regressions, especially Prais-Winston and Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) models, are estimated to forecast the economic impacts of hurricanes of varying intensity, given that various patterns of land use emerge in the Atlantic and Gulf coastal states of the U. S. The Prais-Winston and ARMA models use observed time series data from 1900 to 2005 for inflation adjusted hurricane damages and socio-economic and land-use data in the coastal or inland regions where hurricanes caused those damages. The results from this study provide evidence that increases in housing density and agricultural cover cause significant rise in the de-trended inflation-adjusted damages. Further, higher intensity and frequency of land-falling hurricanes also significantly increase the economic damages. The evidence from this study implies that a medium to long term land use adaptation in the form of capping housing density and agricultural cover in the coastal (and adjacent inland) states can significantly reduce economic damages from intense hurricanes. Future studies must compare the benefits of such land use adaptation policies against the costs of development controls implied in housing density caps and agricultural land cover reductions.","Univ Vermont, Dept Community Dev & Appl Econ, Burlington, VT 05482 USA",University of Vermont,"Zia, A (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Community Dev & Appl Econ, 146 Univ Pl,Morrill 208E, Burlington, VT 05482 USA.",Asim.Zia@uvm.edu,,"zia, asim/0000-0001-8372-6090","National Science Foundation [0433165, EPS-1101317]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Work on this paper and research supporting it is funded by the National Science Foundation grants 0433165 and EPS-1101317.

Due to its location on a deltaic plain, the city is extremely prone to detrimental flooding, and risks associated with this are expected to increase further in the coming years due to global climate change impacts as well as the high rate of urbanization the city is facing. The lowest-lying part of Dhaka, namely Dhaka East, is facing the most severe risk of flooding. Traditionally, excess water in this part of the city was efficiently stored in water ponds and gradually drained into rivers through connected canals. However, the alarming increase in Dhaka's population is causing encroachment of these water retention areas because of land scarcity. The city's natural drainage is not functioning well and the area is still not protected from flooding, which causes major threats to its inhabitants. This situation increases the urgency to adapt effectively to current flooding caused by climate variability and also to the impacts of future climate change. Although the government is planning several adaptive measures to protect the area from floods, a systematic framework to analyze and assess them is lacking. The objective of this paper is to develop an integrated framework for the assessment and prioritization of various (current and potential) adaptation measures aimed at protecting vulnerable areas from flooding. The study identifies, analyzes, assesses and prioritizes adaptive initiatives and measures to address flood risks in the eastern fringe area, and the adaptation assessment is conducted within the framework of multi-criteria analysis (MCA) methodology. MCA facilitates the participation of stakeholders and hence allows normative judgements, while incorporating technical expertise in the adaptation assessment. Based on the assessment, adaptive measures are prioritized to indicate which actions should be implemented first. Such a participatory integrated assessment of adaptation options is currently lacking in the decision-making process in the city of Dhaka and could greatly help reach informed and structured decisions in the development of adaptation strategies for flood protection.","[Haque, Anika Nasra] Amer Int Univ Bangladesh, Dept Architecture, Dhaka 1213, Bangladesh; [Grafakos, Stelios; Huijsman, Marijk] Inst Housing & Urban Dev Studies, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands",American International University Bangladesh (AIUB),"Haque, AN (corresponding author), Amer Int Univ Bangladesh, Dept Architecture, Campus 7,House 23,Rd 17,Kemal Ataturk Ave, Dhaka 1213, Bangladesh.",anikanasra@gmail.com; s.grafakos@ihs.nl; m.huijsman@ihs.nl,"Haque, Anika Nasra/AAU-8305-2020","Haque, Anika Nasra/0000-0002-0717-376X; Grafakos, Stelios/0000-0002-6821-0667",,,,,16,32,32,0,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,1746-0301,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

Changes in blue-ice on the landscape are affecting transportation in traditional activities such as hunting and fishing, as well as the delivery of essential community supplies. The word adaptation linked to climate change does not exist in their languages and the term is associated with European colonization.

Excess rain can only be drained off with pumping systems or by evaporation due to the bowl-like shape of a large part of the city. As part of the solution to make New Orleans climate adaptive, green infrastructure has been implemented that enable rainfall infiltration and evapotranspiration of stored water after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The long-term efficiency of infiltrating water under sea level with low permeable soils and high groundwater tables is often questioned. Therefore, research was conducted with the full-scale testing method measuring the infiltration capacity of 15 raingardens and 6 permeable pavements installed in the period 2011-2022. The results show a high variation of empty times for raingardens and swales: 0.7 to 54 m/d. The infiltration capacity decreased after saturation (ca 30% decrease in empty time after refilling storage volume) but all the tested green infrastructure met the guideline to be drained within 48 h. This is in contrast with the permeable pavement: only two of the six tested locations had an infiltration capacity higher than the guideline 10 inch/h (254 mm/h). The results are discussed with multiple stakeholders that participated in ClimateCafe New Orleans. Whether the results are considered unacceptable depends on a number of factors, including its intended purpose, site specific characteristics and most of all stakeholder expectations and perceptions. The designing, planning and scheduling of maintenance requirements for green infrastructure by stormwater managers can be carried out with more confidence so that green infrastructure will continue to perform satisfactorily over the intended design life and can mitigate the effects of heavy rainfall and droughts in the future.","[Boogaard, Floris; Rooze, Daan; Stuurman, Roelof] Deltares, Daltonlaan 600, NL-3584 BK Utrecht, Netherlands; [Boogaard, Floris] Hanze Univ Appl Sci, Res Ctr Built Environm NoorderRuimte, NL-9747 AS Groningen, Netherlands",Deltares,"Boogaard, F (corresponding author), Deltares, Daltonlaan 600, NL-3584 BK Utrecht, Netherlands.;Boogaard, F (corresponding author), Hanze Univ Appl Sci, Res Ctr Built Environm NoorderRuimte, NL-9747 AS Groningen, Netherlands.",floris.boogaard@deltares.nl,"Boogaard, Floris Cornelis/V-6308-2019","Boogaard, Floris Cornelis/0000-0002-1434-4838",City of New Orleans (National Disaster and Resilience Competition); SIA [SVB/RAAK.PUB07.015],City of New Orleans (National Disaster and Resilience Competition); SIA,"This research was funded by City of New Orleans (supported with a grant of the National Disaster and Resilience Competition) and by SIA, grant number SVB/RAAK.PUB07.015 project Groenblauwe oplossingen, kansen en risico's' (Green Infrastructure: changes and challenges).",,42,0,0,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,JAN,2023,12,1,,,,,,,171,10.3390/land12010171,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land12010171,,,14,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,8C5KM,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000917647100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim is to build the resilience of informal settlements to climate change impacts. In particular, it highlights the types, categories, spatial and temporal scales of publicly available big data. The benefits of publicly available big data become clear when looking at issues such as the development and quality of life in informal settlements within and around major African cities. Sub-Saharan African (SSA) cities are among the fastest growing urban areas in the world. However, they lack spatial information to guide urban planning towards climate-adapted cities and fair living conditions for disadvantaged residents who mostly reside in informal settlements. Therefore, this study collected key information on freely available data such as data on land cover, land use, and environmental hazards and pressures, demographic and socio-economic indicators for urban areas. They serve as a vital resource for success of many other related local studies, such as the transdisciplinary research project DREAMS-Developing REsilient African cities and their urban environMent facing the provision of essential urban SDGs. In the era of exponential growth of big data analytics, especially geospatial data, their utility in SSA is hampered by the disparate nature of these datasets due to the lack of a comprehensive overview of where and how to access them. This paper aims to provide transparency in this regard as well as a resource to access such datasets. Although the limitations of such big data are also discussed, their usefulness in assessing environmental hazards and human exposure, especially to climate change impacts, are emphasised.","[Banzhaf, Ellen; Elze, Sebastian] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Urban & Environm Sociol, Permoser Str 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Bulley, Henry N.] CUNY, Borough Manhattan Community Coll, Dept Social Sci Human Serv & Criminal Justice, New York, NY 10007 USA; [Inkoom, Justice Nana] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Geosci & Geog, Dept Sustainable Landscape Dev, Von Seckendorff Pl 4, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); City University of New York (CUNY) System; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Banzhaf, E (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Urban & Environm Sociol, Permoser Str 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",ellen.banzhaf@ufz.de,,"Banzhaf, Ellen/0000-0002-4740-1202",Belmont Forum;  [FU 1000/4-1];  [RA-312/21],Belmont Forum; ; ,This research was funded by the Belmont Forum under grant number FU 1000/4-1 Belmont Forum; RA-312/21.,,30,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,DEC,2022,10,12,,,,,,,186,10.3390/cli10120186,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli10120186,,,16,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,7D5DD,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000900510100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We applied a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model to explore the response of the thermal structure in Germany's largest drinking water reservoir, Rappbode Reservoir, to future climate projections and different water withdrawal strategies. We used projections for representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6, 6.0 and 8.5 from an ensemble of 4 different global climate models. Simulation results showed that epilimnetic water temperatures in the reservoir strongly increased under all three climate scenarios. Hypoli mnetic temperatures remained rather constant under RCP 2.6 and RCP 6.0 but increased markedly under RCP 8.5. Under the intense warming in RCP 8.5, hypolimnion temperatures were projected to rise from 5 degrees C to 8 degrees C by the end of the century. Stratification in the reservoir was projected to be more stable under RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5, but did not show significant changes under RCP 2.6. Similar results were found with respect to the light intensity within the mixed-layer. Moreover, the results suggested that surface with-drawal can be an effective adaptation strategy under strong climate warming (RCP 8.5) to reduce surface warming and avoid hypolimnetic warming. This study documents how global scale climate projections can be translated into site-specific climate impacts to derive adaptation strategies for reservoir operation. Moreover, our results illustrate that the most intense warming scenario, i.e. RCP 8.5, demands far-reaching climate adaptation while the mitigation scenario (RCP 2.6) does not require adaptation of reservoir management before 2100.

TWSE is a climatic adaptive building envelope consisting of visually transparent modular water containers, exterior shading devices, water supply and return pipes. It is an upgraded water wall that can serve both as an energy efficient facade and an auxiliary water cistern in a building. Currently the energy simulation involving transparent water walls cannot be explicitly done in all energy simulation programs because transparent envelopes are always predefined as the surfaces without thermal mass due to the embedded algorithms complied with ISO15099 standard. A numerical approach based on the integrated energy and computational fluid dynamics (IE&CFD) simulation was developed for solving the energy simulation problem related with TWSEs. A simplified optical model of TWSE was proposed and validated through light transmission testing. Meanwhile, cooling and heating loads of a zone with TWSEs and conventional glazing in summer and winter months were studied. The thermal performance of a TWSE relative to the conventional glazing was also investigated via the comparative thermal box testing. Based on the simulation and testing results, it reveals that TWSEs can exceed most high performance coated glazing with regard to solar radiation control, and they are also exceptional energy efficient transparent envelopes that can outperform the ASHRAE standard window and conventional glazing in terms of cooling and heating load reduction as long as being configured and operated properly according to their physical characteristics and outdoor climatic condition. Furthermore, the innovative technical paradigm of TWSEs, along with the numerical approach developed for their energy simulation, demonstrates a wide range of versatility to be implemented in research and practice for ultra low energy buildings.","[Liu, Xiangfeng; Guo, Juanli; Zhu, Renjie] Tianjin Univ, Sch Architecture, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Xu, Miao] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",Tianjin University; Royal Institute of Technology,"Liu, XF (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Architecture, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",archliuxf@163.com,,"Liu, Xiangfeng/0000-0003-0138-4782",,,,,28,6,6,4,22,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0038-092X,1471-1257,,SOL ENERGY,Sol.

Although vernacular dwellings have received considerable attention, few studies investigate other building types. In this paper, the thermal environments of ancient timber-frame halls in northern China were investigated based on field measurements to obtain more evidence of traditional ecological ideology and related strategies. As one of the main types of public buildings in ancient China, six typical halls with different orientations, openings, and ceilings but similar spatial scales and materials were selected; their air temperature, relative humidity (RH), air speed, surface temperature, and globe temperature on typical summer and winter days were measured. The results show that the indoor air temperature of the ancient halls under free-running conditions fluctuated between 22.52 and 29.46 degrees C in summer and between -8.91 and -2.64 degrees C in winter, meaning that the indoor environments are comfortable in summer but too cold in winter according to GB/T 50785-2012, which is the Chinese standard for evaluating indoor thermal environments. Further analysis shows that the key strategy for comfort in summer is to have high heat capacity to provide shelter from hot air and solar gains; natural ventilation is considered to be merely an auxiliary approach. Climate-responsive design strategies for winter consist of a south-facing orientation with a maximum window-to-wall ratio and significant thermal insulation to utilize solar gains and to provide shelter from cold air.

A number of indices to estimate exposure are available in literature. However, testing or validating them is difficult and reveals a considerable variability, and no systematic methodology has been developed to guide users in selecting indices for particular applications. This need is addressed in this paper by developing a flowchart from a conceptual model that uses a system's approach. Also, we compare five approaches to estimate exposure indices (EIs) to study the exposure of agriculture to climate variability and change: single stressor-mean climate, single stressor-extreme climate, multiple stressor-mean climate, multiple stressor-extreme climate; and combinations of the above approaches. The developed flowchart requires gathering information on the region of study, including its agriculture, stressor(s), climate factor(s) (CF), period of interest and the method of aggregation. The flowchart was applied to a case study in Kansas to better understand the five approaches to estimate EIs and the implications of the choices made in each step on the estimated the exposure. The flowchart provides options that guide EI estimation by selecting the most appropriate stressor(s), associated CF(s), and aggregation methods when a detailed methodological analysis is possible, or proposes a default method when data or resources do not allow a detailed analysis. Climate adaptation involves integration of a multitude of factors across complex systems. A more standardized approach to assessing exposure can promote information sharing across different locations and systems as this rapidly evolving area of study moves forward.","[Anandhi, Aavudai; Bailey, Nathaniel] Florida A&M Univ, Biol & Agr Syst Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32307 USA; [Anandhi, Aavudai; Steiner, Jean L.] ARS, USDA, Grazinglands Res Lab, 7207 West Cheyenne St, El Reno, OK 73036 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida A&M University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Anandhi, A (corresponding author), Florida A&M Univ, Biol & Agr Syst Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32307 USA.;Anandhi, A (corresponding author), ARS, USDA, Grazinglands Res Lab, 7207 West Cheyenne St, El Reno, OK 73036 USA.",anandhi@famu.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [EPS-0903806]; USDA through the National Institute for Food and Agriculture's Agriculture and Food Research Initiative, Regional Approaches for Adaptation to and Mitigation of Climate Variability and Change [2013-69002-23146]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); USDA through the National Institute for Food and Agriculture's Agriculture and Food Research Initiative, Regional Approaches for Adaptation to and Mitigation of Climate Variability and Change","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Award No. EPS-0903806 and matching support from the State of Kansas through Kansas Technology Enterprise Corporation and the Funding provided by USDA to Project No. 2013-69002-23146 through the National Institute for Food and Agriculture's Agriculture and Food Research Initiative, Regional Approaches for Adaptation to and Mitigation of Climate Variability and Change.

This study shows that parameters of Farquhar's photosynthesis and Jarvis' stomatal conductance models differed between two apple cultivars, and examines the consequences of these differences for leaf water use efficiency. Methods Leaf stomatal conductance (g(sw)), net CO2 assimilation rate (A(n)), respiration (R-d) and transpiration (E) were measured during summer in 8-year-old 'Braeburn' and 'Fuji' apple trees under well-watered field conditions. Parameters of Farquhar's and Jarvis' models were estimated, evaluated and then compared between cultivars. Leaf carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13) was measured at the end of the growing season. Key Results A single positive relationship was established between V-Cmax (maximum carboxylation rate) and N-a (leaf nitrogen concentration per unit area), and between J(max) (maximum light-driven electron transport rate) and N-a. A higher leaf R-d was observed in 'Fuji'. The g(sw) responded similarly to increasing irradiance and leaf temperature in both cultivars. g(sw) responded to lower vapour pressure deficit in 'Fuji' than in 'Braeburn'. Maximal conductance (g(swmax)) was significantly smaller and A(n) was more limited by g(sw) in 'Braeburn' than 'Fuji'. Lower g(sw), E and higher intrinsic water use efficiency were shown in 'Braeburn' and confirmed by smaller leaf Delta C-13 compared with 'Fuji' leaves. Conclusions The use of functional model parameters allowed comparison of the two cultivars and provided evidence of different water use 'strategies': 'Braeburn' was more conservative in water use than 'Fuji', due to stomatal limitation of A(n), higher intrinsic water use efficiency and lower Delta C-13. These physiological traits need to be considered in relation to climate adaptation, breeding of new cultivars and horticultural practice.","INRA SupAgro, Equipe Architecture & Fonctionnement Especes Frui, UMR Dev & Ameliorat Plantes 1098, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France; CNRS, CEFE, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; INRA, UHP Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestieres, UMR 1137, F-54280 Champenoux, France",INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; INRAE; Universite de Lorraine,"Regnard, JL (corresponding author), INRA SupAgro, Equipe Architecture & Fonctionnement Especes Frui, UMR Dev & Ameliorat Plantes 1098, 2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France.",regnard@supagro.inra.fr,"Costes, Evelyne/C-8708-2009; Rambal, Serge/H-5705-2019","Rambal, Serge/0000-0001-5869-8382; DREYER, Erwin/0000-0003-4999-5072",,,,,59,72,79,5,53,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,1095-8290,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

Strategies based on the rehabilitation of green infrastructures in coastal municipalities, such as renaturalization of seafronts, are considered adaptive to the effects of climate change but may cause misconceptions that could lead to social conflicts between the tourist sector and the society. A survey was carried out to study user perceptions on the effects of climate change, preferences for adaptation strategies, and the assessment of projects of dune reconstruction. We find that while beach users recognize the benefits of NBS for environmental conservation and storm protection, they show little concern about possible effects of climate change on recreational activity and have limited understanding about the protective capacity of NBS. Thus, a greater effort must be made to better explain the effects of climate change and the potential benefits of NBS in coastal risk management.","[Sauer, Inga] Univ Politecn Catalunya Barcelona Tech, Barcelona, Spain; [Roca, Elisabet; Villares, Miriam] Univ Politecn Catalunya Barcelona Tech, Sch Civil Engineers Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Sauer, I (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Catalunya Barcelona Tech, Barcelona, Spain.",inga.josefine.sauer@estudiant.upc.edu; elisabet.roca@upc.edu; miriam.villares@upc.edu,,,"Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MINECO/AEI/FEDER) [CTM2011-29808, CTM2017-83655-C2-1-R]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MINECO/AEI/FEDER),"This research was performed in the framework of the PaiRisC-M project (CTM2011-29808) and the M-CoastAdapt project (CTM2017-83655-C2-1-R), funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MINECO/AEI/FEDER).",,56,6,6,6,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1096-3480,1557-7554,,J HOSP TOUR RES,J.

The perturbation experiments follow the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiment (CORE) version III. All regions of the global ocean experience a sea level rise within 7-8 days of the initialization of a polar meltwater input of 0.1 Sv (1 Sv equivalent to 10(6) m(3) s(-1)). The fast adjustment contrasts sharply with the slower adjustment associated with the smaller steric sea level evolution that is also connected with melt events. The global mean sea level rises by 9 mm yr(-1) when this forcing is applied either from Greenland or Antarctica. Nevertheless, horizontal inter-basin gradients in sea level remain. For climate adaption in low-lying coastal and island regions, it is critical that the barotropic sea level signal associated with melt events is taken into consideration, as it leads to a fast sea level rise from melting ice sheets for the bulk of the global ocean. A linear relation between sea level rise and global meltwater input is further supported by experiments in which idealized melting occurs only in a region east or west of the Antarctic Peninsula, and when melting rates are varied between 0.01 Sv and 1.0 Sv. The results indicate that in ocean models that do not explicitly represent the barotropic signal, the barotropic component of sea level rise can be added off-line to the simulated steric signal.","[Lorbacher, K.; Marsland, S.

Cultural support networks in both the MI and OI will almost certainly be relied upon to lessen the severity of climate change impacts, perhaps especially as more OI residents relocate to the MI.

The complex microbial community that resides within the yak rumen is responsible for fermentation and contributes to its climatic adaptation. This study aimed to characterize the rumen microbiota responses to wide seasonal variations, especially those necessary for survival in the cold seasons. Methods and Results In the present study, we performed 16s rRNA gene sequencing to investigate the seasonal variations in microbiota composition, diversity and associated volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in yak rumen. The results showed that rumen microbiota were dominated by Bacteroides (72.13%-78.54%) and Firmicutes; the relative abundance of Firmicutes was higher in summer (17.44%) than in winter (10.67%; p < 0.05). The distribution of taxa differed among spring, summer and winter rumen communities (PERMANOVA, p = 0.001), whereas other taxa (e.g., Fibrobacter, Verrucomicrobia, Anaerostipes and Paludibacter), which could potentially help overcome harsh climate conditions were observed in higher abundance during the cold spring and winter seasons. The highest total VFA concentration in the yak rumen was obtained in summer (p < 0.05), followed by spring and winter, and both positive and negative correlations between VFAs and specific genera were revealed. Conclusions Microbiota in yak rumen appear to be highly responsive to seasonal variations. Considering environmental factors, we suggest that seasonal adaptation by microbial communities in rumen enables their hosts to survive seasonal scarcity and cold stress in the spring and winter. Significance and Impact of Study The present study furthers our understanding of how microbial adaptation to seasonal variations in nutrient availability and climate may function in high plateau ruminants, providing insights into the tripartite relationship between the environment, host and microbiota.","[Huang, Xiaodan; Basangwangdui; Pingcuozhandui; Zhang, Qiang] Tibet Acad Agr & Anim Husb Sci TAA AS, State Key Lab Barley & Yak Germplasm Resources &, Lhasa, Peoples R China; [Huang, Xiaodan] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Mi, Jiandui] South China Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Long, Ruijun] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, 222 TianshuiNanlu, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [McSweeney, Christopher S.] CSIRO, Agr Flagship, Queensland Biosci Precinct, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",Lanzhou University; South China Agricultural University; Lanzhou University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Zhang, Q (corresponding author), Tibet Acad Agr & Anim Husb Sci TAA AS, State Key Lab Barley & Yak Germplasm Resources &, Lhasa, Peoples R China.;Long, RJ (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, 222 TianshuiNanlu, Lanzhou, Peoples R China.",longrj@lzu.edu.cn; longrj@lzu.edu.cn,,"HUANG, XIAODAN/0000-0001-8741-2785","Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Barley and Yak Germplasm Resources and Genetic Improvement (Tibet Academy of Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Sciences (TAA AS)), Lhasa Tibet, China [XZNKY-2021-C-014-K06]; Special Item of Regional Collaborative Innovation in Tibet Autonomous Region [QYXTZX-LS2021-01, QYXTZX-NQ2021-03]; National Modern Agricultural Technology System [CARS-37]; NSFC [31500101]","Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Barley and Yak Germplasm Resources and Genetic Improvement (Tibet Academy of Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Sciences (TAA AS)), Lhasa Tibet, China; Special Item of Regional Collaborative Innovation in Tibet Autonomous Region; National Modern Agricultural Technology System; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was Supported by the Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Barley and Yak Germplasm Resources and Genetic Improvement (Tibet Academy of Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Sciences (TAA AS)), Lhasa Tibet 850002, China (XZNKY-2021-C-014-K06), Special Item of Regional Collaborative Innovation in Tibet Autonomous Region (QYXTZX-LS2021-01, QYXTZX-NQ2021-03), National Modern Agricultural Technology System (CARS-37) and NSFC (31500101).",,43,5,5,13,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-5072,1365-2672,,J APPL MICROBIOL,J.

Development planning for climate change vulnerability and adaptation assessment was utilised in the study. Using multi-stage sampling procedure, 193 vegetable farmers in selected sites prominent for vegetable production from Uganda, Ghana and Nigeria were used. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, analysis of variance and linear regression at alpha(0.05). Awareness of climate variability and change was high among most respondents from the three countries, but highest among respondents from Uganda (78.3%). Awareness was highest for long dry spell (x over bar = 1.90) and drought (x over bar = 1.81) and lowest for harmful gas emissions (x = 0.76). Changes in climate variability and trends were perceived to be highest in terms of flood volume/damage caused by flood to farmlands in Nigeria (x = 3.85) and Uganda (x = 5.0), but in terms of increased temperature for Ghana (x = 4.93). Impact of climate-related changes on vegetable farming was high in Ghana (98.3%) and Nigeria (46.6%) but low in Uganda (5.0%). Awareness (beta= 0.14), perception (beta = 0.15) use of adaptation strategies (beta= 0.10) and household size (beta = - 0.19) predicted change in perceived impact of climate variability among vegetable farmers. Vegetable farmers in Nigeria, Ghana and Uganda are affected differently by climate variability. Farmers in these countries also have different priorities for adaptation strategies.

We analyzed ensemble projections of hydrological changes in the Alpine Rhine (Eastern Switzerland) for the near-term and far-term scenario periods 2024-2050 and 2073-2099 with respect to 1964-1990. For the latter scenario period, the model ensemble projects a decrease of daily mean runoff in summer (-32.2%, range [-45.5% to -8.1%]) and an increase in winter (+41.8%, range [+4.8% to +81.7%]). We applied an analysis of variance model combined with a subsampling procedure to assess the importance of different uncertainty sources. The CMs generally are the dominant source in summer and autumn, whereas, in winter and spring, the uncertainties due to the HMs and the statistical PP gain importance and even partly dominate. In addition, results show that the individual uncertainties from the three components are not additive. Rather, the associated interactions among the CM, the statistical PP scheme, and the HM account for about 5%-40% of the total ensemble uncertainty. The results indicate, in distinction to some previous studies, that none of the investigated uncertainty sources are negligible, and some of the uncertainty is not attributable to individual modeling chain components but rather depends upon interactions.

However, their transition temperatures, named lower critical solution temperature (LCST), are too high for building window applications, and it is also challenging to reduce LCST to comfortable room temperature range (e.g., 26-28 degrees C) in hot seasons. In this work, we report smart windows prepared using poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)-modified HPC hydrogels and demonstrate that the LCST of the resulting HPC/PAA hybrid hydrogels can be effectively tuned by solution pH, from 44 to 10 degrees C with decreasing pH from 6.0 to 1.0. At pH 2.5, an optimized LCST at 26.5 degrees C has been achieved. The sandwich-structured smart window, composed of two glass panes and an optimized HPC/PAA hydrogel in between, shows a high visible-light transmittance (T-lum = 90.1%), excellent solar energy modulation (Delta T-sol = 47.5%), outstanding heat-shielding performance, and excellent stability after 100 heating and cooling cycles. These optical properties outperform the reported thermosensitive cellulose-based materials, vanadium oxide based smart windows, and other thermosensitive hydrogel-based smart windows. Furthermore, HPC/PAA hydrogels are easy to prepare, nontoxic, biocompatible, low-cost, and environmentally friendly, making them very promising materials for energy-saving and climate-adaptable smart windows.","[Zhang, Liangmiao; Xia, Hui; Du, Yi; Gao, Yanfeng] Shanghai Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yupeng] Univ Nottingham, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Fac Engn, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Xia, Fang] Murdoch Univ, Harry Butler Inst, Perth, WA 6150, Australia",Shanghai University; University of Nottingham; Murdoch University,"Gao, YF (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China.;Xia, F (corresponding author), Murdoch Univ, Harry Butler Inst, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.",f.xia@murdoch.edu.au; yfgao@shu.edu.cn,"Xia, Fang/B-5056-2008","Xia, Fang/0000-0002-4950-3640","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51702208, 52072231]; Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission [18JC1412800]; Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission [2019-01-07-00-09-E00020]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission(Science & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM)); Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission(Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission),"This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51702208 and 52072231), the Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission (18JC1412800), and the Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission (No. 2019-01-07-00-09-E00020).",,35,18,18,29,113,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2574-0962,,,ACS APPL ENERG MATER,ACS Appl.

They are traditionally based on fixed setpoint temperatures during working hours and disregard outdoor conditions. The use of natural ventilation coupled with HVAC systems is frequently proposed when considering the global tendency towards reducing energy consumption in buildings. Buildings working under mixed mode instead of full air-conditioned mode, are a climate adaption development and usually lead to a decrease in energy consumption. However, there is no consensus on comfort thresholds and it is difficult to predict energy demand and consumption when considering global warming. This research focuses on quantifying the application of an adaptive comfort control mode in mixed mode office buildings. It consists of using daily setpoint temperatures based on the adaptive thermal comfort approach, in both present and future scenarios. The results show a 74.6% reduction in energy demand and a 59.7% drop in energy consumption when the adaptive comfort control implemented model (ACCIM) is applied in the current scenario. Results also establish that the ACCIM is more resilient to climate change, despite the fact that an increase in energy demand and consumption can be expected. The reduction of the energy demand ranges, with respect to the baseline model, from 31.0% currently to 39.1% in 2080, while energy consumption changes from 40.2% to 62.0% in 2080.

We investigate the effects of 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C global warming above preindustrial conditions, relative to present day (2006-2015), over the Asian-Australian monsoon region (AAMR) using five models from the Half a degree Additional warming, Prognosis and Projected Impacts (HAPPI) project. There is considerable intermodel variability in projected changes to mean climate and extreme events in 2.0 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C scenarios. There is high confidence in projected increases to mean and extreme surface temperatures over AAMR, as well as more-frequent persistent daily temperature extremes over East Asia, Australia, and northern India with an additional 0.5 degrees C warming, which are likely to occur. Mean and extreme monsoon precipitation amplify over AAMR, except over Australia at 1.5 degrees C where there is uncertainty in the sign of the change. Persistent daily extreme precipitation events are likely to become more frequent over parts of East Asia and India with an additional 0.5 degrees C warming. There is lower confidence in projections of precipitation change than in projections of surface temperature change. These results highlight the benefits of limiting the global-mean temperature change to 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial, as the severity of the above effects increases with an extra 0.5 degrees C warming.","[Chevuturi, Amulya; Klingaman, Nicholas P.; Turner, Andrew G.] Univ Reading, NCAS Climate, Reading, Berks, England; [Chevuturi, Amulya; Klingaman, Nicholas P.; Turner, Andrew G.; Hannah, Shaun] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; University of Reading,"Chevuturi, A (corresponding author), Univ Reading, NCAS Climate, Reading, Berks, England.;Chevuturi, A (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England.",a.chevuturi@reading.ac.uk,"Chevuturi, Amulya/P-5212-2016; Turner, Andrew G/D-2286-2009; Klingaman, Nicholas P/H-4610-2012","Chevuturi, Amulya/0000-0003-2815-7221; Turner, Andrew G/0000-0002-0642-6876; Klingaman, Nicholas P/0000-0002-2927-9303","UK-China Research and Innovation Partnership Fund, through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China as part of the Newton Fund; NERC REAL Projections project [NE/N018591/1]; UK Natural Environment Research Council [NE/L010976/1]; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; NERC [NE/N018591/1, ncas10008, ncas10005, NE/L010976/1, ncas10003] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/R015244/1, ncas10003, ncas10008, ncas10009, ncas10005, NE/L010976/1, NE/N018591/1] Funding Source: researchfish","UK-China Research and Innovation Partnership Fund, through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China as part of the Newton Fund; NERC REAL Projections project; UK Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","A.C. and A.G.T. were supported by the UK-China Research and Innovation Partnership Fund, through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China, as part of the Newton Fund.

The wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is a useful index for evaluating heat stress and anticipating conditions related to heat-related illness in the present climate, but projecting the WBGT with a sufficiently high temporal and spatial resolution remains challenging for future climate conditions. In this study, we developed a methodological framework for estimating the site-specific hourly resolution WBGT based on the output of general circulation models using only simple calculations. The method was applied to six sites in Japan and its performance was evaluated. The proposed method could reproduce the site-specific hourly resolution WBGT with a high accuracy. Based on the developed framework, we constructed future (2090s) projections under two different greenhouse gas emission pathways. These projections showed a consistent rise in the WBGT and thus the capacity to perform physically demanding activities is expected to decrease. To demonstrate the usefulness of the projected WBGT in planning adaptation measures, we identified the optimal working schedules which would minimize outdoor workers' exposure to heat at a specific site. The results show that a substantial shift in the working time is required in the future if outdoor workers are to compensate the effect of increased heat exposure only by changing their working hours. This methodological framework and the projections will provide local practitioners with useful information to manage the increased risk of heat stress under climate change.","[Takakura, Jun'ya; Takahashi, Kiyoshi; Hijioka, Yasuaki] Natl Inst Environm Studies, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Fujimori, Shinichiro] Kyoto Univ, Nishikyo Ku, 361,C1-3,Kyoto Univ Katsura Campus, Kyoto 6158540, Japan; [Honda, Yasushi] Univ Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Kyoto University; University of Tsukuba,"Takakura, J (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.",takakura.junya@nies.go.jp,"TAKAHASHI, KIYOSHI/AAD-5992-2019; Hijioka, Yasuaki/AAQ-7586-2020; Fujimori, Shinichiro/A-1288-2015","TAKAHASHI, KIYOSHI/0000-0002-0163-545X; Fujimori, Shinichiro/0000-0001-7897-1796",Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency [S-14],Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency,This research was supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S-14) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency.,,36,4,4,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0020-7128,1432-1254,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

Urbanites perceptions of the risks posed by climate change influence communities' mitigation and adaption responses, but there is limited literature on the perceptions of climate risks in cities. Urban climate change impacts are multi-scalar, but existing work isolates local versus global considerations. Adaptive capacity affects climate change impacts, yet scholarship on urban climate typically is not framed through an adaptive capacity lens. In this study, we explore how exposure to heat, place-based vs. social connections, and socio-demographics affect residents' perception that extreme heat (local extreme heat) or climate change (global climate change) seriously affects their household and way of life. Using a survey from metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona (USA), an area facing increased extreme heat and rapid climate change, this study shows that urbanites' perceptions of risks posed by extreme weather conditions and global climate change are mediated in part by the existing urban infrastructure and planning (e.g., access to urban green infrastructure) and magnified by exposure to heat, but also shaped by political ideology. We also find that place attachment and Latino or Hispanic ethnic background positively affect perceptions of local extreme heat, while high income negatively influences perceptions of global climate change impacts. Heat exposure positively, whereas green infrastructure negatively affects risk perceptions of both local extreme heat and global climate change. Risk perceptions are influenced by exposure and adaptive capacity. Identifying the drivers of risk perceptions across different local contexts is an essential step for generating in-situ climate adaptation strategies for cities.","[Yazar, Mahir] Univ Bergen, Fac Social Sci, Ctr Climate & Energy Transformat, Dept Geog, Bergen, Norway; [York, Abigail] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ USA; [Larson, Kelli L.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ USA; [Larson, Kelli L.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ USA",University of Bergen; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Yazar, M (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Fac Social Sci, Ctr Climate & Energy Transformat, Dept Geog, Bergen, Norway.",Mahir.Yazar@uib.no; Abigail.York@asu.edu; Kelli.Larson@asu.edu,"Yazar, Mahir/HPH-3673-2023",,National Science Foundation [DEB-1832016]; Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research Program (CAP LTER),National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research Program (CAP LTER),"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant number DEB-1832016, Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research Program (CAP LTER) .",,98,1,1,17,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-2751,1873-6084,,CITIES,Cities,AUG,2022,127,,,,,,,,103763,10.1016/j.cities.2022.103763,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2022.103763,,JUN 2022,10,Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Urban Studies,2E1ET,,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000811977300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, the outdoor thermal environment in Wuhan's main urban area is studied via the use of field measurements. From June to August in the years 2015 to 2017, 20 measurement points were selected for monitoring from 08:00 to 19:00 h, which were located in spaces such as residential areas, parklands, commercial streets, and college/university campuses. The measurements for the same types of land and different types of land use are analyzed. A comprehensive thermal environment index is used to quantitatively evaluate the overall situations of thermal environments. The results showed that the cooling effect of vegetation shading was stronger than the effect of water evaporation and the maximum temperature difference between the two cooling methods reached 6.1 degrees C. The cooling effect of the canopy shading of tall trees was stronger than the effect of grassland transpiration and the maximum temperature difference was 2.8 degrees C. The streets with higher aspect ratios might improve the ventilation, but the wind speeds remained low, which did not provide a strong cooling effect. This study helps urban planners understand the thermal environment of Wuhan or similar cities with hot summer and diversified urban areas, and puts forward suggestions to reduce the heat island effect from the aspect of building layout, green coverage, shading mode, and street aspect ratio, so as to establish sustainable cities that are climate adaptable and environmentally friendly.","[Li, Kun; Li, Xuefei; Yao, Keji] Wuhan Univ, Sch Urban Design, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Li, K (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Urban Design, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",kunli@whu.edu.cn; Li1018@whu.edu.cn; yaokeji@whu.edu.cn,,,basic work of science and technology of China [2013FY112500]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51208389],basic work of science and technology of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"FundingThis research was funded by the basic work of science and technology of China, grant number 2013FY112500, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 51208389.",,39,3,3,10,38,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2022,14,2,,,,,,,952,10.3390/su14020952,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14020952,,,25,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YN1YJ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000747060400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adaptation is ultimately local, yet similar challenges pose themselves to decision-makers all across the globe and on all levels. The Economics of Climate Adaptation (ECA) methodology has established an economic framework to fully integrate risk and reward perspectives of different stakeholders, underpinned by the CLIMADA (CLIMateADAptation) impact modeling platform. We present an extension of the latter to appraise adaption options in a consistent fashion in order to provide decision-makers from the local to the global level with the necessary facts to identify the most effective instruments to meet the adaptation challenge. We apply the open-source Python implementation to a tropical cyclone impact case study in the Caribbean, using openly available data. This allows us to prioritize a small basket of adaptation options, namely green and gray infrastructure options as well as behavioral measures and risk transfer, and permits inter-island comparisons. In Anguilla, for example, mangroves avert simulated damages more than 4 times the cost estimated for mangrove restoration, whereas the enforcement of building codes is shown to be effective in the Turks and Caicos Islands in a moderate-climate-change scenario. For all islands, cost-effective measures reduce the cost of risk transfer, which covers the damage of high-impact events that cannot be cost-effectively prevented by other measures. This extended version of the CLIMADA platform has been designed to enable risk assessment and options appraisal in a modular form and occasionally bespoke fashion yet with the high reusability of common functionalities to foster the usage of the platform in interdisciplinary studies and international collaboration.","[Bresch, David N.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bresch, David N.; Aznar-Siguan, Gabriela] Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss),"Bresch, DN (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Zurich, Switzerland.;Bresch, DN (corresponding author), Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, Zurich, Switzerland.",dbresch@ethz.ch,"Bresch, David N./D-5298-2018","Bresch, David N./0000-0002-8431-4263",,,,,71,8,8,2,6,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

It scrutinizes the potential and limitations of combining group-based qualitative interview methods, such as focus groups, with new digital media tools such as serious games. The paper brings together three strands of research: Climate change communication studies, methods literature on focus groups, and literature on (digital) serious gaming. Our review demonstrates that studies that deliberately combine focus groups methods with serious gaming have hitherto been scarce. There is a proliferation of digital visualization tools in climate change communication. We therefore see the need to critically explore what and how the integration of digital tools into qualitative group-based studies can contribute to enhancing research into climate change communication and knowledge development. To illuminate the opportunities and challenges for the integration of serious gaming in focus group studies in the area of climate change communication, we bring in a few illustrative examples from a research project that integrated focus group methodology with a serious game on climate adaptation in Nordic agriculture. Introducing digital serious games in focus group-based climate change communication studies can benefit climate change communication research in at least three ways: (a) by spurring participants' in-depth discussions, facilitating analysis of how sense-making occurs; (b) by providing opportunities to evaluate features of the game itself and to develop it for different target audiences; and (c) by forming part of participatory climate change communication activities, engaging lay people and/or experts in co-creating knowledge.

Increased water scarcity will exacerbate competition for water resources, not only between sectors but also between countries sharing transboundary river basins. Due to the mutual dependence of the energy sector on water resources and of the water services provision sector on energy inputs, the 'water-energy' nexus is acknowledged as a major challenge for the near future - with hydropower representing one of the most direct links in this nexus. The aim of this paper is to assess the economy-wide impacts of the concurrent effects of climate change-driven impacts on water availability and the sectoral and regional competition for scarcer water resources. In order to accomplish that goal, an integrated modelling approach is developed, where a computable general equilibrium model including raw water as a production factor is linked to TIMES_PT, a bottom-up model of the energy sector. A case study is provided for the Mediterranean country of Portugal. Results for 2050 show that macroeconomic impacts are significant, and encompass important inter-sectoral differences that, in turn, depend on the degree of competition between sectors. Impacts are stronger when water consumption by Spanish sectors is considered, as this intensifies water scarcity in Portugal. Thus the paper allows to gain insight in the broader 'water-energy-economy' nexus and the additional costs that the dependence on water resources availability in transboundary river basins represents to an economy - both aspects being of utmost importance for climate adaptation and energy policy making.

The rook, Corvus frugilegus (Passeriformes: Corvidae), predominantly resides in Europe but exhibits migratory habits in the eastern Palearctic region. East Asian populations of rook migrate from breeding grounds in the Eurasian continent around the Amur river basin to wintering grounds in central and south China, the Korean peninsula, and Japan. In Japan, the wintering grounds of C. frugilegus have been gradually expanding since the 1980s. In addition, rook populations that have previously roosted in secondary forests have recently moved to urban areas in several cities, resulting in urban fecal pollution. To clarify the wintering ecology of rooks roosting in urban areas in northern Kyushu, we surveyed seasonal trends in abundance, daily behavior, and dietary habit of rooks in two cities, Saga and Kumamoto. Wintering rooks gradually increased from November to December and decreased from January to March. In the daytime, the rooks foraged at croplands at mean distances of 6.3 and 9.7 km from the roosts, in groups averaging approximately 150 and 90 individuals in Saga and Kumamoto, respectively. Examinations of regurgitation pellets and stomach contents revealed the rooks fed mainly on spilled rice grains, supplemented with wheat and barley grains, Toxicodendron succedaneum and Triadica sebifera fruits, insects (beetles), and the apple snail. The rooks formed communal roosts with carrion crows and large-billed crows in both cities by joining their autumn communal roosts.","[Hattori, Minami; Sobagaki, Tomoo; Matsuda, Hiroki; Nakamura, Shoyo; Tokuda, Makoto] Saga Univ, Fac Agr, Lab Syst Ecol, Saga 8408502, Japan; [Sobagaki, Tomoo; Tokuda, Makoto] Kagoshima Univ, United Grad Sch Agr Sci, Kagoshima 8900065, Japan; [Matsuda, Hiroki] IDEA Consultants Inc, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2240025, Japan; [Nakamura, Shoyo] Nagasaki BIOPARK, Nagasaki 8513302, Japan",Saga University; Kagoshima University,"Tokuda, M (corresponding author), Saga Univ, Fac Agr, Lab Syst Ecol, Saga 8408502, Japan.",tokudam@cc.saga-u.ac.jp,,,Kumamoto City Government Office,Kumamoto City Government Office,This study was financially supported in part by the Kumamoto City Government Office.,,49,0,0,5,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1083-8155,1573-1642,,URBAN ECOSYST,Urban Ecosyst.,DEC,2022,25,6,,,,,1901,1911,,10.1007/s11252-022-01273-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-022-01273-0,,SEP 2022,11,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Urban Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,7A1VZ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000853505600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, the methods for assessing their status should be easy and repeatable. Monitoring through satellite data and field measurements are limited in accurately assessing the spatiotemporal dynamics of ecosystems. Fortunately, emerging technologies like Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) allow to transcend these limitations. But their calibration with field data for application in rangelands is still relatively new and less common than for example in precision agriculture. In this study we developed a drone-based workflow for mapping the condition of ran-gelands in dryland savannah. We evaluated how accurately and efficiently the two common indicators (i.e., potential forage biomass and rangeland cover type) of rangeland condition can be estimated from drone imagery across a range of conditions (i.e., highly degraded to healthy rangelands). To develop the drone-based potential forage biomass model we tested the accuracy of four vegetation indices to predict field biomass, with the optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) showing the highest prediction accuracy (R-2 = 0.89 and RMSE = 194.05). The OSAVI-based model yielded a significant strong relationship (R-2 = 0.80, p < 0.001) between predicted and field observed potential forage biomass across the rangeland system. For land cover, we applied a decision tree classification based on thresholds determined using data mining, with a mean overall accuracy of 95.8%. The drone-based estimates of bare cover, herbaceous cover and woody cover showed strong agreements (R(2 )ranging between 0.86 and 0.97) with the two image-truthing methods (line-point intercept and visual es-timations) tested. We show that the drone-based approach is more efficient, unbiased, and repeatable than the field methods. Based on these results, the drone-based workflow presented here offers a reproducible, accurate and efficient approach for near-real time monitoring of rangeland condition at a landscape level. This may assist with climate-adapted management to prevent further land degradation and associated threats to biodiversity and human livelihoods.","[Amputu, Vistorina; Heshmati, Sara] Univ Tubingen, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Plant Ecol Grp, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Braun, Andreas] Univ Tubingen, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Phys Geog & Geoinformat, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Retzlaff, Rebecca; Roeder, Achim] Trier Univ, Fac Spatial & Environm Sci 6, Earth Observat & Climate Proc, D-54286 Trier, Germany; [Knox, Nichola] Namibia Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Land & Spatial Sci, Windhoek 9000, Namibia; [Knox, Nichola] Downforce Technol, Oxford OX1 1QT, England",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Universitat Trier; Namibia University of Science & Technology,"Amputu, V (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Plant Ecol Grp, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",vistorina.amputu@bot.uni-tuebingen.de,,,"German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the research programme Tipping Points, Dynamics, and Interdependencies of Social-ecological Systems - BioTip [FKZ 01LC1821B]","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the research programme Tipping Points, Dynamics, and Interdependencies of Social-ecological Systems - BioTip(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","The study was sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the research programme Tipping Points, Dynamics, and Interdependencies of Social-ecological Systems - BioTip (NamTip project: FKZ 01LC1821B) .

Coffee also grows within some of the world's most biodiverse habitats, in areas predicted to experience severe climate change impacts. Like many other crops, coffee benefits from several ecosystem services (ES) that provide important inputs or conditions for production. Given coffee's strong interactions with conservation, livelihoods, and climate change, it is important to understand the roles of biodiversity-regulated ES to coffee and how they are likely to change under future climates. Here we review the available literature on the provision of two essential and interacting ES that regulate coffee production: control of a beetle pest by birds and pollination by bees. Studies show that bird and bee communities provide pest control and pollination services that improve coffee quantity and quality, benefiting coffee farmers whose livelihoods depend on this crop. The literature also shows that a variety of plot, farm, and landscape management practices that support resources for bees and birds can enhance these ES. We also evaluate how these ES and their interactions may change under future climate change. Several studies have estimated likely climate impacts on coffee per se, but few have investigated climate vulnerability of pollination and pest control ES. Even less studies have quantified interactions between these ES. Although evidence is incomplete, managing coffee farms as diversified agroforestry systems could improve climate resilience of coffee cropping and communities of birds and bees, and therefore help farming families adapt to their changing environment. Based on our review, we identify six critical research priorities in this active area of study. Filling knowledge gaps would advance our understanding of interactions among landscapes, ES, and climate change, and would support climate adaptation for the millions of households whose livelihoods depend on coffee.","[Chain-Guadarrama, Adina; Martinez-Salinas, Alejandra] Trop Agr Res & Higher Educ Ctr CATIE, Apdo 7170, Turrialba 30501, Cartago, Costa Rica; [Martinez-Salinas, Alejandra] CATIE, Agr Livestock & Agroforestry Program PRAGA, Apdo 7170, Turrialba 30501, Cartago, Costa Rica; [Aristizabal, Natalia; Ricketts, Taylor H.] Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Aristizabal, Natalia; Ricketts, Taylor H.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza; CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza; University of Vermont; University of Vermont,"Martinez-Salinas, A (corresponding author), Trop Agr Res & Higher Educ Ctr CATIE, Apdo 7170, Turrialba 30501, Cartago, Costa Rica.",achain@catie.ac.cr; amartinez@catie.ac.cr; Natalia.Aristizabal@uvm.edu; Taylor.Ricketts@uvm.edu,"Chain-Guadarrama, Adina/K-1167-2016; Guadarrama, Adina Chain/AAF-9619-2021; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Chain-Guadarrama, Adina/0000-0002-6944-2064; Guadarrama, Adina Chain/0000-0002-6944-2064; Martinez-Salinas, Alejandra/0000-0003-2557-0635; Aristizabal, Natalia/0000-0002-1001-8824",US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) through the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act (NMBCA) [F18AP00472]; Quantitative and Evolutionary STEM Training (QuEST) Program by the National Science Foundation [DGE-1735316],US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) through the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act (NMBCA); Quantitative and Evolutionary STEM Training (QuEST) Program by the National Science Foundation,"We thank Francisco Alpizar, Roger Madrigal-Ballestero, Matias Piaggio, and staff from Cafetalera Aquiares for comments and discussions that improved this review.

However, the influences of grazing on carbon cycling under climate change are still uncertain in this region. We modeled the carbon dynamics in Central Asia for different grassland types (i.e., Temperate Grassland, TG; Desert Grassland, DG; Forest Meadow, FM) that varied in grazing intensity from 1979 to 2011 by using the modified Biome-BGC grazing model. In addition, an inventory approach was also employed to estimate the CO2-eq emission from meat and milk production. The regional simulation estimated that the grassland ecosystems in Central Asia acted as a net carbon source with a value of 0.83 PgC for the last 33 years (1 Pg= 10(15) g). However, Central Asian grasslands had a weak carbon sink of 0.10 Pg when the grazing effect was eliminated. Grazing resulted in the release of 0.93 Pg C in Central Asia according to the modeling approach and 0.25-1.39 PgC to inventory approach. Nevertheless, proper grazing intensities for TG, DG, and FM at approximately 0.23, 0.35, and 0.35 head ha(-1), respectively, can result in overcompensation, which means that plants have higher productivity after herbivory compared with ungrazed condition under proper grazing intensity. These results can be attributed to the decreasing evapotranspiration (ET) in grazed grasslands, which can effectively promote grass growth. Therefore, restricting the grazing intensity to less than 0.23, 0.35, and 035 head ha(-1) for TG, DG, and FM, respectively, to mitigate the degradation and maintain its carrying capacity for livestock is important. Our research explored the possible implications for grazing management of grasslands in Central Asia and concluded that grazing can eventually be assembled into a set of biophysical tools for climate adaptation and mitigation.

This study therefore focuses on one specific PHA issue: adaptation to the oak processionary moth (OPM). The aim is to examine the development of OPM adaptation in order to offer a problem description of the complexities involved in OPM adaptation. In this explorative case study, we investigate adaptation strategies based on semi-structured interviews with 26 actors involved in OPM adaptation in The Netherlands. The results indicate that the context of OPM adaptation is relatively complex, given the involvement of many interdependent actors. OPM adaptation was developed with limited knowledge and strategies were based on ad hoc approaches in which there was ambiguity about tasks and expertise. In addition, different actors have different perceptions and values concerning health, sustainability, risks and responsibilities influencing decision-making processes, while also posing a challenge to collaboration and the development of a coordinated approach. The generation of knowledge and its translation into practical strategies calls for interdisciplinary cooperation in knowledge development. PHA adaptation involves more than technical and organisational solutions alone. It also entails the development of a shared problem perception and solution space in which citizens are also engaged.","[Buist, Yvette; Bekker, Marleen; Vaandrager, Lenneke; Koelen, Maria] Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Social Sci Hlth & Soc, POB 8130,Bode 60, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Buist, Y (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Social Sci Hlth & Soc, POB 8130,Bode 60, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",yvette.buist@wur.nl; marleen.bekker@wur.nl; lenneke.vaandrager@wur.nl; koelen@caiway.nl,,,Health and Society chair group at Wageningen University & Research in The Netherlands,Health and Society chair group at Wageningen University & Research in The Netherlands,This research was funded by the internal funds of the Health and Society chair group at Wageningen University & Research in The Netherlands.,,68,0,0,3,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

BGI projects like rain gardens, green roofs, and water squares can be combined to achieve a variety of technical (drainage), environmental (biodiversity), economic (property development) and social (health and wellbeing) goals and values at a local neighborhood level. As integrating such values within local governments' existing fragmented structures and procedures has proved to be challenging, urban governments are increasingly experimenting with innovative governance approaches at different levels to capitalize on the multiple benefits of BGI. Nevertheless, policy actors who try to justify their choices in the face of value conflicts are both constrained and enabled by the institutions they can call on. Using a qualitative comparative case study, this article therefore aims to gain insight into different ways of, or approaches to, organizing value integration. In particular, we compare: (1) a top-down case of programmatic steering to translate value integration into a neighborhood approach; (2) a market-oriented innovative procurement approach to local public-private partnership projects; and (3) a case of invitational governance for a future-proof neighborhood that is striving for a sense of citizen ownership. Our findings demonstrate the conditions, drivers, and barriers to the value integration of different governance innovations in relation to time-related issues, the types of support available, organizational embedding, and stakeholder involvement. Our specific focus is on understanding how social and sustainability and spatial and technical values are integrated. This paper thus helps us to get to grips with different pathways to value integration in the context of urban infrastructures, as well as their applicability and the conditions for success. These insights will enable the further strengthening of our capacity to build climate-proof cities in a value-driven and integrative manner.","[Kuitert, Lizet; van Buuren, Arwin] Erasmus Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Sociol, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Kuitert, L (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Sociol, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",kuitert@essb.eur.nl,,,BEGIN project-Interreg VB North Sea Region Programme; Dutch Construction Client Forum; City of Rotterdam,BEGIN project-Interreg VB North Sea Region Programme; Dutch Construction Client Forum; City of Rotterdam,"This work was supported by BEGIN project-Interreg VB North Sea Region Programme, the Dutch Construction Client Forum and the City of Rotterdam.",,73,0,0,1,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9634,,FRONT SUSTAIN CITIES,Front.

The study examines how climate change is affecting food systems and what can be done to mitigate its effects. Two methodological approaches were combined in the study. The first was an Asia-wide regional consultation and forum to explore a range of initiatives that transform food systems among stakeholders working in Myanmar. The second method was an in-depth food systems study employing qualitative methods in Htee Pu Village in the Myanmar Central Dry Zone, a research site of IIRR since 2017. Key informant interviews (KII) and focus group discussions (FGD) were conducted to capture insights and data. Food systems consist of components, drivers, actors, and elements that interact with one another and other systems such as social, health, and transportation. The Myanmar food system is complex. Making it sustainable and transformative requires a mix of different approaches implemented at various scales from local to national. It also requires actions that engage various actors in the system from producers to consumers. The study of the local food system of Htee Pu Village indicates that the village has a rural and traditional food system and that climate change is one of its key food system drivers. Climate change negatively impacted farming and agricultural practices and disrupted the input supply of the local food systems. The role of intermediaries such as traders and consolidators is critical in the supply and distribution of food in the Central Dry Zone. Improved and more connected roads are essential for the supply and distribution of food for the village. The informal market outlets serve as the primary food source or sale points for households. Household diets are inadequate in quantity as the population remains highly dependent on their crops for their diets due to relatively low income. Climate adaptation must be embedded in the local level management to mitigate the effect of climate change in food production in the longer term.","[Thant, Phyu Sin; Myae, Chan; Barbon, Wilson John] Int Inst Rual Reconstruct IIRR, Room 402,7 1 D Apartment,U Thin Pe St, Hlaing Township, Yangon, Myanmar; [Espino, Apple; Soria, Giulia; Gonsalves, Julian] IIRR Reg Ctr Asia, Cavite, Philippines; [Rodriguez, Edgard] Int Dev Res Ctr IDRC, Ottawa, ON, Canada",,"Thant, PS (corresponding author), Int Inst Rual Reconstruct IIRR, Room 402,7 1 D Apartment,U Thin Pe St, Hlaing Township, Yangon, Myanmar.",phyu.thant@iirr.org,"Barbon, Wilson John/ABR-2416-2022","Barbon, Wilson John/0000-0002-5028-1774; Soria, Giulia Erika/0000-0003-0352-7054","International Development Research Centre (IDRC) , Canada","International Development Research Centre (IDRC) , Canada(CGIAR)","This research was funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) , Canada.

Building on previous studies, we refine and update the mitigation potentials for 20 land-based measures in >200 countries and five regions, comparing bottom-up sectoral estimates with integrated assessment models (IAMs). We also assess implementation feasibility at the country level. Cost-effective (available up to $100/tCO(2)eq) land-based mitigation is 8-13.8 GtCO(2)eq yr(-1) between 2020 and 2050, with the bottom end of this range representing the IAM median and the upper end representing the sectoral estimate. The cost-effective sectoral estimate is about 40% of available technical potential and is in line with achieving a 1.5 degrees C pathway in 2050. Compared to technical potentials, cost-effective estimates represent a more realistic and actionable target for policy. The cost-effective potential is approximately 50% from forests and other ecosystems, 35% from agriculture, and 15% from demand-side measures. The potential varies sixfold across the five regions assessed (0.75-4.8 GtCO2eq yr(-1)) and the top 15 countries account for about 60% of the global potential. Protection of forests and other ecosystems and demand-side measures present particularly high mitigation efficiency, high provision of co-benefits, and relatively lower costs. The feasibility assessment suggests that governance, economic investment, and socio-cultural conditions influence the likelihood that land-based mitigation potentials are realized. A substantial portion of potential (80%) is in developing countries and LDCs, where feasibility barriers are of greatest concern. Assisting countries to overcome barriers may result in significant quantities of near-term, low-cost mitigation while locally achieving important climate adaptation and development benefits.

Understanding the spatio-temporal variation in rainfed agriculture is crucial for promoting food security, socio-economic stability and protecting the vulnerable ecosystem. This study aimed to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of rainfed agriculture in North Darfur State from 1984-2019 using multitemporal Landsat observation data. Using the random forest technique, the multitemporal images were classified into common land use/land cover classes and rainfed agriculture on goz (sandy) and wadi (seasonal river) lands. Overall accuracies were assessed using a confusion matrix. Overall accuracies were assessed using a confusion matrix has ranging between 94.7% and 96.9%, while the kappa statistics were greater than 0.90. The results showed that the high spatial variability in goz land used for rainfed agriculture increased of (889,622.46 ha) over 1994-1999, while it decreased (658,568.61 ha) over 2004-2009 south of the 232.9 mm isohyet. Rainfed cultivation of wadi lands expanded significantly of (580,515.03 ha) over 2014-2019 and decreased (182,701.8 ha) over 1994-1999, especially in the 362.8-477.2 mm isohyets (beyond the climate-adapted 500 mm isohyet agronomic dry limit). These spatial trends need further investigation as they may exacerbate both regional land degradation and disputes among farmers over scarce wadi lands. This study provides essential spatial data which are lacking owing to ongoing conflicts; this can help decision-makers formulate sustainable land use monitoring systems.","[Altoom, Mohammed B.

The US National Park Service (NPS) is facing the challenge of insufficient budget allocations for both maintenance and climate adaptation of historic structures. Research on adaptation planning for cultural resources has predominately focused on vulnerability assessments of heritage sites; however, few studies integrate multiple factors (e.g., vulnerability, cultural significance, use potential, and costs) that managers should consider when making tradeoff decisions about which cultural resources to prioritize for adaptation. Moreover, heritage sites typically include multiple types of cultural resources, and researchers have yet to examine such complex tradeoffs. This study applies the Optimal Preservation (OptiPres) Model as a decision support framework to evaluate the tradeoffs of adaptation actions among multiple types of historic structures-wooden buildings, masonry and concrete buildings, forts, and batteries-under varying budget scenarios. Results suggest that the resource values of different types of historic structures vary greatly under a range of budget scenarios, and tradeoffs have to be made among different types of historical structures to achieve optimal planning objectives. Moreover, periodic, incremental funding and partial maintenance are identified as optimal funding strategies for preservation needs of cost-intensive historic structures. Also, adaptative use of historical buildings (e.g., building occupancy) can improve the resource values when budgets are constrained. The OptiPres Model provides managers with a unique framework to inform adaptation planning efforts for a broad range of historic structures, which is transferable across coastal parks to enhance historic preservation planning under climate change.","[Xiao, Xiao; Lu, Junyu] Arizona State Univ, Sch Community Resources & Dev, 411 N Cent Ave,Suite 550, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [Xiao, Xiao; Lu, Junyu] Hainan Univ, Hainan Univ Arizona State Univ Joint Int Tourism, 58 Remin Rd, Haikou 570004, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Seekamp, Erin] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism Management, Box 8004,Biltmore Hall, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Eaton, Mitchell] US Geol Survey, Southeast Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, 127H David Clark Labs, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [van der Burg, Max Post] US Geol Survey, Northern Prairie Wildlife Res Ctr, 8711 37th St SE, Jamestown, ND 58401 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix; Hainan University; North Carolina State University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Xiao, X (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Community Resources & Dev, 411 N Cent Ave,Suite 550, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.;Xiao, X (corresponding author), Hainan Univ, Hainan Univ Arizona State Univ Joint Int Tourism, 58 Remin Rd, Haikou 570004, Hainan, Peoples R China.",xiao.xiao.7@asu.edu; elseekam@ncsu.edu; junyulu@asu.edu; mitchell.eaton@usgs.gov; maxpostvanderburg@usgs.gov,"Eaton, Mitchell J/HKW-4534-2023; Xiao, Xiao/Z-1199-2019","Eaton, Mitchell J/0000-0001-7324-6333; Xiao, Xiao/0000-0001-5124-0985; Seekamp, Erin/0000-0001-5082-1921",National Park Service Climate Change Response Program through U.S. Department of Interior Inter-Agency Agreement [P17AC00794]; U.S. Geological Survey through Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center [G19AP00042],National Park Service Climate Change Response Program through U.S. Department of Interior Inter-Agency Agreement; U.S. Geological Survey through Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center,The research presented in this paper was supported by the National Park Service Climate Change Response Program through U.S. Department of Interior Inter-Agency Agreement P17AC00794 (project title: Assessing the transferability of a historic resources decision support model for optimized budget allocation and adaptation planning).

In doing so, we scrutinize how notions of urban resilience, climate adaptation, and ecosystem-based infrastructure are influencing contemporary planning practice. Our account from New Orleans and the Mississippi River Delta traces several large-scale hydrological engineering projects with origins in the early 20th century, which aimed to restructure the landscape for more effective maritime transportation, flood protection, and urban drainage. The account then turns to a discussion of a massive and ongoing planning project, which aims to restore the historical dynamics of the Mississippi River Delta, diverting the river into nearby coastal wetlands to provide storm protection for vulnerable communities, most especially New Orleans. Our analysis shows how the development of water infrastructure systems in the region produced cleavages in the region's body politic and eco-hydrology, generating disputes that threaten to slow or obstruct the plan's implementation. The study shows how the forms and discourses of political contention in the present are deeply informed by past decisions regarding the placement, operation, and maintenance of water infrastructures in the region. The conflicts that emerge from these cleavages comprise the primary obstacle facing ecosystem-based strategies aimed at securing New Orleans and other major settlements in the region from storm surges. This raises fundamental challenges for planning practice, which are explored here through a discussion of situational dissensus, conflicting rationalities, and pathways for democratic institutional innovation.","[Lewis, Joshua A.] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lewis, Joshua A.] Tulane Univ, Water Inst, 6823 St Charles Ave, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Ernstson, Henrik] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Hist Sci Technol & Environm, KTH Environm Human Lab, Teknikringen 74D-4tr, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Ernstson, Henrik] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Dept Geog, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",Stockholm University; Tulane University; Royal Institute of Technology; University of Manchester,"Lewis, JA (corresponding author), 6823 St Charles Ave,627 Lindy Boggs Ctr, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",jlewis9@tulane.edu,,"Ernstson, Henrik/0000-0002-6415-4821",Swedish Research Council Formas [211-2011-1519],Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),"We thank Sverker Sorlin and Andrew Karvonen for providing feedback on earlier versions of this manuscript.

Over the last 15 years, a new field of research has focused on the interactions between climate and conflict risk, particularly as it relates to competition over natural resources and livelihoods. Within this field, there has been less attention to the potential for resource competition to be managed in ways that yield greater cooperation, local adaptation capacity, social-ecological resilience, and conflict mitigation or prevention. The challenge of increasing social-ecological resilience in small-scale agriculture is particularly acute in the socioeconomically and agroecologically marginalized Western Highlands of Guatemala. Not only is climate change a threat to agriculture in this region, but adaptation strategies are challenged by the context of a society torn apart by decades of violent conflict. Indeed, the largely indigenous population in the Western Highlands has suffered widespread discrimination for centuries. The armed conflict has left a legacy of a deeply divided society, with communities often suspicious of outsider interventions and in many cases with neighbors pitted against each other. We use the example of the Buena Milpa agricultural development project to demonstrate how grassroots approaches to collective action, conflict prevention, and social-ecological resilience, linking local stakeholder dynamics to the broader institutional and governance context, can bear fruit amidst postconflict development challenges. Examples of microwatershed management and conservation of local maize varieties illustrate opportunities to foster community-level climate adaptation strategies within small-scale farming systems even in deeply divided societies.","[Hellin, Jon; Lopez-Ridaura, Santiago] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Texcoco, Mexico; [Hellin, Jon] Int Rice Res Inst IRRI, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Ratner, Blake D.] CGIAR, WorldFish, Montpellier, France; [Meinzen-Dick, Ruth] IFPRI, Washington, DC USA",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); CGIAR; Worldfish; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Hellin, J (corresponding author), Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Texcoco, Mexico.",,,"Hellin, Jon/0000-0002-2686-8065","United States Agency for International Development (USAID); CGIAR Fund; CGIAR Research Programs on Policies, Institutions and Markets (PIM)","United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)CGIAR); CGIAR Fund(CGIAR); CGIAR Research Programs on Policies, Institutions and Markets (PIM)(CGIAR)","We would like to acknowledge support provided by United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through its Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative, Feed the Future.

This is important as the current coping behaviour serves as a starting point for future adaptations. Primary data were collected from 162 households by a questionnaire survey in three villages in Lijiang, Yunnan province. The results indicate that the majority of households have perceived an increasing occurrence of hailstorm and drought till present. Hailstorms were generally perceived to have more drastic impacts than drought. The most common coping strategy for both was to seek alternative income sources via sideline activities. In addition, there were hazard-specific coping strategies. Migrant work and assets depletion were important to cope with hailstorms while multiple strategies to solve water shortage were deployed during drought. Differences were also found across villages regarding the degree of perceived sensitivity and responses despite similar exposure to climate extremes. These differences are partly related to the nature of events and varied socio-economic characteristics of households, which influence their vulnerability and ability to cope. The study suggests initiatives which could facilitate coping. In addition to providing disaster relief and strengthening technical coping capacity, more efforts could be directed at spreading risk and revitalising livelihoods.","[Zheng, Yuan; Byg, Anja] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Zheng, Y (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",yuanzheng@ifro.ku.dk,,,,,,,52,18,18,0,55,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1747-7891,1878-0059,,ENVIRON HAZARDS-UK,Environ.

We use cognitive models of protective action decision making and planning to explore the effects of having a drought plan on the use of drought early warning information and drought response (and timing). Results of a cross-sectional, probability-based survey of livestock producers affected by a 2016 flash-drought are used to describe the characteristics of operations with drought plans and provide evidence of whether having a plan predicts drought information use and response. While larger operations are more likely than others to have plans for drought, having a drought plan appears to play a unique role in ranchers' use of information and decision making regardless of operation size. Findings suggest that encouraging the use of drought contingency planning may improve ranchers' adaptive capacity. Increased use of planning may also increase the effectiveness of communicating risk and early warning information, by making such information more actionable by decision makers.

The region faces challenges from multiple non-climate stressors such as poverty, environmental and climate shocks, and inadequate infrastructure. Addressing these deprivations in ways that reduce vulnerability associated with a changing climate are critical for the communities that live here. This paper combines data on flood risks derived from a climate-hydrology model under two future scenarios of RCP 4.5 and 8.5, with socio-economic data from communities in the Gandak basin, to demonstrate how mainstreaming climate change impacts into decision-making for sanitation interventions can reduce socio-economic vulnerability to flooding. A Cost-effectiveness analysis of the alternative interventions for sanitation reveals that gains are substantially higher under an intervention that takes note of climatic events, both for the present and in the future. Substantial health costs and inconvenience losses that are particularly acute for women during floods can be averted by investing in climate-friendly options. Climate adaptation (SDG goal 13 on climate action) can be synergistic with the achievement of other SDGs (Goal 6 on sanitation, goal 3 on health and well-being, goal 5 on gender).","[Dasgupta, Purnamita] Inst Econ Growth, Environm & Resource Econ Unit, New Delhi, India; [Prakash, Anjal] TERI Sch Adv Studies, Hyderabad, India; [Lutz, Arthur] FutureWater, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lutz, Arthur] Univ Utrecht, Dept Phys Geog, Utrecht, Netherlands",TERI University; Utrecht University,"Dasgupta, P (corresponding author), Inst Econ Growth, Environm & Resource Econ Unit, New Delhi, India.",purnamita.dasgupta@gmail.com,"Sahay, Samraj/H-3734-2019","Sahay, Samraj/0000-0003-4086-0411; DASGUPTA, PURNAMITA/0000-0001-5148-4402; Lutz, Arthur/0000-0002-6327-1487","HI-AWARE, CARIAA","HI-AWARE, CARIAA","This work was supported by HI-AWARE, CARIAA.",,73,1,1,1,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The subjects were native people from California, Oregon, Washington, the panhandle of Alaska, and British Columbia. They were categorized by their tribe's latitude and longitude (the center point of tribal distribution) and by habitat (characterized as coastal, western lowlands, and interior). Multiple R regressions were used to determine complex relationships between age, habitat, latitude, rainfall, mean January temperature, mean July temperature, and blood quantum, all of which affected some anthropometric variables to statistically significant degrees in both the male and the female samples. Body size and proportional differences support other studies of Bergmann's and Alien's rules, and variation in the nasal index supports prior studies of selection of longer, narrower noses in cold and dry climates and broader noses in warmer, moister ones. Recent disruption in the central portion of the study area was detectable in reduced size of subjects in these regions. Other complicating factors, such as ethnicity and the possibility of prior migrations and intermarriage between populations, are discussed.","OREGON STATE UNIV,CTR STUDY 1ST AMER,CORVALLIS,OR 97331",Oregon State University,"HALL, RL (corresponding author), OREGON STATE UNIV,DEPT ANTHROPOL,CORVALLIS,OR 97331, USA.",,,,,,,,32,14,14,0,4,WAYNE STATE UNIV PRESS,DETROIT,"4809 WOODWARD AVE, DETROIT, MI 48201-1309",0018-7143,,,HUM BIOL,Hum.

Plausible estimates of these climate change impacts require combined use of climate, crop, and economic models. Results from previous studies vary substantially due to differences in models, scenarios, and data. This paper is part of a collective effort to systematically integrate these three types of models. We focus on the economic component of the assessment, investigating how nine global economic models of agriculture represent endogenous responses to seven standardized climate change scenarios produced by two climate and five crop models. These responses include adjustments in yields, area, consumption, and international trade. We apply biophysical shocks derived from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's representative concentration pathway with end-of-century radiative forcing of 8.5 W/m(2). The mean biophysical yield effect with no incremental CO2 fertilization is a 17% reduction globally by 2050 relative to a scenario with unchanging climate. Endogenous economic responses reduce yield loss to 11%, increase area of major crops by 11%, and reduce consumption by 3%. Agricultural production, crop-land area, trade, and prices show the greatest degree of variability in response to climate change, and consumption the lowest. The sources of these differences include model structure and specification; in particular, model assumptions about ease of land use conversion, intensification, and trade. This study identifies where models disagree on the relative responses to climate shocks and highlights research activities needed to improve the representation of agricultural adaptation responses to climate change.","[Nelson, Gerald C.; Robertson, Richard; Robinson, Sherman] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Environm & Prod Technol Div, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Valin, Hugo; Havlik, Petr] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Sands, Ronald D.] ERS, Resource & Rural Econ Div, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Ahammad, Helal; Heyhoe, Edwina] Australian Bur Agr & Resource Econ & Sci, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Deryng, Delphine] Univ E Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Deryng, Delphine] Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Elliott, Joshua] Univ Chicago, Computat Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Elliott, Joshua] Columbia Univ, Ctr Climate Syst Res, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Fujimori, Shinichiro; Hasegawa, Tomoko] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Social & Environm Syst Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Kyle, Page] Pacific NW Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Von Lampe, Martin] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Trade & Agr Directorate, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Lotze-Campen, Hermann; Mueller, Christoph; Popp, Alexander; Schmitz, Christoph] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [van Meijl, Hans; Tabeau, Andrzej] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, LEI Agr Econ Res Inst, NL-2585 DB The Hague, Netherlands; [van der Mensbrugghe, Dominique] Food & Agr Org United Nations, Agr Dev Econ Div, I-00153 Rome, Italy; [Schmid, Erwin] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Willenbockel, Dirk] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England","CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia; University of Chicago; Columbia University; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Wageningen University & Research; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Sussex","Nelson, GC (corresponding author), Int Food Policy Res Inst, Environm & Prod Technol Div, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",nelson.gerald.c@gmail.com,"Schmid, Erwin/Z-1946-2019; Valin, Hugo/Z-1557-2019; Kyle, Page/AFP-3602-2022; Deryng, Delphine/AAN-6255-2020; Lotze-Campen, Hermann/AAA-5093-2020; Nelson, Gerald/L-5903-2019; van Meijl, Hans/G-6223-2015; Hasegawa, Tomoko/AAB-2616-2019; Mason-D'Croz, Daniel/M-4254-2016; Müller, Christoph/E-4812-2016; Tabeau, Andrzej/AAE-8214-2019; Willenbockel, Dirk/AAC-2191-2021; Deryng, Delphine/AAN-8899-2021; Fujimori, Shinichiro/A-1288-2015; Popp, Alexander/N-7064-2014","Schmid, Erwin/0000-0003-4783-9666; Valin, Hugo/0000-0002-0618-773X; Deryng, Delphine/0000-0001-6214-7241; Lotze-Campen, Hermann/0000-0002-0003-5508; van Meijl, Hans/0000-0002-2455-6869; Hasegawa, Tomoko/0000-0003-2456-5789; Mason-D'Croz, Daniel/0000-0003-0673-2301; Müller, Christoph/0000-0002-9491-3550; Willenbockel, Dirk/0000-0002-6840-0954; Fujimori, Shinichiro/0000-0001-7897-1796; Popp, Alexander/0000-0001-9500-1986","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security; US Department of Agriculture; UK Department for International Development; Ministry of the Environment of Japan [A-1103]; Integrated Assessment Research Program in the Office of Science of the US Department of Energy; European Union FP7 Projects Visions of Land Use Transitions in Europe; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems [1215910] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security; US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); UK Department for International Development; Ministry of the Environment of Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); Integrated Assessment Research Program in the Office of Science of the US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); European Union FP7 Projects Visions of Land Use Transitions in Europe; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE))","We thank the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security, the US Department of Agriculture, and the UK Department for International Development for support of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project.

Development of risk informed adaptation strategies for these highly utilized and inhabited inlet-interrupted coast zones requires projections of both alongshore average coastline recession and alongshore variability in coastline position along the coast under future forcing conditions, the latter being an aspect that has not received much attention to date. Here, a combination of a process-based morphodynamic model (Delft3D) and the reduced complexity coastline model (SMIC), concurrently forced with tides, waves, riverflows, and sea level rise, is used to investigate both of these phenomena at STI-interrupted coasts. The models are here applied to schematised conditions representing two systems in Sri Lanka, representing two of the three main Types of STIs: Negombo lagoon - permanently open, locationally stable inlet (Type 1), and Kalutara lagoon - permanently open, alongshore migrating inlet (Type 2). Results indicate that, under a high emissions climate scenario following RCP 8.5, by end-century, the coastline adjacent to the Type 1 STI may experience an alongshore average recession as large as 200 m, and that the alongshore variability in coastline position may be up to twice that at present. The Type 2 STI is projected to experience an alongshore average coastline recession of about 120 m, and up to a 75% increase in alongshore variability in coastline position by end-century, relative to the present. Thus, both the alongshore average coastline recession and the increase in the alongshore variability in coastline position are greater at the Type 1 STI, compared to at the Type 2 STI. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for both alongshore average coastline recession and future changes in alongshore variability in coastline position when assessing coastal hazards and risk on inlet-interrupted coasts to adequately inform climate adaptation strategies.","[Duong, Trang Minh] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Dept Coastal & Urban Risk & Resilience, Delft, Netherlands; [Duong, Trang Minh] Univ Twente, Dept Water Engn & Management, Enschede, Netherlands; [Duong, Trang Minh] Deltares, Harbour Coastal & Offshore Engn, Delft, Netherlands",IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; University of Twente; Deltares,"Duong, TM (corresponding author), IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Dept Coastal & Urban Risk & Resilience, Delft, Netherlands.;Duong, TM (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Dept Water Engn & Management, Enschede, Netherlands.;Duong, TM (corresponding author), Deltares, Harbour Coastal & Offshore Engn, Delft, Netherlands.",t.duong@un-ihe.org,,,,,,,48,3,3,0,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

However, disentangling the effects of climate variability and human activities on NPP is problematic and requires the calculation of potential net primary productivity (PNPP). In this study, we assessed the anthropogenic impacts on NPP in the Shiyang River basin-a typical arid and semi-arid region. We used the seasonal changes in NPP to identify the grids that were not affected by human activity and then proposed a method to calculate PNPP based on the leaf area index (LAI). We estimated the actual net primary productivity (ANPP) using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model, and the HNPP was then calculated as the difference between ANPP and PNPP. Our results showed that this method for PNPP calculation was reliable. From 2001 to 2016, the positive (90.85 gC.m(-2).a(-1)) and negative effects (-130.21 gC.m(-2).a(-1)) of human activities on NPP accounted for 32.68% and 96.84% of the ANPP, respectively, and the overall average HNPP was -3936 g C.m(2).a(-1). The implementation of ecological and environmental protection projects gradually mitigated the negative effects of human activity on NPP at a rate of 4.55 gC.m(-2).a(-1); however, negative HNPP values still occupied 55.39% of the entire region in 2016. In contrast with the prevailing views that climate change is the main factor accounting for vegetation recovery in arid and semi-arid regions, our results suggest that reducing human activities can significantly promote environmental restoration. The findings of this study suggest that policy makers and stakeholders can restore grassland ecosystems and promote environmental protection by reducing anthropogenic activities in arid and semi-arid regions.

However, it requires improvements of modelling methods, detailed observational data as input and expensive computational resources. This work aims to set up a distributed version of the HBV model with a physically based evapotranspiration scheme at 1 km resolution for mainland Norway and to calibrate/validate the model for 124 catchments using regionalized parameterizations. The Penman-Monteith equation was implemented in the HBV model and vegetation characteristics were derived from the Norwegian forest inventory combined with multi-source remote sensing data at 16 m spatial resolution. The estimated potential evapotranspiration (Ep) was compared with pan measurements and estimates from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MOD16) products, the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) and Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model. There are 5 climatic zones in Norway classified based on 4 temperature and precipitation indices. For each zone, the model was calibrated separately by optimizing a multi-objective function including the Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE) and biases of selected catchments. In total, there are 85 catchments for calibration and 39 for validation. The Ep estimates showed good agreement with the measurements, GLEAM and VIC outputs. However, the MOD16 product significantly overestimates Ep compared to the other products. The discharge was well reproduced with the median daily NSE of 0.68/0.67, bias of -3%/ -1%, Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.70/0.69 and monthly NSE of 0.80/0.78 in the calibration/validation periods. Our results showed a significant improvement compared to the previous HBV application for all catchments, with an increase of 0.08-0.16 in the median values of the daily NSE, KGE and monthly NSE. Both the temporal and spatial transferability of model parameterizations were also enhanced compared to the previous application.","[Huang, Shaochun; Magnusson, Jan Olof; Beldring, Stein] Norwegian Water Resources & Energy Directorate NV, POB 5091, N-0301 Oslo, Norway; [Eisner, Stephanie] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res NIBIO, POB 115, N-1431 As, Norway; [Lussana, Cristian] Norwegian Meteorol Inst, Henrik Mohns Plass 1, N-0313 Oslo, Norway; [Yang, Xue] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, POB 1047 Blindern, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Water Resources & Energy Directorate; Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research; Norwegian Meteorological Institute; University of Oslo,"Huang, SC (corresponding author), Norwegian Water Resources & Energy Directorate NV, POB 5091, N-0301 Oslo, Norway.",shh@nve.no,,"Beldring, Stein/0000-0002-8723-4496; Eisner, Stephanie/0000-0002-0157-1636",Norwegian Research Council [243803],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"The authors would like to thank Norwegian Research Council for funding the I:CAN (Impacts: Climate, anthroposphere and nature) project no. 243803 and our colleague Tuomo Mikael Saloranta for providing the observed snow data.",,68,17,17,2,30,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

Climate sensitive decision-making in companies is vital to addressing the urgent need for making societies resilient to climate change and entailed risks. Providing and using state-of-the-art scientific knowledge in decision-making, an integral aspect of climate services, poses great challenges for climate scientists and decision-makers. This article aims to contribute to more informed decision-making processes in climate adaptation by addressing the question How can climate scientists practically implement a transdisciplinary (TD) collaboration with an industry partner to reduce the gap between climate science and decision-making in industry?. We present an engagement framework that provides guidance to address this question. This framework conceptualizes the engagement using two spheres of interests offering the opportunity to explore and widen their overlap as a common space. We present a case study where we apply this framework to a TD collaboration for climate service provision with a Swiss hydropower industry stakeholder; leading to four practical recommendations for effectively using the proposed framework: (1) Secure an anchor person at management level of the decision-maker entity, (2) Be prepared to invest time into triggering and maintaining active engagement by all collaborators, (3) From the start, communicate the open nature of insights and solutions from the engagement process, (4) Be aware that you are working in a field of tension. The presented engagement framework and practical recommendations are particularly beneficial for climate scientists that are not yet familiar with TD collaborations and enables co-development of bespoke climate services.","[Fischer, Luise J.; Bresch, David N.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Zurich, Switzerland; [Fischer, Luise J.; Wernli, Heini] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bresch, David N.] Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss),"Fischer, LJ (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Zurich, Switzerland.",luise.fischer@usys.ethz.ch,"Wernli, Heini/F-1099-2016","Wernli, Heini/0000-0001-9674-4837",,,,,58,3,3,0,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8807,,,CLIM SERV,Clim.

Broad-scale political and developmental similarities (e.g., societally impactful developmental challenges related to climate variability) offer opportunities for comparative research resulting in potentially improved understanding of the complexities of various climate adaptation interventions including disaster risk reduction. Countries or geographical regions of the world significantly affected by climate extremes may consider collaboration on issues such as understanding and modelling of the climate system, especially when there is a common, dominant and somewhat plausible climate mode such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affecting the regions' climate variability. Better ENSO and subsequent climate predictions alone, however, are not enough to reduce the risks associated with such events. The socio-economic and political context in which climate finds expression and in which climate forecasts have potential value also need to be understood. Here we present seasonal precipitation forecast skill over 20 geographical regions including emerging or developing regions, but also a few developed regions, in order to rank their ENSO-related seasonal rainfall predictability in an attempt to cluster regions of similar ENSO climate predictability. We then also provide some of the broad contours to investigate the level of human development within these clusters in order to begin to understand some of the socio-economic factors that configure vulnerabilities. Such profiles begin to show some areas of macro-level vulnerability that may then provide further possible inter-area collaborations, albeit at very gross level scales.","[Landman, Willem A.; Savy, Janique] Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, Pretoria, South Africa; [Barnston, Anthony G.] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, New York, NY USA; [Vogel, Coleen] Univ Witwatersrand, Global Change Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Pretoria; Columbia University; University of Witwatersrand,"Landman, WA (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, Pretoria, South Africa.",willem.landman@up.ac.za,"Barnston, Anthony G/AHB-2825-2022",,,,,,59,12,13,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

The evaluation of transdisciplinary science requires a multi-method approach. Bibliometric analysis is consistently among the methods in multi-method evaluations. We analyse the accuracy of bibliometric evidence for the evaluation of transdisciplinary research by examining two large climate adaptation research programmes in the Netherlands. The assessment of accuracy involves a comparison of different approaches to defining and measuring involvement, output, and quality. We draw three conclusions with regard to accuracy. First, scientific output covers a fairly high amount of the scientific activities of the programmes, though information on funding agencies is not yet sufficiently accurate to reconstruct a programme's output through the Web of Science (WoS). Second, scientific output does not accurately reflect the nature and design of the programmes. The WoS appears to underestimate locally oriented and practically oriented research, non-academic actors rarely co-author scientific publications, and the contributions of non-academic organizations to projects could not be recognized from author affiliations. Third, our exploration of two alternative reproducible metrics (non-scientific output and download statistics) shows that it is too early to introduce such metrics into evaluation practices. The research agenda for transdisciplinary output metrics should focus on the development of a common definition of transdisciplinary research output and a typology of non-scientific outputs, as well as a discussion and assessment of the relative value of such outputs for the integration of knowledge.","[Koier, Elizabeth; Horlings, Edwin] Rathenau Inst, Sci Syst Assessment Dept, NL-2593 HW The Hague, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Rathenau Institute (KNAW),"Koier, E (corresponding author), Rathenau Inst, Sci Syst Assessment Dept, Anna van Saksenlaan 51, NL-2593 HW The Hague, Netherlands.",e.koier@rathenau.nl,"Horlings, Edwin/J-9279-2013","Horlings, Edwin/0000-0001-7787-8813",Dutch national research programme Knowledge for Climate [SSA01]; Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment,Dutch national research programme Knowledge for Climate; Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment,"This work was supported by the Dutch national research programme Knowledge for Climate [grant number SSA01] (www.knowledgeforclimate. org).

Due to global climate changes, extreme weather conditions are likely to occur more frequently in the future. The goal of this study was to identify patient groups most at risk of exacerbations during the four seasons of the year and to determine at which temperature threshold the daily hospital admissions due to AECOPD increase during the summer. Patients and methods: We analyzed retrospective demographic and medical data of 990 patients, who were hospitalized for AECOPD in Berlin, Germany. The cases were grouped into the following cohorts: spring (admission between March and May), summer (June August), autumn (September - November), and winter (December - February). AECOPD hospital admissions from 2006 and 2010 were grouped into a hot summer cohort and cases from 2011 and 2012 into a cold summer data-set. Climate data were obtained from the German Meteorological Office. Results: Patients hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation during winter were significantly older than summertime patients (P=0.040) and also thinner than patients exacerbating in spring (P=0.042). COPD exacerbations during hot summer periods happened more often to patients with a history of myocardial infarction (P=0.014) or active smokers (P=0.011). An AECOPD during colder summers occurred in patients with a higher Charlson index, who suffered in increased numbers from peripheral vascular diseases (P=0.016) or tumors (P=0.004). Summertime hospital admissions increased above a daily minimum temperature of 18.3 degrees C (P=0.006). Conclusion: The identification of COPD patient groups most at risk for climate related exacerbations enables climate-adapted prevention through patient guidance and treatment. In view of global climate changes, discovering vulnerabilities and implementing adaptive measures will be of growing importance.","[Hoffmann, Christina; Hanisch, Marc; Heinsohn, J.

The technologies of clean energy transition require more mineral resources than the traditional fossil fuel methods. The present study sheds the light on the role of mineral exploration using remote sensing techniques to fulfill the requirements of the clean energy technologies from mineral resources. In this study, the capabilities of ASTER data in mapping silica (an essential mineral for solar energy technologies) were demonstrated. Two case study areas with different geological environments of silica-rich rock units were studied. The Faiyum area contains sedimentary silica-rich rock units; mainly white sand, sandstone, and sand dunes. While the Higlig-Suwayqat area contains basement silica-rich rock units; mainly quartz plugs and veins included in the granitic rocks. Two remote sensing techniques; Band ratio (BR), and Constrained Energy Minimization (CEM) supervised classification techniques were applied to the ASTER surface reflectance. Several ASTER band ratios were tested; the ratio of b14/b12 was found the most effective band ratio for delineating the silica-rich areas. On the other hand, the CEM technique was applied using the USGS spectral signature of quartz mineral. CEM technique enabled mapping the pixels that have similar signatures to the input quartz signature as silica-rich areas. A field study was conducted in both the studied case areas to validate the remote sensing results; several silica-rich units were observed including; white sand, sandstone, sand dunes, quartz plugs/veins, and sand-rich wadi deposits. Based on the distribution of the silica-rich units mapped by both the adopted techniques as compared to the field observations, it is found that the accuracy of both the techniques is very high with an advantage of the CEM technique over the BR technique.","[Ali, Hala F.; Ghoneim, Sobhi M.] Natl Author Remote Sensing & Space Sci NARSS, Geol Div, Cairo, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); National Authority for Remote Sensing & Space Sciences (NARSS),"Ghoneim, SM (corresponding author), Natl Author Remote Sensing & Space Sci NARSS, Geol Div, Cairo, Egypt.",sobhy.mahmoud@narss.sci.eg,,"Ghoneim, Sobhi/0000-0002-8907-3307",Egypt's National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences (NARSS),Egypt's National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences (NARSS),"The authors would like to acknowledge the anonymous ?Editors and Reviewers? of the Journal of African Earth Sciences that their fruitful comments helped enhancing the previous version of this manuscript.

More recently, climate change is steadily increasing stress on aging traditional, gray infrastructure. Recent trends in river management present an opportunity to address both the ecological degradation and climate stress. A strategic focus on riverscapes as critical natural infrastructure can serve as ecosystem-based adaptation to improve resilience to climate change and restore river ecosystem health. As traditional, gray infrastructure ages and fails under increasing climate stress, there is opportunity to rebuild with improved understanding of the value of the ecosystem services that healthy riverscapes provide. River valley bottoms, including source-water wetlands and riverscape floodplains, are the critical natural infrastructure areas deserving of protection and restoration to build resilience to increased frequency and severity of fires, floods and droughts associated with climate change. Since healthy riverscapes need space and water, the long-standing focus on restoring natural flow regimes makes sense. Equally crucial to restoring river health is to give rivers space and freedom to exercise (i.e., flood and adjust their channels).","[Skidmore, Peter] Walton Family Fdn, 158 Fillmore St, Denver, CO 80206 USA; [Wheaton, Joseph] Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, 5210 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Skidmore, Peter] 323 N Plum Ave, Bozeman, MT 59715 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Skidmore, P (corresponding author), 323 N Plum Ave, Bozeman, MT 59715 USA.",pskidmore@wffmail.com; joe.wheaton@usu.edu,"Wheaton, Joseph/F-1965-2010","Wheaton, Joseph/0000-0002-8361-8150",,,,,64,3,3,13,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2213-3054,,,ANTHROPOCENE,Anthropocene,JUN,2022,38,,,,,,,,100334,10.1016/j.ancene.2022.100334,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ancene.2022.100334,,APR 2022,7,"Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography; Geology,1L9OY,,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000799611000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The approach includes the application of a diagnostic framework to portray the existing SES configuration, including governance structures, in combination with qualitative modelling and Bayesian belief networks. Although SLR is predicted to cause saltwater inundation of freshwater ecosystems, cultural sites and built infrastructure, our study suggested that it may provide also an opportunity to bring together Indigenous and non-Indigenous knowledge and governance systems, towards a commonly perceived threat. Where feasible, mitigation actions such as levees may be required to manage local SLR impacts to protect important freshwater values. In contrast, adaptation will require strategies that facilitate participation by Kakadu Bininj (the Aboriginal people of Kakadu National Park) in research and monitoring programs that enhance understanding of salinity impacts and the adaptive capacity to respond to reasonably rapid, profound and irreversible future landscape-scale changes.","[Dutra, Leo X.

This requires considering climate change and climate change impact for decision making. Although this knowledge is uncertain and depends on future green-house gas emission, it is rapidly expanding and improving. Therefore, it is important to create flexible systems with adaptable data bases and analytical tools to integrate knowledge of future climate change in agronomy for impact studies and adaptation planning. The joint project LandCaRe (Land, Climate, and Resources) 2020 aimed at developing a conceptual framework and prototype of a model-based decision support system (DSS) based on improved process knowledge and stakeholder communication. The final product, the LandCaRe DSS should combine grid-based information on regional climate and land surface, robust climate impact models and socio-economic boundary conditions to develop spatially explicit climate impact scenarios. Emphasis was put on the integration of different knowledge from science and practice. Climate projections had to be adapted to the needs of impact modelling of agricultural and ecological processes at regional and farm scale. Impact modelling included new process knowledge, especially related to the CO2 fertilisation effect on crop rotations. A new Free Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment Experiment (FACE) on the C-4 plant maize was conducted during the project. A new agro-ecosystem model was developed which integrates soil plant atmosphere exchange and plant production to predict crop yield as well as water, carbon and nitrogen fluxes. Stakeholders included representatives of agricultural and environmental administrations, managers of agro-enterprises and large farms as well as organisations for regional planning and nature conservation. Their central common interests were future land use, water availability and management. Stakeholders from agriculture requested not only to assess potential impacts of regional climate change on yield but also to interpret climate impact on farm economy. This required the design of a farm-economy module linking effects of management and adaptation on crop yield with scenarios of costs and prices. Here an introduction to the project, components of the DSS and its further perspectives are presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Expanding irrigation onto currently underperforming rainfed croplands is crucial to meet future global food demand without further agricultural expansion and associated encroachment of natural ecosystems. Establishing irrigation is also a potential climate adaptation solution to alleviate heat- and water-stress to crops and reduce climate variability and extremes. Despite irrigation being one of the land management practices with the largest environmental and hydroclimatic impacts, the role of irrigation to adapt agriculture to climate change and achieve global sustainability goals has just started to be quantified. This study reviews biophysical opportunities and feedbacks of 'sustainable irrigation'. I describe the concept of sustainable irrigation expansion-where there are opportunities to increase agricultural productivity over currently water-limited rainfed croplands by adopting irrigation practices that do not deplete freshwater stocks and impair aquatic ecosystems. Expanding sustainable irrigation may avert agricultural expansion but create additional externalities that are often neglected. This review highlights major gaps in the analysis and understanding on the role of sustainable irrigation expansion to adapt agriculture to climate change. This study reviews the implications of a potential sustainable irrigation expansion on (a) global food security, (b) hydroclimatic conditions, (c) water quality, (d) soil salinization, (e) water storage infrastructure, and (f) energy use. These implications help to explain the challenges of achieving sustainability in irrigated agriculture and thus also point toward solutions and future research needs.","[Rosa, Lorenzo] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Carnegie Institution for Science,"Rosa, L (corresponding author), Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",lrosa@carnegiescience.edu,,"Rosa, Lorenzo/0000-0002-1280-9945",,,,,189,13,13,38,57,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

The adverse effects of global extreme climate and effective governance have attracted more and more attention of scholars. Considering the differences between developed and developing countries in climate response capacity, a key issue is how to encourage developed countries to provide adequate assistance to developing countries and enhance their enthusiasm to participate in addressing climate change challenges. Given this background, we evaluated the carbon emission reduction effects of developing countries before and after a quasi-natural experiment which involved obtaining the assistance of climate-related funding from developed countries. Specifically, we analyzed the assistance behavior for recipient countries and found that climate assistance can effectively reduce the carbon emissions level of recipient countries, and this result has a better impact on non-island types and countries with higher levels of economic development. Furthermore, the achievement of this carbon emissions reduction target stems from the fact that climate assistance has promoted the optimization of the energy structure of recipient countries and promoted the substitution of renewable energy for coal consumption. In addition, climate-related development finance plays a significant role in promoting the scientific and technological level of recipient countries, especially the development impact of the adaptive climate-related development finance. Therefore, this paper suggests that the direction of climate assistance should focus more on island countries and countries with low economic development level, and pay more attention to the coal withdrawal of recipient countries and climate adaptation field.","[Li, Nan; Shi, Beibei; Wu, Lei; Kang, Rong] Northwest Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian, Peoples R China; [Shi, Beibei; Kang, Rong] Shaanxi Key Lab Carbon Neutral Technol, Xian, Peoples R China; [Gao, Qiang] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian, Peoples R China",Northwest University Xi'an; Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Shi, BB (corresponding author), Northwest Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian, Peoples R China.;Shi, BB (corresponding author), Shaanxi Key Lab Carbon Neutral Technol, Xian, Peoples R China.",shibeibei@nwu.edu.cn,"Gao, Qiang/HLG-1785-2023; Kang, Rong/M-7984-2014","Gao, Qiang/0000-0003-2824-3322; ",Youth Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China [72103163]; Shaanxi Provincial Natural Science Basic Research Program [2021JQ-457]; China-Central Eastern European Countries Higher Joint Education Project [202028]; Shaanxi Key Laboratory for Carbon Neutral Technology,Youth Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China; Shaanxi Provincial Natural Science Basic Research Program; China-Central Eastern European Countries Higher Joint Education Project; Shaanxi Key Laboratory for Carbon Neutral Technology,"This research is funded by the Youth Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 72103163), Shaanxi Provincial Natural Science Basic Research Program (No. 2021JQ-457), China-Central Eastern European Countries Higher Joint Education Project (No. 202028).

One of the recent approaches is based on the reduction of the energy consumption through the climate adaptability of users. This research analyses the possibility of using adaptive setpoint temperatures to reduce the risk of energy poverty. A total of 6528 cases are considered in the south of Spain in 2015 and 2016 with actual data of temperature, hourly prices from the Voluntary Price for the Small Consumer, and the mean household incomes in both years. The energy consumption and expense are compared to both the static setpoints established by the Spanish Technical Building Code and the adaptive setpoints based on EN 16798-1:2019. In the annual calculation, by using both static and adaptive setpoints, the results show that the situation of energy poverty would only affect the family units belonging to the first decile of incomes. However, a monthly analysis identifies that the coldest or warmest months influence more deciles: for example, January 2015 affected until decile 8. The results also show that adaptive setpoints could reduce the risk of energy poverty in most cases, being more significant in Categories II and III from EN 16798-1:2019, in which this risk is reduced in all months of the year and in all deciles. This study aims to throw light on the use of HVAC systems according to the adaptation of users to reduce monthly the risk of energy poverty. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This paper focuses on 100 Resilient Cities (100RC), a transnational municipal network (TMN) that has created governance instruments with potential for contributing to global adaptation governance. Despite their different nature from international actors (states and intergovernmental organizations), the distinct practices of TMNs and how they might influence global adaptation governance are uncertain. Vague claims suggest that TMNs are innovative, but what this innovation consists of remains unclear. Therefore, the research question here is: how do TMNs innovate in global adaptation governance? This paper strives to answer this question, by building an analytical framework to identify types and features of governance instruments, based on the literature on policy instruments, global environmental governance and global climate governance. It presents a case study of 100RC, based on an in-depth documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews. The results suggest that TMNs can be innovative, if they, like 100RC, create original governance instruments instead of using the existing tools of international or other transnational actors. While some of 100RC's tools favour a more recent, soft and indirect approach, its considerable use of hard practices with significant obligation is particularly interesting considering the general characterization of TMNs as voluntary and soft. The governance practices of 100RC are thus not in stark contrast with those of international actors. Their diversity could provide inspiration for future action to improve the effectiveness of global climate adaptation governance, and the analytical framework developed here could be applied in further studies.","[Papin, Marielle] Univ Laval, Dept Polit Sci, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Laval University,"Papin, M (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Polit Sci, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",marielle.papin.1@ulaval.ca,"Papin, Marielle/ABH-3397-2020","Papin, Marielle/0000-0002-0674-6503",Fonds de Recherche du Quebec Societe et Culture,Fonds de Recherche du Quebec Societe et Culture,"This research was made possible thanks to a grant from the Fonds de Recherche du Quebec Societe et Culture.

When novel adaptation strategies are adopted in response to changing climatic and environmental conditions, outcomes are often contingent on individual households' adaptive capacities as well as broader environmental, social, economic, and political contexts. Understanding the heterogeneous and context-dependent outcomes of adaptation strategies is critical information for dryland sustainability policy, and is a burgeoning focus in climate adaptation science. We evaluated the 30-year process of novel adoption of camel husbandry by a group of Kenyan pastoralists, using a five-stage analytical approach that disaggregated dynamics in three ways: at the level of each individual who adopted camel husbandry; at the processual level by distinguishing assets that influenced decision-making, enactment, and streams of livelihood benefits; and at the temporal level by assessing changes in broader social-ecological contexts that occurred over the 30-year period. Our study revealed that adaptation unfolded as a heterogeneous, multi-phase process, contingent on individuals' different sources of adaptive capacity utilized at different junctures in their adaptation experience, as well as on temporal shifts in the broader social-ecological context. Synthesizing the findings using a multi-dimensional vulnerability framework, we concluded that because of inequality in access to assets among households and a concomitant weakening of social norms of reciprocity and social cohesion, the livelihood adaptation is generating contradictory effects on household-level and community-level resilience.","[Volpato, Gabriele; King, Elizabeth G.] Univ Georgia, Ctr Integrat Conservat Res, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Volpato, Gabriele] Univ Gastron Sci, I-12042 Pollenzo Bra, Cuneo, Italy; [King, Elizabeth G.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, 140 E Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [King, Elizabeth G.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Gastronomic Sciences; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"King, EG (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Ctr Integrat Conservat Res, Athens, GA 30602 USA.;King, EG (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, 140 E Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA.;King, EG (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",egking@uga.edu,,"Volpato, Gabriele/0000-0002-1950-2479",US National Science Foundation [1313659],US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by the US National Science Foundation (Grant No. 1313659) and conducted under Government of Kenya Research Clearance Permit No: NACOSTI/P/15/3076/6235.,,114,14,14,2,44,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Using the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model, we examined how different land use and land cover patterns affect regional climate in the agro-pastoral transitional zone of North China, whose environmental and socioeconomic conditions are sensitive to climate change. We parameterized WRF using land use and land cover maps corresponding to 2001 and 2010 conditions, which differ in the representation of four land surface biophysical parameters: vegetation fraction, leaf area index (LAI), albedo, and emissivity. From 2001 to 2010, vegetation fraction and LAI increased in summer, emissivity increased and albedo decreased in winter. Our WRF simulations show that differences in land use and land cover patterns led to widespread reduction in summer temperature with local cooling on the order of 1 degrees C, and extensive increase in winter temperature with local warming exceeding 0.8 degrees C. By contrast, simulations using the default landscape representation, provided by WRF itself, show only minor and random changes in temperature. Model evaluation further reveals that our simulations with appropriate land surface properties improve the performance of the WRF model. Our findings demonstrate that LUCC in Northern China has altered the regional climate over the past decade. The magnitude and spatial patterns of temperature changes quantified by our simulations provide useful information for understanding the impacts of LUCC on climate and for developing mitigation and adaptation strategies in arid and semiarid regions.","[Cao, Qian; Yu, Deyong; Wu, Jianguo] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, CHESS, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Georgescu, Matei] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Han, Zhe] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Temperate East Asia, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jianguo] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Wu, Jianguo] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Beijing Normal University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Yu, DY (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, CHESS, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",dyyucas@163.com,"Georgescu, Matei/G-5442-2011; Wu, Jianguo/G-6267-2010","Wu, Jianguo/0000-0002-1182-3024; Cao, Qian/0000-0002-0580-7407",National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2014CB954301]; Fund for Creative Research Groups of National Natural Science Foundation of China [41321001]; NSF [EAR-1204774]; Division Of Earth Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences [1204774] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(National Basic Research Program of China); Fund for Creative Research Groups of National Natural Science Foundation of China; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Earth Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) under Grant 2014CB954301 and the Fund for Creative Research Groups of National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 41321001.

A Global Analysis of Population Distance to Freshwater Bodies,PLOS ONE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,WORLD; RESOURCES; LEVEL; MAPS,"Traditionally, people have inhabited places with ready access to fresh water. Today, over 50% of the global population lives in urban areas, and water can be directed via tens of kilometres of pipelines. Still, however, a large part of the world's population is directly dependent on access to natural freshwater sources. So how are inhabited places related to the location of freshwater bodies today? We present a high-resolution global analysis of how close present-day populations live to surface freshwater. We aim to increase the understanding of the relationship between inhabited places, distance to surface freshwater bodies, and climatic characteristics in different climate zones and administrative regions. Our results show that over 50% of the world's population lives closer than 3 km to a surface freshwater body, and only 10% of the population lives further than 10 km away. There are, however, remarkable differences between administrative regions and climatic zones. Populations in Australia, Asia, and Europe live closest to water. Although populations in arid zones live furthest away from freshwater bodies in absolute terms, relatively speaking they live closest to water considering the limited number of freshwater bodies in those areas. Population distributions in arid zones show statistically significant relationships with a combination of climatic factors and distance to water, whilst in other zones there is no statistically significant relationship with distance to water. Global studies on development and climate adaptation can benefit from an improved understanding of these relationships between human populations and the distance to fresh water.","[Kummu, Matti; Varis, Olli] Aalto Univ, Water & Dev Res Grp, Espoo, Finland; [de Moel, Hans; Ward, Philip J.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Aalto University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Kummu, M (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Water & Dev Res Grp, Espoo, Finland.",matti.kummu@iki.fi,"Ward, Philip/E-6208-2010; Kummu, Matti/C-4797-2011; Varis, Olli/G-6506-2011; de Moel, Hans/L-1311-2013","Kummu, Matti/0000-0001-5096-0163; Varis, Olli/0000-0001-9231-4549; Ward, Philip/0000-0001-7702-7859; de Moel, Hans/0000-0002-6826-1974",Maa- ja vesitekniikan tuki ry; Aalto University; Dutch research programme Climate changes Spatial Planning; Dutch research programme Knowledge for Climate.,Maa- ja vesitekniikan tuki ry; Aalto University; Dutch research programme Climate changes Spatial Planning; Dutch research programme Knowledge for Climate.,"This work was funded by the following research grants: Maa- ja vesitekniikan tuki ry, postdoctoral funds of Aalto University, Dutch research programme Climate changes Spatial Planning and Dutch research programme Knowledge for Climate.

Adoption of climate-smart soil and crop management practices could buffer future extreme weather effects on maize yield. To test this hypothesis, the overarching aim of our study was to (i) calibrate and evaluation the DSSAT model for maize and parameterize the DSSAT tillage module for different tillage practices (contour ridge tillage and reduced tillage), and (ii) simulate the effects of different management options (tillage and crop residue incorporation) to buffer future extreme climate events on maize yield in four soil types (Lixisols and Plinthosols) located in two landscape positions (upslope and footslopes) of Benin and Burkina-Faso in West Africa, using two climate scenarios (baseline and 2 degrees C above pre-industrial period). Scenario analysis was performed using factorial combination of two tillage operations (contour ridge and reduced tillage), one crop residue treatment (with crop residue), and two N fertilizer rates (recommended N rate: 60 kg ha(-1) and double recommended N rate: 120 kg ha-1) using HAPPI dataset. Model performance (calibration, evaluation and tillage model parameterization) was good as indicated by the lower normalized root mean square error (nRMSE, 12 %-18 %) and mean root absolute error (MRAE, 10 %-16 %), and higher D-index (0.78-0.93) depending on tillage practices and soil types. Long term future climate simulations and cumulative probability distribution confirmed that with both fertilization cases (recommended and double recommended), contour ridge tillage along with crop residue application could enhance maize yield (4 %-7 %) at upslope field sites under a future 2 degrees C warming scenario, where soil erosion and loss of water and nutrients through runoff is a serious risk. Simultaneously, reduced tillage with crop residue application under both fertilization cases could be a valuable alternative to farmer's practice in fields with deep soils at footslope position (St1 and St3), as it resulted in a higher increase of maize yield (14.5 %) under future 2 degrees C warming scenario compared to the baseline and could be preferred by risk-averse farmers. Maize production on gravelly soils with low water retention capacity (St1, 63-66 mm) may suffer (-11 %) from future 2 degrees C warming regardless of the tillage practice. However, despite the significant site-specific tillage effects, intensified N fertilizer application could reduce maize yield losses on St2, St3, and St4, irrespective of tillage practices by improving maize N uptake under elevated CO2 during future warming period. Hence, the application of site-specific tillage operations and crop residue application has the potential to buffer future warming effects on maize yield as confirmed by DSSAT simulations.","[Nafi, Eeusha; Frei, Michael; Gaiser, Thomas] Univ Bonn, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat, Crop Sci Grp, Katzenburgweg 5, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Webber, Heidi] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Danso, Isaac] CSIR Oil Palm Res Inst, POB 74, Kusi, Ghana; [Naab, Jesse B.] West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapte, 06 BP 9507 06, Ouaga 06, Burkina Faso; [Nafi, Eeusha] Montana State Univ, Northwestern Agr Res Ctr, 4570 Montana Hwy 35, Kalispell, MT 59901 USA",University of Bonn; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman,"Nafi, E (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Northwestern Agr Res Ctr, 4570 Montana Hwy 35, Kalispell, MT 59901 USA.",eeusha.nafi@gmail.com,"Frei, Michael/K-5511-2013; Gaiser, Thomas/AAD-6326-2021; Mwenda, Nicholas/AAU-9334-2021","Frei, Michael/0000-0002-2474-6558; Gaiser, Thomas/0000-0002-5820-2364; Webber, Heidi/0000-0001-8301-5424",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the WASCAL program [FKZ 01LG1202A]; Eiselen Foundation Fiat Panis (Ulm); Stiftung Fiat Panis; Center for Development Research (ZEF),German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the WASCAL program(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Eiselen Foundation Fiat Panis (Ulm); Stiftung Fiat Panis; Center for Development Research (ZEF),"This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the WASCAL program (Funding number FKZ 01LG1202A), the Eiselen Foundation Fiat Panis (Ulm), Stiftung Fiat Panis, and Center for Development Research (ZEF).",,60,2,2,2,30,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-1987,1879-3444,,SOIL TILL RES,Soil Tillage Res.,JAN,2021,205,,,,,,,,104767,10.1016/j.still.2020.104767,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2020.104767,,,13,Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,OH6JN,,Green Submitted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000582696400021,View Full Record in Web of Science

In developing economies pathways practice can guide climate-resilient development (CRD) but is hampered by complex political dynamics, intensified by `resource curses' of abundant natural resources. We tested an adaptation pathways approach for large-scale natural resource development in Papua New Guinea's Bismarck Sea. We engaged with five contested development proposals for deep sea mining, oil palm and tourism to integrate CRD principles into decision-making. The process involved three steps: mapping decision-making and power, participatory pathways planning, and evaluation and learning. CRD-relevant information was fed into decision-making about the proposals. `Political spaces' were created through participatory planning that levelled power asymmetries, enabled common interests to emerge, democratised knowledge co-production, enhanced networks and coordination, and galvanised collective action to re-design the proposals with CRD considerations. The common political interests formed leverage points for conflict transformation and collaboration. Evaluation revealed the suspension of an oil palm development to allow a landuse plan to be formulated to account for food security, conservation and climate adaptation. The study highlighted three learnings: the importance of analysing politics and power in decision-making and identifying leverage points; the challenges for researchers wishing to create political spaces; and the necessity for capacity-building amongst local knowledge brokers to continue this role. We conclude by assessing the feasibility of mainstreaming this approach into decision-making in resource curses, dubbed by one decision-maker as `walking along with development'.","[Butler, J. R.

Recent climatic shifts in this highly diverse region are not well understood due to sparse observations, and as the skill of global climate products have not been thoroughly evaluated. We examine the performance for several reanalysis and satellite-based global climate data products (CHIRPS/CHIRTS, ERA5, MERRA-2, PERSIANN-CDR) as compared to the observation-based GPCC precipitation dataset. These datasets are then used to evaluate the magnitude and spatial extent of hydroclimatic shifts and changes in aridity and drought over the last four decades. We focus on water-limited regions that are important for rain-fed agriculture and particularly vulnerable to further drying, and newly delineate those regions for Central America and Mexico by adapting prior definitions of the Central American Dry Corridor. Our results indicate that the CHIRPS dataset exhibits the greatest skill for the study area. A general warming of 0.2-0.8 degrees C center dot decade(-1) was found across the region, particularly for spring and winter, while widespread drying was indicated by several measures for the summer growing season. Changes in annual precipitation have been inconsistent, but show declines of 20-25% in eastern Honduras/Nicaragua and in several parts of Mexico. Some regions most vulnerable to drying have been subject to statistically significant trends towards summer drying, increases in drought and aridity driven by precipitation declines, and/or a lengthening of the winter dry season, highlighting areas where climate adaptation measures may be most urgent.","[Stewart, Iris T.] Santa Clara Univ, Dept Environm Studies & Sci, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [Stewart, Iris T.; Stahl, Kerstin] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Freiburg Im Breisgau, Germany; [Maurer, Edwin P.] Santa Clara Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Sustainable Engn, Santa Clara, CA USA; [Joseph, Kenneth] Santa Clara Univ, Dept Bioengn, Santa Clara, CA USA",Santa Clara University; University of Freiburg; Santa Clara University; Santa Clara University,"Stewart, IT (corresponding author), Santa Clara Univ, Dept Environm Studies & Sci, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",istewartfrey@scu.edu,"Stahl, Kerstin/I-8138-2012; Maurer, Edwin/C-7190-2009","Stahl, Kerstin/0000-0002-2159-9441; Maurer, Edwin/0000-0001-7134-487X; Stewart-Frey, Iris/0000-0002-0232-2367",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [STA 632/6-1]; Frias Institute of Advanced Studies (FRIAS); National Science Foundation [BCS-1539795],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Frias Institute of Advanced Studies (FRIAS); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/ Award Number: STA 632/6-1; Frias Institute of Advanced Studies (FRIAS); National Science Foundation, Grant/ Award Number: BCS-1539795",,79,5,5,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Despite this, little work has considered how intention to adopt differs from actual adoption of climate change practices in agriculture. Applying the Theory of Planned Behavior we aim to assess whether different factors affect intended versus actual adoption of climate behaviors among farmers in New Zealand. Data were collected through mixed methods (37 interviews and a telephone survey of 490 farmers) in two regions of New Zealand 2010-2012. Through multiple regression models we test hypotheses related to the Theory of Planned Behavior around the role of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived capacity in affecting intended and actual adoption. Results suggest that there are different drivers of intended and actual adoption of climate change practices. Climate change attitudes and belief is only associated with intended not actual adoption. We find no evidence that subjective norms (climate change policy support) significantly influence either intention or actual adoption. Only perceived capacity and self-efficacy were important predictors of both intended and actual adoption. These results suggest a disconnect between intended and actual behavior change and that using data about intention as a guiding factor for program and policy design may not be prudent. Furthermore, fostering perceived capacity and self-efficacy for individuals may be crucial for encouraging both intended and actual adoption of climate adapting and mitigating behaviors.","[Niles, Meredith T.] Univ Vermont, Dept Nutr & Food Sci & Food Syst Initiat, 109 Carrigan Dr,350 Marsh Life Sci Bldg, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Niles, Meredith T.] Harvard Univ, Kennedy Sch Govt, Sustainabil Sci Program, 79 JFK St,Mailbox 81, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Brown, Margaret] Private Bag AgRes Ltd, Grasslands Res Ctr, Private Bag 11008, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand; [Dynes, Robyn] AgResearch, Lincoln Res Ctr, Lincoln, NE, New Zealand",University of Vermont; Harvard University; AgResearch - New Zealand,"Niles, MT (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Nutr & Food Sci & Food Syst Initiat, 109 Carrigan Dr,350 Marsh Life Sci Bldg, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.;Niles, MT (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Kennedy Sch Govt, Sustainabil Sci Program, 79 JFK St,Mailbox 81, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mtniles@uvm.edu; margaret.brown@agresearch.co.nz; robyn.dynes@agresearch.co.nz,,"Niles, Meredith/0000-0002-8323-1351","US National Science Foundation (NSF); US NSF IGERT grant - DGE [0801430]; New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology; AgResearch","US National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US NSF IGERT grant - DGE; New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology(New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology); AgResearch","Funding from the US National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research fellowship, US NSF IGERT grant - DGE#0801430, the New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology, and AgResearch.

This paper introduces an approach to assess vulnerability that incorporates a set of new factors. The method is demonstrated with a case study of a reservoir system in Salt Lake City using an integrated modeling framework composed of a hydrologic model and a systems model driven by temperature and precipitation data for a 30-year historical (1981-2010) period. The climate of the selected future (2036-2065) simulation periods were represented by five combinations of warm or hot, wet or dry, and central tendency projections derived from the World Climate Research Programme's (WCRP's) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5. The results of the analysis illustrate that basing vulnerability on severity alone may lead to an incorrect quantification of the system vulnerability. In this study, a typical vulnerability metric (severity) incorrectly provides low magnitudes under the projected future warm-wet climate condition. The proposed new metric correctly indicates the vulnerability to be high because it accounts for additional factors. To further explore the new factors, a sensitivity analysis (SA) was performed to show the impact and importance of the factors on the vulnerability of the system under different climate conditions. The new metric provides a comprehensive representation of system vulnerability under climate change scenarios, which can help decision makers and stakeholders evaluate system operation and infrastructure changes for climate adaptation.

However, since it was developed primarily in animals, we lack information on how general these patterns are across organisms. This is alarming if we are to understand how thermal tolerances are distributed globally, improve predictions of climate change, and mitigate effects. We approached this knowledge gap by compiling a geographically and taxonomically extensive database on plant heat and cold tolerances and used this dataset to test for thermal macrophysiological patterns and processes in plants. We found support for several expected patterns: Cold tolerances are more variable and exhibit steeper latitudinal clines and stronger relationships with local environmental temperatures than heat tolerances overall. Next, we disentangled the importance of local environments and evolutionary and biogeographic histories in generating these patterns. We found that all three processes have significantly contributed to variation in both heat and cold tolerances but that their relative importance differs. We also show that failure to simultaneously account for all three effects overestimates the importance of the included variable, challenging previous conclusions drawn from less comprehensive models. Our results are consistent with rare evolutionary innovations in cold acclimation ability structuring plant distributions across biomes. In contrast, plant heat tolerances vary mainly as a result of biogeographical processes and drift. Our results further highlight that all plants, particularly at mid-to-high latitudes and in their nonhardened state, will become increasingly vulnerable to ongoing climate change.","[Lancaster, Lesley T.] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland; [Humphreys, Aelys M.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Humphreys, Aelys M.] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",University of Aberdeen; Stockholm University; Stockholm University,"Lancaster, LT (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland.",lesleylancaster@abdn.ac.uk,,"Humphreys, Aelys/0000-0002-2515-6509",,,,,72,57,57,5,27,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,1091-6490,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

The risk of winter road hoar frost is subjected to changes in the warming climate. A better understanding of these changes could lead to improved forecasting of hoar frost risk and provide information to policymakers in making climate adaptation strategies. In this work, the decadal variation in winter road hoar frost risk between 2000 and 2016 in Sweden was examined by using in situ observations from 244 stations in the Swedish Road Weather Information System. Results show that hoar frost risks have decreased in the south of Sweden (south of 59 degrees N), whilst increasing in central Sweden (approximately 59 degrees-65 degrees N). Hoar frost risk tends to increase (decrease) in regions where there is a relatively high (low) mean number of hoar frost risk days. Further analysis indicates that the strengthened winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) over the last few decades, which resulted in warmer and wetter winters in Sweden, is the main cause of the changes. During strong positive NAO winters, the frequency of blocking anticyclones centred to the south-west of Sweden significantly decreased and led to more warm and moist air from south-west being transported to Sweden. The reduction in hoar frost risk in the southern part of Sweden is mainly due to an increase in road surface temperature, while the increasing hoar frost risk in central Sweden is dominated by the increase in relative humidity, which favours the occurrence of hoar frost.","[Hu, Yumei; Ou, Tinghai; Huang, Jianbin; Gustavsson, Torbjorn; Bogren, Jorgen] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, Guldhedsgatan 5 A, S-41320 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Huang, Jianbin] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Gothenburg; Tsinghua University,"Hu, YM (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, Guldhedsgatan 5 A, S-41320 Gothenburg, Sweden.",yumei.hu@gvc.gu.se,"Huang, Jianbin/AAP-5941-2020; Ou, Tinghai/A-5068-2013","Ou, Tinghai/0000-0002-6847-4099",Swedish Transport Administration,Swedish Transport Administration,"Professor D.

The aim of this study was to further address morphofunctional issues of the nasal cavity, using three human groups from subarctic, temperate, and subtropical regions of the Japanese Archipelago: prehistoric Okhotsk, early-modern Honshu and Okinawa groups. Methods: Using three-dimensional coordinates of craniometric landmarks surrounding the nasal cavity, we compared linear measurements regarding nasal cavity form among the three groups and also conducted 3D geometric morphometrics. Results: Both linear measurements and morphometric analyses corroborate the previously reported covariation pattern of nasal cavity shape with climate, where humans from a cold/dry climate tend to possess a relatively tall, narrow, and deep nasal cavity compared with those from a warm/humid environment. The northern Okhotsk group had overall larger cranial airways, which may be attributable to their large facial skeleton. However, the ratio of nasal/bimaxillary breadth was significantly lower in the Okhotsk group, indicating that maxillary size does not necessarily constrain the nasal breadth. In addition, despite the presence of obvious geographic clines in anterior nasal shape, posterior choanal shape lacked the north-south geographic cline. This suggests a certain level of morphofunctional independence between the anterior and posterior nasal openings. Conclusions: The observed geographic variations must, however, be partly considered as a reflection of different ancestral traits and population histories of the three groups. Nevertheless, the results indicate that intergroup variations in nasal cavity morphology can be largely explained by climatic conditions.

According to the 2020 Chinese Ecological and Environment Quality Bulletin issued by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China, 46% and 32% of the YRD cities are still above the Chinese air quality standards for PM2.5 and ozone respectively. Thus, coordinated control of PM2.5 and ozone has become the focus of improving air quality within the region. Facing the challenges of both climate change and air pollution, as a leading demonstration area in China, how can the YRD region first achieve the goal of simultaneous mitigating PM2.5 and ozone in the context of coping with climate change? In this study, based on a socio-economic development forecast framework coupled with the high-resolution air pollution emission inventory for the YRD region and the WRF-CMAQ air quality model, we simulated the improvement of regional air quality under different policy scenarios. The results show that the green low-carbon scenario (CP) has higher emission reduction potential than the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario and the more progressive scenario of end-of-pipe (EP) control policy, making it an important path in building a beautiful and green Yangtze River Delta in the long term. Under the CP scenario, compared to 2017, it is estimated that SO2, NOx, non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), and primary PM2.5 emissions will decrease by 55.1%, 26.5%, 25.2%, and 27% in 2025; and 66%, 56.4%, 36.1% and 39.4% in 2035. The annual average PM2.5 concentration and the 90th percentile of daily maximum 8-h average ozone concentration (O-3-8 h 90th) in YRD will reach 26 and 129 mu g m(-3), respectively by 2035, with 50% of 41 municipal cities in the region will even meet the standards in WHO IT-2. We show that to continuously improve the regional air quality, nationwide collaborations in the implementation of the strengthened abatement measures are needed in the medium and long-term attempts to simultaneously mitigate PM2.5 and ozone pollution. In the short- and medium-term, the end-of-pipe control scenario driven by the goal of beautiful and green Yangtze River Delta will play an important role in air pollution control. Starting from 2030, low-carbon policies driven by carbon neutral goals are expected to contribute significantly to the further reductions of both PM2.5 and ozone. To summarize, continuous and vigorous abatement in NOx and NMVOCs is the key to mitigate PM2.5 and ozone pollution, and to achieve the current national air quality standard for both PM2.5 and ozone, the NOx and NMVOCs emissions are expected to be reduced at least by 56% and 40% respectively, compared to 2017. The existing end-of-pipe control policy, in combination with other measures, including industrial restructuring, especially for NMVOCs-emission related industries (i.e. , industrial coating, petrochemical, chemical, rubber and plastics, pharmaceuticals), transportation restructuring, as well as the promotion of clean energy vehicles, non-road vehicles and ships are thus important means to the pollution control in the medium and long-term development in YRD region.","[Dai, Haixia; An, Jingyu; Huang, Cheng; Wang, Hongli; Zhou, Min; Qiao, Liping; Hu, Qingyao; Lou, Shengrong; Yang, Chao; Yan, Rusha] Shanghai Acad Environm Sci, State Environm Protect Key Lab Format & Prevent U, Shanghai 200233, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Kejun; Zhu, Songli] Chinese Acad Marcoecon Res, Energy Res Inst, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China",,"Huang, C (corresponding author), Shanghai Acad Environm Sci, State Environm Protect Key Lab Format & Prevent U, Shanghai 200233, Peoples R China.",Huangc@saes.sh.cn,,,,,,,36,1,1,19,21,SCIENCE PRESS,EPHRATA,"300 WEST CHESNUT ST, EPHRATA, PA 17522 USA",0023-074X,2095-9419,,CHIN SCI B-CHIN,Chin.

There is an urgent need to better understand the factors that determine people's capacity to cope with and adapt to adverse climate conditions. This paper examines the influence of formal education in determining the adaptive capacity of the residents of two low-income settlements: Los Manantiales in San Salvador (El Salvador) and Rocinha in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), where climate-related disasters are recurrent. In both case study areas, it was found that the average levels of education were lower for households living at high risk, as opposed to residents of lower risk areas. In this context, the influence of people's level of education was identified to be twofold due to (a) its direct effect on aspects that reduce risk, and (b) its mitigating effect on aspects that increase risk. The results further suggest that education plays a more determinant role for women than for men in relation to their capacity to adapt. In light of these results, the limited effectiveness of institutional support identified by this study might also relate to the fact that the role of formal education has so far not been sufficiently explored. Promoting (improved access to and quality of) formal education as a way to increase people's adaptive capacity is further supported with respect to the negative effects of disasters on people's level of education, which in turn reduce their adaptive capacity, resulting in a vicious circle of increasing risk.","[Wamsler, Christine] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Wamsler, Christine] Lund Univ, Ctr Risk Assessment & Management, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University,"Wamsler, C (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",,,,,,,,41,58,59,0,44,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

Using original survey data this paper discusses the challenges that community and county officials currently face, the perceived effects of future climate change in this region, and the perceived barriers to adaptation planning and hurdles to adaptation implementation. Results show lack of resources, information and political will are the most commonly reported barriers to adaptation. This paper also examines the connectivity between mountain communities and the surrounding federal public lands. Fifty one percent of respondents report that decisions made on nearby public lands frequently or always affect planning and decision making in their community. Collaborative efforts between these entities are proposed as a way to reduce the resource burden of adaptation planning for both entities. Finally, this paper discusses how attitudes and beliefs about climate change affect responses to questions about adaptation planning. On average, respondents who report higher levels of concern about and belief in climate change and those who are better informed about climate change report higher levels of adaptation planning. Elected officials in this sample have, on average, lower concern about and belief in climate change than bureaucratic respondents. Thus changes in elected official composition or improved leadership on climate change planning by incumbent officials could facilitate progress on adaptation.","Univ Colorado, CIRES, CSTPR, Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Archie, KM (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, CIRES, CSTPR, Environm Studies Program, 1333 Grandview Ave,Campus Box 488, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",kelli.archie@colorado.edu,,"Archie, Kelli/0000-0001-9348-8073","NOAA Climate Program Office through the Western Water Assessment RISA at CIRES, University of Colorado-Boulder; CIRES Graduate Research Fellowship","NOAA Climate Program Office through the Western Water Assessment RISA at CIRES, University of Colorado-Boulder; CIRES Graduate Research Fellowship","I thank the hundreds of municipal employees who took the time to answer my survey and contribute their knowledge to this study.

Although local governments have declared climate emergency in recent years, there is still a lack of real climate actions due to the poor understanding of the future climatic changes over Eastern Canada and how to mitigate and adapt to those changes from a long-term perspective. Here we attempt to fill this gap by developing high-resolution regional climate scenarios for Eastern Canada throughout the twenty-first century under three greenhouse gases emission scenarios (RCP2.6-low, RCP4.5-medium, and RCP8.5-high). The results suggest that the low-emission scenario of RCP2.6 would potentially stabilize the regional climate (i.e., no significant changes in both temperature and precipitation) over Eastern Canada after the continuous warming reaches its peak in the middle of this century. However, an average warming about 1 degrees C would still be expected from now to the end of this century under RCP2.6, highlighting the importance of preparing for a new climate normal even though strict carbon reduction efforts could be made before 2050. In comparison, both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios would lead to a continuous warming over Eastern Canada with increased total precipitation throughout this century. Most importantly, the warming trend under RCP8.5 is likely to accelerate after 2050, which would potentially cause significant shifts in the precipitation seasonality and bring more climate extremes, such as droughts in August, increasing spring and fall floods, more freezing rains between fall and winter, and more heavy snowfalls in winter. The results from this study can help the local policy makers understand the importance and scientific implications of taking immediate carbon reduction actions and developing long-term climate adaptation plans.","[Wang, Xiuquan; Fenech, Adam; Farooque, Aitazaz A.] Univ Prince Edward Isl, Canadian Ctr Climate Change & Adaptat, St Peters Bay, PE C0A 2A0, Canada; [Wang, Xiuquan; Fenech, Adam; Farooque, Aitazaz A.] Univ Prince Edward Isl, Sch Climate Change & Adaptat, Charlottetown, PE C1A 4P3, Canada; [Guo, Junhong] North China Elect Power Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, MOE Key Lab Resource & Environm Syst Optimizat, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Farooque, Aitazaz A.] Univ Prince Edward Isl, Fac Sustainable Design Engn, Charlottetown, PE C1A 4P3, Canada",University of Prince Edward Island; University of Prince Edward Island; North China Electric Power University; University of Prince Edward Island,"Wang, XQ (corresponding author), Univ Prince Edward Isl, Canadian Ctr Climate Change & Adaptat, St Peters Bay, PE C0A 2A0, Canada.;Wang, XQ (corresponding author), Univ Prince Edward Isl, Sch Climate Change & Adaptat, Charlottetown, PE C1A 4P3, Canada.",xxwang@upei.ca,"Wang, Xander/Q-9659-2018","Wang, Xander/0000-0002-3718-3416",Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada; New Frontiers in Research Fund; Atlantic Computational Excellence Network (ACENET),Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); New Frontiers in Research Fund; Atlantic Computational Excellence Network (ACENET),"This research was supported by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the New Frontiers in Research Fund, and the Atlantic Computational Excellence Network (ACENET).",,48,0,0,11,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Impacts are, however, associated with substantial uncertainties. This paper studies an uncertainty-robust adaptation strategy: strengthening the resilience of the impacted system. This approach is operationalised for the city of Rotterdam, using literature study, interviews, and a workshop. Potential impacts have been explored using national climate statistics and scenarios and a set of 'wildcards' (imaginable surprises). Sea level rise, particularly in combination with storm surge, and enduring heat and drought are the most relevant potential stresses in the area. These can lead to damage, loss of image, and societal disruption. Unclear responsibilities enhance disruption. 'Resilience principles' nude the concept of resilience sufficiently operational for local actors to explore policy options. Useful principles for urban resilience include: homeostasis, omnivory, high flux, flatness, buffering, redundancy, foresight and preparedness/planning, compartmentalisation, and flexible planning/design. A resilience approach makes the system less prone to disturbances, enables quick and flexible responses, and is better capable of dealing with surprises than traditional predictive approaches. Local actors frame resilience as a flexible approach to adaptation that would be more suitable and tailored to local situations than rigid top-down regulations. In addition to a change in policy, it would require a more pro-active mentality among the population. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Wardekker, J.

We present an analytical framework based on network theory, and apply this to the Swiss case study destination of Engelberg, in order to deduct a number of insights for the future assessment of resilience based on the cooperation of local actors. The main aim of the paper is to come up with comparable resilience metrics based on social network analysis in order to assess the structural strengths and weaknesses of a geographically delimited tourism system in the face of climate change. Together with the action potential of the individual actors these structural properties influence the adaptive capacity of both individual actors, and the tourism system as a whole. In line with comparable studies, we identify structural strengths and weaknesses around the core-periphery distribution (centrality), subgroups (modularity) and information flows (path length). We find that the Engelberg network follows an almost ideal-typical scale-free structure and the overall cooperation rate (density) is comparable to other tourism networks. The main weaknesses of the network with regard to climate change resilience are the lacking integration of public sector actors and the relatively high number of actors in the periphery of the network.","[Wyss, Romano; Luthe, Tobias] Univ Appl Sci HTW Chur, Inst Tourism & Leisure, Chur, Switzerland; [Wyss, Romano] Catholic Univ Eichstatt Ingolstadt, Chair Cultural Geog, Eichstatt, Germany; [Abegg, Bruno] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Geog, Innsbruck, Austria; [Abegg, Bruno] AlpS Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck,"Wyss, R (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci HTW Chur, Inst Tourism & Leisure, Chur, Switzerland.",romano.wyss@gmx.ch,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Luthe, Tobias/0000-0002-4748-3885",,,,,72,30,30,4,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2015,20,8,,,,,908,922,,10.1080/13549839.2013.879289,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2013.879289,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,V79ZB,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000212151800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

We present a global-scale dynamic land use allocation model and show that it can reproduce the broad spatial features of the past 100 years of evolution of cropland and pastureland patterns. The modeling approach integrates economic theory, observed land use history, and data on both socioeconomic and biophysical determinants of land use change, and estimates relationships using long-term historical data, thereby making it suitable for long-term projections. The underlying economic motivation is maximization of expected profits by hypothesized landowners within each grid cell. The model predicts fractional land use for cropland and pastureland within each grid cell based on socioeconomic and biophysical driving factors that change with time. The model explicitly incorporates the following key features: (1) land use competition, (2) spatial heterogeneity in the nature of driving factors across geographic regions, (3) spatial heterogeneity in the relative importance of driving factors and previous land use patterns in determining land use allocation, and (4) spatial and temporal autocorrelation in land use patterns. We show that land use allocation approaches based solely on previous land use history (but disregarding the impact of driving factors), or those accounting for both land use history and driving factors by mechanistically fitting models for the spatial processes of land use change do not reproduce well long-term historical land use patterns. With an example application to the terrestrial carbon cycle, we show that such inaccuracies in land use allocation can translate into significant implications for global environmental assessments. The modeling approach and its evaluation provide an example that can be useful to the land use, Integrated Assessment, and the Earth system modeling communities. 2014 The Authors.

Vegetation exerted significant influences on the budget by altering the surface thermal properties and land-atmospheric interactions, while the sign and magnitude remained unclear. With the aid of satellite observations, this study estimated the vegetation influences through a semi-physical approach. Methodologically, a physical model of the total surface radiation budget (R-net) was firstly built. Then, the empirical regressions between vegetation with radiation albedo and thermal emissivity were adopted. Finally, the vegetation influences were estimated by measuring the response of budgets (R-snet, R-lnet and subsequently R-net) to vegetation perturbance. Our results demonstrated that the global R-net presented a positive budget (73.20 W/m(2)) over the past two decades (2001-2020), which was dominated by the positive R-snet (135.52 W/m(2)). In contrast, the R-lnet showed a negative value (-60.92 W/m(2)), which helped to mitigate the warming trend. Vegetation tended to enhance the positive surface radiation budgets. Overall, the vegetation influences on R-snet, R-lnet and R-net were 56.20 W/m(2), -6.65 W/m(2), and 50.29 W/m(2), accounting for 41.47 %, 10.92 % and 68.70 % of the total budgets. Temporally, the vegetation influences showed increasing trends of 0.019 W/m(2)/yr (R-snet), 0.007 W/m(2)/yr (R-lnet) and 0.031 W/m(2)/yr (R-net). Physically, temporal variations of the vegetation influences were strongly affected by the interactions of atmospheric factors, particularly of the cloud, aerosol, and greenhouse gases (GHGs). Results of this study help to capture characteristics of surface radiation budgets and corresponding mechanism, which could support the climatic adaption and eco-environment management.

Rainfall over BNB supplies over two-thirds of the water to the Nile and supports a large local population living mainly on subsistence agriculture. Regional food security is sensitive to both the amount and timing of rain and is already an important political challenge that will be further complicated if scenarios of climate change are realized. In this study a simple spatial model of the timing and duration of summer rains (Kiremt) and dry season (Bega), and annual rain over the upper BNB was established from observed data between 1952 and 2004. The model was used to explore potential impacts of climate change on these rains, using a down-scaled ECHAM5/MP1-OM scenario between 2050 and 2100. Over the observed period the amount, onset and duration of Kiremt rains and rain-free Bega days have exhibited a consistent spatial pattern. The spatially averaged annual rainfall was 1490 mm of which 93% was Kiremt rain. The average Kiremt rain and number of rainy days was higher in the southwest (322 days) and decreased towards the north (136 days). Under the 2050-2100 scenario, the annual mean rainfall is predicted to increase by 6% and maintain the same spatial pattern as in the past. A larger change in annual rainfall is expected in the southwest (ca. +130 mm) with a gradually smaller change towards the north (ca. +70 mm). Results highlight the need to account for the characteristic spatiotemporal zonation when planning water management and climate adaptation within the upper BNB. The presented simple spatial resolved models of the presence of Kiremt and annual total rainfall could be used as a baseline for such long-term planning.","[Mellander, Per-Erik] Johnstown Castle Environm Res Ctr, TEAGASC, Agr Catchments Programme, Wexford, County Wexford, Ireland; [Gebrehiwot, Solomon G.; Bishop, Kevin] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Sci & Assessment, Uppsala, Sweden; [Gardenas, Annemieke I.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Soil & Environm, Uppsala, Sweden; [Bewket, Woldeamlak] Univ Addis Ababa, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Gebrehiwot, Solomon G.] Univ Addis Ababa, Ethiopian Inst Water Resources, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Bishop, Kevin] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Uppsala, Sweden",Teagasc; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Addis Ababa University; Addis Ababa University; Uppsala University,"Mellander, PE (corresponding author), Johnstown Castle Environm Res Ctr, TEAGASC, Agr Catchments Programme, Wexford, County Wexford, Ireland.",Per-Erik.Mellander@teagasc.ie,"Gärdenäs, Annemieke/AAE-9564-2019; Bishop, Kevin H/C-7816-2012; Gärdenäs, Annemieke/HGV-1512-2022","Bishop, Kevin H/0000-0002-8057-1051; Reurslag Gardenas, Annemarie/0000-0001-8390-220X",Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,"This study was funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, http://www.sida.se/English/.
