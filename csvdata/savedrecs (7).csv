The effect of climate change on the discharge of the Alata River Basin in Mersin province (Turkey) was assessed under the worst-case climate change scenario (i.e., RCP8.5), using the semi-distributed, process-based hydrological model Hydrological Predictions for the Environment (HYPE). First, the model was evaluated temporally and spatially and has been shown to reproduce the measured discharge consistently. Second, the discharge was predicted under climate projections in three distinct future periods (i.e., 2021-2040, 2046-2065 and 2081-2100, reflecting the beginning, middle and end of the century, respectively). Climate change projections showed that the annual mean temperature in the Alata River Basin rises for the beginning, middle and end of the century, with about 1.35, 2.13 and 4.11 degrees C, respectively. Besides, the highest discharge timing seems to occur one month earlier (February instead of March) compared to the baseline period (2000-2011) in the beginning and middle of the century. The results show a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature in all future projections, resulting in more snowmelt and higher discharge generation in the beginning and middle of the century scenarios. However, at the end of the century, the discharge significantly decreased due to increased evapotranspiration and reduced snow depth in the upstream area. The findings of this study can help develop efficient climate change adaptation options in the Levant's coastal areas.","[Yildirim, Umit; Guler, Cuneyt] Mersin Univ, Dept Geol Engn, Fac Engn, Ciftlikkoy Campus, TR-33343 Mersin, Turkey; [Onol, Baris] Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Aeronaut & Astronaut, Dept Meteorol Engn, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey; [Rode, Michael; Jomaa, Seifeddine] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Aquat Ecosyst Anal & Management, Bruckstr 3a, D-39114 Magdeburg, Germany; [Rode, Michael] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany",Mersin University; Istanbul Technical University; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); University of Potsdam,"Yildirim, U (corresponding author), Mersin Univ, Dept Geol Engn, Fac Engn, Ciftlikkoy Campus, TR-33343 Mersin, Turkey.",umityildirim@bayburt.edu.tr; cguler@mersin.edu.tr; onolba@itu.edu.tr; michael.rode@ufz.de; seifeddine.jomaa@ufz.de,"Rode, Michael/ABA-4786-2021; Rode, Michael/AAD-1014-2022; Yıldırım, Ümit/Z-3894-2019; Yıldırım, Ümit/AAH-6203-2021; Güler, Cüneyt/A-7755-2008; Jomaa, Seifeddine/P-7534-2017","Rode, Michael/0000-0003-0086-2033; Rode, Michael/0000-0003-0086-2033; Yıldırım, Ümit/0000-0002-7631-7245; Yıldırım, Ümit/0000-0002-7631-7245; Güler, Cüneyt/0000-0001-8821-6532; Jomaa, Seifeddine/0000-0003-4782-9468; Onol, Baris/0000-0002-6382-7975",Research Fund of Mersin University in Turkey [2015-TP3-1008]; Erasmus+ staff mobility programme of the European Union,Research Fund of Mersin University in Turkey(Mersin University); Erasmus+ staff mobility programme of the European Union,"The data sets utilised in this study in part originated from the PhD dissertation of the first author (U.

This study was conducted to analyse the spatio-temporal variability of precipitation and drought intensity in an arid catchment in South Africa. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to estimate the spatio-temporal precipitation where nine meteorological stations were used as input to the model. The model was calibrated and validated by regionalization with a physical similarity approach. SWAT only predicts precipitation at sub-basin level. Hence, the mean precipitation was further interpolated by using the inverse distance weighted method (IDW). The Mann-Kendall trend test shows that there was no trend in annual precipitation whereas in the monthly precipitation there was a 0.01 mm decrease. Daily precipitation varied from 0.1 to 4 mm whereas in a monthly basis, it varied from 6 mm (September) to 43.4 mm (February). The annual precipitation varied from 169 mm (1983) to 415 mm (2003) with a long-term mean of 280.8 mm. Precipitation is also highly variable in space throughout the catchment. Generally, annual precipitation decreased from north to south; however, during the winter season, the reverse was true due to the influence of rain-bearing condition from the south-western direction. Based on the aridity index (AI), the catchment is categorized as arid. The SPI shows that the 1983 drought was the worst whereas the 2003 and 2004 years were relatively wet. The results from this study provide baseline information for further research in climate change adaptation and environmental monitoring programs in the region.","[Mengistu, Achamyeleh G.; Tesfuhuney, Weldemichael A.] Univ Free State, Dept Soil Crop & Climate Sci, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Woyessa, Yali E.] Cent Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa; [van Rensburg, Leon D.] Vans Lab Soil Plant & Water Anal, ZA-9338 Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of the Free State; Central University of Technology,"Mengistu, AG (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Dept Soil Crop & Climate Sci, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa.",acha.mengistu@gmail.com; tesfuhuneyw@ufs.ac.za; ywoyessa@cut.ac.za; 216261eon@gmail.com,"Tesfuhuney, Weldemichael/AHC-1047-2022; Woyessa, Yali/GQH-6198-2022","Tesfuhuney, Weldemichael/0000-0002-1209-5321; Woyessa, Yali/0000-0002-1128-7321; Mengistu, Achamyeleh/0000-0002-2860-5699",Kumba Iron Ore Company (specifically by the Kolomela Mine),Kumba Iron Ore Company (specifically by the Kolomela Mine),This research was funded by Kumba Iron Ore Company (specifically by the Kolomela Mine).,,77,7,7,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,JUN,2020,8,6,,,,,,,70,10.3390/cli8060070,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli8060070,,,23,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,MN9SN,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000551179500009,View Full Record in Web of Science

This assumption persists in part because there is surprisingly little empirical evidence either way, although case studies suggest that there may be important differences. Here, we use a national survey of South Africa's commercial grain farmers (n = 389)-similar to their peers in higher-income countries (e.g., North America, Europe, Australia), but without subsidies-to show that they treat weather and climate change risks quite differently. We find that their perceptions of climate change risks are distinct from and, in many regards, oppositional to their perceptions of weather risks. While there seems to be a temporal element to this distinction (i.e., differing concern for short-term vs long-term risks), there are other differences that are better understood in terms of normalcy (i.e., normal vs abnormal relative to historical climate) and permanency (i.e., temporary vs permanent changes). We also find an interaction effect of education and political identity on concern for climate change that is at odds with the well-publicized cultural cognition thesis based on surveys of the American public. Overall, studies that use weather and climate variability as unqualified proxies for climate change are likely to mislead researchers and policymakers about how farmers perceive, interpret, and respond to climate change stimuli.","[Findlater, Kieran M.; Kandlikar, Milind; Satterfield, Terre] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Findlater, Kieran M.; Kandlikar, Milind] Univ British Columbia, Sch Publ Policy & Global Affairs, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Findlater, Kieran M.] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa; [Donner, Simon D.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; University of Cape Town; University of British Columbia,"Findlater, KM (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, Vancouver, BC, Canada.;Findlater, KM (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Sch Publ Policy & Global Affairs, Vancouver, BC, Canada.;Findlater, KM (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa.",k.findlater@alumni.ubc.ca,,"Findlater, Kieran/0000-0002-6818-5588",International Development Research Centre [106204-99906075-058]; Centre for International Governance Innovation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [435-2013-2017]; University of British Columbia; IODE Canada,International Development Research Centre; Centre for International Governance Innovation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); University of British Columbia; IODE Canada,"We thank our respondents for their time and attention; Dr. Mark New and the African Climate and Development Initiative at UCT for logistical support; Dr. Hendrik Smith at Grain SA for his feedback and dissemination of the survey; Dr. Chris Jack from the Climate System Analysis Group at UCT for the climate data; and Dr. Lucy Rodina for her feedback and research assistance.

One key element of preparedness is the use of sufficient climate information for monitoring, forecasting, and tracking long-term trends. In the face of a changing climate and increasing variability, these types of data are even more critical for planning and overall resiliency. The systematic use of these data to inform the drought planning component of drought risk management is a relatively recent development. Actionable science has direct applicability for planning and decision-making, and allows for an iterative process between scientists and end users that can build long-term drought resiliency. The article will describe how planners in Colorado are increasingly relying on climate data, ranging from paleoclimatological records to experimental seasonal forecasts, to guide their long-term drought preparedness and climate change adaptation efforts. This information can then be used to inform broader policy and planning efforts, unifying the scientific basis across multiple processes. In addition, the Integrated Drought Management Programme (IDMP), with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the Global Water Partnership (GWP) as co-leads, promotes national policies encouraging proactive risk management, and provides a platform for sharing the lessons learned by the planners, policy makers, and scientists around the world. Data-driven decision-making using climate information can help depoliticize actions and increase overall resiliency and response in times of drought, which will be increasingly important as the world warms.","[Finnessey, Taryn] Dept Nat Resources, Colorado Water Conservat Board, 1313 Sherman St,Rm 721, Denver, CO 80203 USA; [Hayes, Michael; Svoboda, Mark] Univ Nebraska, Natl Drought Mitigat Ctr, 3310 Holdrege St, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Lukas, Jeff] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Western Water Assessment, Boulder, CO 80304 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Finnessey, T (corresponding author), Dept Nat Resources, Colorado Water Conservat Board, 1313 Sherman St,Rm 721, Denver, CO 80203 USA.",taryn.finnessey@state.co.us,,,,,,,56,14,14,4,13,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0936-577X,1616-1572,,CLIM RES,Clim.

Lessons from Coastby,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; VULNERABILITY; ASSESSMENTS; GOVERNANCE; RESPONSES; INSIGHTS; SPACES,"For coastal areas across the world, sea-level rise and problems of coastal erosion and coastal flooding are expected to increase over the next hundred years. At the same time political pressure for continued waterfront planning and development of coastal areas threatens to increase our societal vulnerability, and necessitating climate adaptation in coastal zone management. The institutional dimension has been identified as important for ensuring a more robust adaptation to both current climate variability and future climate change. In this paper, lessons regarding institutional constraints for climate adaptation are drawn from a Swedish case-study on local coastal zone management, illustrating the diverse and complex nature of institutional capacity-building. The aim of the paper is to illustrate critical factors that from an institutional perspective condition the capacity to achieve a more integrated, strategic and proactive climate adaptation and for turning rules on paper to working practice, based on case-study experiences from Coastby. Following and expanding a framework for analysing institutional capacity-building we learnt that a selective few key actors had played a critical role in building a strong external networking capacity with a flip-side in terms of a weak internal coordinating capacity and lack of mutual ownership of coastal erosion between sectoral units e.g. risk-management, planning and environment. We also found a weak vertical administrative interplay and lack of formal coherent policy, procedures and regulations for managing coastal erosion between local, regional and national administrations. Further, tensions and trade-offs between policy-agendas, values and political priorities posed a barrier for capacity-building in coastal zone management which calls for processes to mediate conflicting priorities in policy-making, planning and decision-making. The case-study suggests that the ability of the political administrative system to acknowledge and deal with institutional conflicts is a critical condition for ensuring an integrated and proactive climate adaptation in coastal zone management.

Runoffs simulated by a lumped rainfall-runoff model were fed into a stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) routine to generate reservoir operating rules. These rules were optimized for maximum power generation under maximal and minimal reservoir level constraints. With these optimized rules, a power generation simulator was used to predict the amount of generated hydropower. The same steps, excluding calibration, were performed on 60 climate projections (from 23 general circulation models and 3 greenhouse gas emission scenarios) for future horizons 2036-2065 and 2071-2100. Reservoir operation rules were optimized for every climate change projection for the 3 power plants in the system. From these simulations, it was possible to determine hydropower numbers for both horizons. The same steps were performed under a modified system in which an additional turbine was added to each power plant. Results show that both the non-structural (optimizing reservoir rules) and structural (adding turbines) adaptation measures allow for increased power production, but that adapting operating rules is sufficient to reap the most of the benefits of increased water availability.","[Arsenault, Richard; Brissette, Francois; Malo, Jean-Stephane; Leconte, Robert] Ecole Technol Super, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Minville, Marie] Inst Rech Hydro Quebec, Varennes, PQ J3X 1S1, Canada",University of Quebec; Ecole de Technologie Superieure - Canada; Hydro-Quebec,"Arsenault, R (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, 1100 Rue Notre Dame Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.",richard.arsenault.1@ens.etsmtl.ca; francois.brissette@etsmtl.ca; minville.marie@ireq.ca; robert.leconte@usherbrooke.ca,,"Arsenault, Richard/0000-0003-2834-2750",,,,,31,30,30,2,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

Severe storm events and sea-level rise are threatening coastal communities with increasing levels of flood damage. Because ownership of coastal assets is distributed among many private and public actors, both individual property owners and public officials must take adaptive actions. This paper introduces an integrated agent-based and hedonic pricing modeling system to simulate coastal real estate market performance under non-equilibrium conditions that reflect the effects of storm events. The modeling system, which is used for policy analysis, is calibrated to conditions in two towns in Monmouth County, New Jersey, USA, which were badly damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The key findings are that (a) coastal real estate markets capitalize flood risk into property values but this discount diminishes rapidly as time passes between storm events, and (b) there is a distinct equity versus efficiency tradeoff in designing public policies to reduce the cost to society of coastal flooding. Stringent regulation of building practices reduces flood damage but drives away poorer home buyers and owners, whereas informational and incentive-based policies are fairer but less effective. Hands-off, market-based retreat from risky areas is socially costly but allows less wealthy people to remain at the shore, albeit in vulnerable situations. Managed retreat should emphasize improved recreational access to coastal amenities while discouraging people from living there.","[Chandra-Putra, Handi] Univ Tarumanagara, Real Estate & Urban Planning, Jakarta 11440, Indonesia; [Chandra-Putra, Handi] Rutgers State Univ, Edward J Bloustein Sch Planning & Publ Policy, Rutgers Ctr Green Bldg, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Andrews, Clinton J.] Rutgers State Univ, Edward J Bloustein Sch Planning & Publ Policy, Urban Planning & Policy Dev, New Brunswick, NJ USA",Tarumanagara University; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Rutgers State University New Brunswick,"Chandra-Putra, H (corresponding author), Univ Tarumanagara, Real Estate & Urban Planning, Jakarta 11440, Indonesia.",handichan@gmail.com,"Andrews, Clinton/X-6346-2018","Andrews, Clinton/0000-0002-2989-8091; Chandra Putra, Handi/0000-0002-8280-7726",New Jersey Sea Grant Consortium,New Jersey Sea Grant Consortium,Funding provided byNewJersey Sea Grant Consortium.,,48,8,8,4,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

At the same time, adaptation to climate change has been a research interest in different academic fields; while private companies provide research and development efforts on the issue. Views from perspectives may contain common ground and discrepancies, but benefits from the discussion may differ among these three sectors. This study shows the application of collaborative approaches to analyze impacts and adaptation measures at a local level. A stakeholder workshop was held in the city of Bilbao to discuss impacts of climate change and adaptation in the local context of the Basque Country. The contributions were proposed on three axes: impacts from climate change, good practices proposed or already in action, and costs and benefits derived from those strategies. Participants were asked to rank a series of measures and practices extracted from their previous inputs. These measures were analyzed after applying bootstrapping techniques, according to the perceived costs and benefits assigned to each of the grouped measures and practices. Participants estimated that groups containing green adaptation measures and those that had potentially positive impacts over climate change mitigation were the most efficient measures, as reduced costs combined with high benefits could lead to win-win adaptation strategies, while grey infrastructures were seen as providing high benefits at high costs.","[Martinez-Juarez, Pablo; Suarez, Cristina; Quiroga, Sonia] Univ Alcala UAH, Dept Econ, Plaza Victoria 2, Alcala De Henares 28802, Spain; [Martinez-Juarez, Pablo] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ Anal Econ Theory & Econ Hist, Calle Francisco Tomas & Valiente 5, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Chiabai, Aline] Univ Basque Country, Basque Ctr Climate Change, BC3,Sede Bldg 1,1st Floor,Sci Campus, Leioa 48940, Spain",Universidad de Alcala; Autonomous University of Madrid; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); University of Basque Country,"Quiroga, S (corresponding author), Univ Alcala UAH, Dept Econ, Plaza Victoria 2, Alcala De Henares 28802, Spain.",pablo.martinezj@uah.es; aline.chiabai@bc3research.org; cristina.suarez@uah.es; sonia.quiroga@uah.es,"Quiroga, Sonia/ABH-6577-2020; Suarez, Cristina/O-1688-2017; Suarez, Cristina/AAG-1283-2019","Suarez, Cristina/0000-0003-2579-0734; Suarez, Cristina/0000-0003-2579-0734; Quiroga, Sonia/0000-0002-4269-5053","Horizon 2020 research project INHERIT (INter-sectoral Health and Environment Research for InnovaTion) [GA-667364]; ECOHEALTH (Adaptation to Climate Change in Spain: analysing Co-benefits among health, tourism, ecosystem and food) Fundacion Biodiversidad [G95532826]","Horizon 2020 research project INHERIT (INter-sectoral Health and Environment Research for InnovaTion); ECOHEALTH (Adaptation to Climate Change in Spain: analysing Co-benefits among health, tourism, ecosystem and food) Fundacion Biodiversidad","This research was funded by Horizon 2020 research project INHERIT (INter-sectoral Health and Environment Research for InnovaTion) GA-667364; and ECOHEALTH (Adaptation to Climate Change in Spain: analysing Co-benefits among health, tourism, ecosystem and food) G95532826 Fundacion Biodiversidad.",,48,7,7,2,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB 1,2019,11,3,,,,,,,647,10.3390/su11030647,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11030647,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HL7NY,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000458929500092,View Full Record in Web of Science

The region is characterized by poverty, illiteracy, weak infrastructure, failed states, widespread conflict, and an abysmal status of women. Scenarios beyond 2050 demonstrate that, without urgent and significant action today, the Sahel could become the first part of planet earth that suffers large-scale starvation and escalating conflict as a growing human population outruns diminishing natural resources. National governments and the international community can do a great deal to ameliorate this unfolding disaster if they put in place immediate policies and investments to help communities adapt to climate change, make family planning realistically available, and improve the status of girls and women. Implementing evidence-based action now will be an order of magnitude more humane and cost-effective than confronting disaster later. However, action will challenge some long held development paradigms of economists, demographers, and humanitarian organizations. If the crisis unfolding in the Sahel can help bridge the current intellectual chasm between the economic commitment to seemingly endless growth and the threat seen by some biologists and ecologists that human activity is bringing about irreversible damage to the biosphere, then it may be possible also to begin to solve this same formidable problem at a global level.","[Potts, Malcolm; Henderson, Courtney; Campbell, Martha] Univ Calif Berkeley, Bixby Ctr Populat Hlth & Sustainabil, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Potts, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Bixby Ctr Populat Hlth & Sustainabil, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",potts@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,44,9,9,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The potential problem is being addressed as part of the much larger issue of climate change, and just this year a regional Climate Change Centre was established in Belize. Means of adapting to accommodate change will be considered under the Mainstream Adaptation to Climate Change (MACC) project, but initially the threat needs to be quantified. While meteorological offices have been accumulating weather data in some parts of the region for many years, sea level data is more scarce. This work puts least squares methods to test by applying them to spectral analysis of intermittent data sets acquired over periods of 6 and 9 years at two locations in Trinidad. The resulting sea level models that include 13 periodic components, datum bias, trend and atmospheric pressure are validated using fundamental historical information and observations that form the subject of discussion among local professional surveyors. Results show that while sea level at a location in North Trinidad is rising at the rate of about 1 mm a year, the change at a Southern site is about four times this amount. Horizontal movement has been measured across a tectonic fault that parts the island, and it is now apparent that there may be some vertical motion on this or some other fault lines in the region.","[Miller, Keith M.] Univ W Indies, Dept Surveying & Land Informat, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago",University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Saint Augustine,"Miller, KM (corresponding author), Univ W Indies, Dept Surveying & Land Informat, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago.",kmiller@uwi.tt,,,,,,,8,5,5,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0149-0419,1521-060X,,MAR GEOD,Mar.

Currently, a scientific gap exists in the understanding of the factors shaping Indigenous resilience. This study aimed to address this gap by focusing on two Indigenous Tayal communities in northern Taiwan and how they have coped with and built resilience in the face of climate change and climate-related disasters. This study employed both quantitative (n = 101) and qualitative methods (n = 10) to determine the factors that shape the livelihood adaptation pathways and resilience capacities (i.e., absorptive, adaptive, and transformative) of Indigenous and local smallholder farmers. This study demonstrated that the adaptation pathways of individual households must be placed in the broader context of economic, social, and historical processes. Cultural practices, traditional ecological knowledge systems, place attachment, and perceptions, as well as socioeconomic factors and convictions regarding the need to combat climate change and conserve nature, have shaped households' resilience capacities. The evidence of a relationship between ethnicity and livelihood resilience was far from conclusive, and both Indigenous and non-indigenous households living in the same locality must be included when assessing Indigenous resilience to climate change. This study contributes to better understanding the agency of Indigenous households in their response to climate change and negative impacts of climate-related events. Such an understanding is necessary because sufficient insight into Indigenous and endogenous forms of climate change adaptation is lacking.","[Bayrak, Mucahid Mustafa; Hung, Li-San; Hsu, Yi-Ya] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Geog, 162,Sect 1,Heping E Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Hsu, Yi-Ya] Univ New South Wales, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",National Taiwan Normal University; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Hung, LS (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Geog, 162,Sect 1,Heping E Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",lshung@ntnu.edu.tw,,"Hsu, Yi-Ya/0000-0002-7874-4638; Hung, Li-San/0000-0002-9854-7551","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 109-2636-H-003-007, MOST 108-2410-H-003-140]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This study was funded by Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST 109-2636-H-003-007 and MOST 108-2410-H-003-140).",,86,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1862-4065,1862-4057,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

To reduce projection uncertainty over Asia, where half the world's population resides, we develop emergent constraint relationships between simulated temperature (1970-2014) and precipitation (2015-2100) growth rates using 27 CMIP6 models under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. Here we show that, with uncertainty successfully narrowed by 12.1-31.0%, constrained future precipitation growth rates are 0.39 +/- 0.18 mm year(-1) (29.36 mm degrees C-1, SSP126), 0.70 +/- 0.22 mm year(-1) (20.03 mm degrees C-1, SSP245), 1.10 +/- 0.33 mm year(-1) (17.96 mm degrees C-1, SSP370) and 1.42 +/- 0.35 mm year(-1) (17.28 mm degrees C-1, SSP585), indicating overestimates of 6.0-14.0% by the raw CMIP6 models. Accordingly, future temperature and total evaporation growth rates are also overestimated by 3.4-11.6% and -2.1-13.0%, respectively. The slower warming implies a lower snow cover loss rate by 10.5-40.2%. Overall, we find the projected increase in future water availability is overestimated by CMIP6 over Asia. Reduction of uncertainty in climate projections is a key issue for climate change adaptation. Here the authors show that an applying an emergent constraint effectively reduces projection uncertainty across Asia, and reveals less warming and a slower increase in water availability than previously estimated.","[Chai, Yuanfang; Yue, Yao; Yin, Jiabo] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Chai, Yuanfang] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Earth Sci, Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Yue, Yao] Wuhan Univ, Inst Water Carbon Cycles & Carbon Neutral, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Slater, Louise J.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Borthwick, Alistair G.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the changes in the SOC stock (SOCs) with depth and time and explore the SOC accumulation process, in a millennium chronosequence derived from marine sediments. Chronofunctions were formulated based on SOCs at different depths to evaluate the effects of sampling depth on chronofunctions and the rates of SOC sequestration. The depth distribution of SOCs showed that SOC accumulation occurred mainly in the top 40 cm, with 69% of the SOC being distributed in the upper 0-40 cm layers. The chronofunctions yielding the best fits changed from linear to power and then to logarithmic, suggesting that sampling depth affected the chronofunction type. The SOCs for the entire profile (0-100 cm) could be estimated from that in the 0-20 cm or 0-50 cm, which can potentially aid the estimation of legacy SOC data. The SOC sequestration rates were found to be high at the beginning of development, gradually slowing down with time. The soil in this area can sequestrate SOC for more than 2000 years, at a rate greater than 0.4%. Spectroscopy and digital soil mapping methods can provide accurate and acceptable SOC data pertaining to agriculture and climate change and could be a potential technology for global SOC monitoring.","[Jiao, Caixia; Zheng, Guanghui; Shang, Gang; Zhao, Chengyi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Jiao, Caixia; Zheng, Guanghui; Cui, Xuefeng; Shang, Gang; Zhao, Chengyi] Univ Coll Dublin, Meteorol & Climate Ctr, Sch Math & Stat, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Xie, Xianli] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Cui, Xuefeng] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China","Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University College Dublin; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil Science, CAS; Beijing Normal University","Zhao, CY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",zhaocy@nuist.edu.cn,"Zheng, Guanghui/F-6892-2016","Zheng, Guanghui/0000-0002-9554-5462","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41877004]; China Scholarship Council [201809040007, 201808320124]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41877004) and the China Scholarship Council (201809040007 and 201808320124).

This poses tremendous influences on physical and the socio-economic vulnerability of the coastal communities, in the form of negative impacts on lives and livelihoods. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the vulnerability of households to the impacts of coastal erosion. As a result, this study focused on the assessment and mapping of the social vulnerability of households to coastal erosion in Gunjur village. An interdisciplinary and mixed-method approaches were used in the study. The MOVE system-thinking framework was used to develop and select social vulnerability indicators. Geographic Information Systems technique was employed in data integration and mapping of the vulnerability of households. The outcome of the study revealed that 90% of the households were highly vulnerable to coastal erosion, however, women were perceived to be relatively more vulnerable. The study found high levels of exposure and susceptibility of the households to coastal erosion, given the limited adaptation capacity. It was found that 74% of the households do not have sustainable adaptation strategies to the impacts of coastal erosion. Integrating coastal protection measures into climate change adaptation and mitigation policy framework was a key recommendation towards reducing the impacts of human factors on coastal erosion. Alternative sources of livelihoods and mind building are required to build the resilience of households and enhance human security in the coastal communities of The Gambia.","[Gomez, Muhammad Leroy Albert] Univ Gambia, Sch Agr & Environm Sci, Serekunda, Gambia; [Adelegan, Olatundun Janet] West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapte, Dept Capac Bldg, Accra, Ghana; [Ntajal, Joshua] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Bonn, Germany; [Trawally, Dodou] Natl Environm Agcy, Serrekunda, Gambia",University of the Gambia; University of Bonn,"Gomez, MLA (corresponding author), Natl Environm Agcy, Educ & Climate, PMB 48 Jimpex Rd Kanifing, Serrekunda, Gambia.",speedy1_507@hotmail.com; olatundunja@yahoo.com; joshuantajal@mail.com; dtrawally@gmail.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Adelegan, Olatundun/ABA-9122-2020","Adelegan, Olatundun/0000-0002-9952-6007; Ntajal, Joshua/0000-0001-7113-5779","Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in Germany, through West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land use (WASCAL)","Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in Germany, through West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land use (WASCAL)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","This work was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in Germany, through West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land use (WASCAL).

Understanding the magnitude of the progress made in this respect can help shape further adaptation developments and avoid the putative maladaptive side effects of forest management evolutions. Here, we aim to bridge the knowledge gap of adaptation implementation in French forests. To stay as close as possible to concrete changes, we conducted semi-structured interviews with foresters in two study areas that differed in the intensity of their forest management approaches. Our findings highlight unprecedented aspects of adaptations: (i) adaptation focuses on productive ecosystem services at the expense of other essential services such as water supply or natural habitats; (ii) adaptations rely on technical changes in forest management and do not deal with climate impacts through organizational or economic tools; and (iii) envisaging ecological processes through adaptations is instrumental and limited to small spatial and temporal scales. Our results also extend the existing body of knowledge to the framework of forest management: (i) climate change is not the main driver of forestry changes; (ii) extreme events are windows of opportunity to stimulate adaptive changes; and (iii) proactive adaptation to unexperienced hazards is very weak. We argue that to be as effective as possible, climate change adaptation in forestry should implement complementary organizational and economic changes in addition to the necessary technical evolutions.","[Fouqueray, Timothee; Frascaria-Lacoste, Nathalie] Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, CNRS, Ecol,Systemat,Evolut,AgroParisTech, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Charpentier, Antoine] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Master Bioterre, F-75005 Paris, France; [Trommetter, Michel] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble INP, CNRS, GAEL,INRA, F-38000 Grenoble, France",AgroParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE,"Fouqueray, T (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, CNRS, Ecol,Systemat,Evolut,AgroParisTech, F-91405 Orsay, France.",timothee.fouqueray@u-psud.fr,,"Fouqueray, Timothee/0000-0003-4773-4733",French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the Investments d'Avenir Programme (LabEx BASC) [ANR-11-LABX-0034],French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the Investments d'Avenir Programme (LabEx BASC)(French National Research Agency (ANR)),Our warmest thanks go to the interviewees for the time spent in the interviews and to Agnes Fortier for her very constructive remarks.

When the decision process involves many stakeholders, frequently with different interpretations of the meteorological information, the process is even more complex. This work provides a quantitative decision model with a new index (called the weather decision index, WDI) to support the stakeholders in making real-world choices according to their preferences regarding the uncertainty of weather information. The integrated model combines several methods such as problem structuring, multi-criteria analysis, scenario planning and probabilistic weather forecast techniques. As a demonstration, the model was applied in the sounding rocket launch mission in the Brazilian Space Programme. The WDI captured stakeholders' behaviour related to three meteorological information attributes (probability, lead-time and variables) and modelled the most important judgements of the decision maker; low probability or an extended lead-time depreciates the meteorological information, and weather variables are not considered in the decisions, even with forecasts of extreme events. Modelling with the WDI brings a new perspective in weather-related decision problems. The choice of alternatives no longer depends on a necessarily simplified optimization analysis, but rather on the decision maker's preferences about the possibly nonlinear trade-offs between forecast reliability and lead-time. The findings also increase understanding of the forecast decision maker's preferences and how to improve weather risk communication. The WDI provides a starting point for several applications, including early warning systems or climate change adaptation, for which reliable uncertainty estimates are accessible.","[Caruzzo, Amaury] McGill Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Room 946,Burnside Hall 805 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [Neyra Belderrain, Mischel Carmen] Aeronaut Inst Technol ITA, Sao Jose Dos Campos, Brazil; [Fisch, Gilberto] Aeronaut & Space Inst IAE, Dept Atmospher Sci, Sao Jose Dos Campos, Brazil; [Young, George S.; Hanlon, Christopher J.; Verlinde, Johannes] Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol & Atmospher Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",McGill University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Caruzzo, A (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Room 946,Burnside Hall 805 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada.",amaury.caruzzo@mail.mcgill.ca,"Caruzzo, Amaury/C-2124-2011; Fisch, Gilberto F./E-5906-2011; Verlinde, Johannes/H-8351-2017","Caruzzo, Amaury/0000-0001-5280-6063; Verlinde, Johannes/0000-0002-9121-3110; Neyra Belderrain, Mischel Carmen/0000-0002-5582-4977; Fisch, Gilberto/0000-0001-6668-9988","National Council for Scientific and Technological Development of Brazil - CNPq [142212/2011-3, 232898/2014-6]; CAPES [14552/2013-2]; ITA [PCT/BR2016/050232]",National Council for Scientific and Technological Development of Brazil - CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); ITA,"This study was supported by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development of Brazil - CNPq (grant 142212/2011-3 and 232898/2014-6) and CAPES (grant 14552/2013-2).

We used RS and the GIS-supported FAO Maximum Limitation Approach to perform land suitability analysis for the current conditions and 20-year periodic times from 2020 to 2100. The results of the current land suitability assessment indicated that 81.39% of the study area is suitable for rice paddy cultivation. Two climate change models (HadGEM2-ES and MPI-ESM-MR) and related scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 showed that the climate conditions in the region will change significantly, therefore, the suitable lands for rice paddy cultivation in the study area will increase. However, the amount of change varies across models and scenarios. Further land suitability for rice paddy cultivation in the study area will be positively affected by temperature and solar radiation changes and negatively affected by changes in humidity and precipitation. Lastly, the agricultural irrigation infrastructure is expected to be unfavorably affected by an increase in extreme climatic events. These findings can guide policymakers and stakeholders to select suitable land for future rice paddy cultivation. To adapt to climate change and reduce its effects, we recommend choosing an agricultural production model that is suitable for climate change scenarios.","[Ozsahin, Emre] Tekirdag Namik Kemal Univ, Fac Arts & Sci, Geog Dept, Tekirdag, Turkey; [Ozdes, Mehmet] Tekirdag Namik Kemal Univ, Fac Engn, Environm Engn, Tekirdag, Turkey",Namik Kemal University; Namik Kemal University,"Ozsahin, E (corresponding author), Tekirdag Namik Kemal Univ, Fac Arts & Sci, Geog Dept, Tekirdag, Turkey.",eozsahin@nku.edu.tr,"ÖZŞAHİN, Emre/R-8807-2018; OZDES, MEHMET/R-8352-2018","OZDES, MEHMET/0000-0003-3538-8861; OZSAHIN, EMRE/0000-0001-8169-6908",,,,,101,0,0,7,10,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

Attention to the identification of the direct linkage between crop switching and farm profitability, and, thus, farm sustainability, however, has been quite limited. This study attempts to provide a significant complement to the extant research by identifying the treatment effect of crop switching on the net returns of crop growers in Taiwan. A multinomial endogenous treatment effects model with the latent-factor structure is used to take self-selection into account. The result suggests that farm households' economic resilience is closely related to their choice of crops, which constitute the major source of farm income. Specifically, among the six cash crop categories, fruit crops and other crops are found to be most remunerating and, thus, suggests possible improvements in farm households' economic resilience through crop switching. A further analysis of the distributional implications of crop switching through quantile regression confirms the persistent and stronger effects of crop choice on net returns when moving from the bottom to the top quartiles along the net-return distribution. This result suggests a close association of crop choices with farm income inequality among the crop farm households in Taiwan, which in turn implies possible distributional effects of crop switching.","[Luh, Yir-Hueih; Chang, Yun-Cih; Ho, Shuay-Tsyr] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Luh, YH; Ho, ST (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",yirhueihluh@ntu.edu.tw; f08627010@ntu.edu.tw; shuaytsyrho@ntu.edu.tw,,"Ho, Shuay-Tsyr/0000-0002-3190-5537; Luh, Yir-Hueih/0000-0003-1765-6156",,,,,22,1,1,3,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2022,14,3,,,,,,,1422,10.3390/su14031422,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14031422,,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YY4SF,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000754779500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

No large-scale study exists that shows the types of adaptation, the spatial distribution of types of adaptation, and the numbers of people engaging in that adaptation. To address this gap, and to feed into debates about the modalities for the global stocktake, in this paper we propose a new stocktaking approach to document the spectrum and prevalence of observed adaptation over large scales. The four-step stocktaking approach focuses on: (a) obtaining consensus on the objectives of adaptation; (b) agreeing the sources of evidence; (c) agreeing the search method; and (d) categorizing the adaptations. By focusing on documenting rather than evaluating adaptation, the simple approach avoids some of the adaptation heuristic traps. With guidance to countries on how to operationalize, this approach could improve the transparency of adaptation data collection and analysis, ensure comparability of findings across space and time, and inform the Adaptation Communications (Article 7.10)-a prerequisite to strengthening future ambition commitments within the Paris Agreement.

Agrobiodiversity is fundamentally shaped by farmers' preferences and management practices, and these are again shaped by the farmers' social and cultural background. This study investigates variety preferences and seed management practices in the crop sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) among the Kunama and the Tigrayan ethnolinguistic groups living side by side in Northern Ethiopia. Surveys were conducted in 10 villages located in two districts inhabited by the two ethnolinguistic groups and analyzed using descriptive and multinominal analysis. We find important differences in varieties grown across the ethnolinguistic groups, but we also find that ethnicity and geographic proximity interact and affect trait preference and seed management practices. Altogether, 22 varieties are cultivated, and few farmers cultivated improved varieties, especially among the Kunama. Respondents considered use traits as important as agronomic traits when selecting sorghum varieties. Notably, preferred use traits were not limited to food (e.g., construction materials were important for the Kunama), and preferred agronomic traits were not focused on drought resistance. Timing of seed selection, seed selection criteria (e.g., panicle size and color), and seed storage practices differed among the ethnic groups. Understanding cultural and social preferences towards sorghum varieties, their traits, and the criteria used for seed management is crucial for the success of crop breeding programs, climate change adaptation policies, and development interventions.","[Wendmu, Tsedal Asres; Cuni-Sanchez, Aida; Westengen, Ola Tveitereid] Norwegian Univ Life Noragr, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, As, Norway; [Wendmu, Tsedal Asres] Mekelle Univ, Inst Paleoenvironm & Heritage Conservat, Dept Anthropol, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Abebe, Haftom Temesgen] Mekelle Univ, Dept Biostat, Coll Hlth Sci, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [de Boer, Hugo J.] Univ Oslo, Nat Hist Museum, Oslo, Norway; [Abera, Fetien Abay] Mekelle Univ, Dept Dryland Crop & Hort Sci, Coll Dryland Agr & Nat Sci, Mekelle, Ethiopia",Mekelle University; Mekelle University; University of Oslo; Mekelle University,"Wendmu, TA (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Noragr, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, As, Norway.;Wendmu, TA (corresponding author), Mekelle Univ, Inst Paleoenvironm & Heritage Conservat, Dept Anthropol, Mekelle, Ethiopia.",tsedal.asres.wendmu@nmbu.no,"; de Boer, Hugo/B-5640-2015","Wendmu, Tsedal/0000-0003-1178-1087; de Boer, Hugo/0000-0003-1985-7859",Norwegian Embassy in Addis Ababa; Research Council of Norway through the research project ACCESS [RCN-288493],Norwegian Embassy in Addis Ababa; Research Council of Norway through the research project ACCESS(Research Council of Norway),"We would like to express our gratitude to the participants in this study for their hospitality and willingness to be interviewed.

As the agricultural sector is implementing measures to adapt to or cope with climatic variability and change, the potential negative consequences of these measures need to be explored in order to avoid increased vulnerability or (unintended) environmental impacts. This paper employs serious gaming and focus group methodology to study how agricultural stakeholders in Sweden and Finland frame and negotiate the unintended negative impacts of adaptation measures. The results of our interactional frame analysis suggest that the participants negotiated the potential maladaptive outcomes depending on: (1) whether they agreed that this was indeed a potential consequence of an adaptation measure, (2) whether they considered this to be a negative outcome, and if so whether it was (3) a negative outcome which they could adapt to, (4) a negative outcome that would make it preferable not to adapt at all (5) negotiable in terms of a trade-off with alternative outcomes. While it may be obvious that adaptation options that increase vulnerability should be avoided, this study illustrates the complex, value based, individual, yet dialogical processes and contextual basis for identifying and assessing maladaptation.","[Neset, Tina-Simone; Asplund, Therese; Juhola, Sirkku] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Linkoping, Sweden; [Kayhko, Janina; Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Ecosyst & Environm Res Programme, Helsinki, Finland; [Kayhko, Janina; Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, HELSUS, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci, Helsinki, Finland",Linkoping University; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Neset, TS (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Linkoping, Sweden.",tina.neset@liu.se; therese.asplund@liu.se; janina.kayhko@helsinki.fi; sirkku.juhola@helsinki.fi,"Juhola, Sirkku/GVS-5485-2022; Käyhkö, Janina/AAW-6163-2021","Käyhkö, Janina/0000-0003-0904-5857; Juhola, Sirkku/0000-0003-0095-2282; Neset, Tina-Simone/0000-0003-1151-9943",Swedish Research Council FORMAS [2013-1557],Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),This study is funded by the Swedish Research Council FORMAS under Grant No. 2013-1557.,,25,14,14,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Most assessments of the effect of historical climate change on crop yield has been at the national level, ignoring possibly important subnational variation and climate change adaptation through changes in crop distribution. We analyzed the relationship between growing season temperature, rice yield, and the spatial distribution of rice production in China between 1949 and 2015. Since 1949, rice production in China has moved northwards. Because of this, country level average temperature for rice areas during the growing season was relatively stable, and colder than it would have been without the movement. Temperature has had a very small effect on rice yield at the country level of -0.05 t ha(-1)degrees C-1. However, this masks important subnational variation. Increased temperatures were associated with an increase in rice yield (0-1.0 t ha(-1)degrees C-1) in northern provinces and a decrease (-0.6-0 t ha(-1)degrees C-1) in southern provinces of China. While the estimated overall effect of the northward movement on average rice yield in China was only 162 kg ha(-1), it does illustrate how crop movements can modify climate change effects and can be an emergent adaptation strategy.","[Wang, Hongfei; Hijmans, Robert J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Hijmans, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rhijmans@ucdavis.edu,,,China Scholarship Council,China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),All authors have no potential conflicts of interest.

However, in order to support local stakeholders in sustainable energy development strategies and climate change adaptation plans and the implementation of policies, there is a need to equip local decision makers with tools enabling the assessment of sustainable energy investments. In order to do so, the aim of this study is to create a novel tool for the assessment of solar radiation (SOLIS) in ArcGIS. The SOLIS tool builds on the existing ArcGIS algorithm by including input data conversion and post-processing of the results. This should expand the group of potential users of solar radiation analyses. The self-filtering tool excludes surfaces that are not suitable for solar energy investments due to geometrical reasons. The reduction of the size of the output data is positive for technical reasons (speed of the calculation and occupied storage place) and for cognitive reasons (reduction of the number of objects necessary to analyse by the user). The SOLIS tool limits the requirement for users to insert three-dimensional (3D) models of roofs (with any geometry) and select solar radiation calculation periods. The highlight of this research is to develop the decision support tool for the assessment of solar radiation, which would reduce the requirements for potential users, in order to promote indicator-based assessments among non-Geographical Information Systems (GIS) specialists.","[Kazak, Jan K.; Swiader, Malgorzata] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Fac Environm Engn & Geodesy, Dept Spatial Econ, PL-50357 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences,"Kazak, JK (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Fac Environm Engn & Geodesy, Dept Spatial Econ, PL-50357 Wroclaw, Poland.",jan.kazak@upwr.edu.pl; malgorzata.swiader@upwr.edu.pl,"Kazak, Jan/S-7783-2016; Świąder, Małgorzata/A-3891-2017","Kazak, Jan/0000-0002-1864-9954; Świąder, Małgorzata/0000-0003-3398-4985",Department of Spatial Economy of the Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences,Department of Spatial Economy of the Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences,This research was supported by the Department of Spatial Economy of the Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences.,,56,13,13,0,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,AUG,2018,11,8,,,,,,,2105,10.3390/en11082105,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en11082105,,,12,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Energy & Fuels,GW1BJ,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000446604100184,View Full Record in Web of Science

We test these methodologies by applying them to the Marconi dike strengthening project in Delfzijl, the Netherlands. This city's dike fortification is an interesting case, as it offers many opportunities for re-designing heritage. The city borders the Wadden Sea area, a tidal mudflat area protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its natural and geological heritage values. The area also consists of a rich cultural landscape, which is overlooked in the public image and in local policy. We conclude that landscape architects and planners should strengthen not only the dike, but also the interpretation of the past that dominates policy and political debates in the area. We also find that the existing heritage production model of Ashworth and Tunbridge can provide some useful structure for understanding and contextualizing spatial planning for climate change as a way of doing heritage.","[Egberts, Linde] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Riesto, Svava] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Copenhagen,"Egberts, L (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",l.r.egberts@vu.nl; svri@ign.ku.dk,,"Riesto, Svava/0000-0002-7949-7026; Egberts, Linde/0000-0002-0076-1569",,,,,39,3,3,2,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1872-7859,2212-9790,,MARIT STUD,Marit.

The Amazon countries still have limited national policies on how to adapt and have failed to cooperate to promote adaptation plans at the regional level. Most studies have focused on adaptation policies at a local or national level, but overlook how these interact with the necessary regional cooperation required in transboundary ecosystems. This article assesses regional and national plans for climate adaptation in Amazonia, asking whether these provide a basis for regional adaptation policies. Have countries addressed climate adaptation in their NDCs and are there any synergies between countries? Are the Amazon countries currently implementing adaptation policies through the regional framework Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization, and if so how? The analysis is then contrasted with the regional adaptation policies promoted in Central America, a region that faces similar challenges. The analysis finds that regional adaptation governance in the Amazon region is still incipient, and requires a holistic view that integrates a multi-stakeholder approach to climate adaptation. This article makes a vital contribution to the impact and contribution of Amazonia to climate governance, which is still poorly understood.","[Tigre, Maria Antonia] Pace Univ, Elisabeth Haub Sch Law, 78 N Broadway, White Plains, NY 10603 USA",Pace University,"Tigre, MA (corresponding author), Pace Univ, Elisabeth Haub Sch Law, 78 N Broadway, White Plains, NY 10603 USA.",mtigre@law.pace.edu,"Tigre, Maria Antonia/AAN-6661-2021","Tigre, Maria Antonia/0000-0003-4308-1958",,,,,81,4,4,5,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

However, not all adaptation measures bring about positive changes. In some cases, local-level adaptations may shift risks to other vulnerable places and communities. Both maladaptation, generally recognized to be undesirable at least in terms of the results it generates, and sustainable adaptation has been studied in diverse settings and for a range of climate-related risks. Sustainable adaptation aims at reducing poverty and enhancing social equity and environmental integrity in concert with risk reduction. However, there is limited research on how interventions by state and non-state implementing entities differ in addressing issues related to sustainable adaptation and the threat of maladaptation. In this paper, we use case study analysis to focus on three specific adaptation interventions-homestead plinth level raise, pond sand filter for safe drinking water, and surface and groundwater irrigation-in Bangladesh. Drawing on in-depth interviews with stakeholders facing recurring drought and coastal hazards, we emphasis on the implemented interventions and the roles played by a local NGO and central government. The first two interventions were implemented by a local NGO and the irrigation system by the government. Although the selected interventions led to many benefits, including reduced community vulnerability, enhanced resilience, and adaptive capacity, the stakeholders also identified sustainability challenges. NGO-implemented interventions, for example, suffer from beneficiary selection bias, while state-implemented intervention does not conform, at least partly, to environmental integrity. To limit maladaptation, it is necessarily better to understand beneficiary attitude(s) towards an intervention. Findings can help inform future interventions by raising awareness of agencies' roles and responsibilities in implementation and recognizing the stakeholders' adaptation needs and priorities.","[Rahman, Syed Mahbubur] Amer Int Univ Bangladesh AIUB, Fac Business Adm, 408-1 Kuratoli, Dhaka 1229, Bangladesh",American International University Bangladesh (AIUB),"Rahman, SM (corresponding author), Amer Int Univ Bangladesh AIUB, Fac Business Adm, 408-1 Kuratoli, Dhaka 1229, Bangladesh.",rahman_s_m@yahoo.com,"Rahman, Syed/N-4715-2015","Rahman, Syed/0000-0001-8578-2731",JSPS RONPAKU Program of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS),JSPS RONPAKU Program of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS),This work was supported by the JSPS RONPAKU Program of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).,,68,1,1,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Therefore, it's essential to explore carbon metabolism from the perspective by integrating coastal ecosystems and socio-economic systems, thus identifying the key nodes for adapting to climate change. We used ecological network analysis (ENA) by the interaction and feedbacks of costal ecosystems and socio-economic system to trace the carbon flows for a typical wetland city in the Yellow River Delta, China, during 1995-2015. We found that the total carbon inputs showed an overall growing trend, which increased to 1.4 times its value. Although decreased by 15% in the coastal ecosystem, carbon inputs increased to 1.8 times in the socio-economic system. Carbon sequestration of coastal wetlands decreased by 43%, while carbon emission increased to 3.0 times its initial value in the coastal region. Heavy industry, crude oil, and atmosphere accounted for approximately 29%, 17%, and 9%, respectively, which most strongly influenced the network as the key nodes. Although the small direct flows of the macrophytes, they totally accounted for about 14%, whose effects could not be ignored for the coupled network. Network mutualism index for carbon metabolism was around 1.3. The ecological relationship distributions were basically the same in the study period, following the sequence of exploitation/control, mutualism and competition relationship. Based on the network control analysis, socio-economic sectors had the great control on atmosphere, and were mainly dependent on wetland resources suppliers. This study identified the key nodes and pathways in the coastal region metabolism system, and thus provided the targeted suggestions for policymakers to manage these nodes for wetland conservation and the sustainable development of coastal regions.

A performing market is vital for supporting uptake of climate services. The diffusion of innovations depends on how business models - meant as firms' strategic choices to create, capture and share value within a value network - are employed. Innovation in business model, rather than product innovation only, has been proved useful for overcoming bottlenecks associated with development and diffusion of technologies. But only few studies have analysed how business models are used within the context of climate services. We fill this gap by using a sample of 32 climate services provisions at different stage of development. We use an original and revised version the Business Model Canvas as a framework to facilitate the data collection and analysis processes. A quali-quantitative approach is employed to tackle the content of the administered semi-structured interviews and to map them into a connected set of nodes representing concepts as provided by the selected informants. By combining Content and Network Analysis we present how business model aspects interact both within and across components. We find that the Value Network in which climate services operate is crucial for success, while a subscription, online-based infrastructure is a widespread tool in reaching the target users. The creation of partnerships and consortia of organisations allows mutual learning opportunities to happen and boosts the innovation behind these products. We focus on the graph giant component to highlight the role of co-creation approach in generating direct and indirect incremental innovations while delivering seasonal forecasts and tailor-made services. Finally, we call for tighter link between business and climate-related aspects to enhance the importance of financial considerations around climate services provision.","[Larosa, Francesca; Mysiak, Jaroslav] Euro Mediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Risk Assessment & Adaptat Strategies Div, Rome, Italy; [Larosa, Francesca; Mysiak, Jaroslav] Ca Foscari Univ, Dorsoduro 3246, I-30133 Venice, Italy",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Larosa, F (corresponding author), Euro Mediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Risk Assessment & Adaptat Strategies Div, Rome, Italy.",francesca.larosa@cmcc.it,"Mysiak, Jaroslav/A-8683-2019","Mysiak, Jaroslav/0000-0001-9341-7048; Larosa, Francesca/0000-0002-4350-8790","EU [730500, 730482]",EU(European Commission),The underlying research for this article has received funding from the EU's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under Grant Agreement No 730500 (EU-MACS -www.eu-macs.eu) and under Grant Agreement No. 730482 (CLARA -www.clara-project.eu).,,61,14,14,2,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8807,,,CLIM SERV,Clim.

In this study, we quantified the total water footprint (WF) of major crop products in Northwest China using the Penman-Monteith formula. The logarithmic mean divisor index (LMDI) was used to explain the four factors driving the spatial and temporal differences in the WFs of the major crops in five provinces and regions in Northwest China. The results showed that from 2006 to 2015, the total WF of the major crops was increasing overall. From a temporal perspective, the crop area and yield effects, which were the factors driving the overall increase in the WF, positively impacted the overall change in the WF of the major crops in Northwest China. The effects of the virtual water content (VWC) and crop structure were both volatile. The effect of the crop structure made a relatively small contribution, while the effect of the VWC played a significant role in changing the overall WF. From a spatial perspective, the changes in the VWC and crop structure negatively inhibited the increase of the WF, widening the difference between these provinces and regions and Shanxi. The increased yields in Xinjiang most clearly increased the WF, followed by those in Ningxia, Qinghai, and Gansu. In comparison with Shanxi, in all the provinces and regions except Xinjiang, the change in cultivated area was less effective in promoting the WF. Therefore, scientific planting plans should be developed for adapting to climate change, considering the differences in natural features among various provinces and regions. Water conservation and advanced agricultural technology should be promoted to enhance the sustainability of agricultural development.","[Shi, Changfeng; Wang, Yanying; Zhang, Chenjun; Zhang, Lina] Hohai Univ, Sch Business Adm, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China",Hohai University,"Zhang, CJ (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Sch Business Adm, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.",shichangfeng007@163.com; wyy98071@hotmail.com; 20161963@hhu.edu.cn; 20191001@hhu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41701613]; Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Ministry of Education in China [17YJC790194]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [:2019B23014],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Ministry of Education in China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Numbers: 41701613), the Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Ministry of Education in China (Grant Numbers: 17YJC790194), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant Numbers:2019B23014).",,41,4,4,7,44,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,DEC,2019,11,12,,,,,,,2457,10.3390/w11122457,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11122457,,,15,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,KC7UQ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000507378600030,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, identification of the causes responsible for vegetation changes remain challenging. Using Geographical Detector, a new spatial statistical approach, individual and interactive influences of natural factors on vegetation NDVI changes were quantified for the Sichuan province. The optimal characteristics of key natural factors that are beneficial to vegetation growth were determined. The vegetation cover in Sichuan for 2000 and 2015 is good overall; areas with upper-intermediate and high vegetation cover account for more than 88% of the total area. Regions with an NDVI higher than 0.4 are noticeably transformed; regions with upper intermediate vegetation cover (NDVI from 0.4 to 0.8) tend to decrease significantly, whereas regions with high vegetation cover (NDVI>0.8) tend to increase significantly. Spatiotemporal variation in vegetation cover is very significant. Regions with high vegetation cover are distributed in the northeast part of the Sichuan Basin and on the northwestern Sichuan Plateau, whereas regions with low vegetation cover are distributed in urban agglomerative regions in the central part of the Sichuan Basin. Soil types, elevation, and annual mean temperature can satisfactorily account for vegetation changes. Natural factors have an interactive influence on NDVI. The synergistic effect of natural factors is manifested as mutual enhancement and nonlinear enhancement, and the interaction of two natural factors strengthens the influence of each individual natural factor. Natural factors within a favourable value range or favourable landform factors serve to promote and intervene in vegetation changes, adapt to climatic changes, and buffer against the effects of vegetation changes.

Observations indicate that temperature has steadily increased during the last century, including changes in precipitation. This study implements the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Hydro framework with the Noah-Multiparameterization (Noah-MP) model that is currently used in the National Water Model to estimate the tendencies of the different variables that compounded the water budget in the Northeast of the US from 1980 to 2016. We use North American Land Data Assimilation System-2 (NLDAS-2) climate data as forcing, and we calibrated the model using 192 US Geological Survey (USGS) Geospatial Attributes of Gages for Evaluating Streamflow II (Gages II) reference stations. We study the tendencies determining the Kendall-Theil slope of streamflow using the maximum three-day average, seven-day minimum flow, and the monotonic five-day mean times series. For the water budget, we determine the Kendall-Theil slope for changes in monthly values of precipitation, surface and subsurface runoff, evapotranspiration, transpiration, soil moisture, and snow accumulation. The results indicate that the changes in precipitation are not being distributed evenly in the components of the water budget. Precipitation is decreasing during winter and increasing during the summer, with the direct impacts being a decrease in snow accumulation and an increase in evapotranspiration. The soil tends to be drier, which does not translate to a rise in infiltration since the surface runoff aggregated tendencies are positive, and the underground runoff aggregated tendencies are negative. The effects of climate change on streamflows are buffered by larger areas, indicating that more attention needs to be given to small catchments to adapt to climate change.","[Somos-Valenzuela, Marcelo A.] Univ La Frontera, Butamallin Res Ctr Global Change, Temuco 4780000, Chile; [Somos-Valenzuela, Marcelo A.; Palmer, Richard N.] USGS Northcast Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, DOI, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Palmer, Richard N.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",Universidad de La Frontera; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Somos-Valenzuela, MA (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Butamallin Res Ctr Global Change, Temuco 4780000, Chile.;Somos-Valenzuela, MA (corresponding author), USGS Northcast Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, DOI, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",marcelo.somos@ufrontera.cl; rpalmer@engin.umass.edu,,"Somos-Valenzuela, Marcelo/0000-0001-7863-4407",United States Geological Survey [G12AC00001],United States Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey),The project described in this publication was supported by Grant or Cooperative Agreement No. G12AC00001 from the United States Geological Survey.

J,"Razavi, S",,,,"Razavi, Shahra",,,Making the Right to Social Security a Reality for All Workers,INDIAN JOURNAL OF LABOUR ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Social security; Social protection; Social insurance; Social assistance; Rights; Financing,,"The right to social security has strong anchoring in international human rights law and forms a critical component of international labour standards. While social security has sometimes been portrayed as inimical to economic dynamism, there is a much larger body of work that posits a positive relationship between social welfare and economic progress. The COVID-19 crisis has revealed stark gaps in social protection. Workers in the informal economy have been particularly hard hit, as they were excluded from formal work-related protections and were not eligible for social assistance that often targets the very poor and those outside the labour force. Social assistance schemes with flat-rate benefits can be an element of a rights-based national social protection system if their eligibility criteria, benefit levels and modalities are set out in the national legislation, to ensure transparency and accountability. However, social assistance schemes should be part of a broader social protection system, which usually combines tax-financed schemes and social insurance to guarantee a social protection floor and provide higher-level benefits in line with international social security principles. Inspired by a vision that seeks to formalize all economic units, especially micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, and make the right to social protection a reality for workers in all types of employment, the paper points to a number of country examples that have extended social protection by combining contributory and non-contributory elements. This vision is particularly needed at a time when climate change adaptation, digital transition, and other drivers of transformative change call for the formalization of jobs and enterprises, while making it possible for states to mobilize the maximum available resources to build universal, comprehensive and adequate social protection systems that can facilitate inclusive transitions.","[Razavi, Shahra] Int Labor Org, Social Protect Dept, Route Morillons 4, CH-1211 Geneva 23, Switzerland",,"Razavi, S (corresponding author), Int Labor Org, Social Protect Dept, Route Morillons 4, CH-1211 Geneva 23, Switzerland.",razavi@ilo.org,,,,,,,45,0,0,2,4,INDIAN SOC LABOUR ECONOMICS,NEW DELHI,"C/O MNG ED, NIDM BLDG, IIPA CAMPUS, NEW DELHI, INDIA",0971-7927,0019-5308,,INDIAN J LABOUR ECON,Indian J.

The effectiveness of two current-successful water management strategies, i.e., mid-season drainage (MSD) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD), under future climate was investigated for the first time involving the AquaCrop model. The model was calibrated and validated using 4-year field data of an early-matured rice cultivar. Future climate data was downscaled for a 2041-2070 period under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) of RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 by applying 20 different Global Circulation Models. The calibrated AquaCrop was then used to predict yield, water productivity (WP), and economic water productivity (EWP) for different cropping calendars. For the current planting date, global warming will reduce rice yield (70-170 kg ha(-1)), WP (10-15%), and EWP (16-27%) under MSD and increases yield (1040-1290 kg ha(-1)) and decreases WP (21-31%), and EWP (22-32%) under AWD compared with the base period. Delayed cropping could not be a suitable strategy for both MSD and AWD under both climate scenarios. Under MSD and AWD, 10 days earlier transplanting will decrease rice yield by 65-130 kg ha(-1) and WP (and EWP) by 5-11% in RCP2.6, while increasing by 413-820 kg ha(-1) and 8-13% in RCP8.5, respectively. Investigation revealed that sustaining or improving current land and water productivity in the future mainly relies on the severity of global warming. However, the AWD strategy will be a more effective climate change-adaptation strategy than MSD in viewpoints of crop yield, WP, and EWP.","[Mirfenderski, Ramtin; Darzi-Naftchali, Abdullah] Sari Agr Sci & Nat Resources Univ, Water Engn Dept, Sari, Iran; [Karandish, Fatemeh] Univ Zabol, Water Engn Dept, Zabol, Iran",Sari Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources University (SANRU),"Darzi-Naftchali, A (corresponding author), Sari Agr Sci & Nat Resources Univ, Water Engn Dept, Sari, Iran.",ramtin7888@gmail.com; abdullahdazi@yahoo.com; f.karandish@uoz.ac.ir,,,Sari Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University,Sari Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University,The Sari Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University supported this project.,,72,1,1,5,14,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

This study, therefore, assessed the determinants of climate change perception (CCP), the level of perception and its impact on net farm income of rice farmers. This is imperative as the actual CC communication and policy, therefore, require a good understanding of smallholders' views and acknowledgment of individual's perception about CC. Employing cross-sectional data from 360 rice farmers selected from three States in South-West, Nigeria, a Ricardian model was used to analyse climate change impact on rice production. While accounting for selection bias, the study employed a double-hurdle (DH) model to estimate the determinants of farmers' perception of climate change. The results of DH estimation model show that location, access to credit, educational level and household size of the farmers are statistically significant factors influencing climate change perception (CCP). The result from the second hurdle shows that the perceived intensity of climate change was influenced by farm size, farming experience, marital status and educational level of smallholder rice farmers. The Ricardian model's result shows that farmers' income is influenced by CCP and their socio-economic characteristics. The results further indicate that smallholder rice farmers' net farm income is sensitive to marginal changes in both temperature and precipitation. Thus, this study recommends that government policies and investment strategies should be geared towards the support of education and the improvement of farmers' cooperatives, credit facilities and information about climate change, particularly in respect of smallholder rice farmers in Nigeria. The recommended improvements are imperative for food security. Investment in farmer training programmes is essential for development and may also be a panacea for improving the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies with the overall goal of increasing productivity.","[Ojo, T.

Thus, better climate change adaptation strategies need to be identified and implemented. This study aimed at identifying the farmers' perceptions of climate change and time series trend analysis of precipitation and temperature in northern Gondar Zuria District, Ethiopia. Data were gathered using a questionnaire from the institutional, socio-economic, and bio-physical situation of the 121 sample households. The survey data were analyzed using SPSS software version 21, XLSTAT software, and excel spreadsheets. The climate change trend analysis was conducted using monthly precipitation, which has been downloaded from free online resources such as Global Precipitation. The temperature data were collected using the Climate Centre and Climate Research Unit with 0.5 by 0.5 degree resolutions from 1980 to 2013. The climate variable data have been analyzed using a precipitation concentration index, anomaly index, coefficient of variation, simple linear regression, and Mann-Kendall test. The result revealed that for the main rain season (summer), a statistically insignificant decreasing trend was obtained. In the Belg season, there was a growing trend of precipitation. The max monthly and annual temperatures have increased significantly over time. However, the min temperature trend shows a non-significant increasing trend over the 1980-2013 periods. The recorded monthly precipitation and temperature data trend analysis were similar to the farmers' perceptions of changes in temperature and rainfall over the past 30 years. Therefore, we recommend possible adaptation strategies designed for climate change. Particularly, countries whose economy is dependent on rain-fed agriculture should pay attention to the increasing trend of temperature and the decreasing and unreliable nature of rainfall.","[Marie, Mequannt; Yirga, Fikadu] Oda Bultum Univ, Coll Nat Resource & Environm Sci, Chiro, Ethiopia; [Haile, Mebrahtu] Mekelle Univ, Coll Dryland Agr & Nat Resources, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Ehteshammajd, Shaghayegh] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Econ Agr Extens & Educ, Tehran, Iran; [Azadi, Hossein; Scheffran, Jurgen] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Res Grp Climate Change & Secur, Hamburg, Germany; [Azadi, Hossein] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Prague, Czech Republic",Mekelle University; Islamic Azad University; University of Hamburg; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Haile, M (corresponding author), Mekelle Univ, Coll Dryland Agr & Nat Resources, Mekelle, Ethiopia.",mebrahtu.haile@yahoo.com,"Haile, Mebrahtu/V-8695-2019; Azadi, Hossein/E-2361-2011; Scheffran, Jürgen/M-6876-2019","Haile, Mebrahtu/0000-0002-7043-0976; Azadi, Hossein/0000-0002-5108-1993; Scheffran, Jürgen/0000-0002-7171-3062",German DFG Clusters of Excellence CliSAP,German DFG Clusters of Excellence CliSAP,This work was supported in part by the German DFG Clusters of Excellence CliSAP and CLICCS.,,58,3,3,2,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Historical rainfall and temperature data of forty years (1978-2017) obtained from Ethiopian Meteorological Agency and household questionnaire survey (n=150) were used to assess the climate trend of Jimma city. Descriptive statistics have been used to assess people's perceptions towards climate change. Rainfall and temperature variability were analyzed using standard deviations, coefficient of variation (CV), rainfall anomaly index and standard precipitation index. The magnitude of the linear trends is estimated using the Sen's slope estimator, and Mann-Kendall test to check the statistical significance of the trends. Findings revealed that average maximum and minimum temperature showed statistically significant trend. The magnitude of increasing trends of monthly maximum temperature varies between 0.033 and 0.045 degrees C/year in January and April, respectively. For minimum temperature the magnitude of trends vary between 0.081 degrees C/year in November and 0.025 degrees C/year in April. Annual rainfall variability is relatively stable with 11% CV, while monthly rainfall variability was found to be very high in December, January, and February with CV 115, 80, and 75, respectively. The result from household survey shows that 85% perceived the increasing trends of temperature. The community perceived that climate change is having an impact on vector-borne diseases. Our results indicate that climate-borne disease and pests, food insecurity, frequent drought and flooding appear to have a significant relationship with climate change withpvalue 0.000, 0.029, 0.010, and 0.047, respectively.

It was evident from the literature that West Africa is vulnerable to climate change and variability, on account of its socio-economic and physical characteristics. As climate change and variability persists, the region's quest to use agriculture as the mainstream opportunity to deliver on set targets of the sustainable development goals will be strongly challenged without appropriate interventions. Adopting CSA seems to be a suitable strategy to achieving food security while also mitigating and adapting to climate-related risks. Among numerous CSA technologies, the review found (1) agroforestry (farmer-managed natural regenerations), soil and water conservation technologies (zai, half-moon, tie/contour ridges, conservation agriculture) and (3) climate information services as highly valued promising options for climate change adaptation and risk management in West Africa. In addition, institutional settings at the community, national and regional levels such as the establishment of multi-stakeholder innovation platforms, national science policy dialogue platforms on CSA in parts of West Africa and the formulation of the West Africa CSA Alliance were found to be crucial in promoting capacity development and awareness of CSA technologies and innovations in the region. The review found that CSA still faces a number of challenges, including: lack of clear conceptual understanding, limited enabling policy and financing. The prospects of CSA in West Africa hinge on the capacities of farming households and the region's national institutions to understand the environmental, economic and social challenges in the context of climate change, and consequently self-mobilize to develop and implement responsive policies at appropriate scales.

The Colorado Plateau is comprised of vast tracts of public land managed by local, state, and federal agencies that oversee a wide range of activities (e.g., mineral and energy extraction, livestock grazing, and recreation). About 75% of the Plateau is managed by federal and tribal agencies and tens of millions of people visit the Plateau's public lands each year. However, even in the face of this diverse use, our knowledge of effective ways to restore Plateau ecosystems remains relatively poor. Further, the multiple agencies on the Plateau have mandates that differ greatly in allowable practices, restoration needs, and desired outcomes. The Colorado Plateau is also expected to undergo ecosystem shifts in the face of climate change, further complicating management decisions and potentially limiting some options while creating others. Here, we explore the current state of Colorado Plateau restoration science and underscore key challenges and opportunities for improving our capacity to maintain the myriad of services provided by these desert ecosystems. We highlight past research efforts and future needs related to restoration concepts, including consideration and design of novel ecosystems, mitigation for and adaptation to climate change, use of genetically diverse seed adapted for current and future conditions, and the value of strong multi-agency and stakeholder collaborations in restoring systems on the Colorado Plateau and beyond.","[Winkler, Daniel E.; Belnap, Jayne; Duniway, Michael C.; Fick, Stephen E.; Mann, Rebecca; Pfennigwerth, Alix A.; Young, Kristina E.; Reed, Sasha C.] US Geol Survey, Canyonlands Res Stn, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, 2290 South West Resource Blvd, Moab, UT 84532 USA; [Backer, Dana M.] Bur Land Management, Grand Staircase Escalante Natl Monument, Kanab, UT 84741 USA; [Bradford, John B.; Copeland, Stella M.; Massatti, Robert T.; McCormick, Molly L.; Munson, Seth M.] US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, 2255 North Gemini Dr, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [Butterfield, Bradley J.; Copeland, Stella M.] No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, 805 South Beaver St, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Butterfield, Bradley J.; Copeland, Stella M.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 805 South Beaver St, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Faist, Akasha M.] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Anim & Range Sci, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Jensen, Scott L.; Richardson, Bryce A.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, 735 North 500 East, Provo, UT 84606 USA; [Kramer, Andrea T.] Chicago Bot Garden, 1000 Lake Cook Rd, Glencoe, IL 60022 USA; [Olwell, Peggy] Bureau Land Management, 1849 C St NW,LSB-204, Washington, DC 20240 USA; [Parr, Steve D.] Upper Colorado Environm Plant Ctr, 5538 Cty Rd 4, Meeker, CO 81641 USA; [Pilmanis, Adrienne M.] Bur Land Management, Colorado Plateau Native Plant Program, 440 West 200 South, Salt Lake City, UT 84101 USA; [Samuel, Ella] Bur Land Management, New Mexico State Off, Santa Fe, NM 87508 USA; [See, Kathy] Western Colorado Landscape Collaborat, Montrose, CO 81402 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Northern Arizona University; Northern Arizona University; New Mexico State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Winkler, DE (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Canyonlands Res Stn, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, 2290 South West Resource Blvd, Moab, UT 84532 USA.",dwinkler@usgs.gov,"Reed, Sasha C/ABE-9476-2020; Winkler, Daniel E./C-5710-2019; Copeland, Stella/X-5828-2019; Kramer, Andrea T/K-8427-2017; Copeland, Stella/GRS-5992-2022; Bradford, John/E-5545-2011","Reed, Sasha C/0000-0002-8597-8619; Winkler, Daniel E./0000-0003-4825-9073; Kramer, Andrea T/0000-0002-0956-0157; Bradford, John/0000-0001-9257-6303; Young, Kristina/0000-0002-5377-5171; Samuel, Ella/0000-0001-5085-7369; Duniway, Michael/0000-0002-9643-2785",,,,,66,20,20,3,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-2971,1526-100X,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

We integrated in a single index the degree of exposure to climate that the nation's municipalities have. We selected this spatial scale because the municipality is the basic unit of administrative and economic planning; consequently, this is the scale at which policies of adaptation to climate change must be fostered. We conceptualized exposure as the sum of historic extreme events, the degree of ecosystem conservation and current climate and its future scenarios. This approach allowed us to create a climate hazard exposure index at the municipality scale integrating past and present. Maps of this index can be constructed to serve as a medium of risk communication and to aid policy design. We used information from eighteen variables to statistically standardize and compute the hazard exposure index by applying empirical formulae. We found that actually, out of ten Mexicans, three live in flood-prone zones, three may suffer the passage of tropical cyclones, five reside in drought zones and two live in extreme drought regions. Additionally, hailstorms affect five out of ten Mexicans, while eight out of ten are affected by frosts. Incorporating climate change, in the future more municipalities and a higher population will live in high exposure.

Previous results have demonstrated observed increases in warm and wet extremes and decreases in cold extremes, consistent with changes expected in a warming world. Here, a significant shift is found in the distribution of observed total annual precipitation over 1981-2010. In addition, significant positive trends are seen in all observed wet precipitation indices over 1951-2010. For the Northeast region, CMIP5 models project significant shifts in the distributions of most temperature and precipitation indices by 2041-2070. By the late century, the coldest (driest) future extremes are projected to be warmer (wetter) than the warmest (wettest) extremes at present. The multimodel interquartile range compares well with observations, providing a measure of confidence in the projections in this region. Spatial analysis suggests that the largest increases in heavy precipitation extremes are projected for northern, coastal, and mountainous areas. Results suggest that the projected increase in total annual precipitation is strongly influenced by increases in winter wet extremes. The largest decreases in cold extremes are projected for northern and interior portions of the Northeast, while the largest increases in summer warm extremes are projected for densely populated southern, central, and coastal areas. This study provides a regional analysis and verification of the latest generation of CMIP global models specifically for the Northeast, useful to stakeholders focused on understanding and adapting to climate change and its impacts in the region.","[Thibeault, Jeanne M.; Seth, Anji] Univ Connecticut, Dept Geog, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut,"Thibeault, JM (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Geog, 215 Glenbrook Rd,Unit 4148, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",jeanne.thibeault@uconn.edu,,,U.S. Department of Energy's Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison; WMO ETCCDI [LP100200690]; NSF CAREER [1056216]; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences [1056216] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,U.S. Department of Energy's Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); WMO ETCCDI; NSF CAREER(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"We appreciate the thoughtful comments of three anonymous reviewers, which helped to improve this manuscript.

Risk area determination and cause analysis through risk assessment are essential for disaster risk reduction. Previous studies in Republic of Korea has assessed risk according to administrative district due to limitations in analysis of spatially extensive disaster impact and constructing geospatial data. This study developed and applied a model to assess gridded risk integrating various climate-related disasters in Daegu, Ulsan, Gyeongbook, and Gangwon of Republic of Korea. The developing process consists of design, implementation, and verification stage. The method of assessing risk using proxy variables was applied to the model. Gridded hazards constructed through numerical analysis, exposure, and vulnerability in high-resolution were utilized as input data. The model was verified by analyzing whether the observed damage was located within the upper and lower outliers of the gridded risk. The observed damage in 43 out of 54 (80%) administrative districts was located within the outlier range of gridded risk. Climate-related disaster risk was highest in the central region of Gangwon, which was highly affected by flood and snow risk. In Daegu and Ulsan, the flood risk was high in the low-lying area near the Nakdong and Taehwa rivers due to the concentration of population, building, and infrastructure. The model will be useful for central government, which requires integrated disaster risk information. Gridded risk can be used to determine hot spots in high-resolution for establishing strategies for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation of local government.","[Yu, Insang] Korea Environm Inst, Korea Adaptat Ctr Climate Change, Bldg B-517,KACCC,232 Gareum Ro, Sejong 30121, South Korea",Korea Environment Institute (KEI),"Yu, I (corresponding author), Korea Environm Inst, Korea Adaptat Ctr Climate Change, Bldg B-517,KACCC,232 Gareum Ro, Sejong 30121, South Korea.",isyu@kei.ac.kr,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Yu, Insang/0000-0002-8127-4892",Korea Environment Institute (KEI) upon the request of the Korea Ministry of Environment [2022-00105],"Korea Environment Institute (KEI) upon the request of the Korea Ministry of Environment(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea)","This paper is based on the results of the research work Assessment of climate change vulnerability and support tool (2022-00105), conducted by the Korea Environment Institute (KEI) upon the request of the Korea Ministry of Environment.",,97,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

There is a growing interest in using natural habitats such as mangroves to defend coastlines. The protective services of mangroves, however, have not been assessed in the same rigorous engineering and socio-economic terms as rock revetments, and therefore are often overlooked by coastal managers. We used field measurements, a social science survey and economic valuation to compare the coastal protection services of mangroves and rock revetments, at five locations across Victoria, Australia. The results showed, in sheltered locations, both mangroves and rock revetments attenuated waves, however, the wave attenuation (per metre) of rock revetments was greater than mangroves, at two of the five locations. Only a small proportion of the survey respondents had observed flooding or erosion in their suburb but most agreed that mangroves provide important coastal protection benefits. Coastal landowners visited areas with mangroves more often than the public but were less likely to worry about the links between climate change and coastal erosion and flooding, or to agree that the coast was well protected with existing artificial coastal infrastructure, than other respondents. There were much higher up-front costs associated with building rock revetments, than planting mangroves, but rock revetments required less land than mangroves. Mangroves covered a larger area and averted more damages than rock revetments. Coastal managers and policy makers will have more success in advocating for nature-based solutions for coastal protection, if they are implemented in locations where they are eco-engineering and socio-economically acceptable options for climate change adaptation.","[Strain, E.

For this purpose, we used the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) to investigate the spatial-temporal pattern of drought and its impact on crop production. Using monthly precipitation (Precip) and temperature (Temp) data from 1986-2015 for 39 weather stations, the drought index was obtained for the time scale of 3, 6, and 12 months. The Mann-Kendall test was used to determine trends and rates of change. Precip and Temp anomalies were investigated using the regression analysis and compared with the drought index. The link between drought with large-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies using the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) was explored. Results showed a non-uniform spatial pattern of dryness and wetness which varied across Myanmar agro-ecological zones and under different time scales. Generally, results showed an increasing trend for the SPEI in the three-time scales, signifying a high tendency of decreased drought from 1986-2015. The fluctuations in dryness/wetness might linked to reduction crop production between 1986-1999 and 2005, 2008, 2010, 2013 cropping years. Results show relationship between main crops production and climate (teleconnection) factors. However, the low correlation values (i.e., <0.49) indicate the extent of the relationship within the natural variability. However, readers are urged to interpret this result cautiously as reductions in crop production may also be affected by other factors. We have demonstrated droughts evolution and trends using weather stations, thus providing useful information to aid policymakers in developing spatially relevant climate change adaptation and mitigation management plans for Myanmar.","[Sein, Zin Mie Mie; Nooni, Isaac Kwesi; Sian, Kenny T.

Together with the onslaught of climate change on livelihoods, LSLA is contributing to new, and exacerbating old vulnerabilities in ways that raise important questions for research. We examined the impact of LSLAs on food security disparities across multiple intersections of vulnerabilities: gender, migration, and climate change. Guided by political ecology concepts, we analyzed cross-sectional data (n = 1136) from Tanzania using multivariate ordinal logistic regression and post-estimation margins. The analyses revealed that male non-migrants compared with female non-migrants were 58 % more likely to report that LSLA was resulting in food insecurity. Individuals who experienced drought were 42 % less likely, while those who perceived temperature to be hotter (OR = 0.58, p < 0.05), rapidly changing (OR = 0.21, p < 0.01), or even stable (OR = 0.13, p < 0.01) compared to those who perceived temperature to be colder were less likely to report that LSLA was resulting in food insecurity. While male non-migrants reported the highest probability (0.81) of experiencing food insecurity as a result of LSLAs, with the added effect of climate change, the impact of LSLAs on food insecurity is reduced among non-migrants but exacerbated among migrants. These findings suggest the need for policy priority on smallholder agriculture as a climate change adaptation strategy.","[Atuoye, Kilian Nasung] Univ Toronto Mississauga, Dept Geog Geomat & Environm, 3359 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada; [Luginaah, Isaac] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, Social Sci Ctr, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Hambati, Herbert] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Coll Social Sci, Populat Studies & Res Ctr, POB 35047, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Campbell, Gwyn] McGill Univ, Peterson Hall,3460 McTavish St,Room 100, Montreal, PQ H3A 1X9, Canada",University of Toronto; University Toronto Mississauga; Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Dar es Salaam; McGill University,"Atuoye, KN (corresponding author), Univ Toronto Mississauga, Dept Geog Geomat & Environm, 3359 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.",kilian.atuoye@utoronto.ca; iluginaa@uwo.ca; hhambati@udsm.ac.tz; gwyn.campbell@mcgill.ca,"Campbell, Gwyn/AAN-1474-2021","Luginaah, Isaac/0000-0001-7858-3048; Atuoye, Kilian Nasung/0000-0002-6003-980X; Hambati, Herbert/0000-0002-0171-9012","the Indian Ocean World: The Making of the First Global Economy in the Context of Human Environment Interaction project within Major Collaborative Research Initiative (MCRI) from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Canada [412-2010-1007]","the Indian Ocean World: The Making of the First Global Economy in the Context of Human Environment Interaction project within Major Collaborative Research Initiative (MCRI) from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Canada","We acknowledge research funding support from the Indian Ocean World: The Making of the First Global Economy in the Context of Human Environment Interaction project within the framework of Major Collaborative Research Initiative (MCRI) from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Canada (Grant #412-2010-1007).

The Republic of Fiji was chosen as a case study; sea level rise is based on predictions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for the years 2050 and 2100. This study combines the concept of a geographic information system based digital inundation analysis with the concept of a material stock analysis. The findings show that about 4.5% of all existing buildings on Fiji will be inundated by 2050 because of an expected global sea level rise of 0.22 m (scenario 1) and 6.2% by 2100 for a sea level rise of 0.63 m (scenario 2). The number of buildings inundated by 2050 is equivalent to 40% of the average number of new constructed buildings in Fiji Islands in a single year. Overall, the amount of materials present in buildings which will be inundated by 2050 is 900,000 metric tons (815,650 metric tons of concrete, 52,100 metric tons of timber, and 31,680 metric tons of steel).

Cage culture of salinity-tolerant fish may be an adaptation strategy to compensate for the losses of freshwater fish production by climate change in coastal areas. Therefore, a 120-day long field experiment was conducted to evaluate the cage culture potentiality of Mystus gulio in the coastal region of Bangladesh. Three treatments at the stocking density of 90 (T-1), 135 (T-2), and 180 (T-3)/m(2) were stocked in nine cages (1.115 m(2)). Significantly (p<0.05) higher growth performance and feed utilization were recorded in T-1 followed by T-2 and T-3. In return, considering overall growth, survival, production, coast-benefit analysis, T-2 was found more profitable followed by T-3 and T-1. This result revealed that the culture of M. gulio in floating net cages might be a potential climate-adaptive aquaculture technique in the coastal region. However, further research works are necessary for optimizing stocking density, nutrition, social acceptance, etc. before conclude it as a viable climate-resilient adaptive aquaculture practice.","[Hossain, Mohammad Mosarof; Mostafiz, Md] Sylhet Agr Univ, Dept Coastal & Marine Fisheries, Sylhet 3100, Bangladesh; [Ahamed, Saokat] Bangladesh Fisheries Res Inst, Freshwater Sub Stn, Saidpur, Bangladesh; [Hassan, Mohammed Masud] Noakhali Integrated Agro Ind Ltd, Operat & Mkt, Noakhali, Bangladesh; [Islam, Md Ariful] Bangladesh Fisheries Res Inst, Shrimp Res Stn, Bagerhat, Bangladesh; [Baten, Md Abdul] Sher E Bangla Agr Univ, Dept Fishing & Post Harvest Technol, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Hoq, Md Enamul] Bangladesh Fisheries Res Inst, Res Planning & Evaluat Div, Mymensingh, Bangladesh; [Akter, Taslima] Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agr Univ, Dept Aquaculture, Dhaka, Bangladesh",Sylhet Agricultural University; Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI); Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI); Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University (SAU); Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI); Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University (BSMRAU),"Hossain, MM (corresponding author), Sylhet Agr Univ, Dept Coastal & Marine Fisheries, Sylhet 3100, Bangladesh.;Akter, T (corresponding author), Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agr Univ, Dept Aquaculture, Gazipur 1706, Bangladesh.",mosarofmh.cmf@sau.ac.bd; taslima@bsmrau.edu.bd,"Akter, Taslima/ABB-4887-2021","Akter, Taslima/0000-0003-2944-9541; ISLAM, ARIFUL/0000-0003-0150-0819","Infrastructural Development and Research Strengthening of Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute Project (IDRS-BFRI Project), Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute, Bangladesh","Infrastructural Development and Research Strengthening of Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute Project (IDRS-BFRI Project), Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute, Bangladesh","This research project was carried out with financial support from Infrastructural Development and Research Strengthening of Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute Project (IDRS-BFRI Project), Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute, Bangladesh.",,47,0,0,1,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1045-4438,1545-0805,,J APPL AQUACULT,J.

This article describes how climate change and extreme weather impact vulnerable riparian communities and settlements. The analysis is done by reviewing past research and empirical case studies from riparian rural communities of the impact zone of the Sundarbans in Bangladesh, the world's most extensive mangrove forest. The article discusses the climate-related impacts on households through a Severity Index of Vulnerability and assesses the adaptation responses they may pursue. The principal climate-related vulnerabilities and impacts due to increases in temperature, storm surges, sea flooding, and sea-level rise are seawater intrusion and riverbank erosion. Many households have adopted several autonomous reactive adaptation strategies rather than planned ones, to cope with these impacts. However, government organisations and NGOs provide less than optimal technical and financial support to households for planned and anticipatory adaptive responses. The main barriers to adaptation were the high cost of improved crop varieties, inadequate agricultural extension services, and a lack of knowledge on effective climate adaptation. The restoration of the mangrove ecosystem may increase its resilience and, among other things, make local communities less exposed. The article also presents some adaptation measures proper to reduce the climate-related vulnerability of riparian settlements.","[Leal Filho, Walter; Wolf, Franziska; Kovaleva, Marina] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Res & Transfer Ctr Sustainable Dev & Climate Chang, Hamburg, Germany; [Leal Filho, Walter] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Manchester, England; [Alam, G.

This article explores these assumptions and considers whether there is any evidence that the success of planning for unavoidable climate change is related to the extent of public participation.

The adaptation to such threats is both a challenge as well as an opportunity, especially for woman-operated farms in Pakistan. The challenge is how to devise measures and look for options to counter its impact, while the opportunity lies in developing new techniques, skills, and interventions leading to innovativeness. As women farmers are constrained regarding resources, cultural, societal, and personal reasons in Pakistan's context, they particularly need innovative behavior and decision power to adapt to climate change. This study aims to measure the decisional empowerment and innovativeness of women farmers and their role in adopting different climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices at the farm level. To this end, data from 384 farms where women were majorly involved are utilized in a multivariate probit model and propensity score matching to reveal various aspects of women's role in adopting CSA practices. Results reveal that most women farmers lacked decisional power related to productive resources such as sale/purchase and renting of farmland, using farm machinery, and availing credit. Their decisional empowerment and innovativeness positively affected the adoption of CSA practices at the farm level. Females with more decisional power and innovativeness adopted more CSA practices than women with weaker decisional power and innovativeness. Therefore, the world can benefit greatly from giving more power to women in agriculture in terms of increased adoption of CSA practices, consequently improving food security and mitigating climate change. This outcome will assist in achieving the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals of gender equality (SDG5) and climate action (SDG 13).","[Shahbaz, Pomi; Abbas, Azhar] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Faisalabad 38040, Pakistan; [ul Haq, Shamsheer] Univ Educ, Dept Econ, Div Management & Adm Sci, Lahore 54000, Pakistan; [Batool, Zahira] Govt Coll Univ, Dept Sociol, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan; [Alotaibi, Bader Alhafi] King Saud Univ, Coll Food & Agr Sci, Dept Agr Extens & Rural Soc, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia; [Nayak, Roshan K.] Univ Calif Davis, Div Agr & Nat Resources, 2801 2nd St, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Agriculture Faisalabad; Government College University Faisalabad; King Saud University; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Abbas, A (corresponding author), Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Faisalabad 38040, Pakistan.;Alotaibi, BA (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Coll Food & Agr Sci, Dept Agr Extens & Rural Soc, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.",azhar.abbas@uaf.edu.pk; bathafi@ksu.edu.sa,"SHAHBAZ, POMI/AAM-6128-2020; Abbas, Azhar/H-9311-2019","SHAHBAZ, POMI/0000-0002-7384-4664; Abbas, Azhar/0000-0003-4922-5959; Haq, Dr. Shamsheer ul/0000-0002-7258-5525; Alhafi-Alotaibi, Bader/0000-0002-9633-4341","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [RSP2022R443]","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University)","This research was funded by Researchers Supporting Project Number (RSP2022R443), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",,74,0,0,8,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,AUG,2022,12,8,,,,,,,1161,10.3390/agriculture12081161,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12081161,,,16,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,4C4NG,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000846431700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Sea turtles have temperature-dependent sex determination, and many populations produce highly female-biased offspring sex ratios, a skew likely to increase further with global warming. We estimated the primary sex ratio at one of the world's largest green turtle Chelonia mydas rookeries in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, and explored its resilience to climate change. In 2013 and 2014, we deployed data loggers recording nest (n = 101) and sand (n = 30) temperatures, and identified hatchling sex by histological examination of gonads. A logistic curve was fitted to the data to allow predictions of sex ratio across habitats and through the nesting season. The population-specific pivotal temperature was 29.4 degrees C, with both sexes produced within incubation temperatures from 27.6 to 31.4 degrees C: the transitional range of temperatures (TRT). Primary sex ratio changed from male-to female-biased across relatively small temporal and spatial scales. Overall it was marginally female-biased, but we estimated an exceptionally high male hatchling production of 47.7% (95% CI: 36.7-58.3%) and 44.5% (95% CI: 33.8-55.4%) in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Both the temporal and spatial variation in incubation conditions and the wide range of the TRT suggest resilience and potential for adaptation to climate change if the present nesting habitat remains unchanged. These findings underline the importance of assessing site-specific parameters to understand populations' responses to climate change, particularly with regard to identifying rookeries with high male hatchling production that may be key for the future conservation of sea turtles under projected global warming scenarios.","[Patricio, Ana R.; Broderick, Annette C.; Godley, Brendan J.; Hawkes, Lucy A.] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn TR10 9FE, England; [Patricio, Ana R.; Catry, Paulo] ISPA Inst Univ, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, P-1140041 Lisbon, Portugal; [Marques, Ana; Rebelo, Rui] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, CE3C, Bloco C2, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Barbosa, Castro; Regalla, Aissa] Inst Biodivers & Protected Areas Guinea Bissau IB, CP-70, Bissau, Guinea Bissau",University of Exeter; Instituto Superior Psicologia Aplicada (ISPA); Universidade de Lisboa,"Patricio, AR (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn TR10 9FE, England.;Patricio, AR (corresponding author), ISPA Inst Univ, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, P-1140041 Lisbon, Portugal.",r.patricio@exeter.ac.uk,"godley, brendan/O-1959-2019; Patricio, Rita/AAE-2655-2021; Patrício, Ana Rita/B-3437-2019; Rebelo, Rui/D-7054-2013; Catry, Paulo/I-5408-2013","godley, brendan/0000-0003-3845-0034; Patricio, Rita/0000-0003-4963-2343; Patrício, Ana Rita/0000-0003-4963-2343; Rebelo, Rui/0000-0003-2544-1470; Regalla de Barros, Aissa/0000-0003-1522-8211; Catry, Paulo/0000-0003-3000-0522; Broderick, Annette/0000-0003-1444-1782","MAVA Foundation; Rufford Foundation [RSG12317-1, RSG16357-2]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PEst-OE/BIA/UI0329/2014, UID/MAR/04292/2013, IF/00502/2013/CP1186/CT0003, SFRH/BD/85017/2012]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PEst-OE/BIA/UI0329/2014, SFRH/BD/85017/2012] Funding Source: FCT",MAVA Foundation; Rufford Foundation; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia,"research was funded by the MAVA Foundation, the Rufford Foundation (RSG12317-1, RSG16357-2), and the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology through the strategic projects PEst-OE/BIA/UI0329/2014 granted to cE3c, and UID/MAR/04292/2013 granted to MARE, project IF/00502/2013/CP1186/CT0003, and the grant awarded to A.R.P.

Local temperature, precipitation, clouds, atmospheric water vapor. wind speed, and wind direction influence atmospheric chemical processes, and interactions occur between local and global-scale environments. If the climate becomes warmer and more variable, air quality is likely to be affected. However, the specific types of change (i.e., local, regional, or global), the direction of change in a particular location (i.e., positive or negative), and the magnitude of change in air quality that may be attributable to climate change are a matter of speculation, based on extrapolating present understanding to future scenarios. There is already extensive evidence on the health effects of air pollution. Ground-level ozone can exacerbate chronic respiratory diseases and cause short-term reductions in lung function. Exposure to particulate matter can aggravate chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, alter host defenses, damage lung tissue, lead to premature death, and possibly contribute to cancer. Health effects of exposures to carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide can include reduced work capacity, aggravation of existing cardiovascular diseases, effects on pulmonary function, respiratory illnesses, lung irritation, and alterations in the lung's defense systems. Adaptations to climate change should include ensuring responsiveness of air quality protection programs to changing pollution levels.

The growth of urbanisation has noticeable adverse impacts on urban microclimate and parameters generating the urban heat island (UHI) effect. These impacts, exac-erbated by the gradual influences of global warming over time, make urban microclimate changes more complex. The future urban development and climate change adaptation plans in New Zealand (NZ) show almost no evidence of considering the status of future urban microclimate, UHI and outdoor thermal comfort. An initial literature review showed a relatively small number of papers and grey literature on urban microclimate in NZ. This motivated the authors to explore the status of studies on the urban micro -climate and the following impacts on UHI and outdoor thermal comfort in NZ. The results showed a rel-atively small body of knowledge on urban microclimate studies in research articles published and governmental reports in the context of NZ. Likewise, the inconsistency of research parameters and meth-ods studied and the lack of validation in the available studies, plus the neglection of future urban devel-opment and urban morphology, limit the clarity of the scientific understanding of changes to the urban microclimate in NZ. The results of this study address the missing links and provide new insight for future studies.

Sea level rise (SLR) and anthropogenic activities have triggered more extreme climatic events and made the coastal region vulnerable in recent decades. Many parts of the world also noticed increased sediment deposition, tidal effects, and changes in the shoreline. Farasan Island, located in the south-eastern part of Saudi Arabia, experienced changes in sediment deposition from the Red Sea in recent years. This study used Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) to delineate the shoreline changes of Farasan Island during 1975-2020. Multi-temporal Landsat data and DSAS were used for shoreline calculation based on endpoint rate (EPR) and linear regression. Results revealed an increase in vegetation area on the island by 17.18 km(2) during 1975-1989 and then a decrease by 69.85 km(2) during 1990-2020. The built-up land increased by 5.69 km(2) over the study period to accommodate the population growth. The annual temperature showed an increase at a rate of 0.196 degrees C/year. The sea-level rise caused a shift in the island's shoreline and caused a reduction of land by 80.86 km(2) during 1975-2020. The highly influenced areas by the environmental changes were the north, central, northwest, southwest, and northeast parts of the island. Urban expansion and sea-level rise gradually influence the island ecosystem, which needs proper attention, management, policies, and awareness planning to protect the environment of Farasan Island. Also, the study's findings could help develop new strategies and plan climate change adaptation.","[Khedher, Khaled Mohamed] King Khalid Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Abha 61421, Saudi Arabia; [Khedher, Khaled Mohamed] High Inst Technol Studies, Dept Civil Engn, Mrezgua Univ Campus, Nabeul 8000, Tunisia; [Abu-Taweel, Gasem Mohammad; Al-Fifi, Zarraq] Jazan Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Biol, POB 2079, Jazan 45142, Saudi Arabia; [Qoradi, Mofareh D.] King Saud Univ, Coll Arts, Dept Geog, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia; [Al-khafaji, Zainab] AL Mustaqbal Univ Coll, Bldg & Construct Engn Technol Dept, Hillah 51001, Iraq; [Halder, Bijay; Bandyopadhyay, Jatisankar] Vidyasagar Univ, Dept Remote Sensing & GIS, Midnapore, W Bengal, India; [Shahid, Shamsuddin] Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Fac Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Essaied, Laatar] Co Phosphate Gafsa & Chem Grp Tunisia, Appt D6 Immeuble Ramsis Ave Habib Bourguiba, Ezzahra Ben Arous 2034, Tunisia; [Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Al Ayen Univ, Sci Res Ctr, New Era & Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Thi Qar 64001, Iraq",King Khalid University; Jazan University; King Saud University; Al-Mustaqbal University College; Vidyasagar University; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Yaseen, ZM (corresponding author), Al Ayen Univ, Sci Res Ctr, New Era & Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Thi Qar 64001, Iraq.",yaseen@alayen.edu.iq,"SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/B-5185-2010; Al-Khafaji, Zainab/E-5962-2019; ALFaifi, zarraq/GYA-2609-2022; Halder, Bijay/AAT-3875-2020","SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/0000-0001-9621-6452; Al-Khafaji, Zainab/0000-0002-5450-7312; Halder, Bijay/0000-0002-4279-5214",,,,,78,0,0,3,3,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,AUG 22,2022,12,1,,,,,,,14322,10.1038/s41598-022-18225-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-18225-5,,,20,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,3Z0XT,35995829,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000844144900078,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, interventions similar to NBS were used for a long time before this term was first introduced. Such pre-existing actions, to be considered as NBS, must meet the Global Standards formulated by the Union for Conservation of Nature Global Standards. One of these standards refers to the challenge-orientation of NBS. The aim of this study was to propose objective criteria that enable the assessment of the challenge-orientation of such interventions. To this end, a set of criteria referring to the seven societal challenges was presented. A Lublin city (Poland) case study was applied in relation to 24 types of interventions. The results showed that all of the analysed pre-existing actions met at least two of the challenges. The actions with the greatest challenge-orientation potential continuity for ecological networks are: protecting surface wetlands, public parks, allotment gardens, restoring waterbodies and maintaining floodplains, and the lowest potential are: creating nesting boxes for bats and insect hotels, installing apiaries and below-ground rainwater collection systems. The analysed interventions responded, to a greater extent, to challenges such as to human health, climate change adaptation and mitigation and ecosystem degradation/biodiversity loss, and, to the least extent, to food security and socioeconomic development Moreover, the study revealed that the scale of the pre-existing intervention type is too general to draw conclusions regarding its challenge-orientation: each piece of the intervention should be assessed separately in relation to the conditions in the local context.","[Wojcik-Madej, Julia; Sowinska-Swierkosz, Barbara] Univ Life Sci Lublin, Dept Hydrobiol & Ecosyst Protect, Dobrzanskiego 37, PL-20262 Lublin, Poland",University of Life Sciences in Lublin,"Sowinska-Swierkosz, B (corresponding author), Univ Life Sci Lublin, Dept Hydrobiol & Ecosyst Protect, Dobrzanskiego 37, PL-20262 Lublin, Poland.",barbara.sowinska@wp.pl,,"Sowinska-Swierkosz, Barbara/0000-0002-0276-7809; Wojcik-Madej, Julia/0000-0003-1324-9000","University of Life Sciences in Lublin, Poland [SD/64/ISGiE/2022]","University of Life Sciences in Lublin, Poland","This research was supported by project no.

However, depressional wetlands are particularly vulnerable to effects of climate change due to the significant role that precipitation and surface runoff play in shaping their hydrology. In the Southern Great Plains of North America, climate projections predict more extreme storm events, higher temperatures, and severe droughts, which could threaten natural hydrological patterns of depressional wetlands in this region. Regional hydrological models that accurately predict water dynamics are critical for developing effective climate change adaptation strategies. We developed a model to predict wetland inundation status for depressional wetlands in the Pleistocene Sand Dunes Ecoregion of Oklahoma, USA, that evaluated effects of weather variables, wetland characteristics, and landscape-level variables. We then predicted numbers of inundated wetlands and frequency of wetland inundation under three climate change scenarios for the middle and end of the century (2036-2050 and 2084-2099, respectively). Total precipitation measured in the 2 months prior to an inundation event and average daily temperature were the most important variables predicting wetland inundation status, and land use and wetland characteristics explained relatively little variation in water dynamics. Projections of wetland inundation status indicate numbers of inundated wetlands will decrease in spring and summer by as much as 42% and 79%, respectively, by midcentury. Future inundation patterns during fall and winter were less clear but will likely be similar to current, highly variable conditions. These results suggest climate change may threaten persistence of wetlands during key seasonal periods when humans, plants, and wildlife depend on them for crucial resources and services.","[Londe, David W.; Davis, Craig A.; Loss, Scott R.; Robertson, Ellen P.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Nat Resources Ecol & Management, 008c Ag Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Dvorett, Daniel] Oklahoma Conservat Commiss, 4545 North Lincoln Blvd, Oklahoma City, OK 73105 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Londe, DW (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Nat Resources Ecol & Management, 008c Ag Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",david.londe@okstate.edu,,"Loss, Scott/0000-0002-8753-2995","Wetland Program Development Grant (CA) [CD-00F42801, 2]; South Central Climate Adaption Center",Wetland Program Development Grant (CA); South Central Climate Adaption Center,"This project was funded through a 2012, 104(b)(3)Wetland Program Development Grant (CA#CD-00F42801, Project 2), and the South Central Climate Adaption Center.",,81,4,4,24,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Five years later, flooding recurred on a wider scale, destroying buildings, roads, fields, and orchards all over Ladakh and provoking a wide-ranging discussion among locals about the causes of climate catastrophe. In this essay, we attend to those local voices and allow the people of Ladakh to speak for themselves about the causes and consequences of climate change as well as the best forms of climate change adaptation in the trans-Himalayan region. We offer a two-year progress report on our ongoing oral history fieldwork in this unique and ecologically sensitive high desert region. At the same time, we offer some reflections on the discipline of oral history itself and the promise it offers in conjunction with community engagement to the study of climate change. The surprising fact remains that despite much recent and inspiring work at the compelling intersection of oral and environmental history, few oral historians have taken on directly the subject of climate change, and those who have tend to dwell on the specific experience of the American West. Here we join those few oral and environmental historians who are approaching climate change by way of global community engagement. Only by way of such engagement, we argue-only by following the best practices of what has come to be known as community-based participatory research, can oral history fulfill its public mission as we understand it and contribute decisively to the humanistic study of the Anthropocene.","[Weaver, Stewart; Bakhmetyeva, Tatyana; Rinn, Daniel Wayne] Univ Rochester, Hist, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Bakhmetyeva, Tatyana] Univ Rochester, Susan B Anthony Inst Gender Sexual & Womens Studi, Rochester, NY USA",University of Rochester; University of Rochester,"Weaver, S (corresponding author), Univ Rochester, Hist, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",sweaver@ur.rochester.edu; tbakhmet@ur.rochester.edu; rinn.dw@gmail.com,,"Rinn, Daniel/0000-0002-4119-3422",University of Rochester; Andrew Carnegie Corporation,University of Rochester; Andrew Carnegie Corporation,"For their invaluable contributions to the thinking and community-engaged research that went into this essay, the authors would like to thank Sonam Wangchuk, Geshe Konchok Wangdu, Stanzin Mingur, Nancy Chin, Puntsok Namgyal, Namgil Nawang, Kausar Haider, Sophia McCrae, Tsering Yangchan, Pegga Mosavi, Rinchen Tamchos, Danielle Gartenberg, Jigmet Dolma, Daria ValovaLynch, and all our Ladakhi narrators, translators, and interlocutors.

Based on daily temperature data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) and population data, we estimate the changes in population exposure for two future periods under three scenarios of emission and socio-economic development at global and continental scales, and assess the contributions from climate and population changes. We find that the spatial patterns of exposure to compound hot extremes are similar for different periods and scenarios, and regions with high exposure are mainly located over East Asia, South Asia, Europe, and parts of eastern USA and Africa. The exposure shows an increase from baseline (1980-2014) to mid- and late 21st century periods (2021-2055 and 2056-2090) in most regions worldwide. Under the business-as-usual scenario (SSP2-4.5), the global exposure increases by similar to 19-fold during the late 21st century, and Africa shows the largest increase while Europe shows the smallest. Early (SSP1-2.6) and no (SSP5-8.5) actions of mitigation would relieve and aggravate the increase rate, respectively. For about 78%-87% of the global land areas, the changes in exposure are mainly caused by climate change (accounting for >69%), followed by the interaction effect (accounting for similar to 29%) that refers to synergistic changes in climate and population. In parts of mid- to high-latitude regions, the exposure is smaller than expected due to opposite effects of climate change and population change. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Studies into risk perceptions have acknowledged differences between public and expert knowledge. What is less known is how perceptions of climate change related health risk vary between the public and health experts and how these differentiated perceptions are shaped and modified by everyday complex climate change narratives from multiple actors, and contextual ecologies of social and physical spaces. A concurrent mixed-methods approach was used to elucidate climate change knowledge and awareness of climate-related health risks among health experts and the public. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected on community members (n = 927) and health experts (n = 99) in Savelugu-Nanton and Ada East Districts in Ghana. The results showed that both groups were likely to report climate change-related health concerns, of which disease was the top concern. However, differences exist in public and experts' perceptions of climate change health linkage. Community members were less likely to link climate change to health risks compared with health experts (OR = 0.02, p <= 0.000). The contrasting climate change health risk perceptions between health experts and the public adds to the literature on the health dimensions of global environmental change. The findings from this study highlight limited knowledge about climate change health related risks among the public. Hence, in building sustainable communities in light of persistent climate change impacts, it is crucial to improve climate change adaptation by implementing climate change sensitization programs. In addition, health infrastructure, decision-making and management should be strengthened for effective response to emerging climate-health risks in Ghana and similar contexts.","[Hussey, Lucia Kafui; Arku, Godwin] Western Univ, Dept Geog, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Hussey, LK (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Geog, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",lhussey3@uwo.ca,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,2016 Association of American Geographers Dissertation Research Grant; Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Scholarship; Faculty of Social Science Graduate Research Awards Funds - Western University; University of Western Ontario's Faculty Directed Research Fund,2016 Association of American Geographers Dissertation Research Grant; Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Scholarship; Faculty of Social Science Graduate Research Awards Funds - Western University; University of Western Ontario's Faculty Directed Research Fund,"We thank the health institutions for access and study participants for their valuable inputs into this research.

Aggregated at the atoll scale, results show that, over the past four decades, total land area increased by 59 ha (2.4%). Land reclamation of 93.8 ha on 12 inhabited islands was the dominant factor in the increase in land area. Excluding reclaimed islands from the dataset reveals net erosion of atoll island area of 28.5 ha (1.5%). Erosion was prevalent on 45% of islands with remaining islands being stable (40%) or increasing in area (15%). A relationship between island size and planform change was identified. Small islands (< 10 ha) were dominated by erosional responses whereas larger islands were dominated be accretion. Results indicate future transformation in atoll land resources to fewer smaller islands but an increase in size of larger islands. Results also indicate that all islands changed, underscoring the dynamic nature of islands on reef surfaces. Ten distinct styles of island adjustment were identified from the dataset. Direct human impact, through reclamation, was found to have a more significant impact on island change in the atoll than secondary factors such as sea level change and changes in reefal sediment supply. Implications for the Maldives are discussed and indicate that land resources for ongoing habitation will persist across the next century though the location of tourism activities on smaller islands places this valuable economic sector at risk. Analysis of historic island change provides a rich information source to reconsider landuse planning in the context of climate change adaptation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The IMP has several cross-cutting areas of intervention such as the Blue Growth Strategy, Maritime Spatial Planning, and Strategies for maritime basins. To ensure this policy's implementation, the European Commission requested its coastal members to develop integrated maritime strategies. Furthermore, within the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, it is also a priority of the EU to ensure compliance with the 2030 Agenda, in particular the SDG14. This study focuses on countries from the Atlantic Basin, namely France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and the UK (before Brexit) comparing key priorities and objectives of national ocean strategies of these countries and how they match IMP guidelines and the 2030 Agenda. The results show that one of the main focuses of these strategies is the mitigation and adaptation to climate change and nature conservation. On the other hand, desalination, exploration and prospection of oil and gas are the socioeconomic sectors of smaller significance. This study also demonstrated that Spain and UK's ocean strategies cannot be considered as a national ocean strategy in the IMP concept. The national ocean strategy of Ireland was introduced almost 10 years ago, therefore can be considered outdated in several dimensions. France and Portugal are the only countries whose national ocean strategies are aligned with the objectives of the Atlantic Action Plan and the only ones that truly follow the guidelines of the EU Integrated Maritime Policy.","[da Silva Marques, Ines; Guerreiro, Jose] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Anim Biol Dept, Lisbon, Portugal; [Santos, Conceicao] Directorate Gen Maritime Policy, Lisbon, Portugal; [Guerreiro, Jose] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"Marques, ID (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Anim Biol Dept, Lisbon, Portugal.",ines98marques@gmail.com,"Guerreiro, Jose/P-3898-2015","Guerreiro, Jose/0000-0001-8941-8611",European Union [N810139],European Union(European Commission),This publication was financed by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement N810139: Project Portugal Twinning for Innovation and Excellence in Marine Science and Earth Observation - PORTWIMS.,,41,0,0,1,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

This comparison has been carried out under present conditions and with perfect predictors, based on the framework established by the VALUE network, in particular, on its perfect predictor experiment. In this experiment, we evaluate the marginal aspects of the distributions of daily maximum/minimum temperatures and daily accumulated precipitation analysed by seasons, on a high resolution observational grid (0.05 degrees) over mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands. This is the first of a set of three experiments aimed to allow us to decide which methods, and under what configuration, is more appropriate for the generation of downscaled climate projections over our region. For maximum/minimum temperatures, all methods display a similar behaviour. They capture very satisfactorily the mean values although slight biases are detected on the extremes. In general, results for maximum temperature appear to be more accurate than for minimum temperature, and the nonlinear methods display certain added value. For precipitation, remarkable differences are found among all methods. Most of the methods are capable of reproducing the total precipitation amount quite satisfactorily, whereas other aspects such as intense precipitations and the precipitation occurrence are captured with more accuracy by the Analog method.","[Hernanz, Alfonso; Dominguez, Marta; Pastor-Saavedra, Maria A.; Rodriguez-Camino, Ernesto] Spanish Meteorol Agcy AEMET, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Garcia-Valero, Juan Andres] AEMET, Murcia, Spain; [Ramos-Calzado, Petra] AEMET, Seville, Spain",Agencia Estatal de Meteorologia (AEMET); Agencia Estatal de Meteorologia (AEMET); Agencia Estatal de Meteorologia (AEMET),"Hernanz, A (corresponding author), Spanish Meteorol Agcy AEMET, Madrid 28040, Spain.",ahernanzl@aemet.es,"; GARCIA-VALERO, JUAN ANDRES/L-7357-2014","Hernanz, Alfonso/0000-0003-1091-0422; GARCIA-VALERO, JUAN ANDRES/0000-0002-3914-6328; Rodriguez-Camino, Ernesto/0000-0002-1565-2373; Dominguez, Marta/0000-0001-7840-5516",MEDSCOPE project; European Commission [690462],MEDSCOPE project; European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"We would like to acknowledge all the teams implicated on the ERA-Interim reanalysis and on the Python machine-learning library Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011).

Several vegetation types have been suggested as green roof top layers, depending on the region and the purpose of the roof. In a Mediterranean climate, the Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) vegetation represents a particularly advantageous choice for green roofs since it does not require artificial irrigation and maintenance. However, the flood mitigation performance of CAM green roofs has not been investigated as adequately as other vegetation types. In this framework, we aim to define the potential retention capacity of a no maintenance-cost spontaneous CAM green roof, located at the entrance of the University of Cagliari (Italy) and to compare it to C3 vegetation type. The structure has been equipped with gauges to measure the water fluxes in and out of the roof. Local observations are used to calibrate a conceptual ecohydrological model. A 51-year rainfall time series and corresponding potential evapotranspiration are then used to simulate and compare the relative performance of green roofs vegetated with spontaneous CAM and more common C3 plants. Results show the good performances of the CAM green roof in mitigating rainfall extremes, with an average retention capacity of 0.52 over the whole investigated period, while C3 presents an index of retention equal to 0.71, but it requires frequent irrigation. Moreover, this work highlights some potential economic and environmental benefits of CAM green roof implementation in Mediterranean areas.","[Cristiano, Elena; Urru, Salvatore; Farris, Stefano; Ruggiu, Dario; Deidda, Roberto; Viola, Francesco] Univ Cagliari, Cagliari, CA, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Cristiano, E (corresponding author), Fac Ingn, Dipartimento Ingn Civile Ambientale & Architettur, Sez Idraul, Via Marengo 2, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.",elena.cristiano@unica.it,"Cristiano, Elena/AAJ-5635-2021; Viola, Francesco/E-9722-2013; DEIDDA, ROBERTO/J-2054-2017","Viola, Francesco/0000-0003-1716-192X; Farris, Stefano/0000-0002-5039-0575; DEIDDA, ROBERTO/0000-0001-5469-0199; Cristiano, Elena/0000-0002-0725-3014; Ruggiu, Dario/0000-0002-5620-8148; urru, salvatore/0000-0003-4724-1998","Sardinian Region [7/2007]; project: HYDROSARD: Un approccio multidisciplinare integrato e multiscala per la valutazione globale delle risorse idriche nella Regione Sardegna, anche in condizioni di cambiamento climatico [CUP: F76C18000920002]; Fondazione di Sardegna [CUP: F71117000270002]","Sardinian Region(Regione Sardegna); project: HYDROSARD: Un approccio multidisciplinare integrato e multiscala per la valutazione globale delle risorse idriche nella Regione Sardegna, anche in condizioni di cambiamento climatico; Fondazione di Sardegna(Fondazione Banco di Sardegna)","This work was partially supported by the Sardinian Region with law 7/2007, funding call 2017, project: HYDROSARD: Un approccio multidisciplinare integrato e multiscala per la valutazione globale delle risorse idriche nella Regione Sardegna, anche in condizioni di cambiamento climatico, CUP: F76C18000920002.

Thailand endures substantial damage from floods every year and needs accurate measurement to mitigate flood disaster predicted under the looming scenario of climate change. The predicted impacts of climate change on flood discharge need to consider land use changes in the future, especially in developing countries because of their vulnerabilities to economic growth. The objective of this study was the quantitative predictions of the impacts of climate change and land use changes on flood discharge, using two simulation models at one watershed in the Song Khwae District, Nan Province, Northern Thailand. This study has three steps: (1) predictions of future land uses (14 scenarios having different proportion of forest cover), (2) calculation of 3.3 and 10-year return period rainfall for the period of 2006-2016 and 2040-2050. and (3) comparisons of average daily discharge from 3.3 and 10-year return period rainfall in 14 land use patterns. The results showed that although climate change will decrease the average daily discharge from the 3.3 and 10-year return period rainfall, discharge from future rainfall that has a 10-year return period, where land use patterns limit forest areas to less than 45%, will be greater than present levels. These quantitative predictions can lead to cost-benefits performance analysis and contribute to positive adaptation to climate change.","[Igarashi, Keiichi; Koichiro, Kuraji; Tanaka, Nobuaki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Aranyabhaga, Nilobol] Off Prime Minister, Off Natl Water Resources, Bangkok, Thailand",University of Tokyo,"Igarashi, K (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan.",k50-igarashi@uf.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,,,,,25,5,6,1,23,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2395-7611,2395-7697,,J CLIM CHANG,J.

The demand for understanding the value and benefits of using SCF in decision-making processes can be associated with different logics. Two of these would be the need to justify public and private investment in the provision of SCF and demonstrating the gains and benefits of using SCF in specific decision-making contexts. This paper reviews the main factors influencing how SCF is (or can be) valued in supporting decision-making and the main methods and metrics currently used to perform such valuations. Our review results in four key findings: (a) there is a current emphasis on economic ex ante studies and the quantification of SCF value; (b) there are fundamental differences in how the value of SCF is defined and estimated across methods and approaches; (c) most valuation methods are unable to capture the differential benefits and risks of using SCF across spatiotemporal scales and groups; and (d) there is limited involvement of the decision-makers in the valuation process. The paper concludes by providing some guiding principles towards more effective valuations of SCF, notably the need for a wider diversity and integration of methodological approaches. These should particularly embrace ex-post, qualitative, and participatory approaches which allow co-evaluation with decision-makers so that more comprehensive and equitable SCF valuations can be developed in future.

Transformational adaptation is less well understood than incremental adaptation, since there are few studies of agricultural enterprises making transformative changes in response to climatic change. This paper is an in-depth study of an agricultural company's attempt to implement transformational adaptation in response to climate change. We document the Peanut Company of Australia's (PCA) response to predicted climatic change by expanding its operations into Katherine, Northern Territory, after decades of below-average rainfall in their traditional production region in south-east Queensland. Our research question was: what conditions and processes influenced the outcome of the company's response? We conducted 37 semi-structured interviews with company, government and community representatives to examine diverse perspectives on PCA's expansion into Katherine and its subsequent strategic retreat. To reveal insights into why, when and how this attempted transformational adaptation occurred we reviewed the literature and identified Park et al.'s (2012) Adaptation Action Cycles (AAC) framework and aspects from the organisational adaptation literature as useful for our analysis. Based on our findings, we revised the AAC framework to better reflect the way that incremental adaptation in situ can occur simultaneously with transformational adaptation at a new location. Our study illustrates that transformational adaptation in agriculture is difficult, complex, risky and costly and sometimes unsuccessful, revealing some of the challenges of and barriers to organisational adaptation in agriculture, especially when moving to a new location.","[Jakku, E.; Brandon, C.] CSIRO Land & Water, GPO Box 2583, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Thorburn, P.

This paper presents the first geological evidence for springs associated with archaeological sites in this semiarid rift basin. The springs appear to be limited to a small area within the basin and were likely connected to faults that acted as conduits for groundwater. Tufas associated with ten archaeological sites have stable- isotope signatures occurring in a cluster bounded by delta O-18 ratios from -6% to +1%, and the delta C-13 ratios from -5% to +2%. The delta O-18 values cluster around -4%, that of precipitation in the region, indicating a meteoric source. The longevity of the spring record reflects a hydrologic system that apparently persisted for hundreds of thousands of years. Previous landscape reconstructions depicted the archaeological sites on the lake margin of paleo Lake Olduvai, as an alkaline playa. The discovery of springs at or near the archaeological sites provides fresh insights for interpreting hominin behavior during this key time in evolution with respect to procuring food, water, and materials for stone tools, as well as hominin adaptation to climate change and paleoenvironmental change. The idea that spring deposits may be in proximity to archaeological sites could lead to discovery of new sites at other hominin fossil localities in the East African Rift System (EARS).","[Ashley, Gail M.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Dominguez-Rodrigo, Manuel] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Prehist, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Bunn, Henry T.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Anthropol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Mabulla, Audax Z.

After a certain period of time, timbers tend to degrade and it becomes more and more difficult to seek cost-effective replacement hardwood sleepers. To provide a shortterm solution, many rail infrastructure managers use an interspersing method of track maintenance. The interspersed sleeper of railway tracks, which is a spot replacement of old timber sleeper with concrete or composite counterparts, is often utilised as a temporary maintenance measure for secondary railway tracks such as low-traffic lines, yards, balloon loops or siding. Reportedly, the performance of railway lines including the interspersed tracks can quickly deteriorate when the tracks are exposed to heavy rains and floods. In many cases, ballast washaway can be often seen. This study is the world first to demonstrate the effects of ballast washaway on the vulnerability assessment of interspersed railway tracks using nonlinear finite element simulations, STRAND7. Two sets of moving point loads representing a bogie along the rails have been established to investigate the worst-case, potential actions for impaired performance of sleepers and differential settlements of the track. In this study, the emphasis is placed on the effects of ballast washaway on the maximum displacement of rails and the relative track geometries (i.e. top and twist). The maximum bending actions causing the failures of the track components are also investigated.

However, the country currently lacks a comprehensive integrated place-based assessment of social vulnerability that covers the entire territory. In consequence, the present study employed the SoVI (R) method to understand the pre-existing social vulnerability throughout the territory as a first step in national disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation planning. The social vulnerability assessment presented in this study is based on the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI (R)) developed for the United States of America (USA). The Colombian index was constructed using data from the 2005 census provided by the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) and the 2009 data of the Selecting Beneficiaries of Social Programs (SISBEN). The analysis included the municipalities with available information of their urban and rural areas (1118). The results show seven factors that explain 64% of the variance. The values range from +17.85 (High social vulnerability) to-4.85 (low social vulnerability). In general, the most vulnerable municipalities are located in the Pacific and Amazon regions, the southern areas of the Orinoco and the northern part of the Caribbean. The application of SoVI (R) for Colombia presented in this paper indicates a regionalization of vulnerability within the territory between areas of industrial and economic growth (urban), and areas of poor socio-economic development that may also be marked by the presence of political conflict and production of illegal crops (rural).","[Roncancio, D.

Overviews of adaptation policy, plans and actions have largely been lacking for Africa, particularly at the local, city level. We applied a systematic map to assess what the human responses to climate impacts are in African cities, noting the climate drivers of these actions, the range of responses, where they have taken place, and who the actors are. Standardized, pre-selected search terms were used to systematically search peer-reviewed and grey literature, using Web of Science, Scopus, and Google. Publications were screened based on pre-approved inclusion criteria, and actions described in included articles were coded using categories from key conceptual framing papers on climate change adaptation. Of 2 042 peer-reviewed and 60 grey-literature publications, 252 underwent full-text screening, with 121 included for coding. We recorded 1 504 actions, taking place in 41 cities from 21 African countries, in response to various climate drivers. Anticipatory and reactive actions were taken by actors, from individuals to international agencies, and we highlighted successful adaptations, those taking advantage of climate impacts, and maladaptive actions. Combinations of climatic and non-climatic stimuli induced adaptive responses, which were frequently based on local knowledge, and provided a base upon which government action could build. Residents of informal settlements had less adaptive capacity than those in formal settlements, and government action could build their resilience. Since development is affected by climate impacts, climate change information should be integrated into development programmes.","[Hunter, N. B.; North, M. A.; Roberts, D.

Pacific Island countries (PICs) are at the forefront of the impacts of climate change, which is likely to affect food and nutrition security (FNS) directly and indirectly, and many countries have existing high NCD burdens. This paper surveys the climate change adaptation (CCA) landscape in one PIC, Vanuatu. It explores the extent to which FNS and diet-related NCDs are considered and addressed within CCA initiatives. A comprehensive review of the literature related to CCA, FNS, and NCDs in Vanuatu was combined with 32 semistructured interviews with key experts and stakeholders. This study found that some promising groundwork has been laid for tackling the effects of climate change on FNS in policy and governance, agriculture, coastal management, and nutrition. However, several opportunities for strengthening CCA were identified: targeting urban populations; complementary integration of disaster risk reduction and CCA; incorporating local knowledge; applying a systems-based framing of NCDs as climate-sensitive health risks; and emphasizing human-centered, community-led CCA. Vanuatu will continue to be affected by accelerating climate change. A strong foundation for CCA presents clear opportunities for further development. As food and nutrition insecurity and diet-related NCD risk factors are increasingly exacerbated by climate change, alongside other socioeconomic drivers, it is crucial to find new and innovative ways to increase transformational resilience and adaptive capacity that also improve nutrition and health outcomes.","[Savage, Amy; Bambrick, Hilary] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Publ Hlth & Social Work, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Schubert, Lisa; Hall, Nina] Univ Queensland, Sch Publ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Huber, Corey] Pacific Consulting Ltd, Port Vila, Vanuatu; [Bellotti, Bill] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Savage, A (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Publ Hlth & Social Work, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",aj.savage@hdr.qut.edu.au,"Savage, Amy/AAX-8855-2020; Schubert, Lisa/G-2280-2012","Savage, Amy/0000-0002-9961-8665; Bambrick, Hilary/0000-0001-5361-950X; Schubert, Lisa/0000-0001-5392-4221",Ministry of Health; Australian Government Research Training Program scheme,Ministry of Health; Australian Government Research Training Program scheme,"We express our gratitude to the participants of this study for providing their time and insights.

There is, however, limited insight into the scaling effects and structural limitations of flood risk models and, therefore, the underlying uncertainty. In light of this, we examine key sources of epistemic uncertainty in the coastal flood risk (CFR) modelling chain: (i) the inclusion and interaction of different hydraulic components leading to extreme sea level (ESL), (ii) the underlying uncertainty in the digital elevation model (DEM), (iii) flood defence information, (iv) the assumptions behind the use of depth-damage functions that express vulnerability, and (v) different climate change projections. The impact of these uncertainties on estimated expected annual damage (EAD) for present and future climates is evaluated in a dual case study in Faro, Portugal, and on the Iberian Peninsula. The ranking of the uncertainty factors varies among the different case studies, baseline CFR estimates, and their absolute and relative changes. We find that uncertainty from ESL contributions, and in particular the way waves are treated, can be higher than the uncertainty of the two greenhouse gas emission projections and six climate models that are used. Of comparable importance is the quality of information on coastal protection levels and DEM information. In the absence of large datasets with sufficient resolution and accuracy, the latter two factors are the main bottlenecks in terms of large-scale CFR assessment quality.","[Vousdoukas, Michalis I.; Mentaschi, Lorenzo; Feyen, Luc] European Commiss, Joint European Res Ctr JRC, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy; [Bouziotas, Dimitrios; Giardino, Alessio] Deltares, POB 177, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands; [Bouwer, Laurens M.] Climate Serv Ctr Germany, Fischertwiete 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany; [Voukouvalas, Evangelos] Engn Ingn Informat SpA, Via S Martino della Battaglia 56, I-00185 Rome, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; Deltares,"Vousdoukas, MI (corresponding author), European Commiss, Joint European Res Ctr JRC, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy.",michail.vousdoukas@ec.europa.eu,"Feyen, Luc/ABD-6195-2021; Bouwer, Laurens/AAV-7628-2021; Mentaschi, Lorenzo/ABD-2814-2020; Bouwer, Laurens/ABE-7170-2021; Vousdoukas, Michalis/C-6743-2012","Mentaschi, Lorenzo/0000-0002-2967-9593; Bouwer, Laurens/0000-0003-3498-2586; Vousdoukas, Michalis/0000-0003-2655-6181; Voukouvalas, Evangelos/0000-0002-8812-2613; Giardino, Alessio/0000-0001-8744-5886",EU Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013 [603864],EU Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013,"The research leading to these results has received funding from the EU; Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013 under grant agreement no. 603864 (HELIX: High-End cLimate Impacts and eXtremes; http://www.helixclimate.eu, last access: 23 July 2018).

Water demand from the oil sands mining industry is projected to increase as climate change is projected to alter the seasonal freshwater supply. In this study, a range of water management options are developed to investigate the potential trade-offs between the scale of bitumen production and industry growth, water storage requirements, and environmental protection for the aquatic ecosystems, under projections of mid-century climate change. It is projected that water storage will be required to supplement river withdrawals to maintain continuous bitumen production under the impacts of future climate warming. If high growth in future bitumen production and water demand is the priority, then building sufficient water storage capacity to meet industry demand will be comparable to a week of lost revenue because of interrupted production. If environmental protection is prioritized instead, it will require over nine times the water storage costs to maintain water demand under a high industry growth trajectory. Future water use decisions will need to first, determine the scale of industry and environmental protection, and second, balance the costs of water storage against lost revenue because of water shortages that limit bitumen production. This physically based assessment of future water trade-offs can inform water policy, water management decisions, and climate change adaptation plans, with applicability to other regions facing trade-offs between industrial development and ecosystem water needs.

The herein study evaluates the impact of two climate change scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways-RCPs 4.5 and 8.5) on main crops (millet, sorghum and cowpea) grown in two agroclimatological regions (Soudano-Sahelian and Sahel) in the Republic of Niger. Climate projections using HadGEM2-ES model show increasing precipitation trends of up to + 30 % under RCP 8.5 in Birni N ' Konni (Soudano-Sahelian) and a decrease of 1 % under RCP 4.5 in Mare de Tabalak (Sahel) when comparing the 2021-30 and 2071-80 periods. The number of dry days and heavy rainfall events during the wet-season are also expected to gain in frequency over the century. As a result, the productivity of major crops is threatened, with potential dire consequences for national food security and the income of millions. The emerging findings of the crop-modelling work using AquaCrop show a decrease/increase yield trends for millet, sorghum and cowpea of about 0 to -50 %, + 5 to -20 %, + 11 to + 18 %, respectively, by the end of the century (2060-80), depending on the agroclimatic zone, sowing date and RCP. Overall, the emerging findings of this work can be used to inform agricultural trans-formation and adaptation to climate change by promoting a higher resilience against both excess of water (due to high rainfall events) and lack of water resources (due to extended dry periods).","[Alvar-Beltran, Jorge; Dibari, Camilla; Ferrise, Roberto; Bartoloni, Niccolo; Dalla Marta, Anna] Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry DAGRI, I-50144 Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Alvar-Beltran, J (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry DAGRI, I-50144 Florence, Italy.",jorge.alvar@unifi.it,,,,,,,63,0,0,6,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1161-0301,1873-7331,,EUR J AGRON,Eur.

At the neighbourhood scale, context-related aspects heavily influence the internal quality and real usability of the buildings themselves, with particular reference to factors such as the quality of the site, the relationship between the building and the context, the presence and quality of the greenery and open spaces surrounding the building, as well as all measures that make it possible to reduce the building's impact on the environment, to protect it against environmental pollution, and to manage the building in an integrated manner for maintenance purposes. Creating healthy living environments means referring to the different dimensions mentioned above, and this not only requires the attention of Public Health operators, but also implies an integration of vision and objectives among various professional skills and competences that puts health at the center of all policies.

Out of the 12 selected CSAP for the assessment of adoption and evaluation, seven (7) were used by more than 50% of those who knew them. Farmers agreed with the statements that the evaluated practices improved farm productivity and adaptation to climate change but did not mitigate climate change. Ethnic group and education level were the two major factors that significantly determined the use of the evaluated CSAP.","[Moutouama, Fidele T.; Tepa-Yotto, Ghislain T.; Agboton, Cyriaque; Gbaguidi, Brice; Tamo, Manuele] Int Inst Trop Agr IITA Benin, Biorisk Management Facil BIMAF, 08 BP 0932 Tri Postal, Cotonou 01000, Benin; [Tepa-Yotto, Ghislain T.] Univ Natl Agr, Ecole Gest & Prod Vegetale & Semenciere EGPVS, Ketou 43, Benin; [Sekabira, Haruna] Int Inst Trop Agr IITA Uganda, Kampala 28565, Uganda",,"Moutouama, FT (corresponding author), Int Inst Trop Agr IITA Benin, Biorisk Management Facil BIMAF, 08 BP 0932 Tri Postal, Cotonou 01000, Benin.",fidelemoutouama@gmail.com; g.tepa-yotto@cgiar.org; c.agboton@cgiar.org; b.gbaguidi@cgiar.org; h.sekabira@cgiar.org; m.tamo@cgiar.org,"Tepa-Yotto, Ghislain/AAX-5617-2021","Tepa-Yotto, Ghislain/0000-0002-9650-8313; SEKABIRA, HARUNA/0000-0001-5675-7211",Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) project; International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank [P173398],Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) project; International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank,"This research was funded by Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) project.

The long-term consequences of climate change on these impacts are critical to watershed management. With coastal watersheds facing frequent hypoxic events and cultural eutrophication, the coupled influence of land use and climate change can lead to policies under nonstationarity assumptions. This study aims to model a regional coastal watershed system using a dynamic simulation with future land use and climate stressors for watershed sustainability. The efficacy of current nutrient management efforts may be limited or undone if future changes in climate or land use increase nutrient and sediment loads to the Narragansett Bay. The baseline model was calibrated and validated to accurately reflect watershed processes to simulate water quantity and quality under the independent and combined influence of future climate and land scenarios. Results show significant effects of climate change and land-use change on the watershed, with demonstrated impacts on sediment loading, organic N, organic P, and nitrates. Climate impacts were much more significant than land-use effects, but land-use impacts displayed greater regional variation. The results from combined simulations indicate that future climate and land-use change will likely negatively impact the coastal system and need restoration efforts that consider nonstationarity. However, the results also highlight the potential to utilize land use to mitigate and adapt to climate change impacts. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The QTP is called the the third pole, exerting remarkable impact on environmental changes in its surrounding regions. While few reports are available for addressing multi-hazard risks over the QTP, we develop an integrated indicator system involving multiple meteorological hazards, i.e., droughts, rainstorms, snowstorms and hailstorms, investigating the spatiotemporal patterns of major hazards over the QTP. The hazard zones of droughts and rainstorms are identified in the southern Gangdise Mountains, the South Tibet Valley, the eastern Nyenchen-Tanglha Mountains, the Hengduan Mountains and West Sichuan Basin. Snowstorm hazard zones distribute in the Himalayas, the Bayan Har Mountains and the central Nyenchen-Tanglha Mountains, while hailstorm hazard zones cluster in central part of the QTP. Since the 21st century, intensified rainstorms are detectable in the densely populated cities of Xining and Lhasa and their adjacent areas, while amplified droughts are observed in grain production areas of the South Tibet Valley and the Hengduan Mountains. Snowstorm hazards show large interannual variations and an increase in pastoral areas, although the overall trend is declining slightly. The frequency of hailstorms gradually decreases in human settlements due to thermal and landscape effects. Mapping meteorological hazards regionalization could help to understand climate risks in the QTP, and provide scientific reference for human adaptation to climate changes in highly sensitive areas.","[Sun, Shao] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Lab Climate Studies, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiang; Yuan, Ruyue] Beijing Normal Univ, Key Lab Environm Change & Nat Disasters, Minist Educ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiang; Yuan, Ruyue] Beijing Normal Univ, Acad Disaster Reduct & Emergency Management, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiang] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yuanxin] Sichuan Climate Ctr, Key Lab Drought Flood Disasters Plateau & Basin S, Chengdu 610072, Peoples R China",China Meteorological Administration; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University,"Zhang, Q (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Key Lab Environm Change & Nat Disasters, Minist Educ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Zhang, Q (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Acad Disaster Reduct & Emergency Management, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Zhang, Q (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",sunshao@cma.gov.cn; zhangq68@bnu.edu.cn; xuyuanxin0710@gmail.com; yuanry@mail.bnu.edu.cn,,"SUN, Shao/0000-0003-3411-5466","China National Key RD Program [2019YFA0606904, 2018YFC1509003]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41701103, 41771536]; Major Research and Development Program of China Railway Group [P2018T006]; UK-China Cooperation on Climate Change Risk Assessment",China National Key RD Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Research and Development Program of China Railway Group; UK-China Cooperation on Climate Change Risk Assessment,"This research has been financially supported by the China National Key R&D Program (Grant No. 2019YFA0606904 and 2018YFC1509003), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41701103 and 41771536), the Major Research and Development Program of China Railway Group (P2018T006), and the UK-China Cooperation on Climate Change Risk Assessment.",,35,3,3,15,47,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2021,13,18,,,,,,,10402,10.3390/su131810402,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su131810402,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UZ2VW,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000702069000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It has been argued that climate change may contribute to the severity of the issue; hence impact assessment is being replaced by adaptation, which explores more adapting scenarios and approaches. This study explores the adaptability of the proposed cyclic and non-cyclic conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water resources in increasing groundwater sustainability while increasing the sustainability of water allocation to the agricultural sector under possible climate change scenarios. To simulate climate change in the study area, precipitation and temperature variables are extracted from the results of three global atmospheric circulation models (Ensemble, CMCC-CMS, MRI-CGCM3) under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 greenhouse gas emission scenarios in the period of 2021-2031. Spatial downscaling is performed using the M5 decision tree algorithm. The Wavelet-M5 hybrid model is used to predict runoff values as a rainfall-runoff model. Also, the Kharrufa method is applied to calculate evaporation in the future seasons. The system's adaptability to climate change is examined using the multi-objective cyclic and non-cyclic conjunctive use of surface and groundwater models. The study reveals that cyclic operation strategy improves the conjunctive use system adaptability compared to the optimal operation strategy that employs the non-cyclic approach. In this study's case study, the improvement in groundwater sustainability index exceeds 27 percent over the non-cyclic conjunctive use strategy.","[Afshar, Abbas; Khosravi, Mina; Molajou, Amir] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Tehran, Iran",Iran University Science & Technology,"Afshar, A (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Tehran, Iran.",a_afshar@iust.ac.ir,"Afshar, Abbas/T-7164-2018; Khosravi, Mina/ABB-8463-2021; Molajou, Amir/AAI-5690-2021","Afshar, Abbas/0000-0001-8891-3426; Molajou, Amir/0000-0002-2161-4146",Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) [96010175],Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)(Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)),Authors appreciate Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) for their partial support through grant number 96010175.,,42,12,12,3,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

Several studies found that tropical storms are becoming an important cause of Natechs. Understanding whether and how climate change affects the incidence of tropical storms-related Natechs becomes a crucial issue for industrial risk management and adaptation to climate change. This study analyzed the temporal-spatial variation of tropical storms-related Natech incidence on the eastern side of the United States (US) from 1990 to 2017 based on the analysis of hazmat-release accidents reported to the US National Response Center. The results show that the frequency and density of tropical storms-related Natechs are on the rise. In order to explore the cause of such changes, this study investigates the relationships between the temporal-spatial variation of the incidence of tropical storms-related Natechs, and the accumulated cyclone energy, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and the Oceanic Nin tilde o Index (ONI), and other variables. The results suggest an indirect link between climate change and the temporal-spatial variation of the incidence of related Natechs due to its effect on tropical storm activity. The presented evidence suggests that, when developing Natech risk management plans, the potential effects of climate change should be considered. Not only facilities' owners/ operators, but government, first responders and other stakeholders should consider how climate change will affect the Natech risk landscape, and implement more effective regulations to manage Natech risk in wider areas.","[Luo, Xiaolong] Sichuan Univ, Inst Disaster Management & Reconstruct, Chengdu 610207, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Luo, Xiaolong; Tzioutzios, Dimitrios] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Urban Management, Kyoto 6158540, Japan; [Cruz, Ana Maria] Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst DPRI, Uji, Kyoto 6110011, Japan",Sichuan University; Kyoto University; Kyoto University,"Cruz, AM (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst DPRI, Uji, Kyoto 6110011, Japan.",cruznaranjo.anamaria.2u@kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Tzioutzios, Dimitrios/GLQ-6573-2022","Tzioutzios, Dimitrios/0000-0001-8557-8837; Luo, Xiaolong/0000-0002-8295-3598","Kaken [17K01336]; China Scholarship Council; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17K01336] Funding Source: KAKEN","Kaken(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was supported by the funding of Kaken Grant 17K01336, April 2017-March 2020 (JSPS) .

Correct perception is a prerequisite for farmers to adopt adaptation strategies, which plays a crucial guiding role in the development of adaptation plans and the improvement of the security of livelihoods. This study aimed to compare farmers' perceptions of temperature and precipitation change with meteorological data in two regions of the Tibetan Plateau, analyzed how irrigation affects farmers' perceptions. Data were obtained from local meteorological stations and household questionnaires (N = 1005). The study found that, since 1987, the climate warming trend was significant (p < 0.01), and the temperature increase was faster in winter. Precipitation had no significant change trend, but the seasonal variations indicated that the precipitation concentration period moved forward in the Pumqu River Basin and was delayed a month in the Yellow River-Huangshui River valley. The farmers' perception of temperature change was consistent with meteorological data, but there was an obvious difference in precipitation perception between the two regions. We noticed that irrigation facilities played a mediating role on precipitation perception and farmers having access to irrigation facilities were more likely to perceive increased precipitation. Finally, this study suggested that meteorological data and farmers' perceptions should be integrated when developing policies, rather than just considering actual climate trends. Simultaneously, while strengthening irrigation investment, the government should also pay attention to publicizing the consequences of climate change and improving farmers' abilities of risk perception.","[Wang, Tao; Yan, Jianzhong; Cheng, Xian] Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Yan, Jianzhong; Cheng, Xian] Southwest Univ, State Cultivat Base Ecoagr Southwest Mt Land, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Yu, Yi] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Southwest University - China; Southwest University - China; Australian National University,"Cheng, X (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.;Cheng, X (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, State Cultivat Base Ecoagr Southwest Mt Land, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.",wang157725@gmail.com; yanjz@swu.edu.cn; chengxian@swu.edu.cn; raymond.yy.nash13@gmail.com,"YU, Yi/HJP-6854-2023","Yu, Yi/0000-0002-1140-2713","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571093, 41761144081]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20040201]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [SWU119037]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This research work and APC was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 41571093, 41761144081; the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, grant number XDA20040201; and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, grant number SWU119037.",,47,4,4,9,53,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2020,12,19,,,,,,,8164,10.3390/su12198164,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12198164,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OO2GO,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000587202900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this research, urban ecological resilience, and especially, climate resilience, are considered. Urban green infrastructure has been shown to be effective in reducing the effects of climate change in cities and enhancing the climate resilience. One of the greatest impacts of climate change can be found in cities, and especially, in neighbourhoods. It is necessary to provide solutions in the neighbourhood scale for dealing with the climate change. This research attempts to answer the general question of: how to achieve a climate resilient neighbourhood, by studying and analyzing the existing urban green infrastructure. The overall objectives of this research include the investigation of the impact of quality, quantity and location of urban green infrastructure and their effect on climate resilience in neighbourhoods, finding and expanding the intervention principles, finding the strategies of adaptation to climate change in relation to green infrastructure and their impact on urban climate resilience and development of the 'climate' aspect of resilience through green infrastructure in the neighbourhood scale. A qualitative-quantitative method was used here on Yousef Abad neighbourhood of Tehran, in Iran.

Although Indigenous communities and their knowledge systems are recognized as critical resources for understanding and adapting to climate change, no comprehensive, evidence-based analysis has been conducted into how environmental studies engage Indigenous communities. Here we provide the first global systematic review of levels of Indigenous community participation and decision-making in all stages of the research process (initiation, design, implementation, analysis, dissemination) in climate field studies that access Indigenous knowledge. We develop indicators for assessing responsible community engagement in research practice and identify patterns in levels of Indigenous community engagement. We find that the vast majority of climate studies (87%) practice an extractive model in which outside researchers use Indigenous knowledge systems with minimal participation or decision-making authority from communities who hold them. Few studies report on outputs that directly serve Indigenous communities, ethical guidelines for research practice, or providing Indigenous community access to findings. Further, studies initiated with (in mutual agreement between outside researchers and Indigenous communities) and by Indigenous community members report significantly more indicators for responsible community engagement when accessing Indigenous knowledges than studies initiated by outside researchers alone. This global assessment provides an evidence base to inform our understanding of broader social impacts related to research design and concludes with a series of guiding questions and methods to support responsible research practice with Indigenous and local communities.","[David-Chavez, Dominique M.; Gavin, Michael C.] Colorado State Univ, Human Dimens Nat Resources, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Gavin, Michael C.] Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, Jena, Germany",Colorado State University,"David-Chavez, DM (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Human Dimens Nat Resources, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",dmari@rams.colostate.edu,,"Gavin, Michael/0000-0002-2169-4668",National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE-1321845]; Center for Collaborative Conservation Fellowship,National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Center for Collaborative Conservation Fellowship,"David-Chavez maintained primary responsibility for conceptual development, research design, data collection, data analyses and data interpretation.

Uncontrolled charcoal production, although a livelihood source for communities living in woodland areas of Kenya, leads to woodland degradation. We used Landsat imagery, field plot data and household interviews to describe land cover change and the role of charcoal production in woodland degradation. An unsupervised classification was used to determine land cover change from woodland to open/farmland, and five 16-km transects were used to investigate the extent of charcoal production in the target woodlands. Semi-structured interviews were conducted on 117 households to understand their perceptions on woodland cover change and the role of charcoal production. The overall accuracy of our classification was 86%. Woodland areas decreased by 24% between 1986 and 2014. The trend of woodland area change compared well between remote sensing and interview data. The density of kilns, a proxy for charcoal-led woodland degradation, varied across the sample plots. Despite charcoal providing a livelihood for 66% of the households, the community felt that their environment, wealth and social relations have been affected by land cover changes caused by charcoal production. Based on these results, we recommend that appropriate measures aimed at improving the productivity of agriculture, adapting to climate change and reducing dependence on charcoal for sustenance should be encouraged to mitigate woodland cover loss and degradation.

Drought is a complex stress, impacting on plant growth in a number of interacting ways. In response, there are a number of ways in which the growing plant is able to adapt to or alleviate these stresses. It is suggested that the most significant opportunity for progress in overcoming drought stress and increasing crop yields is to understand and exploit the conditions in soil by which plant roots are able to maximize their use of resources. This may not be straightforward, with multiple stresses, sometimes competing functions of roots, and conditions which impact upon roots very differently depending upon what soil, what depth or what stage of growth the root is at. Several processes and the interaction between these processes in soil have been neglected. It is our view that drought is not a single, simple stress and that agronomic practice which seeks to adapt to climate change must take account of the multiple facets of both the stress induced by insufficient water as well as other interacting stresses such as heat, disease, soil strength, low nutrient status, and even hypoxia. The potential for adaptation is probably large, however. The possible changes in stress as a result of the climate change expected under UK conditions are assessed and it appears possible that wet warm winters will impact on root growth as much if not more than dry warm summers.","[Whitmore, Andrew P.; Whalley, W.

Hence, the need for this study, which is aimed at understanding how rainfall may change in the future over the Sahel, Savannah, and coastal zones of the Volta River Basin (VRB). The trends and changes in rainfall between 2021-2050 and 1985-2014 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) scenarios were analyzed after evaluating the performance of three climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) using Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) as observation. The results show, in general, a relatively high correlation and low spatial biases for rainfall (r > 0.91, -20% < Pbias < 20%) over the entire Volta Basin for the models' ensemble mean. An increasing trend and projected increase in annual rainfall under the SSP2-4.5 scenario is 6.0% (Sahel), 7.3% (Savannah), and 2.6% (VRB), but a decrease of 1.1% in the coastal zone. Similarly, under SSP5-8.5, the annual rainfall is projected to increase by 32.5% (Sahel), +22.8% (Savannah), 23.0% (coastal), and 24.9% (VRB), with the increase being more pronounced under SSP5-8.5 compared to the SSP2-4.5 scenario.

Several factors contribute to the problem, e.g., an increase in winter precipitation, renovation of old leaky sewer pipes (previously acting as drain systems), and closure of groundwater abstraction for drinking water in urban areas in response to pollution. Four adaptation measures are compared with a detailed hydrological model for the town of Sunds, located in the western part of Denmark. Two 'grey', one 'green' and one 'blue' measure are evaluated. The grey solutions involve (1) installing drainage pipes (a third pipe) alongside the existing sewer pipes, and (2) lowering the water table by groundwater pumping from shallow wells, including storage of water in deeper aquifers for use in the drier summer; the green solution involves planting new forest in and around the town; and the blue solution is to establish a new ditch in the town. A climate model that projects more precipitation, especially in the winter, is used to evaluate the robustness of the different measures in a wetter climate for the northern European area. The hydrological modelling shows that the third pipe is the most effective climate-change adaptation of the four measures tested. The new ditch is an effective solution to lower the water table but with a more limited areal coverage.","[Rasmussen, Per; Kidmose, Jacob; Schneider, Raphael; Sonnenborg, Torben O.

However, setbacks in the soybean industry since 2017 demonstrated the impacts of climate risk and global market uncertainty. Therefore, a better understanding of future climate conditions that will impact soybean growth in Canada is needed for decision-making in the sector, such as prioritizing regions for expansion and developing climate change adaptation strategies through either agronomic management practices or breeding new cultivars. Based on climate projections from a set of global climate models, we analyzed climate conditions for growing soybeans, including growing season start, crop heat units, precipitation, precipitation deficits and climate extremes, in the near-term (2030s), the mid-term (2050s) and the distant future (2070s). We found that a future warmer climate with an increase of 1.6, 2.8 and 4.1 degrees C in the growing season (May-September) mean temperature averaged over Canada's land area in the near-term, mid-term and distant future under SSP3-7.0 would favour the expansion of soybean production further north and west. However, an increase of approximately 200 mm in precipitation deficits on the semiarid Canadian Prairies in the mid-term would constrain soybean production unless irrigation could be introduced. Heat-and drought-tolerant cultivars should be developed to adapt soybean production to a changing climate, in addition to the adoption of late-maturing cultivars that would benefit from the lengthened growing season and increased crop heat units.","[Qian, Budong; Smith, Ward; Jing, Qi; Grant, Brian] Agr & Agrifood Canada, Ottawa Res & Dev Ctr, Sci & Technol Branch, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada; [Kim, Yong Min] Agr & Agrifood Canada, Brandon Res & Dev Ctr, Sci & Technol Branch, MB, Brandon, MB R7A 5Y3, Canada; [Jego, Guillaume] Agr & Agrifood Canada, Quebec Res & Dev Ctr, Sci & Technol Branch, Quebec City, PQ G1V 2J3, Canada; [Duguid, Scott] Agr & Agrifood Canada, Morden Res & Dev Ctr, Sci & Technol Branch, Morden, MB R6M 1Y5, Canada; [Hester, Ken] Market & Ind Serv Branch, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C5, Canada; [Nelson, Alison] Agr & Agrifood Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Directors Off RDT Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3C 3G7, Canada",Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada,"Qian, BD (corresponding author), Agr & Agrifood Canada, Ottawa Res & Dev Ctr, Sci & Technol Branch, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada.",budong.qian@agr.gc.ca,,,Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada under the Interdepartmental Research Initiative in Agriculture [J-002303: ?],Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada under the Interdepartmental Research Initiative in Agriculture,Funding information This study was partly supported by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada under the Interdepartmental Research Initiative in Agriculture (Project J-002303: ?Sustainable crop production in Canada under climate change?) .

Recent attempts to quantify such impacts mainly focused on a basin or larger scale, or used limited time periods that largely ignore observations of long-term trends at a fine resolution, thereby affecting the recognition of climate change's effect on ecosystem services. Objectives This study conducts a detailed and spatially explicit recognition of climate change's effect on ecosystem services and provides an intuitive map for decision-making and climate change adaptation planning. Methods We used long-term time series of ecosystem service assessments and various future climate scenarios to quantify the sensitivity and future exposure of ecosystem services to climate change on the Tibetan Plateau. Results Carbon sequestration (CS) and habitat quality experience significant growth, while water retention did not show any trend. Sensitivity patterns of these ecosystem services vary largely. For CS, more than half of the pixels showed a positive sensitivity to climate change, even though the degree of sensitivity is not high. There is substantial spatial heterogeneity in the exposure of ecosystem services to future climate changes, and high levels of future climate change increase the intensity of exposure. Conclusions This study illustrates the complex spatial association between ecosystem services and climatic drivers, and these findings can help optimize local response strategies in the context of global warming. For example, the existing protected areas have notable conservation gaps for disturbance of future climate change on ecosystem services, especially in the southeastern part of the study area.","[Hua, Ting; Zhao, Wenwu] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Hua, Ting; Zhao, Wenwu] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Inst Land Surface Syst & Sustainable Dev, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Cherubini, Francesco; Hu, Xiangping] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Ind Ecol Programme, Trondheim, Norway; [Cherubini, Francesco; Hu, Xiangping] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, Trondheim, Norway; [Pereira, Paulo] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Environm Management Ctr, Ate G 20, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Mykolas Romeris University,"Zhao, WW (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",zhaoww@bnu.edu.cn,"华, 廷/CAF-4607-2022; , Wenwu Zhao/AFU-3731-2022; zhao, wenwu/L-7716-2018; Pereira, Paulo/O-1845-2016","zhao, wenwu/0000-0001-5342-354X; Pereira, Paulo/0000-0003-0227-2010; Hua, Ting/0000-0002-1605-9010",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41861134038]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program [2019QZKK0405]; Norwegian Research Council [286773]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program; Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41861134038), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (2019QZKK0405), Norwegian Research Council (No. 286773), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.",,109,19,20,60,168,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2973,1572-9761,,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

To prove this point, this paper focusses on irrigation as an adaptation option to climate change and highlights the fact that there is no such thing as irrigation. Instead, different farms consider water management options across a spectrum that ranges from purely rainfed farms to purely irrigated farms with in between the extreme practices such as supplemental irrigation, water conservation practices, and different irrigation techniques. Accounting for such differences is necessary, yet difficult due to a lack of farm-specific data on water management and irrigation. This paper uses unique Farm Accountancy Data Network data of Western European farmers on the proportion of farmland that each farm irrigates. Unlike previous work, this allows taking into account some within-irrigation heterogeneity instead of simply categorizing farms as being irrigated. We estimate and compare climate response models based on the Ricardian cross-sectional method for a large range of irrigation categories. The results give insights into how the farm irrigation climate response can be significantly different depending on how irrigation is defined. This proves that ignoring within-adaptation differences when comparing non-adaptation with adaptation (in this case, rainfed versus irrigated agriculture) might lead to biased conclusions with regard to effectiveness of adaptation strategies.

Every year hurricane (cyclone) hazards cause extensive economic losses and social disruption around the world. Annual hurricane damage in the United States (US) is around $6 billion in recent years. Hurricane intensity or/and frequency may change due to the increase in sea surface temperature as a result of climate change. Implications of the changing hazard patterns on hurricane risk assessment warrants an investigation to evaluate the potential impact of climate change. The framework includes probabilistic models of hurricane occurrence and intensity and conditional damage state probabilities (vulnerability model) for typical residential construction in the US, and an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of various climate change adaptation strategies. A case study of Miami-Dade County, Florida is presented to illustrate the framework under various scenarios of change in maximum annual wind speed over 50 years. Demographic information, such as median house value and changes in house numbers, and distribution of houses on different exposure, is used to estimate the time-dependent probable damage with or without possible climate change induced change in wind speed. This study shows that climate change may have a substantial impact on the damage and loss estimation in coastal areas, and that certain adaptation strategies can cost effectively decrease the damage, even if the wind speed does not change.

Quantifying the changes in the precipitation bioclimate is crucial in planning climate-change adaptation and mitigation measures. Southeast Asia (SEA), home to the world's greatest concentration of ecological variety, needs reliable monitoring of such changes. This study utilized the global-climate models from phase 6 of coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6) to examine the variations in eight precipitation bioclimatic variables over SEA for two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). All indicators were studied for the near (2020-2059) and far (2060-2099) futures to provide a better understanding of the temporal changes and their related uncertainty compared to a historical period (1975-2014). The results showed a high geographical variability of the changes in precipitation-bioclimatic indicators in SEA. The mainland of SEA would experience more changes in the bioclimate than the maritime region. The multimodel ensemble (MME) showed an increase in mean annual rainfall of 6.0-12.4% in most of SEA except the Philippines and southern SEA. The increase will be relatively less in the wettest month (15%) and more in the driest month (20.7%) in most of SEA; however, the precipitation in the wettest quarter would increase by 2.85%, while the driest quarter would decrease by 1.0%. The precipitation would be more seasonal. In addition, the precipitation would increase over a larger area in the wettest month than in the driest month, making precipitation vary more geographically.","[Sobh, Mohamed Tarek; Hamed, Mohammed Magdy] Arab Acad Sci Technol & Maritime Transport AASTMT, Coll Engn & Technol, Construct & Bldg Engn Dept, B 2401 Smart Village, Giza 12577, Egypt; [Hamed, Mohammed Magdy; Shahid, Shamsuddin] Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Fac Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Water & Environm Engn, Skudia 81310, Malaysia; [Nashwan, Mohamed Salem] Arab Acad Sci Technol & Maritime Transport AASTMT, Coll Engn & Technol, Construct & Bldg Engn Dept, Cairo 2033, Egypt","Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport","Nashwan, MS (corresponding author), Arab Acad Sci Technol & Maritime Transport AASTMT, Coll Engn & Technol, Construct & Bldg Engn Dept, Cairo 2033, Egypt.",m.salem@aast.edu,"Hamed, Mohammed Magdy/AAW-7463-2021; SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/B-5185-2010; Nashwan, Mohamed Salem/J-6843-2018","Hamed, Mohammed Magdy/0000-0002-2939-5443; SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/0000-0001-9621-6452; Nashwan, Mohamed Salem/0000-0003-4007-5878; sobh, Mohamed/0000-0002-9675-6499",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) [09G07],Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM),Authors are grateful to Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) for providing financial support to conduct this research through the UTM High Impact Research Grant No. 09G07.,,49,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2022,14,20,,,,,,,13596,10.3390/su142013596,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142013596,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,5Q0PF,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000873541900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the government and development partners have paid little attention to the governance challenges which limit the contributions of community-managed forests to food security and livelihoods. Also lacking is a synthesis of evidence relating to the requirements for improved governance to support the efforts of decision makers and practitioners. This paper attempts to review and synthesize the available evidence with the aim of identifying the requirements to achieve improved governance in community-managed forests. The results revealed that failure to devise benefit-sharing mechanisms which consider the heterogeneity of rural communities was prevalent. Interference of local authorities and elite capture in decision-making processes of forest and landscape restoration also compromised the willingness of rural communities to engage in collective action. Requirements such as the identification of the needs of specific categories of communities and enabling of the negotiation of diverse interests in the design and implementation of interventions could improve the governance of community-managed forests. Developing management plans and business model scenarios which balance the ecological and socio-economic goals at a local level in collaboration with rural communities is important to improve the governance of community-managed forests. There is also a need to revisit the practice of evaluating the performance of community-managed forests almost exclusively based on the goals of climate change adaptation and mitigation and biodiversity conservation.","[Yami, Mastewal] POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Mekuria, Wolde] Int Water Management Inst IWMI, East Africa & Nile Basin Off, POB 5689, Addis Ababa 5689, Ethiopia",CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI),"Yami, M (corresponding author), POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",mastewalyami@yahoo.com; w.bori@cgiar.org,,"Yami, Mastewal/0000-0001-9750-5571",,,,,133,2,2,4,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2022,14,3,,,,,,,1478,10.3390/su14031478,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14031478,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YZ6RW,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000755602700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Considering the challenges that the South Alborz Region, Iran is currently facing in supplying water for various consumers; in this study, the climate change adaptation scenarios are investigated for sustainable water supply and demand. This study uses a procedure in which five different adaptation approaches, under RCPs scenarios, were established using the WEAP model to assess the impacts of various adaptation strategies on increasing the balance between water supply and demand over current and 2020s accounts. The findings suggest an imbalance between supply and demand in the current situation with the greatest imbalance in domestic use while the minimum in the industrial sector. The results of assessing adaptive scenarios show that various scenarios have different effects on balancing the water supply and demand by different consumers; on the other hand, the scenarios that directly affect domestic water demand have the greatest effect on minimizing the gap between supply and demand in the region; therefore, the options for decreasing the population demand along with diminishing the losses in the domestic water distribution network are the most effective alternatives for balancing supply and demand under all of the climate scenarios. The findings of this research indicate that adaptive management with the focus on restricting demand helps actively management of water resources in the regions with scarce water resources.","[Mirdashtvan, Mahsa; Najafinejad, Ali; Sa'doddin, Amir] Gorgan Univ Agr Sci & Nat Resources, Dept Watershed Management Engn, Gorgan, Golestan, Iran; [Malekian, Arash] Univ Tehran, Dept Rehabil Arid & Mt Areas, Karaj, Iran",University of Tehran,"Mirdashtvan, M (corresponding author), Gorgan Univ Agr Sci & Nat Resources, Dept Watershed Management Engn, Gorgan, Golestan, Iran.",mirdashtevan@ut.ac.ir,,,,,,,37,20,21,7,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

The methodology follows two steps. First, we econometrically estimate the marginal product of key production inputs (e.g., labor and land), through the estimation of production functions. Then, we predict future agricultural sector performance, by assuming a future with climate-induced changes in the land use and in agricultural labor use, under different IPCC scenarios. We also assume that no dramatic technological change in agriculture production will occur in the near future, so that the selected inputs will present the same marginal product. We assume that the agricultural sector might develop differently under different climate change-induced scenarios and that the use of land and labor will change accordingly. In this way, we are able to compute predictions on the agricultural sector performance in the future, under very different circumstances. We apply the methodology for predicting the sector performance of the Veneto region in 2030. Results differ according to the selected IPCC scenario and consequent input use variations. In the selected case study, for instance, land presents a very high productivity and climate-induced changes in the land use might dramatically (positively and negatively) affect agricultural yields under different IPCC scenarios. In this perspective, the climate change adaptation and mitigation policies and options should primarily aim at the preservation of land productivity in Veneto.","[Onofri, Laura; Bianchin, Federica; Boatto, Vasco] Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry, Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Onofri, L (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry, Padua, Italy.",laura.onofri@unipd.it,,,,,,,21,5,5,2,5,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2193-7532,,AGR FOOD ECON,Agric.

The divergence between these governments has widened in the past century, mostly due to a series of institutional changes that generated different socioeconomic and demographic trajectories. Due to its high latitude and altitude, the Plateau has been highly sensitive to the rapid changes in global and regional climates that have altered the spatial and temporal distributions of energy and water. Based on a recent workshop to synthesize findings on the sustainability of the Plateau amidst socioeconomic and environmental change, we identify five critical issues facing the social-ecological systems (SES): (1) divergent and uncertain changes in social and ecological characteristics; (2) declining prevalence of nomadism; (3) consequences of rapid urbanization in transitional economies; (4) the unsustainability of large-scale afforestation efforts in the semi-arid and arid areas of Inner Mongolia; and (5) the role of institutional changes in shaping the SES on the Plateau. We emphasize that lessons learned in Inner Mongolia are valuable, but may not always apply to Mongolia. National land management policies and regulations have long-term effects on the sustainability of SES; climate change adaptation policies and practices must be tuned to local conditions and should be central to decision-making on natural resource management and socioeconomic development pathways.","[Chen, Jiquan;

These concepts are becoming ever more central to the resilience debate. They aggregate elements of climate change adaptation, critical infrastructure protection, and societal resilience in the face of complex, high-impact events. However, despite the potential of these concepts to link together diverse disciplines, scholars and practitioners need to avoid treating them in a superficial or ambiguous manner. Overlapping uses and definitions could generate confusion and lead to the duplication of research effort. This article gives an overview of the state of the art regarding compound, interconnected, interacting, and cascading risks. It is intended to help build a coherent basis for the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR). The main objective is to propose a holistic framework that highlights the complementarities of the four kinds of complex risk in a manner that is designed to support the work of researchers and policymakers. This article suggests how compound, interconnected, interacting, and cascading risks could be used, with little or no redundancy, as inputs to new analyses and decisional tools designed to support the implementation of the SFDRR. The findings can be used to improve policy recommendations and support tools for emergency and crisis management, such as scenario building and impact trees, thus contributing to the achievement of a system-wide approach to resilience.","[Pescaroli, Gianluca; Alexander, David] UCL, Inst Risk & Disaster Reduct, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Pescaroli, G (corresponding author), UCL, Inst Risk & Disaster Reduct, London WC1E 6BT, England.",gianluca.pescaroli@gmail.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Pescaroli, Gianluca/0000-0003-3468-2970",European Commission [607579],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"This work has been carried out under the aegis of the EC FP7 FORTRESS project.

However, in contrast to the model robustness of simulated extremes at the global scale, the robustness in simulating past and future extremes often diminishes over finer spatial scales. In this study we analyze heat waves simulated by state-of-the-art global climate models over the Australian region. For the first time we present results explicitly detailing the model spread in simulated heat wave trends and climatology for this region for the recent past (1958-2005). As expected, large intermodel spread is observed at the local to regional scale for both heat wave trends and climatology. By analyzing multiple initial condition runs from individual models, we show that model internal variability strongly influences the spatial patterns of heat wave trends, while intermodel differences in heat wave climatology appear more influenced by model uncertainty. From a model evaluation perspective, cluster analysis is shown to be useful in characterizing robust spatial features of heat waves simulated by the models. In contrast to the multimodel mean, where uncorrelated spatial features tend to be averaged out, cluster composites preserve these features. Since previous examinations have tended to focus on the multimodel mean the extent of model spread may have been overlooked. Further examination of the processes that lead to model differences and biases is needed.","[Gibson, Peter B.; Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Sarah E.; Alexander, Lisa V.] Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Gibson, Peter B.; Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Sarah E.; Alexander, Lisa V.] Univ New South Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Fischer, Erich M.] Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland",University of New South Wales Sydney; ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Gibson, PB (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Gibson, PB (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",peter.gibson@unsw.edu.au,"Alexander, Lisa V/A-8477-2011; Fischer, Erich/B-6067-2011; Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Sarah E/O-5042-2015","Alexander, Lisa V/0000-0002-5635-2457; Fischer, Erich/0000-0003-1931-6737; Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Sarah E/0000-0001-9443-4915; Gibson, Peter/0000-0003-2095-5165",Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science [CE110001028]; Australian postgraduate Award; ARC [DE140100952]; Australian Research Council [DE140100952] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science(Australian Research Council); Australian postgraduate Award(Australian Government); ARC(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We thank the NCI National Facility at the Australian National University for providing data storage and computational facilities.

Hydrological impact signals from earlier Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3)-based assessments, however, are highly uncertain and largely ignore hydrological extremes. This paper provides one of the first hydrological impact assessments using the CMIP5 climate projections. Furthermore, we model and analyse changes in river flow regimes and hydrological extremes (i.e. high-flow and low-flow conditions). In general, the Mekong's hydrological cycle intensifies under future climate change. The scenario's ensemble mean shows increases in both seasonal and annual river discharges (annual change between +5 and +16 %, depending on location). Despite the overall increasing trend, the individual scenarios show differences in the magnitude of discharge changes and, to a lesser extent, contrasting directional changes. The scenario's ensemble, however, shows reduced uncertainties in climate projection and hydrological impacts compared to earlier CMIP3-based assessments. We further found that extremely high-flow events increase in both magnitude and frequency. Extremely low flows, on the other hand, are projected to occur less often under climate change. Higher low flows can help reducing dry season water shortage and controlling salinization in the downstream Mekong Delta. However, higher and more frequent peak discharges will exacerbate flood risks in the basin. Climate-change-induced hydrological changes will have important implications for safety, economic development, and ecosystem dynamics and thus require special attention in climate change adaptation and water management.","[Hoang, Long Phi; van Vliet, Michelle T.

There are a variety of adaptation strategies producers can use to enhance their resilience to the changing climate. The theory of planned behavior is applied as a framework to compare the adaptation intentions and choices of producers in Cariboo and Okanagan regions of the province of British Columbia (BC), Canada, and Baoji and Xi'an city prefectures of Shaanxi (SX) province, China. In BC, producers are more likely to explore the use of new crop varieties, and BC producers also seem to have a stronger intention to invest in irrigation efficiency. In contrast, producers in SX are far more likely to use online marketing methods to connect directly with consumers. Based on transcripts from a set of focus groups, community meetings, and interviews, differences in attitudes, social norms, and perceived behavioral control between SX and BC producers are identified that may contribute to their different adaptation choices. Multiple barriers to adaptation existed in both areas. Limited technical knowledge and doubts about adaptation effectiveness were more serious in BC, while limited support from local government and normative expectations were notable in SX. Education, targeted research, and public investments in irrigation and marketing may contribute to addressing some of these differences, improving the resilience of agricultural climate adaptation in both provinces.","[Mu, Lan] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Northwest Inst Hist Environm & Socio Econ Dev, 620 West Changan Ave, Xian 710119, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Janmaat, Johannus; Taylor, Joanne; Arnold, Lauren] Univ British Columbia, Irving K Barber Fac Arts & Social Sci, 1147 Res Rd, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada",Shaanxi Normal University; University of British Columbia,"Janmaat, J (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Irving K Barber Fac Arts & Social Sci, 1147 Res Rd, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",john.janmaat@ubc.ca,,"Janmaat, Johannus/0000-0001-8099-2756",National Natural Science Foundation of China [42001221]; Shaanxi Provincial Innovation Capability Support Program [2022KRM067]; Central University of China [GK202103119]; Shaanxi Normal University [18QNGG011]; National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFD1100901]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shaanxi Provincial Innovation Capability Support Program; Central University of China; Shaanxi Normal University; National Key R&D Program of China; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),National Natural Science Foundation of China (42001221); Shaanxi Provincial Innovation Capability Support Program (2022KRM067); Central University of China (GK202103119); Shaanxi Normal University (18QNGG011); National Key R & D Program of China (2019YFD1100901); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.,,59,0,0,5,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Techniques based on landscape planning to alleviate the increasing frequency of extreme climate are becoming more of a focus in urban ecology studies. In this paper, we proposed and defined the urban cooling island (UCI) extent, intensity, and efficiency, as well as the threshold value of efficiency (TVoE) introduced from the law of diminishing marginal utility for the first time. The radiative transfer equation has been compared with other algorithms and used to retrieve accurate land surface temperature (LST) in a subtropical city of China Fuzhou. Two important and arguable factor size and shape of greenspaces also been expressed and explored. The results indicate that: (1) larger-sized greenspaces produce a higher cooling effect. However, there exist a TVoE, which is in line with our hypothesis. The TVoE in Fuzhou is 4.55 ha. (2) The circles and squares greenspaces have a significant correlation with LST and also show the highest UCI intensity and efficiency. (3) 92% of the maximum extent of greenspaces are within the 30-180 m limit, and the mean UCI extent and intensity are 104 m and 1.78 C. (4) The greenspaces connected with waterbodies intensified the UCI effects, whereas the grassland-based greenspace shows the weakest UCI effects.

The data of the geographic information system of agrarian data along with semi-structured surveys and visits to managers of UA initiatives in the city, the city's participatory processes and other factors that can contribute to its promotion were analysed. The results show a drastic decrease in the horticultural function in Palencia. The contribution of the UA to face the challenges of the city of Palencia can be based on: the AU is an innovative solution with the capacity to contribute to mitigating the effects of climate change; allows a healthy leisure offer to an aging population; it can contribute to creating a culture favourable to organic, local and local food; allows innovative forms of social action, favouring the integration of different groups (retired, disabled, young people, people at risk of social exclusion...) and contributes to promoting the low-carbon city model, helping to create more resilient cities in adapting to climate change. The UA currently has, therefore, multiple functions. Participatory processes around the challenges of the city and the food system can be a good starting point for its development. Also, managers in charge are needed, a detailed analysis of the possible reusable land, transfer of agricultural land and greater support and regulation of the activity that allows the development of urban models of agriculture with a multitude of functions: social, occupational, leisure, participatory, productive (favouring close access to healthy food), providing safe outdoor spaces and fulfilling a function of natural self-regulation of ecosystems.","[Sualdea, Ana Maria Bartolome; de Meneses, Beatriz Urbano Lopez] Univ Valladolid, Dept Ingn Agr & Forestal, Ave Madrid 50, Palencia 34004, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid,"Sualdea, AMB (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Dept Ingn Agr & Forestal, Ave Madrid 50, Palencia 34004, Spain.",anabartolomesu@gmail.com; beatriz.urbano@uva.es,,,,,,,31,0,0,1,1,"MINISTERIO AGRICULTURA PESCA & ALIMENTACION, SECRETARIA GENERAL TECNICA",MADRID,"CENTRO PUBLICACIONES, PASEO INFANTA ISABEL 1, MADRID, 28071, SPAIN",1575-1198,,,REV ESP ESTUD AGROSO,Rev.

High yielding rice varieties adapted to climatic changes is a key breeding objective. However, little is known regarding the impact of climate change on the yield potentials and resource utilization efficiencies of modern rice cultivars in Eastern China. Using two-year field experiment, we investigated the biomass, nitrogen (N) uptake, and yield in relation to climatic resource use efficiencies of eight representative Chinese mid-season indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars grown in the Middle Lower Yangtze Area over the last fifty years. The yield potential of rice from 1961-2015 was simulated using the ORYZA (v3) model. The total thermal time (growing degree days) increased at a rate of 3.3 degrees C yr(-1), while sunshine hours decreased at a rate of 2.4 h yr(-1) over the past five decades during growth period. Compared with the average potential yield from 1961 to 1975, an average 5.65 % of reduction occurred across different cultivars from 2001 to 2015. However, the rice potential yield increased by 52.0 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in the released cultivars with increasing years of release. The use efficiencies of sunshine hours and thermal time for the cultivar Yangliangyou6 released in 2001 increased by 68.5 % and 59.5 % compared with the cultivar Shenglixian released in 1938. The increase of potential yield in the released cultivar Yangliangyou6 was attributed to increase utilization efficiency of radiation. Modern cultivars (semi-dwarf and super rice) maintained greater leaf area index (LAI) during the filling period without modification in photosynthetic rate. Besides, the decrease in grain N concentration contributed to stay-green characteristic and to the efficient use of N in modern cultivars. Thus, modern indica rice cultivars tolerate the adverse climatic changes by optimizing plant productivity and increasing resource utilization efficiencies.","[Zhang, Yikai; Zhu, Dan; Zhang, Yuping; Xiang, Jing; Wang, Yaliang; Zhu, Defeng; Wang, Lei; Chen, Huizhe] China Natl Rice Res Inst, State Key Lab Rice Biol, Hangzhou 310006, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; China National Rice Research Institute, CAAS","Chen, HZ (corresponding author), China Natl Rice Res Inst, State Key Lab Rice Biol, Hangzhou 310006, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",chenhuizhe@163.com,,"zhang, yikai/0000-0002-6520-7200","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31701374]; National Key Research and Development Plan of China [2016YFD0300502, 2016YFD0200801]; Special Funds for the Construction of Modern Agricultural Technology System [CARS-01-22]; Basic Research Foundation of National Commonweal Research Institute [2017RG004-4]; Key Research and Development Plan of Zhejiang Province [2019CO2017]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Plan of China; Special Funds for the Construction of Modern Agricultural Technology System; Basic Research Foundation of National Commonweal Research Institute; Key Research and Development Plan of Zhejiang Province,"We are grateful to Prof. Zhijuan Liu for the valuable suggestions on data analysis.

Nevertheless, the temporal consistency of the climate-war correlation in Europe over extended period has rarely been examined systematically. In this study, we extended the European violent conflict record in the Conflict Catalog [Brecke 1999. Violent conflicts 1400 A.D. to the present in different regions of the world. Paper presented at the 1999 Meeting of the Peace Science Society (International), Ann Arbor, MI, 8-10 October 1999] back to the year AD900, and examined quantitatively the climate-war consistency in Europe in AD900-1999. The period covers the Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age, and twentieth-century warming. Grounded on a total number of 2309 recorded violent conflicts in Europe over the last 1100 years, our statistical results were: (1) the negative temperature-war correlation was significant in terms of multi-decadal cycles; (2) in the second half of the period (AD1450-1999): the climate-war relationship was more apparent during longer cycles; a large spatial extent of slight cooling was more pertinent than a small spatial extent of severe cooling in affecting social stability in Europe; and the overall temperature-war correlation was stronger; and (3) the climate-war association was temporarily distorted when population pressure was drastically reduced. The association became significant again once the population system pushed against its Malthusian constraints. In sum, the climate-war association in Europe was statistically significant at the multi-decadal timescale. Yet, its strength varied across different periods and was contingent upon population pressure during the time. The findings in this study may provide some hints in assessing the effectiveness of human adaptations to climate change in the long-term.","[Lee, Harry F.] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, David D.] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Brecke, Peter] Georgia Inst Technol, Sam Nunn Sch Int Affairs, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Pei, Qing] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Social Sci, Tai Po, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong; Guangzhou University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK),"Lee, HF (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",harrylee@cuhk.edu.hk,"Lee, Harry F./M-9979-2019","Lee, Harry F./0000-0001-5415-7845; Pei, Qing/0000-0002-9699-2950",Research Grants Council of The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China [17610715],Research Grants Council of The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),"This research was supported by the Research Grants Council of The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China (17610715).

Owing to the direct influence of climate change on the lives and means of livelihood of marine fishing communities, effective adaptation methods are required to ensure the well-being of coastal communities. Thus, the goal of this study is to examine the various factors that impact the adaptation behaviour of marine fishermen towards climate change. To this end, data were collected from 312 Bangladeshi fishermen using survey questionnaires and subsequently analysed by employing partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Our findings reveal a significant and positive association between all components (perceived severity, perceived benefit and perceived barrier) of the Health Belief Model (HBM) and marine fishermen's adaptation behaviour. However, the perceived susceptibility component of the HBM had no effect on the climate change adaption behaviour of marine fishermen. Likewise, the findings indicate that awareness influences attitude, which in turn impacts the adaption behaviour of marine fishermen. Furthermore, the study results establish the indirect mediating role of awareness and attitude with respect to the adaptation behaviour of marine fishers. The findings of this study can be adopted by policymakers to develop adaptation strategies to aid marine fishermen in adapting to climatic effects. Furthermore, the various responses of marine fishermen to climate change will also serve as a useful source of information for the government. In summary, the information generated from this research can serve as a practical basis to foster adaptation behaviour among marine fishers and advance adaptation policies at the national level, not only in Bangladesh but also for other coastal communities that are at risk as a result of climate change.","[Begum, Mahfuza; Alam, Lubna; Bin Mokhtar, Mazlin; Amir, Ahmad Aldrie] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Environm & Dev LESTARI, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Begum, Mahfuza; Alam, Lubna; Bin Mokhtar, Mazlin; Amir, Ahmad Aldrie] Natl Univ Malaysia, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Masud, Muhammad Mehedi] Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Dev Studies, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Alam, Lubna] Univ Airlangga, Fac Fisheries & Marine, Dept Aquaculture, Mulyorejo St, Surabaya 60115, Indonesia; [Bin Mokhtar, Mazlin] Sustainable Dev Solut Network SDSN Asia Off, Subang Jaya 47500, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Universiti Malaya; Airlangga University,"Alam, L (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Environm & Dev LESTARI, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.;Alam, L (corresponding author), Natl Univ Malaysia, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.;Alam, L (corresponding author), Univ Airlangga, Fac Fisheries & Marine, Dept Aquaculture, Mulyorejo St, Surabaya 60115, Indonesia.",lubna@ukm.edu.my,,"Masud, Mehedi/0000-0003-0476-4481","Bangabandhu Science and Technology Fellowship Trust, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh [GUP-2022-065, XX-2022-008]","Bangabandhu Science and Technology Fellowship Trust, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh","This manuscript is part of a PhD study supported by the Bangabandhu Science and Technology Fellowship Trust, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh.

Based on related research on ecological assets, we established a county-scale ecological asset accounting technology system by analyzing the temporal and spatial variations of county-level ecological assets in China from 1990 to 2018 and clarified the factors which caused the gains and losses of ecological assets. On these bases, optimization and promotion pathways were proposed. The results show that the number of counties dominated by farmland and forest ecological resources accounted for about 45% and 37% of the total counties, respectively. From 1990 to 2018, the quality of county-level ecological stock assets showed an increasing trend, while the water conservation volume decreased in nearly 70% of the counties. The number of counties with the gains (47%) and losses (37%) of ecological flow assets demonstrated spatial patterns which showed the same segmentation characteristics as the Hu Huanyong Line, that is, the counties in the vastness of northwest China experienced significant gains, while decreases were widespread in eastern and southern China. The change of ecological assets in more than 70% of the counties was driven by climate change and human activities. The average degree of impact of human activities driving the ecological asset gains in counties was about 80%, while that of climate change causing the ecological asset losses was about 60%. According to various ecological resource types, gain and loss status, and its driving factors, counties in China can be classified into five types: climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, ecological resources restoration, ecological resources protection, and ecological resources management. Our results indicate that differentiated optimization and promotion pathways can be adopted to achieve desired ecological asset gains.","[Li Jiahui; Huang Lin; Cao Wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li Jiahui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Huang, L (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",lijh.19s@igsnrr.ac.cn; huanglin@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,,,,,48,0,0,11,11,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1009-637X,1861-9568,,J GEOGR SCI,J.

Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the UHI effect. In this context, the implementation of Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) can partially reduce UHI intensity, promoting a resilient urban environment and contributing to climate change adaptation and mitigation. In order to achieve this result, there is a need to systematically integrate UGI into urban planning and legislation, but this process is subject to the availability of widely applicable, easily accessible and quantitative evidence. To offer a big picture of urban heat intensity and opportunities to mitigate high temperatures, we developed a model that reports the Ecosystem Service (ES) of microclimate regulation of UGI in 601 European cities. The model simulates the temperature difference between a baseline and a no-vegetation scenario, extrapolating the role of UGI in mitigating UHI in different urban contexts. Finally, a practical, quantitative indicator that can be applied by policymakers and city administrations has been elaborated, allowing to estimate the amount of urban vegetation that is needed to cool summer temperatures by a certain degree. UGI is found to cool European cities by 1.07 degrees C on average, and up to 2.9 degrees C, but in order to achieve a 1 degrees C drop in urban temperatures, a tree cover of at least 16% is required. The microclimate regulation ES is mostly dependent on the amount of vegetation inside a city and by transpiration and canopy evaporation. Furthermore, in almost 40% of the countries, more than half of the residing population does not benefit from the microclimate regulation service provided by urban vegetation. Widespread implementation of UGI, in particular in arid regions and cities with insufficient tree cover, is key to ensure healthy urban living conditions for citizens.","[Marando, Federica; Zulian, Grazia; Udias, Angel; Maes, Joachim] Joint Res Ctr JRC, European Commiss, Ispra, Italy; [Heris, Mehdi P.] Hunter Coll, Urban Policy & Planning, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Mentaschi, Lorenzo] Univ Bologna, Dept Phys & Astron Augusto Righi DIFA, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; [Chrysoulakis, Nektarios; Parastatidis, David] Fdn Res & Technol Hellas FORTH, Inst Appl & Computat Math, Remote Sensing Lab, Iraklion 70013, Greece",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY); University of Bologna,"Marando, F (corresponding author), Joint Res Ctr JRC, European Commiss, Ispra, Italy.",federica.marando@ec.europa.eu; mehdi.heris@hunter.cuny.edu; grazia.zulian@ec.europa.eu; angel.udias-moinelo@ec.europa.eu; lorenzo.mentaschi@unibo.it; zedd2@iacm.forth.gr; parastat@iacm.forth.gr; joachim.maes@ec.europa.eu,"Zulian, Grazia/HGC-7621-2022; Udias, Angel/H-3222-2011","Udias, Angel/0000-0003-1219-0465",,,,,73,33,33,99,158,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

This paper illustrates that a combination of non-stationary modelling approaches can be adopted to evaluate trends in EPEs under uncertainty. A large database of daily rainfall events from 281 sparsely distributed weather stations in Finland between 1961 and 2016 was analysed. Among the tested methods, Poisson distributions provided a powerful method to evaluate the impacts of multiple physical covariates, including temperature and atmospheric circulation patterns (ACPs), on the resulting trends. The analysis demonstrates that non-stationarity is statistically valid for the majority of observations, independently of their location in the country and the season of the year. However, subsampling can severely hinder the statistical validity of the trends, which can be easily confused with random noise and therefore complicate the decision-making processes regarding long-term planning. Scaling effects have a strong impact on the estimates of non-stationary parameters, as homogenizing the data in space and time reduces the statistical validity of the trends. Trends in EPE statistics (mean, 90 and 99% percentiles) and best-fitted Generalized Pareto parameters in the tails of the distributions appear to be stronger when approaching the Polar region (Lapland) than away from it, consistent with the Arctic amplification of climate change. ACPs are key covariates in physically explaining these trends. In particular, the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) can explain statistically significant increases in extreme precipitation in Lapland, Bothnian and South regions of Finland, particularly during summer and fall seasons.","[Pedretti, Daniele] Geol Survey Finland GTK, PO 96, Espoo, Finland; [Irannezhad, Masoud] Southern Univ Sci & Technol SUSTech, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Irannezhad, Masoud] Univ Oulu, Water Resources & Environm Engn Res Unit, Oulu, Finland",Geological Survey of Finland (GTK); Southern University of Science & Technology; University of Oulu,"Pedretti, D (corresponding author), Geol Survey Finland GTK, PO 96, Espoo, Finland.",daniele.pedretti@gtk.fi,,"Pedretti, Daniele/0000-0001-7677-3948; Irannezhad, Masoud/0000-0002-9634-5622",Suomen Kulttuurirahasto,Suomen Kulttuurirahasto(Finnish Cultural Foundation),Suomen Kulttuurirahasto,,63,4,4,5,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Green infrastructure practices such as rainwater harvesting (RWH), rain gardens, porous pavements, and green roofs are emerging as viable strategies for climate change adaptation. The modified framework includes 4 economic, 11 environmental, and 3 social indicators. Using 6 indicators from the framework, at least 1 from each dimension of sustainability, we demonstrate the methodology to analyzeRWHdesigns. Weuse life cycle assessment and life cycle cost assessment to calculate the sustainability indicators of 20 design configurations as Decision Management Objectives (DMOs). Five DMOs emerged as relatively more sustainable along the EE analysis Tradeoff Line, and we used Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), a widely applied statistical approach, to quantify the modified EE measures asDMOsustainability scores. We also addressed the subjectivity and sensitivity analysis requirements of sustainability analysis, and we evaluated the performance of 10 weighting schemes that included classical DEA, equal weights, National Institute of Standards and Technology's stakeholder panel, Eco-Indicator 99, Sustainable Society Foundation's Sustainable Society Index, and 5 derived schemes. We improved upon classical DEA by applying the weighting schemes to identify sustainability scores that ranged from 0.18 to 1.0, avoiding the nonuniqueness problem and revealing the least to most sustainable DMOs. Our methodology provides a more comprehensive view of water resource management and is generally applicable to GI and industrial, environmental, and engineered systems to explore the sustainability space of alternative design configurations.

Respiratory epidemics and air pollution (particulate matter <10 mm in aerodynamic diameter and O-3) were added singly and then jointly for a fully adjusted model. Percent changes in mortality were calculated for days of relatively extreme temperatures [cold (10-11C) for both cities and heat (35-36C) for Monterrey], compared to days at the overall mean temperature in each city (15C in Mexico City, 25C in Monterrey). In Mexico City, total mortality increased 12.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 10.5%, 14.5%] on cold days (fully adjusted). Among children, the adjusted association was similar [10.9% (95% CI: 5.4%, 16.7%)], but without control for pollution and epidemics, was nearly twice as large [19.7% (95% CI: 13.9%, 25.9)]. In Monterrey, the fully adjusted heat effect for all deaths was 18.7% (95% CI: 11.7%, 26.1%), a third lower than the unadjusted estimate; the heat effect was lower among children [5.5% (95% CI: -10.1%, 23.8%)]. Cold had a similar effect on all-age mortality as in Mexico City [11.7% (95% CI: 3.7%, 20.3%)]. Responses of the elderly differed little from all-ages responses in both cities. Associations between weather and health persisted even with control for air pollution and respiratory epidemics in two Mexican cities, but risk assessments and climate change adaptation programs are best informed by analyses that account for these potential confounders.","Univ Michigan, Dept Epidemiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA; Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Publ & Environm Hlth Res Unit, London WC1E 7HT, England; Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Exposure Epidemiol & Risk Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Inst Nacl Salud Publ, Cuernavaca 62508, Morelos, Mexico",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

However, many developing countries have realized that concepts that have been recommended as solutions to existing problems are not suitable in their contexts. This paper synthesizes a subset of literature on CSA in the context of small-scale agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa as it relates to the need for CSA, factors influencing CSA adoption, and the challenges involved in understanding and scaling up CSA. Findings from the literature reveal that age, farm size, the nature of farming, and access to extension services influence CSA adoption. Many investments in climate adaptation projects have found little success because of the sole focus on the technology-oriented approach whereby innovations are transferred to farmers whose understanding of the local farming circumstances are limited. Climate-smart agriculture faces the additional challenge of a questionable conceptual understanding among policymakers as well as financing bottlenecks. This paper argues that the prospects of CSA in small-scale agriculture rest on a thorough socio-economic analysis that recognizes the heterogeneity of the small farmer environment and the identification and harnessing of the capacities of farming households for its adoption and implementation.","[Abegunde, Victor O.; Sibanda, Melusi] Univ Zululand, Dept Agr, ZA-3886 Kwa Dlangezwa, South Africa; [Obi, Ajuruchukwu] Univ Ft Hare, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, ZA-5700 Alice, South Africa",University of Zululand; University of Fort Hare,"Sibanda, M (corresponding author), Univ Zululand, Dept Agr, ZA-3886 Kwa Dlangezwa, South Africa.",overcomers001.av@gmail.com; SibandaM@unizulu.ac.za; aobi@ufh.ac.za,"Obi, Ajuruchukwu/I-3620-2013","Obi, Ajuruchukwu/0000-0002-5545-8946",National Research Foundation of South Africa; World Academy of Science (NRF-TWAS) through the NRF-TWAS African Renaissance Doctoral Scholarship [UID 105460]; University of Zululand Research and Innovation O ffice,National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa); World Academy of Science (NRF-TWAS) through the NRF-TWAS African Renaissance Doctoral Scholarship; University of Zululand Research and Innovation O ffice,"The National Research Foundation of South Africa and The World Academy of Science (NRF-TWAS) through the NRF-TWAS African Renaissance Doctoral Scholarship (Grant UID 105460) and the University of Zululand Research and Innovation O ffice, were the primary sources of funding for this research.",,126,25,25,8,48,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,NOV,2019,7,11,,,,,,,132,10.3390/cli7110132,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli7110132,,,23,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,JU6XO,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000501817400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet cities face considerable constraints on this front. This paper aims to provide a better understanding of these constraints by analyzing the case of Rosario, in Argentina. The city has a strong coherent governance system, with a commitment to decentralization, transparency, accountability and participation. Its long tradition of urban planning has evolved to include a broad vision of urban challenges and responses, a commitment to environmental sustainability and a strategic plan that has involved multiple stakeholders. This paper describes the many measures implemented in Rosario over the last 18 years, which provide a solid foundation for more systematically addressing adaptation. It also describes the significant challenges faced by the city's administration, especially around funding, data and the challenge of responding to pressing and competing interests.","[Hardoy, Jorgelina] IIED Amer Latina, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",,"Hardoy, J (corresponding author), IIED Amer Latina, Carlos Melo 2698,C1602, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",jhardoy@iied-al.org.ar; regina.ruete@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,23,23,0,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,1746-0301,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

Policy tools can shape the type and extent of adaptation, and therefore, function either as barriers or enablers for reducing risk and vulnerability. Using data from a systematic review of academic literature on global adaptation responses to climate change (n = 1549 peer-reviewed articles), we categorize the types of policy tools used to shape climate adaptation. We apply qualitative and quantitative analyses to assess the contexts where particular tools are used, along with equity implications for groups targeted by the tools, and the tools' relationships with transformational adaptation indicators such as the depth, scope, and speed of adaptation. We find diverse types of tools documented across sectors and geographic regions. We also identify a mismatch between the tools that consider equity and those that yield more transformational adaptations. Direct regulations, plans, and capacity building are associated with higher depth and scope of adaptation (thus transformational adaptation), while economic instruments, information provisioning, and networks are not; the latter tools, however, are more likely to target marginalized groups in their design and implementation. We identify multiple research gaps, including a need to assess instrument mixes rather than single tools and to assess adaptations that result from policy implementation. Key policy insights Information-based approaches, networks, and economic instruments are the most frequently documented adaptation policy tools worldwide. Direct regulations, plans, and capacity building are associated with higher depth and scope of adaptation, and thus more transformational adaptation. Capacity building, economic instruments, networks, and information provisioning approaches are more likely to target specific marginalized groups and thus equity challenges. There are many regions and sectors where certain tools are not widely documented (e.g. regulations and plans in Africa and Asia), representing a key research gap.","[Ulibarri, Nicola] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Urban Planning & Publ Policy, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Ajibade, Idowu] Portland State Univ, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Galappaththi, Eranga K.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Joe, Elphin Tom] World Resources Inst, New Delhi, India; [Lesnikowski, Alexandra] Concordia Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Mach, Katharine J.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Mach, Katharine J.] Univ Miami, Leonard & Jayne Abess Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Policy, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Musah-Surugu, Justice Issah] United Nations Univ, Bonn, Germany; [Musah-Surugu, Justice Issah] Univ Ghana, Dept Publ Adm, Accra, Ghana; [Alverio, Gabriela Nagle] Duke Univ, Durham, NC USA; [Segnon, Alcade C.] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Bamako, Mali; [Segnon, Alcade C.] Univ Abomey Calavi, Cotonou, Benin; [Siders, A.

With coastal areas and habitats particularly susceptible to negative climate change effects, it is necessary to build resilience in these areas by devising coastal adaptation responses in collaboration with coastal communities. Policies and structures have also been put in place to create an enabling environment which facilitates community participation. However, the extent of community engagement and its current role in formulating and implementing coastal adaptation responses are unclear. This paper assesses the effectiveness of the enabling environment in encouraging community-led coastal adaptation solutions by identifying community and voluntary groups who are actively engaging with stakeholders at all levels of governance in key adaptation tasks. The findings reveal that the policies and structures for enhanced local participation in coastal adaptation responses are in place, but as only a small number of communities are actively engaging in coastal adaptation solutions, further progress in their implementation is needed.","[Lawlor, Paul] Technol Univ Dublin, Sch Transport Engn Environm & Planning, Dublin, Ireland",,"Lawlor, P (corresponding author), Technol Univ Dublin, Sch Transport Engn Environm & Planning, Dublin, Ireland.",,,,,,,,33,0,0,1,4,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",0001-8325,2449-9471,,ADMINSTRATION,Administration,DEC 1,2021,69,4,,,,,83,108,,10.2478/admin-2021-0029,http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/admin-2021-0029,,,26,Public Administration,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Public Administration,XY3NZ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000736884800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

We identify six challenges (1 an insufficient alignment of FES supply and demand, 2 lacking policy integration, 3 ambiguous and conflicting regulatory frameworks, 4 a lack of precise information on FES demand and provision, and innovations to align both, 5 an increasing pressure to adapt to climate change, and 6 a striking diversity constraining European level policy solutions) and three opportunities (1 increasingly heterogenous forest owner objectives potentially matching pluralistic societal demands, 2 diversifying forest enterprises levering innovations in regulating and cultural ecosystem services provision, and 3 the potential of forests to mitigate climate change). Subsequently, we introduce four distinct but complimentary policy pathways for European forest policy to better align forest ecosystem services provision and demand: 1 Better monitoring of FES supply and demand, 2 Enhanced policy integration, 3 Payments for ecosystem services, and 4 Bottom-up participation and learning among ecosystem services innovators. We conclude by emphasizing the momentum that the EU Green Deal unfolds for a future European forest policy to incentivise the provision of multiple forest ecosystem services.","[Winkel, Georg; Roitsch, Dennis; Roux, Jeanne-Lazya] Wageningen Univ, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lovric, Marko; Pulzl, Helga] European Forest Inst, Yliopistokatu 6B, Joensuu 80100, Finland; [Muys, Bart; Pipart, Nathalie; Parra, Constanza] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200 E,Box 2411, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Katila, Pia; Tyrvainen, Liisa] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Latokartanonkaari 9, Helsinki 00790, Finland; [Lundhede, Thomas; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Pulzl, Helga; Weiss, Gerhard] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, European Forest Inst Forest Policy Res Network, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Roitsch, Dennis; Roux, Jeanne-Lazya] European Forest Inst, Pl Vereinten Nationen 7, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Pecurul, Mireia; Prokofieva, Irina] Forest Sci & Technol Ctr Catalonia, Carretera St Llorenc,Km 2, Solsona 25280, Spain; [Pettenella, Davide] Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry TESAF, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy; [Plieninger, Tobias; Torralba, Mario] Univ Kassel, Fac Organ Agr Sci, Steinstr 19, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany; [Plieninger, Tobias; Torralba, Mario] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Wunder, Sven] European Forest Inst, Mediterranean Facil, St Antoni Maria Claret 167, Barcelona 08025, Spain; [Vacik, Harald] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Inst Silviculture, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Peter Jordanstr 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","Wageningen University & Research; KU Leuven; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Copenhagen; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Padua; Universitat Kassel; University of Gottingen; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Winkel, G (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",georg.winkel@wur.nl; marko.lovric@efi.int; bart.muys@kuleuven.be; pia.katila@luke.fi; thlu@ifro.ku.dk; mireia.pecurul@ctfc.cat; davide.pettenella@unipd.it; plieninger@uni-goettingen.de; irina.prokofieva@ctfc.cat; constanza.parra@kuleuven.be; helga.puelzl@efi.int; dennis.roitsch@efi.int; jeanne-lazya.roux@efi.int; bjt@ifro.ku.dk; liisa.tyrvainen@luke.fi; mario.torralba@uni-kassel.de; harald.vacik@boku.ac.at; gerhard.weiss@boku.ac.at; Sven.wunder@efi.int,"Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark J/K-8770-2014; Plieninger, Tobias/E-3861-2010; Torralba, Mario/HKV-7397-2023; Torralba, Mario/AFU-9676-2022; Katila, Pia/HCI-3316-2022","Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark J/0000-0002-3305-8343; Plieninger, Tobias/0000-0003-1478-2587; Torralba, Mario/0000-0001-9205-787X; Roux, Jeanne-Lazya/0000-0003-2184-5515; Puelzl, Helga/0000-0001-7920-5903","European Union [773702, 773324]; project NOBEL (Novel business models to sustainably supply forest ecosystem services) under the ERA-NET Co-fund ForestValue; European Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme [821242]",European Union(European Commission); project NOBEL (Novel business models to sustainably supply forest ecosystem services) under the ERA-NET Co-fund ForestValue; European Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme,"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 under Grant Agreement number 773702, SINCERE project (Spurring INnovations for forest eCosystem sERvices in Europe).

Modelling the national and global economic repercussions of 2017's Hurricane Harvey, we find a qualitative change in the global economic response in an increasingly warmer world. While the United States were able to balance regional production failures by the original 2017 hurricane, this option becomes less viable under future warming. In our simulations of over 7000 regional economic sectors with more than 1.8 million supply chain connections, the US are not able to offset the losses by use of national efforts with intensifying hurricanes under unabated warming. At a certain warming level other countries have to step in to supply the necessary goods for production, which gives US economic sectors a competitive disadvantage. In the highly localized mining and quarrying sector-which here also comprises the oil and gas production industry-this disadvantage emerges already with the original Hurricane Harvey and intensifies under warming. Eventually, also other regions reach their limit of what they can offset. While we chose the example of a specific hurricane impacting a specific region, the mechanism is likely applicable to other climate-related events in other regions and other sectors. It is thus likely that the regional economic sectors that are best adapted to climate change gain significant advantage over their competitors under future warming.","[Middelanis, Robin; Willner, Sven N.; Otto, Christian; Levermann, Anders] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Telegrafenberg A56, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Middelanis, Robin] Univ Potsdam, Dept Comp Sci, Bahn 2, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Levermann, Anders] Univ Potsdam, Inst Phys & Astron, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Levermann, Anders] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Potsdam; University of Potsdam; Columbia University,"Levermann, A (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Telegrafenberg A56, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.;Levermann, A (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Phys & Astron, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.;Levermann, A (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",anders.levermann@pik.potsdam.de,"Levermann, Anders/G-4666-2011; Middelanis, Robin/ABG-2592-2021","Levermann, Anders/0000-0003-4432-4704; Middelanis, Robin/0000-0001-8848-3745; Otto, Christian/0000-0001-5500-6774","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union project RECEIPT [820712]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LA1817C, 01LA1829A, 01LP1907A]",Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union project RECEIPT; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"We thank Michael Wehner and three anonymous reviewers for their very constructive and valuable feedback to this work.

Ongoing environmental transformations pose many challenges for spatial policy across the entire globe. The aim of this paper is to analyse the effects of climate change on urban spaces in Poland and to answer the question of whether planning practice promotes adaptation to climate change and, if so, to what extent. This paper uses a descriptive and comparative research methodology to interpret planning provisions used in selected local spatial development plans in terms of the arrangements that aim to prevent the negative consequences of climate change. The subject of the analysis is the content of general and detailed plans defined in the texts of the examined resolutions of applicable local plans in the Lower Silesia and Greater Poland voivodeships. This study assessed the validity of applying specific planning provisions. This interpretation was determined on the basis of a review of the current provisions in the Polish law, literature on the subject, as well as the author's own professional experience in the field of spatial planning. The quantitative and qualitative research results are summarized in a table and also examined and described in detail. Examples of planning records that were used in the analysis of local plans are cited and compared. Finally, the adaptation challenges posed to spatial planning in Poland at the local level (communal) based on the obtained quantitative data on the issues were studied.","[Andrzejewska, Anna Katarzyna] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Architecture, 27 Wybrzeze Wyspianskiego St, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Science & Technology,"Andrzejewska, AK (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Architecture, 27 Wybrzeze Wyspianskiego St, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland.",anna.andrzejewska@pwr.edu.pl,,"Andrzejewska, Anna/0000-0003-0503-8414",,,,,27,3,3,1,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,DEC,2021,11,12,,,,,,,596,10.3390/buildings11120596,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings11120596,,,18,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,XX0CC,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000735974400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The effects of global warming on the hydrology and water cycle in nature are very serious, and the quantitative recognition of these effects creates more readiness to deal with its consequences. In the present study, the 2006-2100 period is predicted based on the statistical downscaling model (SDSM). Finally, the effects of climate change on the hydrological conditions in the Darabad watershed are simulated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The SWAT model calibration is done based on the SUFI-2 algorithm, and the effective and optimal parameter is identified. The results of the study, while confirming the efficiency of both SDSM in climate simulations and SWAT in hydrological simulation, showed that the increase in precipitation and temperature is probably in future climate conditions for the 2010-2040 period. The surface flow and runoff at the watershed area during the observation period (1970-2010) is 0.29 m(3)/s, but this value for the predicted period with regard to climate change in the RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5 scenarios is equal to 0.43, 0.44, and 0.45 m(3)/s.

Low productivity, which characterises food production in many Africa countries, remains a major concern. Compounded by the effects of climate change and lack of technical expertise, recent reports suggest that the impacts of climate change on agriculture and food systems in African countries may have further-reaching consequences than previously anticipated. Thus, it has become imperative that African scientists and farmers adopt new technologies which facilitate their research and provide smart agricultural solutions to mitigating current and future climate change-related challenges. Advanced technologies have been developed across the globe to facilitate adaptation to climate change in the agriculture sector. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), synthetic biology, and genomic selection, among others, constitute examples of some of these technologies. In this work, emerging advanced technologies with the potential to effectively mitigate climate change in Africa are reviewed. The authors show how these technologies can be utilised to enhance knowledge discovery for increased production in a climate change-impacted environment. We conclude that the application of these technologies could empower African scientists to explore agricultural strategies more resilient to the effects of climate change. Additionally, we conclude that support for African scientists from the international community in various forms is necessary to help Africans avoid the full undesirable effects of climate change.","[Ribeiro, Priscilla] CSIR Crops Res Inst, Cereals Div, AK000-AK911, Kumasi, Ghana; [Rodriguez, Anyela Valentina Camargo] NIAB, John Bingham Lab, 93 Lawrence Weaver Rd, Cambridge CB3 0LE, England",,"Rodriguez, AVC (corresponding author), NIAB, John Bingham Lab, 93 Lawrence Weaver Rd, Cambridge CB3 0LE, England.",prisboat@yahoo.com; anyela.camargorodriguez@niab.com,,"Francisco Ribeiro, Priscilla/0000-0001-6395-0917",Cambridge-Africa ALBORADA fund,Cambridge-Africa ALBORADA fund,This project was supported by Cambridge-Africa ALBORADA fund.,,76,4,4,3,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2223-7747,,PLANTS-BASEL,Plants-Basel,MAR,2020,9,3,,,,,,,381,10.3390/plants9030381,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants9030381,,,14,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,LC4SV,32204576,"Green Accepted, gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000525315000090,View Full Record in Web of Science

Additionally, these plans can serve as communications required by the U.N.

These measures anticipate potential climate changes and are flexible enough to meat objectives under a wide variety of future climate conditions. The process builds on assessments of vulnerability by focusing on adaptation measures for the most sensitive regions, or populations, within a country. potential anticipatory adaptation measures are identified, and two or three are chosen based on expert judgment and analysis regarding which measures would produce the greatest benefits and be easiest to implement. Analytic techniques are used to assess the benefits and costs of each of the measures and evaluate barriers to implementation.

This study presents a new elevation model called the digital impermeable surface model (DISM) based on the topographical data acquired by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs) for improving seawater inundation mapping. The proposed DISM model, along with the bathtub model, was used to assess coastal vulnerability to flooding in significant tropical cyclone events in a low-lying region of Victoria Harbor in Hong Kong. The inundation simulations were evaluated based on the typhoon news and reports which indicated the actual storm surge flooding conditions. Our findings revealed that the proposed DISM obtains a higher accuracy than the existing digital elevation model (DEM) and the digital surface model (DSM) with a RMSE of 0.035 m. The DISM demonstrated a higher skill than the DEM and the DSM by better accounting for the water-repellent functionality of each geospatial feature and the water inflow under real-life conditions. The inundation simulations affirmed that at least 88.3% of the inundated areas could be recognized successfully in this newly-designed model. Our findings also revealed that accelerating sea level rise in Victoria Harbor may pose a flooding threat comparable to those induced by super typhoons by the end of the 21st century under two representative emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The seawater may overtop the existing protective measures and facilities, making it susceptible to flood-related hazards.","[Shen, Yangshuo] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Shen, Yangshuo; Zhang, Boen; Chue, Cheuk Ying; Wang, Shuo] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shuo] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Res Inst Land & Space, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shuo] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Smart Cities Res Inst, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Wang, S (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Wang, S (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Res Inst Land & Space, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Wang, S (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Smart Cities Res Inst, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",shuo.s.wang@polyu.edu.hk,,,,,,,51,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,JAN,2023,14,1,,,,,,,52,10.3390/atmos14010052,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos14010052,,,21,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,7X7BO,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000914353400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite this consensus, little is known about potential changes in the variability of ecohydrological conditions, which is also required to inform climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. Considering potential changes in ecohydrological variability is critical to evaluating the emergence of trends, assessing the likelihood of extreme events such as floods and droughts, and identifying when tipping points may be reached that fundamentally alter ecohydrological function. Using a single-model Large Ensemble with sophisticated terrestrial ecosystem representation, we characterize projected changes in the mean state and variability of ecohydrological processes in historically snow-dominated regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Widespread snowpack reductions, earlier snowmelt timing, longer growing seasons, drier soils, and increased fire risk are projected for this century under a high-emissions scenario. In addition to these changes in the mean state, increased variability in winter snowmelt will increase growing-season water deficits and increase the stochasticity of runoff. Thus, with warming, declining snowpack loses its dependable buffering capacity so that runoff quantity and timing more closely reflect the episodic characteristics of precipitation. This results in a declining predictability of annual runoff from maximum snow water equivalent, which has critical implications for ecosystem stress and water resource management. Our results suggest that there is a strong likelihood of pervasive alterations to ecohydrological function that may be expected with climate change.","[Wieder, William R.; Kennedy, Daniel; Lehner, Flavio; Rosenbloom, Nan; Simpson, Isla R.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Wieder, William R.; Musselman, Keith N.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Lehner, Flavio] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Rodgers, Keith B.; Yamaguchi, Ryohei] Ctr Climate Phys, Inst Basic Sci, Busan 46241, South Korea; [Rodgers, Keith B.; Yamaguchi, Ryohei] Pusan Natl Univ, Busan 46241, South Korea; [Yamaguchi, Ryohei] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Kanagawa, Japan",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Cornell University; Institute for Basic Science - Korea (IBS); Pusan National University; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC),"Wieder, WR (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.;Wieder, WR (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",wwieder@ucar.edu,"Yamaguchi, Ryohei/HKV-4527-2023","Yamaguchi, Ryohei/0000-0002-7800-5798; WIEDER, WILLIAM/0000-0001-7116-1985; Simpson, Isla/0000-0002-2915-1377; Rosenbloom, Nan/0000-0001-7389-3346","NSF [1852977, 2031238, 2120804, 1637686, 1947282]; Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Republic of Korea [IBS-R028-D1]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological & Environmental Research (BER), Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) component of the Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program [DE-SC0022070]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [4310349]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Republic of Korea; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological & Environmental Research (BER), Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) component of the Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","The simulations presented here were coordinated and conducted by Sun-Seon Lee at the Institute for Basic Sciences Center for Climate Physics (ICCP) and Jim Edwards at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) on the Institute for Basic Sciences (IBS/ICCP supercomputer Aleph, a high-performance Cray XC50-E Skylake computing system.

Agricultural and dietary diversification are promising tools to balance agricultural yield losses and nutrient deficits in crops. However, rigorous impact evaluation of such adaptation strategies is lacking. This project will determine the potential of an integrated home gardening and nutrition counseling program as one possible climate change adaptation strategy to improve child health in rural Burkina Faso and Kenya. Methods: Based on careful co-design with stakeholders and beneficiaries, we conduct a multi-center, cluster-randomized controlled trial with 2 x 600 households in North-Western Burkina Faso and in South-Eastern Kenya. We recruit households with children at the age of complementary feed introduction (6-24 months) and with access to water sources. The intervention comprises the bio-diversification of horticultural home gardens and nutritional health counseling, using the 7 Essential Nutrition Action messages by the World Health Organization. After 12-months of follow-up, we will determine the intervention effect on the primary health outcome height-for-age z-score, using multi-level mixed models in an intention-to-treat approach. Secondary outcomes comprise other anthropometric indices, iron and zinc status, dietary behavior, malaria indicators, and household socioeconomic status. Discussion: This project will establish the potential of a home gardening and nutrition counseling program to counteract climate change-related quantitative and qualitative agricultural losses, thereby improving the nutritional status among young children in rural sub-Saharan Africa.","[Mank, Isabel; Sorgho, Raissa; Danquah, Ina] Heidelberg Univ, Med Fac, Heidelberg Inst Global Hlth HIGH, Neuenheimer Feld 324, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Mank, Isabel; Sorgho, Raissa; Danquah, Ina] Heidelberg Univ, Univ Hosp Heidelberg, Neuenheimer Feld 324, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Mank, Isabel] German Inst Dev Evaluat DEval, Bonn, Germany; [Zerbo, Fanta; Kagone, Moubassira; Coulibaly, Boubacar; Sie, Ali] Ctr Rech Sante Nouna CRSN, Nouna, Burkina Faso; [Oguso, John; Mbata, Michael; Khagayi, Sammy; Muok, Erick M.

The study focused on exploring the existing coastal resources and their support to communities' livelihood, climatic threats that are experienced, and the role of coastal resources in enhancing communities' resilience. It further sought to establish other enabling factors for climate change adaptation (e.g., gender, education, governance, by-laws, and membership in social networks). The study used focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and household surveys in data collection. Findings show that Mchungu village is endowed with fish, mangrove, natural canal, and floodplains as their major coastal resources, while Kivinja' A' is rich in salt and coconut production. Communities in both villages exploit these coastal resources for their livelihood activities such as fishing, agriculture, and business. The study further found that coastal communities are already experiencing the effects of climate change through temperature rise, flooding, drought, sea-level rise, and storm surges. These affect household food security in terms of fish catch and crop production. The study revealed that coastal and marine resources were important for increasing community resilience (P <= 0.05) to climate change impacts in the studied villages. However, household resilience to climate change impacts was also influenced by gender, by-laws, education, and membership in social networks.","[Yanda, Pius Zebhe; Mabhuye, Edmund Bwanduruko; Mwajombe, Anselm] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Ctr Climate Change Studies, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",University of Dar es Salaam,"Mabhuye, EB (corresponding author), Univ Dar Es Salaam, Ctr Climate Change Studies, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.",edmund.mabhuye@gmail.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Mabhuye, Edmund/0000-0002-8593-4085",NORAD (Norway) through Norhed Program,NORAD (Norway) through Norhed Program,"Our sincere thanks are extended to District Executive Director, Rufiji District Council, for his invaluable administrative support and granting access to study sites.

This study addressed this gap by identifying the coping practices for short-term climate variations and the adaptation measures used by smallholder farmers to address future climate change in northeast Ghana. The paper used a mixed-methods approach, including household surveys, focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Data were collected from 555 households located in six communities across three districts in northeast Ghana. Results indicated that smallholder farmers were employing a host of practices to address the threats posed by climate change. Key adaptation practices included the planting of drought-tolerant crop varieties, the use of indigenous knowledge, intensification of irrigation, migration, adjusting the planting calendar, crop diversification, mixed farming, and sustainable land management practices. On the contrary, short-term coping practices reported by the study participants included the sale of non-farm assets, complementing agriculture with non-farm jobs, selling livestock, engaging in wage labor, charcoal burning and reliance on social networks. The results further revealed that barriers to climate change adaptation and coping practices differed by gender. The paper recommends that capacities of smallholder farmers in vulnerability hotspots should be enhanced to address immediate climate variations, as well as future climate changes. Ghana's climate change and agricultural policies should prioritize adaptations by smallholder farmers in addressing threats posed by climate change.","[Antwi-Agyei, Philip] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Kumasi, Ghana; [Nyantakyi-Frimpong, Hanson] Univ Denver, Dept Geog & Environm, Denver, CO 80210 USA",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Denver,"Antwi-Agyei, P (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Kumasi, Ghana.",philiantwi@yahoo.com; hnyanta2@du.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Antwi-Agyei, Philip/0000-0002-8599-474X; Nyantakyi-Frimpong, Hanson/0000-0002-6407-1970",Climate Research for Development (CR4D) Postdoctoral Fellowship [CR4D-19-06]; African Climate Policy Center (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA); United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DfID) Weather and Climate Information Services for Africa (WISER) programme,Climate Research for Development (CR4D) Postdoctoral Fellowship; African Climate Policy Center (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA); United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DfID) Weather and Climate Information Services for Africa (WISER) programme,"This work was supported through the Climate Research for Development (CR4D) Postdoctoral Fellowship [CR4D-19-06], an initiative of the African Climate Policy Center (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) in partnership with the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DfID) Weather and Climate Information Services for Africa (WISER) programme and implemented by the African Academy of Sciences (AAS).",,93,25,25,3,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2021,13,3,,,,,,,1308,10.3390/su13031308,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13031308,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QD6RS,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000615643300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Observed precipitation trends and climate change projections over Brazil indicate that many sectors of society are potentially highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The purpose of this study is to assess model projections of the change in rainfall variability at various temporal scales over sub-regions of Brazil. For this, daily data from 30 CMIP5 models for historical (1900-2005) and future (2050-2100) experiments under a high-emission scenario are used. We assess the change in precipitation variability, applying a band-pass filter to isolate variability on daily, weekly, monthly, intra-seasonal, and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) time scales. For historical climate, simulated precipitation is evaluated against observations to establish model reliability. The results show that models largely agree on increases in variability on all timescales in all sub-regions, except on ENSO timescales where models do not agree on the sign of future change. Brazil will experience more rainfall variability in the future that is, drier or more frequent dry periods and wetter wet periods on daily, weekly, monthly, and intra-seasonal timescales, even in sub-regions where future changes in mean rainfall are currently uncertain. This may provide useful information for climate change adaptation across, for example, the agriculture and water resource sectors in Brazil.","[Alves, Lincoln M.] Natl Inst Space Res INPE, Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil; [Chadwick, Robin] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Chadwick, Robin] Univ Exeter, Global Syst Inst, Exeter, Devon, England; [Moise, Aurel; Brown, Josephine] Bur Meteorol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Marengo, Jose A.] Natl Ctr Monitoring & Early Warning Nat Disasters, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE); Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; University of Exeter; Bureau of Meteorology - Australia,"Alves, LM (corresponding author), Natl Inst Space Res INPE, Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil.",lincoln.alves@inpe.br,"Alves, Lincoln M/G-8894-2015","Brown, Josephine/0000-0002-1100-7457",U.S. Department of Energy; Newton Fund; Met Office,U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Newton Fund; Met Office,U.S. Department of Energy; Newton Fund; Met Office,,94,19,19,7,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

In the first part of this paper, projections of low and high flows in the rivers of the Vistula and the Odra basins (VOB region), for two future time horizons, are presented. Projections are based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model simulations driven by results of the EURO-CORDEX experiment under Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5. The VOB region covers most of Poland and parts of five neighboring countries, giving this study an international relevance. In the second part of the paper, a review of projections of low and high flows in rivers in Central and Eastern Europe is presented. Despite a substantial spread of flow projections, the main message of the modelling part is that increases of both low and high flows are dominating. The magnitude of increase of low flow is considerably higher than that of high flow. In other words, future streamflow droughts are projected to be less severe, whereas, in contrast, river floods are projected to increase, which is a challenge for flood risk reduction, water management, and climate change adaptation. There is an overall agreement of our findings for the VOB region with projections of hydrological extremes from large-scale models forced by EURO-CORDEX results in the European-scale studies.","[Piniewski, Mikolaj; Szczesniak, Mateusz] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Dept Hydraul Engn, Ul Nowoursynowska 159, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland; [Piniewski, Mikolaj; Kundzewicz, Zbigniew W.] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Kundzewicz, Zbigniew W.] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Agr & Forest Environm, PL-60809 Poznan, Poland; [Mezghani, Abdelkader; Hov, Oystein] Norwegian Meteorol Inst, N-0313 Oslo, Norway",Warsaw University of Life Sciences; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Polish Academy of Sciences; Norwegian Meteorological Institute,"Piniewski, M (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Dept Hydraul Engn, Ul Nowoursynowska 159, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland.",mpiniewski@levis.sggw.pl,"Piniewski, Mikolaj/A-5159-2012","Piniewski, Mikolaj/0000-0001-7930-4549; Kundzewicz, Zbigniew/0000-0002-3579-5072","Narodowe Centrum Badan i Rozwoju [CHASE-PL, Pol Nor/200799/90/2014]","Narodowe Centrum Badan i Rozwoju(National Centre for Research & Development, Poland)","Narodowe Centrum Badan i Rozwoju, Grant/ Award Number: CHASE-PL project No. Pol Nor/200799/90/2014",,50,27,27,1,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0885-6087,1099-1085,,HYDROL PROCESS,Hydrol.

Empirical studies examining how community-based organizations (CBOs) practice resilience on the ground and what enables these CBOs to organize and mobilize around resilience are lacking. Moreover, in the growing context of competitive and entrepreneurial urbanism and conflicting priorities about urban (re)development, it is unclear how urban development dynamics influence community based resilience actions. Through empirical research conducted on the Lower East Side, a gentrifying neighborhood in Manhattan, and in Rockaway, a socio-spatially isolated neighborhood in Queens, we investigate community organizing of low-income residents for (climate) resilience in a post-disaster context. Results show that both the operationalization of resilience- how resilience is practiced- and the community capacity to organize for the improved resilience of low-income residents are strongly influenced by pre-existing urban development dynamics and civic infrastructure- the socio-spatial networks of community-based organizations- in each neighborhood. The Lower East Side, with its long history of community activism and awareness of gentrification threats, was better able to mobilize broadly and collectively around resilience needs while the more socio-spatially isolated neighborhoods on the Rockaway peninsula were more constrained.

Through observations, qualitative interviews, and archival reviews, we explore the dynamics of livelihood change and analyse the diverse factors that have been influencing options and adaptation over time. The results reveal that both villages have undergone profound changes in livelihoods and productive activities on several occasions. While the villages' histories, geographies, and cultures are different, similarities in long-term trends include the transition from land-based to marine resources and the decline of small-scale agriculture. Our analysis illuminates the deep connections between local livelihoods and national as well as global political-economic processes, which favour extraction and export of natural resources throughout the period investigated, whereby resource access and market mechanisms create and constrict adaptation options for the villagers. Gradual environmental changes, such as erosion, and episodic events, such as hurricanes, have also influenced livelihood shifts and adaptations in combination with a wide range of political-economic factors. Despite the demonstrated importance of the influence of history and dimensions of political economy on contemporary adaptation options in the communities studied, the literature on climate change adaptation inadequately accounts for these factors. This paper adds new perspectives to current debates in climate change research by emphasising that longer temporal dimensions of livelihood change are important for understanding the current context for adaptation.","[Karlsson, Marianne; Bryceson, Ian] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, As, Norway; [Karlsson, Marianne] CICERO, Oslo, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Karlsson, M (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, As, Norway.;Karlsson, M (corresponding author), CICERO, Oslo, Norway.",marianne.karlsson@nmbu.no,,,,,,,85,2,2,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2016,21,2,,,,,137,156,,10.1080/13549839.2014.926871,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2014.926871,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,DP0GM,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000378167300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study evaluates the prospects for widespread adoption of these modern maize varieties as a climate change adaptation strategy for smallholder farmers. Data are from a detailed household survey completed in four rural villages in Southern Malawi between May and July 2010. The empirical analysis involves estimation of an ordered logit regression model because the dependent variable is categorical, with one category for nonadoption (has never grown modern maize varieties) and three categories for the duration of growing a modern maize variety among adopters (this year only, 2 to 5 years and 6 years or more). The empirical findings indicate a positive association between a farmer's perception of drought risk and the adoption and continued use of modern maize. Regression results also show that farmers that value the traits of early maturity and drought tolerance are more likely to adopt modern maize varieties. There is evidence of some disadoption among farmers dissatisfied with maize genotype performance, in terms of poor storability and yield under drought conditions. Finally, the study highlights the urgent need for maize breeders interested in sustained use of modern varieties to simultaneously address robust drought tolerance, early maturity and storability. This underscores the importance of cognizance of local farmer preferences in crop breeding efforts.","[Fisher, Monica] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Ethiopia Off, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Snapp, Sieglinde] Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA",Michigan State University,"Fisher, M (corresponding author), Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Ethiopia Off, ILRI Sholla Campus,POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",m.fisher@cgiar.org,"Snapp, Sieg/GWQ-5774-2022; Snapp, Sieglinde/AAU-8121-2020","Snapp, Sieglinde/0000-0002-9738-0649; Fisher, Monica/0000-0002-6669-6261",,,,,34,15,16,1,27,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0014-4797,1469-4441,,EXP AGR,Exp.

However, ponds are not often considered as Nature-based Solutions to provide all these benefits. In addition, there is insufficient knowledge on how to manage and restore ponds to maximise their role to increase the resilience of ecosystems and society to climate change. To facilitate improved implementation of ponds as Nature-based Solutions for the delivery of a wide range of Nature Contributions to People, it is important to generate and integrate biodiversity, ecosystems, societal, economic and policy knowledge. Hence, there is a need for evidence-based guidance to support the broader use of ponds. Here, we review the role of ponds and pondscapes in delivering Nature's Contributions to People and provide an overview of the challenges and opportunities for their broader implementation as Nature-based Solutions.

Adaptation choices can be represented by economic investment models in which the often large upfront cost of adaptation is offset by the future benefits of avoiding losses due to future natural hazards. In this context, we investigate the role that expectations of future natural hazards have on adaptation in the Colorado River basin of the USA. We apply an innovative approach that quantifies the impacts of changes in concurrent climate extremes, with a focus on flooding events. By including the expectation of future natural hazards in adaptation models, we examine how public policies can focus on this component to support local community adaptation efforts. Findings indicate that considering the concurrent distribution of several variables makes quantification and prediction of extremes easier, more realistic, and consequently improves our capability to model human systems adaptation. Hazard expectation is a leading force in adaptation. Even without assuming increases in exposure, the Colorado River basin is expected to face harsh increases in damage from flooding events unless local communities are able to incorporate climate change and expected increases in extremes in their adaptation planning and decision making.","[Boero, Riccardo; Talsma, Carl James; Oliveto, Julia Andre; Bennett, Katrina Eleanor] Los Alamos Natl Lab, POB 1663, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Boero, Riccardo] Norwegian Inst Air Res NILU, POB 100, N-2027 Kjeller, Norway; [Talsma, Carl James] Carbon Solut LLC, 520 S Walnut St 937, Bloomington, IN 47402 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory; Norwegian Institute for Air Research,"Boero, R (corresponding author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, POB 1663, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.;Boero, R (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Air Res NILU, POB 100, N-2027 Kjeller, Norway.",ribo@nilu.no; carl.talsma@carbonsolutionsllc.com; joliveto@lanl.gov; kbennett@lanl.gov,,"Boero, Riccardo/0000-0002-7468-9096; Bennett, Katrina/0000-0003-2433-8607; Oliveto, Julia/0000-0002-7018-7750; Talsma, Carl/0000-0002-5558-1354",,,,,65,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,FEB,2022,10,2,,,,,,,27,10.3390/cli10020027,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli10020027,,,17,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,ZL2IF,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000763502800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This allowance varies depending on the period for which the estimate is being made, the vulnerability of the development being considered and its location. Recently, questions have been raised as to whether these percentage uplifts should be kept the same, or whether change has already happened within the baseline period and so uplifts should be reduced. A complicating factor is that changes in flood frequency can occur for reasons in addition to climate change, such as land-use change or natural variability. This article describes current approaches taken by different stakeholders for catchments in England and Wales to account for climate change, and discusses these allowances where there is already an observed presence of trend in flood regimes. Theil-Sen estimators of trend were used in comparing non-stationary and stationary flood frequency curves with allowances applied, leading to a recommendation of evaluating non-stationary models at 1990, the end of the reference period. Examples were explored such as the Eden catchment, which was heavily affected by Storm Desmond in December 2015.","[Griffin, Adam; Kay, Alison; Stewart, Lisa] UK Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Crowmarsh Gifford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Spencer, Peter] Environm Agcy, Warrington, Cheshire, England",UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH),"Griffin, A (corresponding author), UK Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Crowmarsh Gifford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England.",adagri@ceh.ac.uk,"Kay, Alison L/D-1981-2012","Kay, Alison L/0000-0002-5526-1756",,,,,30,1,1,3,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1753-318X,,,J FLOOD RISK MANAG,J.

Four perennial wheat genotypes were grown in Central Italy and compared in terms of agronomic traits, root development (biomass and length) and ecophysiological parameters with an annual common wheat cultivar. Plants were, on average, taller in perennial wheat genotypes than in annual wheat as well as the number of tillers per plant (+ 49%), root length (+ 43%) and root biomass (+ 31%) in both years, whereas, perennial wheat kernels were smaller (- 15%). Post harvest regrowth occurred in different amounts in all perennial wheat genotypes. In terms of the ecophysiological response, perennial wheat lines revealed higher soil respiration and lower stomatal conductance than annual wheat. On the contrary, transpiration rate, water use efficiency and photosynthesis were higher in annual genotype than in perennial ones. The environmental benefits of adopting perennial grains are discussed together with suggestions on optimal field management and future breeding strategies.","[Baronti, Silvia; Ugolini, Francesca; Miglietta, Franco; Genesio, Lorenzo; Vaccari, Francesco P.] CNR, Natl Res Council, Inst BioEcon, IBE, Via Madonna Piano 10, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, FI, Italy; [Galassi, Elena; Cacciatori, Pierino; Gazza, Laura] CREA Res Ctr Engn & Agrofood Proc, Via Manziana 30, I-00189 Rome, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per la BioEconomia (IBE-CNR),"Gazza, L (corresponding author), CREA Res Ctr Engn & Agrofood Proc, Via Manziana 30, I-00189 Rome, Italy.",laura.gazza@crea.gov.it,"Baronti, Silvia/AAX-7952-2020; Baronti, Silvia/AAD-5339-2019","Baronti, Silvia/0000-0002-0986-0723; Cacciatori, Pierino/0000-0003-0047-6247","Progetto RGV-FAO, (MIPAAF, Italy) [20380/2017]","Progetto RGV-FAO, (MIPAAF, Italy)","This research was partially supported by Progetto RGV-FAO, (MIPAAF, Italy D.M. 20380/2017).",,52,0,0,1,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0925-9864,1573-5109,,GENET RESOUR CROP EV,Genet.

What has been the influence of the Paris Agreement on litigation to improve mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change? This question is addressed in two articles. Both articles seek to look at a familiar topic-the Paris Agreement and climate litigation-in new and fresh ways. This first article examines how the Paris Agreement is directly implemented through incorporation into the domestic laws of the signatories as well as indirectly implemented through judicial decision-making in accordance with norms under the Paris Agreement. First, the article examines the international obligations created by the Paris Agreement, noting the flexible nature of the agreement and wide margin of discretion left to parties. Secondly, it explores how the Paris Agreement is incorporated in domestic laws and policies. The potential for litigation based on these international and domestic obligations will be considered.

In this study, finite size Lyapunov exponents (FSLE) are used to study error growth rates of the system at different timescales. This is done to quantify the impact of enhanced anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions on the predictability of fast and slow varying components of central Indian rainfall (CIR). The CIR time series for this purpose is constructed using the daily gridded high-resolution India Meteorological Department (IMD) dataset and Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) output for historical run and three representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) from the HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, CCSM4, BCC-CSM1.1, and MPI-ESM-LR models. The analyzed CIR dataset reveals a low dimensional chaotic attractor, suggesting that CIR requires a minimum of 5 and maximum of 11 variables to describe the state of the system. FSLE analysis shows a rapid decrease in the Lyapunov exponent with increasing timescales. This analysis suggests a predictability of about 2-3 weeks for fast varying components at short timescale of the CIR and about 5-9 years for slow varying components at long timescales.","[Singh, Uday Pratap; Dwivedi, Suneet; Tiwari, Anurag] Univ Allahabad, K Banerjee Ctr Atmospher & Ocean Studies, Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Mittal, Ashok Kumar] Univ Allahabad, Dept Phys, Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Dwivedi, Suneet] Univ Allahabad, MN Saha Ctr Space Studies, Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India",University of Allahabad; University of Allahabad; University of Allahabad,"Singh, UP (corresponding author), Univ Allahabad, K Banerjee Ctr Atmospher & Ocean Studies, Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India.",udaykbcaos@gmail.com,"Singh, Dr. Uday Pratap/GLR-2485-2022; Dwivedi, Suneet/D-8008-2019","Singh, Dr. Uday Pratap/0000-0001-7573-8550; Dwivedi, Suneet/0000-0001-9377-7713",CSIR [09/001/0399/2016-EMR-I],CSIR(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India),"The first author is grateful to CSIR, Govt. of India for providing senior research fellowship letter no. 09/001/0399/2016-EMR-I.

In response to these challenges, interest is growing in audience segmentation as a possible strategy to develop more effective communications that are tailored and targeted to subgroups of the public who share similar values, beliefs, behaviors, and/or policy preferences about climate change. In this article, we provide a brief historical overview of audience segmentation and its applications to marketing, health, politics, and most recently climate change. We then critically evaluate several conceptual arguments about whether segmentation is an appropriate strategy for climate change communications, review key methodological considerations associated with conducting segmentation analyses, and make several recommendations about best practice. We conclude that, in principle, audience segmentation and targeted messaging are potentially valuable tools for enhancing climate change communication. But, in practice, there are conceptual and methodological complexities of which practitioners and consumers should be aware when conducting and interpreting the results of segmentation studies. In addition, more research is required, particularly related to tailoring and targeting messages to identified segments, before these strategies can be considered to have a sufficient evidence base to warrant widespread adoption.

This optimism is based on historic trends in yield increases, on the spread of cropping systems far beyond their traditional agroecological boundaries, and the inherent flexibility of systems of international trade. Analysis of the success (or in rare cases, failure) of adaptation is by analogy-either to analogous socioeconomic or technological change or to short term environmental change. Such studies have been limited to industrialized countries. This paper uses five analogs from developing countries to examine potential adaptation to global climate change by poor people. Two are studies of comparative developing country responses to drought, flood, and tropical cyclone and to the Sahelian droughts of the 1970s and 80s that illustrate adaptations to climate and weather events:. Two address food production and rapid population growth in South Asia and Africa. Three types of adaptive social costs are considered: the direct costs of adaptation, the costs of adapting to the adaptations, and the costs of failing to adapt.

Communities along the Mekong River have adapted to variability in temperature, rainfall, and flooding patterns over time. Rapid environmental change in the Mekong Basin presents a new set of challenges related to drought, altered seasonal rainfall, more frequent high-flow flood events, and water withdrawals for hydropower and irrigation. We present a multi-method approach to understand how local knowledge of the spatial and temporal patterns of floods, droughts, and rainfall can be integrated with scientific information along a flood-prone section of the lower Mekong River in Kratie Province, Cambodia.

Seasonal calendars of weather patterns and livelihood activities, together with local indicators of flooding, rainfall, and drought were compared with trends in 35 years of rainfall data, and highlighted pressure points at the beginning and end of the rainy season where agriculture may be particularly impacted by climate change.

In this study, we project future changes in Tmax, Tmin and DTR for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 using fine-resolution downscaled data from the 18global coupled models over the main regions of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Outcomes: The Multi-Model Ensemble (MME) mean projections show that future warming is stronger in Tmax than in Tmin, leading to the increased DTR over central and southern Europe, many areas surrounding the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, and southeastern China. By contrast, the DTR is projected to decline over the regions north of 55 degrees N and other some areas due to the more rapid increase in Tmin than in Tmax. As a whole, the diurnal asymmetry of projected future temperature changes is found to mainly occur from November to March. Conclusions: Our findings contribute to the knowledgebase on climate change over the main BRI regions. Regarding uneven spatiotemporal changes in Tmax, Tmin and DTR, appropriate climate change adaptation strategies, and options should be adopted to reduce or avoid disadvantaged consequences to the natural system and human society over specific regions.","[Zhuang, Yuanhuang; Zhang, Jingyong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Zhuang, Yuanhuang; Zhang, Jingyong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Zhang, JY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",zjy@mail.iap.ac.cn,,"Zhang, Jingyong/0000-0003-1056-8436","National Key RAMP;D Program of China [2018YFA0606501, 2017YFA0603601]",National Key RAMP;D Program of China,"This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFA0606501, 2017YFA0603601].",,31,14,16,3,111,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",2096-4129,2332-8878,,ECOSYST HEALTH SUST,Ecosyst.

A new integrated model of the co-evolution of supply (27 ski areas) and demand-side (skier behaviour) climate change adaptation in the ski tourism market of Ontario, Canada is presented. Ski area operations are modeled under a high-emission 2050s scenario, with skier responses to altered operations informed by a survey of 2429 skiers. These market adaptive dynamics reveal new insights into differential climate risk, capturing patterns not apparent when considering only operational conditions of ski resorts. A decoupling of ski season length and skier visitation was found at four ski areas, where, despite average season length losses, visitation increased as a result of reduced competition. Simulated skier visit losses were smaller than reductions in season length, contributing to an increase in crowding. Growing the market of skiers was also identified as a critical adaptation strategy that could offset skier visit losses from shortened seasons. Climate change challenges the future sustainability of ski areas in this market in several ways: profitability of ski areas with substantially shorter seasons, increased snowmaking costs, crowding impacts on visitor experience, and potential overtourism at the few most climate resilient destinations.","[Scott, Daniel; Johnson, Peter] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Steiger, Robert] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Publ Finance, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Rutty, Michelle] Univ Waterloo, Fac Environm, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Pons, Marc] Observ Sostenibilitat Andorra, AD-600 St Julia De Loria, Andorra",University of Waterloo; University of Innsbruck; University of Waterloo,"Scott, D (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",daniel.scott@uwaterloo.ca; robert.steiger@uibk.ac.at; michelle.rutty@uwaterloo.ca; mpons@obsa.ad; peter.johnson@uwaterloo.ca,"Pons, Marc/AHA-2722-2022; Pons, Marc/GYR-1419-2022; Rutty, Michelle/GPX-7857-2022; Steiger, Robert/N-5724-2014","Pons, Marc/0000-0001-9105-0772; Pons, Marc/0000-0001-9105-0772; Rutty, Michelle/0000-0002-4567-7766; Steiger, Robert/0000-0002-1752-6450; Scott, Daniel/0000-0001-7825-9301",Social Science and Humanities Research Council (Canada) [430-2013-000473],Social Science and Humanities Research Council (Canada)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This research was funded by Social Science and Humanities Research Council (Canada) Insight Development Grant number 430-2013-000473.,,66,10,10,11,41,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2020,12,24,,,,,,,10617,10.3390/su122410617,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su122410617,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PL6EJ,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000603212400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, it is a challenge to integrate climate change information in a form that can be used efficiently by adaptation planners, policy makers, and fishery managers. In this study, we frame a climate change impact assessment using a geographical perspective based on the management units of the dominant fishery, in this case, American lobster in Nova Scotia, Canada. The information considered here includes economic dependence on the fishery, population size, diversity of the fishery revenue, status of harbor infrastructure, total replacement cost of each harbor, increased relative sea level and flooding, and the vulnerability of offshore lobster to ocean warming and changes in zooplankton composition and anticipatory changes in fishery productivity across management borders. Using two ocean models to provide multi-decadal scale projections of bottom temperature, changes in offshore lobster distribution are projected to have a neutral, or positive impact on the region as a whole. However, when lobster vulnerability is combined with climate change related vulnerabilities of coastal fishing communities, it is evident that adaptation planning is needed for long-term sustainability. This impact assessment provides both a framework and information for further in-depth analyses by climate change adaptation planners and fishery managers.","[Greenan, Blair J.

This study aims to contribute to the development of a decision support tool to prepare water resources managers and planners for climate change adaptation. The Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (The Water Balance Department of the Hydrological Bureau) hydrologic model was used to define the boundary conditions for the reservoir capacity yield model comprising daily reservoir inflow from a representative example watershed with the size of 14,924 km(2) into a reservoir with the capacity of 6.80 Gm(3). The reservoir capacity yield model was used to simulate variability in climate change-induced differences in reservoir capacity needs and performance (operational probability of failure, resilience, and vulnerability). Owing to the future precipitation reduction and potential evapotranspiration increase during the worst case scenario (-40% precipitation and + 30% potential evapotranspiration), substantial reductions in streamflow of between -56% and -58% are anticipated for the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Furthermore, model simulations recommend that as a result of future climatic conditions, the reservoir operational probability of failure would generally increase due to declined reservoir inflow. The study developed preparedness plans to combat the consequences of climate change and drought.","[Mohammed, Ruqayah; Scholz, Miklas] Univ Salford, Civil Engn Res Grp, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Newton Bldg,Peel Pk Campus, Salford M5 4WT, Greater Manches, England; [Scholz, Miklas] Lund Univ, Div Water Resources Engn, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, Fac Engn, POB 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Scholz, Miklas] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Civil Engn Sci, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Kingsway Campus,POB 524, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Salford; Lund University; University of Johannesburg,"Scholz, M (corresponding author), Univ Salford, Civil Engn Res Grp, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Newton Bldg,Peel Pk Campus, Salford M5 4WT, Greater Manches, England.;Scholz, M (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Div Water Resources Engn, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, Fac Engn, POB 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.;Scholz, M (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Dept Civil Engn Sci, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Kingsway Campus,POB 524, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",ruqaya2008@yahoo.com; miklas.scholz@tvrl.lth.se,"Mohammed, Ruqayah/E-5074-2019; Mohammed, Ruqayah/AAN-2395-2021","Mohammed, Ruqayah/0000-0002-8485-2467",Iraqi government,Iraqi government,The research has been financed by the Iraqi government via a Ph.D. scholarship for the lead author via Babylon University.,,22,16,16,4,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

Urban floods are mainly caused by short duration extreme events. Hence, robust information on changes in extreme precipitation at high-temporal resolution is required for the design of climate change adaptation measures. However, the quantification of these changes is challenging and subject to numerous uncertainties. This study assesses the changes and uncertainties in extreme precipitation at hourly scale over Denmark. It explores three statistical downscaling approaches: a delta change method for extreme events, a weather generator combined with a disaggregation method and a climate analogue method. All three methods rely on different assumptions and use different outputs from the regional climate models (RCMs). The results of the three methods point towards an increase in extreme precipitation but the magnitude of the change varies depending on the RCM used and the spatial location. In general, a similar mean change is obtained for the three methods. This adds confidence in the results as each method uses different information from the RCMs. The results of this study highlight the need of using a range of statistical downscaling methods as well as RCMs to assess changes in extreme precipitation.","[Sunyer, Maria Antonia; Gregersen, Ida Buelow; Rosbjerg, Dan; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, DK-2800 Kongens Lyngby, Denmark; [Madsen, Henrik; Luchner, Jakob] DHI, Horsholm, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark; Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI),"Sunyer, MA (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, Miljovej Bldg 113, DK-2800 Kongens Lyngby, Denmark.",masu@env.dtu.dk,"Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten/J-7792-2012","Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten/0000-0002-6221-9505; Rosbjerg, Dan/0000-0003-2204-8649",Foundation for Development of Technology in the Danish Water Sector [7492-2012]; Danish Council for Strategic Research [10-093894]; EU FP6 Integrated Project ENSEMBLES [05539],Foundation for Development of Technology in the Danish Water Sector; Danish Council for Strategic Research(Danske Strategiske Forskningsrad (DSF)); EU FP6 Integrated Project ENSEMBLES(European Commission),"This work was carried out with the support of The Foundation for Development of Technology in the Danish Water Sector, contract no. 7492-2012 and the Danish Council for Strategic Research as part of the project RiskChange, contract no. 10-093894 (http://riskchange.dhigroup.com).; The CGD data set is a product of the Danish Meteorological Institute and the SVK data set a product of The Water Pollution Committee of The Society of Danish Engineers.

Storage capacity is often perceived as a key element of climate change adaptation strategies, while at the same time contributing to socioeconomic development through irrigation, energy generation, fish production, and municipal and industrial water supply. The benefits provided by dams must be balanced with the associated environmental and social costs, which can take various forms, such as the degradation of ecosystems because of altered flow regimes and the relocation of people from the impoundment area. The benefits of storage essentially come from the ability to move water in time, making it available during the low-flow season when it becomes more valuable. As river basins develop and new dams are constructed, it may be important for planning and operational purposes to assess the individual contribution of each reservoir to the benefits of storage. This paper presents a methodology to determine the economic value of storage in multireservoir systems based on the marginal net benefit functions of storage and on hydroeconomic modeling. A cascade of reservoirs in the Euphrates river basin is used to illustrate the methodology.","[Tilmant, Amaury; Arjoon, Diane] Univ Laval, Dept Civil & Water Engn, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Marques, Guilherme Fernandes] Ctr Fed Educ Tecnolog Minas Gerais, Dept Civil Engn, BR-30510000 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",Laval University,"Tilmant, A (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Civil & Water Engn, Av Med 1065, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",amaury.tilmant@gci.ulaval.ca; diane.arjoon@gci.ulaval.ca; gmarques@civil.cefetmg.br,"marques, guilherme/P-7303-2019; Marques, Guilherme F Fernandes/I-6028-2012","Marques, Guilherme F Fernandes/0000-0003-0543-6279; Tilmant, Amaury/0000-0001-9586-5274",,,,,24,22,22,2,43,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9496,1943-5452,,J WATER RES PLAN MAN,J.

Although similar to native forests in surrounding regions in structure, composition, and function, these natural areas are threatened by multiple, co-occurring biological and climate stressors that are exacerbated by the urban environment. Furthermore, forests in cities often lack application of formal silvicultural approaches reliant upon evidence-based applied ecological sciences. These include both urban- and climate-adapted silvicultural techniques to increase the resilience and sustainability of native forests in cities. With this in mind, we convened a group of urban forest practitioners and researchers from along a latitudinal gradient in the northeastern United States to participate in a workshop focused on co-developing long-term, replicated ecological studies that will underlie the basis for potential silvicultural applications to urban forests. In this article we review the process and outcomes of the workshop, including an assessment of forest vulnerability, and adaptive capacity across the region, as well as shared management goals and objectives. We discuss the social and ecological challenges of managing urban oak-dominated mixed hardwood forests relative to non-urban forests and identify potential examples of urban- and climate-adapted silviculture strategies created by practitioners and researchers. In doing so, we highlight the challenges and need for basic and long-term applied ecological research relevant to silvicultural applications in cities.","[Piana, Max R.; Bloniarz, David; Lerman, Susannah B.; Nislow, Keith] Forest Serv, USDA, Northern Res Stn, Amherst, NY 59501 USA; [Hallett, Richard A.; Johnson, Michelle L.] USDA, Forest Serv, Northern Res Stn, Queens, NY USA; [Sonti, Nancy F.; Hines, Sarah; Yesilonis, Ian] USDA, No Res Stn, Forest Serv, Baltimore, MD USA; [Brandt, Leslie A.] USDA, Forest Serv, No Res Stn, Northern Inst Appl Climate Sci, St Paul, MN USA; [Aronson, Myla F.

This study uses a bottom-up approach to investigate the provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural benefits of local ecosystems to urban communities in Port Vila, Vanuatu. The project was based on participatory action research carried out for the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) as part of the Pacific Ecosystem-based Adaptation to Climate Change Project. Based on a survey of 821 households, and 10 community workshops, this paper provides a narrative of the terrestrial, freshwater, and coastal ecosystem services salient to the livelihoods of vulnerable urban communities. This narrative is set in the context of rapid urbanisation and climate change, which are increasingly undermining community resilience. These findings stress the urgent need to better understand, and account for, complex socio-ecological relationships when developing adaptation policies and urban development plans, not only in Vanuatu but across Oceania's cities and towns.","[Komugabe-Dixson, Aimee F.] Komugabe Dixson Consulting, Auckland, New Zealand; [de Ville, Naomi S.

These conditions present serious environmental, economic and social impacts on the agricultural community. In recent years, adaptation to climate change has become a major concern to farmers, researchers and policy makers alike. To enhance policy towards tackling the challenges that climate change poses to farmers, it is important to have knowledge on their perceptions of climate change, potential adaptation measures and factors affecting adaptation. In addition, the extent to which farmers' perceptions on climate change coincide with actual climatic data needs to be further examined. This paper, using a qualitative approach, looks into the perceived changes in rainfall and temperature, their impacts and adaptations strategies taken up by farmers in four villages in the states of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. It also analyses the accuracy of these perceptions based on actual available climatic data. The paper also looks into the determinants of adaptive capacity by examining a case of improved water management as an adaptation mechanism.","Univ Bologna, Int Ctr Hist Univ & Sci CIS, Fac Philosophy & Commun, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Banerjee, RR (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Int Ctr Hist Univ & Sci CIS, Fac Philosophy & Commun, Bologna, Italy.",rupsha80@gmail.com,,,,,,,44,46,50,1,62,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

Yet, there are currently no guidelines for structural engineers pertaining to their analysis and design. This work presents analytical solutions readily accessible for the dynamic analysis of MFS utilizing conventional rectangular pontoons subject to regular or irregular waves. Closed-form formulations utilizing linear wave theory proved capable in capturing the response amplitude operators (RAO) for sway, heave, and roll when compared against smoothed particle hy-drodynamics (SPH) simulations for a typical MFS to which appropriate damping ratios were obtained. A para-metric study was subsequently implemented to examine the contribution of building slenderness and superstructure-to-pontoon mass ratios on critical accelerations induced by different sea states. It was revealed that structural configurations beneficial to static stability may result in larger dynamic effects under wave excitation thus compromising occupant comfort delineated via various international standards. Ultimately, this paper represents a significant step towards the realization of MFS for urban expansion by providing structural engineers with an accessible methodology for the dynamic analysis of floating structures as a precursor to detailed computational modeling.","[Wang, Shengzhe] Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Civil Engn, Denver, CO 80217 USA",Children's Hospital Colorado; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; University of Colorado Denver,"Wang, SZ (corresponding author), Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Civil Engn, Denver, CO 80217 USA.",shengzhe.2.wang@ucdenver.edu,,"Wang, Shengzhe/0000-0001-9704-4752",,,,,71,0,0,2,2,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0029-8018,1873-5258,,OCEAN ENG,Ocean Eng.,DEC 15,2022,266,,2,,,,,,112878,10.1016/j.oceaneng.2022.112878,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2022.112878,,OCT 2022,20,"Engineering, Marine; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Ocean; Oceanography",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Oceanography,5W0FK,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000877597500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Critical scholarly insights demonstrate the roles of power and agency in determining social difference and shaping adaptive capacities across geographical contexts. Framings of resilience and adaptation have shifted to acknowledge and examine these dynamic processes and how they are deliberated and negotiated in practice. We utilise an intersectional subjectivities lens and the notion of 'negotiated resilience' as proposed by Harris and colleagues (2018) to assess the inner workings of power and agency in rural Ghanaian farming communities. Specifically, we demonstrate how new entryways for contesting and deliberating power relations can be opened, or conversely closed, within participatory arenas, here during three co-learning workshops on gender and climate change adaptation. Such insights are valuable for researchers and social actors alike to create mindful and practical spaces for (re)negotiating gendered inequalities, as a vital step toward transference into everyday realities.

It explores the existing adaptation measures against climatic stresses. It investigates the extent of resilience-building by the use of these adaptation measures and identifies major challenges that hinder the adaptation process within the country. The review was conducted by following the systematic methods of the protocol of Preferred Items for Systematic Review Recommendations (PRISMA) to comprehensively synthesize, evaluate and track scientific literature on climate-resilient agriculture in coastal Bangladesh. It considered peer-reviewed English language articles from the databasesScopus, Web of ScienceandScience Directbetween the years 2000 and 2018. A total of 54 articles were selected following the four major steps of a systematic review, i.e., identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion. Adaptation measures identified in the review were grouped into different themes: Agricultural adaptation, alternative livelihoods, infrastructure development, technological advancement, ecosystem management and policy development. The review revealed that within the adaptation and resilience literature for coastal Bangladesh, maladaptation, gender imbalance and the notable absence of studies of island communities were gaps that require future research.","[Kundu, Shilpi; Davey, Peter] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Nathan Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Kundu, Shilpi; Morgan, Edward A.; Davey, Peter] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Nathan Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Kundu, Shilpi] Sher E Bangla Agr Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Informat Syst, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh; [Kabir, Mohammad Ehsanul] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Morgan, Edward A.; Hossain, Moazzem] Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Gold Coast Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4222, Australia; [Hossain, Moazzem] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Business Strategy & Innovat, Nathan Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Hossain, Moazzem] Griffith Univ, Griffith Ctr Sustainable Enterprise, Nathan Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University (SAU); Lancaster University; Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University,"Kundu, S (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Nathan Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.;Kundu, S (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Nathan Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.;Kundu, S (corresponding author), Sher E Bangla Agr Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Informat Syst, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh.",Shilpi.kundu@griffithuni.edu.au; m.e.kabir@lancaster.ac.uk; ed.morgan@griffith.edu.au; peter.davey@griffith.edu.au; m.hossain@griffith.edu.au,"Morgan, Edward/AAX-2372-2020","Morgan, Edward/0000-0002-9239-4320; Kundu, Shilpi/0000-0002-6697-4436; Kabir, Mohammad Ehsanul/0000-0001-5438-7376",Griffith University PhD Scholarship,Griffith University PhD Scholarship,S.K. has received a Griffith University PhD Scholarship.

Youth have been identified as an at-risk population, with likely impacts on mental health and well-being. This study identifies and characterizes youth-specific protective factors that enhance well-being in light of a rapidly changing climate, and examines how climatic and environmental change challenges these. In-depth conversational interviews were conducted with youth aged 15-25 from the five communities of the Nunatsiavut region of Labrador, Canada: Nain, Hopedale, Postville, Makkovik, and Rigolet. Five key protective factors were identified as enhancing their mental health and well-being: being on the land; connecting to Inuit culture; strong communities; relationships with family and friends; and staying busy. Changing sea ice and weather conditions were widely reported to be compromising these protective factors by reducing access to the land, and increasing the danger of land-based activities. This study contributes to existing work on Northern climate change adaptation by identifying factors that enhance youth resilience and, if incorporated into adaptation strategies, may contribute to creating successful and effective adaptation responses.

The Vi Agroforestry Program aims to implement agroforestry as a means to alleviate poverty and increase resilience among the poorest smallholders. After seven years, the Vi Agroforestry Project in the Mara Region of Tanzania had an inter-village variation in the proportion of households with tangible surviving agroforestry trees ranging from 10%-90%. Using a multiple methods approach, this variation was analysed in relation to changes and differences among administrative districts and project zones regarding perceived barriers to agroforestry adoption, project interventions, governance and the chronology of the process. In districts and zones where collaboration among the project staff, government counterparts and other stakeholders had been established at multiple levels, more agroforestry trees survived and a larger proportion of households practiced agroforestry. The established collaboration made it possible to discover and consider opportunities and barriers to agroforestry development such as diverse stakeholder interests and perceptions. As a result, potential conflicts could be avoided and socially robust solutions developed, adapted and integrated into the local subsistence systems.","[Johansson, Karl-Erik; Axelsson, Robert] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Fac Forest Sci, Sch Forest Management, SE-73921 Skinnskatteberg, Sweden; [Kimanzu, Ngolia] Social Capital Innovat Int, SE-10110 Stockholm, Sweden; [Sassi, Samuel O.] Reg Commissioner Off, Mara 31000, Tanzania; [Bwana, Eliza] Local Govt Author, Prime Ministers Off, Mtwara 63000, Tanzania; [Otsyina, Robert] Dev Associates Ltd, Dar Es Salaam 11000, Tanzania",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Johansson, KE (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Fac Forest Sci, Sch Forest Management, SE-73921 Skinnskatteberg, Sweden.",kalle.johansson@slu.se; robert.axelsson@slu.se; ngolia.kimanzu@outlook.com; rasmarakilimo@yahoo.com; elizabwana@yahoo.com; rotsyina@gmail.com,"Uhlen, Mathias/B-3262-2016","Uhlen, Mathias/0000-0002-4858-8056; Johansson, Karl-Erik/0000-0003-0916-6827",FORMAS,FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas),"The authors would like to extend appreciation and gratitude to all those involved in the scaling up process in Mara and all those contributing to this study.

Scientific research offers an evidence-based approach to understanding challenges, and possible responses available to local decision makers as they manage the interface between climate change and urban environments. In March 2018, academics, practitioners and policymakers convened at the Cities and Climate Change Science Conference in Edmonton, Canada to develop an understanding of the science needed to support cities as they mitigate and adapt to climate change. This paper evaluates the process and central output of the conference, to determine how effective the transdisciplinary stakeholders were in using the conference as a platform to explore knowledge on the relationship between cities and climate change science. The paper deploys a sustainability scientific framework centred around the theme of transdisciplinarity to analyse conference documentation and interviews with academic/research, practitioner and policymaker conference organisers. Structural arrangements, power differentials, and assumptions about the prioritisation of scientific knowledge, meant that transdisciplinarity was not always achieved. Yet while the academic voice was dominant, diverse conversations were still held, as seen in the inclusion of and recognition given to the Global South issue of urban informality in the main conference output - a Global Research and Action Agenda for Cities and Climate Change Science. Through applying a framework to evaluate participatory research for sustainability, recounting some of the learnings from this methodological approach, and suggesting how the framework could be amended for future application this paper contributes towards the knowledge on evaluation of sustainability research.","[Hunter, N.

Numerous threats, including global climate change and various human activities, affect both the quantity and quality of fresh water available. Here we carried out a case study of Xiamen, a coastal city in subtropical China. Long-term data analysis showed the increasing floods and droughts that are the expected main impacts of climate change on water quality and quantity. Increasing eutrophication and harmful algal blooms in recent decades threaten water quality in Jiangdong reservoir, which supplies raw water to Xiamen and other coastal areas. In addition to excessive manganese (Mn) in surface water, other potential threats to water quality and human health include various emerging contaminants; these threats have all been scientifically detected but are beyond the scope of routine water-monitoring programs. Based on lessons learned from water supply management initiatives currently in progress, we proposed a conceptual framework for source-to-tap integrated water management in an attempt to secure clean and safe water supply. Long-term monitoring and research, adaptive management and actions to reduce nutrients and other pollutants loading are vital to protect water sources, and measures to adapt to climate change should be considered to achieve these goals. Institutional enablers for transboundary and cross-sector management were also suggested: enacting integrated water policies, developing an ecological compensation policy, authorizing the management institution, improving the incentive mechanism of cross-border compensation and transfer payments considering environmental responsibility, and encouraging multiple-stakeholder involvement.","[Chen, Nengwang; Hong, Huasheng; Gao, Xinjuan] Xiamen Univ, Coll Environm & Ecol, Coastal & Ocean Management Inst, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China; [Chen, Nengwang; Hong, Huasheng; Gao, Xinjuan] Xiamen Univ, Fujian Prov Key Lab Coastal Ecol & Environm Studi, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Chen, NW (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Coastal & Ocean Management Inst, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China.",nwchen@xmu.edu.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0502901]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41376082]; Key Projects in the Science AMP; Technology of Xiamen City [3502Z20091005],National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Projects in the Science AMP; Technology of Xiamen City,"This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0502901) , the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41376082) , and Key Projects in the Science & Technology of Xiamen City (No. 3502Z20091005) .

Geospatial information and communication technology (Geo-ICT) assisted planning is increasingly being utilised to foster urban sustainability and adaptability to climate change. To fill the theoretical and practical gaps of urban adaptive planning and Geo-ICT implementation, this article presents an urban ecosystem vulnerability assessment approach using integrated socio-ecological modelling. The application of the Geo-ICT method is demonstrated in a specific case study of climate-resilient city development in Nanjing (China), aiming at helping city decision-makers understand the general geographic data processing and policy revision processes in response to hypothetical future disruptions and pressures on urban social, economic, and environmental systems. Ideally, the conceptual framework of the climate-resilient city transition proposed in this study effectively integrates the geographic data analysis, policy modification, and participatory planning. In the process of model building, we put forward the index system of urban ecosystem vulnerability assessment and use the assessment result as input data for the socio-ecological model. As a result, the model reveals the interaction processes of local land use, economy, and environment, further generating an evolving state of future land use in the studied city. The findings of this study demonstrate that socio-ecological modelling can provide guidance in adjusting the human-land interaction and climate-resilient city development from the perspective of macro policy. The decision support using urban ecosystem vulnerability assessment and quantitative system modelling can be useful for urban development under a variety of environmental change scenarios.","[Cai, Zipan; Cvetkovic, Vladimir] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, Stockholm, Sweden; [Page, Jessica] Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog, Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology; Stockholm University,"Page, J (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog, Stockholm, Sweden.",zipan@kth.se; jessica.page@natgeo.su.se; vdc@kth.se,,"Cai, Zipan/0000-0001-7219-2222",,,,,43,3,3,4,25,COGITATIO PRESS,LISBON,"RUA FIALHO ALMEIDA 14, 2 ESQ, LISBON, 1070-129, PORTUGAL",2183-7635,,,URBAN PLAN,Urban Plan.,,2021,6,3,,,,,227,239,,10.17645/up.v6i3.4208,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/up.v6i3.4208,,,13,Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Urban Studies,WI7BD,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000708511600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Social factors like institutions can affect organizational capacities to adapt to climate change. Yet our knowledge about how different institutional designs for protected areas affect management adaptive capacity is limited. We address this gap by comparing how two models of MPA governance - centralized and collaborative (co-management) - influence the adaptive capacities of public organizations managing MPAs in East Africa. Social network analysis is used to examine external relations of MPA organizations which are interpreted through the lens of social capital theory to explain the acquisition of information and knowledge that support adaptive capacity. We find differences in the ways focal MPA organizations in the centralized and co-managed MPA systems are connected to their external partners. In the centralized system, the focal MPA organization operates in a less connected network rich in opportunities to bridge disconnected groups that can be a source of novel and diverse information. Conversely, the focal MPA organization in the co-managed system operates in a dense network of interconnected organizations that are likely to have similar information, therefore providing redundant information benefits. The composition of partners around focal MPA organizations which determines information quality is not affected by MPA governance context. We conclude that institutional context affects the relational dimensions of adaptive capacity, by giving greater or fewer opportunities for the development of either bridging or bonding social capital.","[Tuda, Arthur Omondi] Univ Cadiz, Campus Puerto Real, Cadiz 11519, Spain; [Tuda, Arthur Omondi] FUECA Fdn Univ Empresa Prov Cadiz, Cadiz 11003, Spain; [Tuda, Arthur Omondi] Univ Algarve, CIMA, Gambelas Campus, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal; [Tuda, Arthur Omondi] Kenya Wildlife Serv, POB 40241-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Machumu, Milali Ernest] Marine Pk & Reserves Unit Tanzania, POB 7565, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",Universidad de Cadiz; Universidade do Algarve,"Tuda, AO (corresponding author), Univ Cadiz, Campus Puerto Real, Cadiz 11519, Spain.",tudahke@yahoo.com,,,European Union Erasmus Mundus PhD.

To improve global-scale groundwater stress assessments, we suggest three new water quantity-related groundwater stress indicators as well as a new way for communicating projected future groundwater stress at the grid-cell level (similar to 55 x 55 km) and for larger spatial units such as transboundary aquifers (>20,000 km(2)). The new indicators encompass the ratio of net abstractions from groundwater to groundwater recharge, human-induced changes in groundwater discharge, and human-induced groundwater depletion. We compare them to four conventional indicators used in the Transboundary Waters Assessment Programme and show how they can add value to global-scale studies or are even more suitable for indicating groundwater stress. We assess potentials and limitations of all indicators by addressing their level of process representation, data requirements, uncertainty, and the underlying different concepts of sustainable groundwater use. To support adaptation to climate change, we recommend showing both the ensemble mean and the worst-case scenario of future groundwater stress that we derived from five climate and two irrigation scenarios. For characterizing groundwater stress in spatial units such as transboundary aquifers, areal fractions where a selected indicator threshold is exceeded should be considered. Finally, hot spots of future groundwater stress should be identified by combining relative changes from current conditions with absolute values of future groundwater stress.","[Herbert, Claudia; Doell, Petra] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Phys Geog, Frankfurt, Germany; [Doell, Petra] Senckenberg Leibniz Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr F, Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Herbert, C (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Phys Geog, Frankfurt, Germany.",c.herbert@em.uni-frankfurt.de,"Döll, Petra/A-3784-2009","Döll, Petra/0000-0003-2238-4546",Global Environment Facility (GEF) within the framework of the Transboundary Waters Assessment Programme (TWAP),Global Environment Facility (GEF) within the framework of the Transboundary Waters Assessment Programme (TWAP),"Part of this study was funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) within the framework of the Transboundary Waters Assessment Programme (TWAP).

As the need for adapting to climate change challenges increases, the development of reliable climate projections becomes a crucial task. In this study, a regional climate modeling system, Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS), is used to simulate the temperature patterns in Ontario. Three PRECIS runs with a resolution of 25 km x 25 km are carried out to simulate the present (1961-1990) temperature variations. There is a good match between the simulated and observed data, which validates the performance of PRECIS in reproducing temperature changes in Ontario. Future changes of daily maximum, mean, and minimum temperatures during the period 2071-2100 are then projected under the IPCC SRES A2 and B2 emission scenarios using PRECIS. Spatial variations of annual mean temperature, mean diurnal range, and temperature seasonality are generated. Furthermore, heat waves defined based on the exceedance of local climatology and their temporal and spatial characteristics are analyzed. The results indicate that the highest temperature and the most intensive heat waves are most likely to occur at the Toronto-Windsor corridor in Southern Ontario. The Northern Ontario, in spite of the relatively low projected temperature, would be under the risk of long-lasting heat waves, and thus needs effective measures to enhance its climate resilience in the future. This study can assist the decision makers in better understanding the future temperature changes in Ontario and provide decision support for mitigating heat-related loss.","[Li, Zhong; Huang, Wendy] McMaster Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada; [Huang, Guohe; Liao, Renfei; Fan, Yurui] Univ Regina, Inst Energy Environm & Sustainabil Res, UR NCEPU, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [Huang, Guohe; Lin, Qianguo] North China Elect Power Univ, Inst Energy Environm & Sustainabil Res, UR NCEPU, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China",McMaster University; University of Regina; North China Electric Power University,"Huang, GH (corresponding author), Univ Regina, Inst Energy Environm & Sustainabil Res, UR NCEPU, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.;Huang, GH (corresponding author), North China Elect Power Univ, Inst Energy Environm & Sustainabil Res, UR NCEPU, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",huang@iseis.org,"Huang, Guohe/H-5306-2011; Huang, Guohe/AAA-7305-2019; FAN, Yurui/F-5949-2012","Huang, Guohe/0000-0003-4974-3019; FAN, Yurui/0000-0002-0532-4026; Li, Zhong/0000-0001-9869-006X",Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),This research was supported by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change and the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada.,,41,9,9,1,40,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

Interest in investments in green infrastructure (interconnected systems of parks, wetlands, gardens and other green spaces), as well as in restoration of urban ecosystems as part of such adaptation strategies, is growing worldwide. Previous research has highlighted the insurance value of ecosystems in securing the supply of ecosystem services in the face of disturbance and change, yet this literature neglects urban areas even though urban populations are often highly vulnerable. We revisit the insurance value literature to examine the applicability of the concept in urban contexts, illustrating it with two case studies: watersheds providing drinking water for residents of Vancouver, Canada; and private gardens ensuring connectedness between other parts of urban green infrastructure in London, UK. Our research supports the notion that investments in green infrastructure can enhance insurance value, reducing vulnerability and the costs of adaptation to climate change and other environmental change. Although we recommend that urban authorities consider the insurance value of ecosystems in their decision-making matrix, we advise caution in relying upon monetary evaluations of insurance value. We conclude by identifying actions and management strategies oriented to maintain or enhance the insurance value of urban ecosystems. Ecosystems that are themselves resilient to external disturbances are better able to provide insurance for broader social-ecological systems.","[Green, Tom L.] Simon Fraser Univ, Ctr Dialogue, 3305-515 Hastings St West, Vancouver, BC V6B 5K3, Canada; [Kronenberg, Jakub] Univ Lodz, Dept Int Econ, POW 3-5, PL-90255 Lodz, Poland; [Andersson, Erik; Elmqvist, Thomas] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Gomez-Baggethun, Erik] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway; [Gomez-Baggethun, Erik] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, Univ Tunet 3, N-1430 As, Norway",Simon Fraser University; University of Lodz; Stockholm University; Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Green, TL (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Ctr Dialogue, 3305-515 Hastings St West, Vancouver, BC V6B 5K3, Canada.",tom@viableeconomics.com,"Andersson, Erik/AAE-9771-2019; Elmqvist, Thomas/AAY-6344-2021; Kronenberg, Jakub/ABD-9941-2021","Elmqvist, Thomas/0000-0002-4617-6197; Kronenberg, Jakub/0000-0003-4903-2401; Andersson, Erik/0000-0003-2716-5502; Green, Tom L./0000-0001-9096-4476",BioDiversa URBES project; GREEN SURGE EU FP7 collaborative project [FP7-ENV.2013.6.2-5-603567]; OpenNESS EU FP7 ENVIRONMENT project [308428],BioDiversa URBES project; GREEN SURGE EU FP7 collaborative project; OpenNESS EU FP7 ENVIRONMENT project,"We appreciate the helpful comments of two anonymous reviewers.

Global warming will likely affect marine circulation and land-atmosphere-ocean exchanges at the regional level, affecting the productivity and biodiversity patterns along the HCLME. The expected decrease of upwelling productivity in the HCS could be amplified by worldwide trends of oxygen depletion and lower pH. In addition, higher frequency of extreme climatic events, such as El Nino in a warmer ocean, might augment the risks for the recruitment success of anchovy and other short-lived fish resources, especially in the Northern HCLME. A range of non-climatic anthropogenic stressors also combines to reduce productivity and biomass yields. Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) work has shown that overfishing and pollution are the main contributing factors in addition to the shared problem between Chile and Peru of high levels of fisheries bycatch and discards. An economic valuation of the HCLME and HCS has been finalized with an estimated annual delivery of around USD19.5 billion in goods and services. With many knowledge gaps this is evidently an underestimate but indicates which mitigating activities under a recently developed bi-national Strategic Action Programme (SAP) need to be prioritized.

Because climate variability in Mexico has important socio-economic and environmental impacts, it is necessary to build capacities for adaptation. We describe social perceptions of three main local stakeholders (that is, farmers, elders, and local authorities), regarding their relationships with rainforest and local adaptation to climate change in eleven rural communities in Marqu,s de Comillas municipality, Chiapas, Southern Mexico. We based in a qualitative approach and used participant observation and semi-structured interviews. Even certain subtly variation among stakeholders, we recognized some underlying ideas behind perceptions. Rainforest is considered crucial to maintain human livelihoods and to mitigate climatic changes. They perceived changes in climate occurring in the region, such as raising temperature, unpredictable rainfall, and streams becoming dry. Local organization and government involved in managing rainforest or dealing with climatic changes are practically absent. This emphasizes the needs bring proper and reliable information to make decisions regarding rainforest use and management, but also to adapt to a changing climate. The loss of the collective character of the communities and, certain conflicts in public policies that mirrored in the coexistence of initiatives with contrasting objectives are proposed as particularly important for understanding the emergence of these perceptions. We proposed some recommendations to bolster regional capacities addressing climate change. Involving stakeholders such as governmental and non-governmental institutions is also imperative.","[Meli, Paula] Nat & Ecosistemas Mexicanos AC, Mexico City 01000, DF, Mexico; [Landa, Rosalva] Ctr Interdisciplinario Biodiversidad & Ambiente A, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Lopez-Medellin, Xavier] Univ Autnoma Estado Morelos, Dept Manejo Recursos Nat & Educ Ambiental, CIByC, Cuernavaca 62209, Morelos, Mexico; [Carabias, Julia] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Mexico City 45210, DF, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Morelos; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Meli, P (corresponding author), Nat & Ecosistemas Mexicanos AC, Plaza San Jacinto 23-D, Mexico City 01000, DF, Mexico.",paula@naturamexicana.org.mx,", 0000-0001-5390-7552/G-1872-2018; Medellín, Xavier López/AAF-8469-2020",", 0000-0001-5390-7552/0000-0001-5390-7552; Medellín, Xavier López/0000-0002-5383-1559",Pemex; WWS-FCS Alliance; Facultadde Ciencias-UNAM [INE/A1-042/08],Pemex; WWS-FCS Alliance; Facultadde Ciencias-UNAM,"WethankM.

To improve efficiency in carbon emission reduction, and enhance adaptability of cities to climate change, it is essential to undertake accounting of urban carbon cycle. This plays a prominent role in global carbon cycle. An integrated accounting framework for urban carbon cycle was established herein to support uniform accounting and place-specific comparisons, covering natural and artificial carbon cycles, vertical and horizontal carbon flows, carbon storage and fluxes, and carbon inputs and outputs:Guangyuan, a mountainous city in China that was seriously stricken by Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, was chosen as the case to demonstrate the framework and investigate the effects of postearthquake reconstruction on carbon cycle. The results show: 1) the proposed framework could effectively assess dynamics of carbon cycle under external disturbances, 2) there were abundant vegetation and correspondingly a large natural carbon tank and vertical carbon input, and low industrialization degree and correspondingly small horizontal and vertical carbon outputs in Guangyuan, 3) the postearthquake reconstruction led to a series of impacts on carbon cycle, from both aspects of amount and structure, and 4) such impacts of post-earthquake construction on artificial carbon cycle were distinct with a tendency toward low-carbon development in Guangyuan. The results were helpful for investigating the effects of natural disturbance and human interference on urban carbon cycle, which in turn could improve the adaptation to climate change.

Parabolic dunes can develop from the stabilisation of highly mobile barchan dunes and transverse dunes as well as from blowouts, as a consequence of colonisation and establishment of vegetation when aeolian sand transport is reduced and/or when water stress is relieved (by increasing precipitation, for instance). Conversely, existing parabolic dunes can be activated and may be transformed into barchan dunes and/or transverse dunes when vegetation suffers environmental or anthropogenic stresses. Predicted increases in temperature and drought severity in various regions raise concerns that dune activation and transformations may intensify, and this intensification would have far-reaching implications for environmental, social, and economic sustainability. To date, a broad examination of the development of parabolic dunes and their related transformations across a variety of climate gradients has been absent. This paper reviews existing literature, compares data on the morphology and development of parabolic dunes in a comprehensive global inventory, and scrutinises the mechanisms of different dune transformations and the eco-geomorphic interactions involved. This knowledge is then integrated into a conceptual framework to facilitate understanding and prediction of potential aeolian dune transformations induced by changes in environmental controls and human activities. This conceptual framework can aid judicious land management policies for better adaptations to climatic changes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Yan, Na; Baas, Andreas C.

As the impacts of climate change intensify, it becomes increasingly important that high-resolution climate services are made available to Indigenous decision makers for the development of climate change adaptation plans. This paper examined extreme climate trends in the Six Nations of the Grand River reserve, the most populated Indigenous community in Canada. A set of 12 indices were used to evaluate changes in extreme climate events from 1951 to 2013, and 2006 to 2099 under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5. Results indicated that from 1951 to 2013, Six Nations became warmer and wetter with an average temperature increase of 0.7 degrees C and precipitation increase of 42 mm. Over this period, the frequency and duration of extreme heat and extreme precipitation events also increased, while extreme cold events decreased. In the future (2006 to 2099), temperature is expected to increase by 3 to 6 degrees C, while seasonal precipitation is expected to increase in winter, early spring, and fall. Projected rate of increase of heatwaves is 0.4 to 1.5 days per year and extreme annual rainfall events is 0.2 to 0.5 mm per year under both RCP scenarios. The climate information and data provide by this study will help Six Nations' decision makers in planning for climate change impacts.","[Deen, Tariq A.; Arain, M.

Therefore, we chose the highly urbanized San Francisco Bay Area as an example to project its flood areas every 20 years between 2000 and 2100, under 24 varied climate scenarios with two greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration levels. We then assessed flood exposure by intersecting the flood areas with demographic and socioeconomic distributions, developed areas, lifeline infrastructures, and emergency responders in low elevation ( < 10 m) coastal zones. Our median estimates under the low GHG scenarios indicated that 10-38% of the items assessed above are flood-exposed in 2000-2020, with this exposure increasing to 20-54% during 2080-2100. The median estimates under the high GHG scenarios for the same periods are 0-35% and 40-67%, respectively. The expected uncertainties, or standard deviations, of the exposures for a given item assessed above under the low and high GHG scenarios are 1-2% in 2000-2020 and 7-10% in 2080-2100. Despite our modeling capability for a range of climate scenarios over the long term, some stakeholders, particularly those in the private sector, prefer near-term results with lower uncertainties. This implies the need for coastal urban areas to cope with climate-related uncertainties and to focus on the long term when developing strategies and policies for climate change adaptation.","[Ju, Yang; Lindbergh, Sarah; He, Yiyi; Radke, John D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Radke, John D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept City & Reg Planning, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Ju, Y (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",yangju90@berkeley.edu; sarah_lindbergh@berkeley.edu; yiyi_he@berkeley.edu; ratt@berkeley.edu,"Ju, Yang/AAI-8472-2021","Ju, Yang/0000-0002-1947-7533; Lindbergh, Sarah/0000-0002-0138-3088",Petroleum Violation Escrow Account (PVEA) through the California Energy Commission [FED-15-001],Petroleum Violation Escrow Account (PVEA) through the California Energy Commission,"This work is funded by the Petroleum Violation Escrow Account (PVEA) through the California Energy Commission, grant FED-15-001 to the University of California, Berkeley.

This paper explores the effects of climate change coping and adaptation responses in three case study villages across the Central Gonja district of northern Ghana. The study addresses the following research questions: i) What are the key climatic and non-climatic stressors confronting households in northern Ghanaian communities? ii) How are households adapting to climatic and non-climatic stressors? and iii) What are the outcomes of these coping and adaptation responses on development? The study employs a mixed-method approach including key informant interviews, focus group discussions and household questionnaire surveys. Data identified socioeconomic stressors including a lack of access to (and high cost of) farm inputs, labour shortages and population growth. Climatic stressors include erratic rainfall, high temperature, droughts and floods. Climatic and non-climatic stressors interact to affect agricultural practices and related livelihoods. The study identified various adaptation measures including extensification and intensification of agriculture, temporary migration, planting of drought resistant varieties, irrigation, and livelihood diversification. We show that many coping measures (e.g. livelihood diversifications activities such as selling of firewood and charcoal production) and adaptation responses (including intensification, extensification and irrigation) currently deliver maladaptive outcomes, resulting in lock-ins that could exacerbate future climate vulnerabilities. The paper contributes to the growing literature on adaptation and climate risk management by providing empirical evidence showing how coping and adaptations measures can deliver maladaptive outcomes in vulnerable communities.","[Antwi-Agyei, Philip] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Kumasi, Ghana; [Dougill, Andrew J.; Stringer, Lindsay C.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Codjoe, Samuel Nii Ardey] Univ Ghana, Reg Inst Populat Studies, Legon, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Leeds; University of Ghana,"Antwi-Agyei, P (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Sci, Dept Environm Sci, PMB, Univ PO, Kumasi, Ghana.",pantwi-agyei.sci@knust.edu.gh,"Antwi-Agyei, Philip/AAI-7392-2020","Antwi-Agyei, Philip/0000-0002-8599-474X","Department for International Development (DfID) under the Climate Impact Research Capacity and Leadership Enhancement (CIRCLE) programme; UK ESRC's Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy University of Leeds, UK [ES/K006576/1]; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish","Department for International Development (DfID) under the Climate Impact Research Capacity and Leadership Enhancement (CIRCLE) programme; UK ESRC's Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy University of Leeds, UK; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","This research was supported by funding from the Department for International Development (DfID) under the Climate Impact Research Capacity and Leadership Enhancement (CIRCLE) programme.

However, there is little empirical evidence to support this notion. In this study, we investigate the relationship between climate shocks and migration between rural and urban areas within Mexico. We combine individual records from the 2000 and 2010 Mexican censuses (n = 683,518) with high-resolution climate data from Terra Populus that are linked to census data at the municipality level (n = 2321). We measure climate shocks as monthly deviation from a 30-year (1961-1990) long-term climate normal period, and uncover important nonlinearities using quadratic and cubic specifications. Satellite-based measures of urban extents allow us to classify migrant-sending and migrant-receiving municipalities as rural or urban to examine four internal migration patterns: rural-urban, rural-rural, urban-urban, and urban-rural. Among our key findings, results from multilevel models reveal that each additional drought month increases the odds of rural-urban migration by 3.6%. In contrast, the relationship between heat months and rural-urban migration is nonlinear. After a threshold of similar to 34 heat months is surpassed, the relationship between heat months and rural-urban migration becomes positive and progressively increases in strength. Policy and programmatic interventions may therefore reduce climate induced rural-urban migration in Mexico through rural climate change adaptation initiatives, while also assisting rural migrants in finding employment and housing in urban areas to offset population impacts.","[Nawrotzki, Raphael J.; DeWaard, Jack; Bakhtsiyarava, Maryia; Ha, Jasmine Trang] Univ Minnesota, Minnesota Populat Ctr, 225 19th Ave South,50 Willey Hall, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [DeWaard, Jack; Ha, Jasmine Trang] Univ Minnesota, Dept Sociol, 225 19th Ave South,50 Willey Hall, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Bakhtsiyarava, Maryia] Univ Minnesota, Dept Geog, 225 19th Ave South,50 Willey Hall, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Nawrotzki, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Minnesota Populat Ctr, 225 19th Ave South,50 Willey Hall, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",r.nawrotzki@gmail.com; jdewaard@umn.edu; bakht013@umn.edu; haxxx132@umn.edu,"Bakhtsiyarava, Maryia/GPS-5031-2022","Bakhtsiyarava, Maryia/0000-0001-5327-4556",Minnesota Population Center [R24 HD041023]; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD); National Science Foundation funded Terra Populus project (NSF Award) [ACI-0940818]; U.S. Consulate General Toronto; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) [0940818] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Minnesota Population Center; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD); National Science Foundation funded Terra Populus project (NSF Award)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Consulate General Toronto; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge support from the Minnesota Population Center (#R24 HD041023), funded through grants from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).

Invasive mosquitoes have become widely established across Europe, with subsequent transmission and outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya virus. Malaria has re-emerged in Greece, and West Nile virus has emerged throughout parts of eastern Europe. Tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme disease, continue to increase, or, in the case of tick-borne encephalitis and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever viruses, have changed their geographical distribution. From a veterinary perspective, the emergence of Bluetongue and Schmallenberg viruses show that northern Europe is equally susceptible to transmission of vector-borne disease. These changes are in part due to increased globalisation, with intercontinental air travel and global shipping transport creating new opportunities for invasive vectors and pathogens. However, changes in vector distributions are being driven by climatic changes and changes in land use, infrastructure, and the environment. In this Review, we summarise the risks posed by vector-borne diseases in the present and the future from a UK perspective, and assess the likely effects of climate change and, where appropriate, climate-change adaptation strategies on vector-borne disease risk in the UK. Lessons from the outbreaks of West Nile virus in North America and chikungunya in the Caribbean emphasise the need to assess future vector-borne disease risks and prepare contingencies for future outbreaks. Ensuring that adaptation strategies for climate change do not inadvertently exacerbate risks should be a primary focus for decision makers.","[Medlock, Jolyon M.; Leach, Steve A.] Publ Hlth England, Emergency Response Dept, Med Entomol Grp, Salisbury SP4 0JG, Wilts, England; [Medlock, Jolyon M.] Publ Hlth England, NIHR Hlth Protect Res Unit Emerging & Zoonot Infe, Salisbury SP4 0JG, Wilts, England; [Medlock, Jolyon M.] Publ Hlth England, NIHR Hlth Protect Res Unit Environm Change & Hlth, Salisbury SP4 0JG, Wilts, England",Public Health England; Public Health England; Public Health England,"Medlock, JM (corresponding author), Publ Hlth England, Emergency Response Dept, Med Entomol Grp, Salisbury SP4 0JG, Wilts, England.",jolyon.medlock@phe.gov.uk,,,National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Environmental Change and Health at the London School of Hygiene AMP; Tropical Medicine in partnership; Public Health England (PHE); NIHR HPRU on Emerging Infections and Zoonoses at the University of Liverpool in partnership; PHE; Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine,National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Environmental Change and Health at the London School of Hygiene AMP; Tropical Medicine in partnership; Public Health England (PHE); NIHR HPRU on Emerging Infections and Zoonoses at the University of Liverpool in partnership; PHE; Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine,"JM was partly funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Environmental Change and Health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in partnership with Public Health England (PHE), and in collaboration with the University of Exeter, University College London, and the Met Office; and partly funded by the NIHR HPRU on Emerging Infections and Zoonoses at the University of Liverpool in partnership with PHE and Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.

How to define and categorize climate engineering options has been a recurring issue in both public and specialist discussions. We assert here that current definitions of mitigation, adaptation, and climate engineering are ambiguous, overlap with each other and thus contribute to confusing the discourse on how to tackle anthropogenic climate change. We propose a new and more inclusive categorization into five different classes: anthropogenic emissions reductions (AER), territorial or domestic removal of atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases (D-GGR), trans-territorial removal of atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases (T-GGR), regional to planetary targeted climate modification (TCM), and climate change adaptation measures (including local targeted climate and environmental modification, abbreviated CCAM). Thus, we suggest that techniques for domestic greenhouse gas removal might better be thought of as forming a separate category alongside more traditional mitigation techniques that consist of emissions reductions. Local targeted climate modification can be seen as an adaptation measure as long as there are no detectable remote environmental effects. In both cases, the scale and intensity of action are essential attributes from the technological, climatic, and political viewpoints. While some of the boundaries in this revised classification depend on policy and judgement, it offers a foundation for debating on how to define and categorize climate engineering options and differentiate them from both mitigation and adaptation measures to climate change.

An understanding of how ecosystem services are provided along rural-urban gradients is crucial in the task of conserving and enhancing vital services in urban environments, increasing the quality of life of urban dwellers, and working towards a sustainable future. Focusing on nine ecosystem services - aesthetic, spiritual, recreation, water flow regulation, carbon sequestration, climate change adaptation, pollination, biodiversity potential, and noise attenuation - regarded as important to urban areas the authors detail the changes in the values of these services along a gradient comprising four categories of urbanisation: urban, suburban, pen-urban and rural, in Greater Manchester, UK. The data on which the discussion is based are derived from an interdisciplinary assessment tool, developed from a selection of previously used assessment methods including the Residential Environment Assessment Tool and the Green Flag Award. Based on a mixture of a field and desktop study, the new tool assigns non-economic values of 0-10 to the selected services, allowing for evaluation of quality between, as well as within, each category of ecosystem service. Trends in the results are discussed, as are drivers for the changes in values along the rural-urban gradient. It is foreseen that this new body of knowledge will allow both practitioners and academics to gain further insight into the provision of ecosystem services along a rural-urban gradient to allow them to tackle the problems associated with them and to optimise open space planning.

The vulnerability of residential construction may be reduced by an adaptation strategy that increases design wind speeds specified by Australian standards. The paper applies break-even analysis to compare the risks, costs and benefits of climate adaptation strategies for new housing in the three largest cities in Australia: Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. These cities are located in southeast Australia where wind hazard is dominated by synoptic winds (thunderstorms and east-coast lows). Break-even estimates of risk reduction and adaptation cost for designing new housing to enhanced standards were calculated for three synoptic wind pattern scenarios to 2070: (1) no change, (2) B1 and (3) A1FI emission scenarios. If the actual cost of adaptation exceeds the predicted break-even value, then adaptation is not cost-effective. It was found that this adaptation strategy can lead to risk reductions of 50-80 % at a cost of approximately 1 % of house replacement value. If risk reduction is over 50 %, discount rate is 4 %, and there is no change of climate, the break-even analysis shows that adaptation is cost-effective for Sydney if the adaptation cost is less than 5-9 % of house replacement cost. Designing new housing to enhance wind classifications is also likely to be a cost-effective adaptation strategy for Brisbane and Melbourne.","Univ Newcastle, Ctr Infrastruct Performance & Reliabil, Newcastle, NSW 2300, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Stewart, MG (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Ctr Infrastruct Performance & Reliabil, Newcastle, NSW 2300, Australia.",mark.stewart@newcastle.edu.au,,"Stewart, Mark/0000-0001-6887-6533",Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),"The author appreciates the financial support of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Flagship Cluster Fund through the project Climate Adaptation Engineering for Extreme Events in collaboration with the Sustainable Cities and Coasts Theme, the CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship.

Based on the vulnerability analysis framework of the vulnerability scoping diagram, a vulnerability evaluation index system for inland fisheries in China was constructed in three dimensions, including exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. The entropy method was used to evaluate the flood disaster vulnerability of China's inland fisheries from 2010 to 2019 and its decomposition. The temporal and spatial differences between vulnerability and its decomposition were analyzed. Kernel density estimation and factor contribution model were used to analyze the changing trend of vulnerability and main influencing factors. The results show that: during the study period, the vulnerability of inland fisheries in China to flood disasters showed a fluctuating downward trend, and the high vulnerability areas were mainly distributed in South China and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River; the exposure index first decreased and then increased, and the high-exposure regions were mainly concentrated in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River; the sensitivity index first decreased and then increased, and the high-sensitivity areas were concentrated in North-east China, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and South China; the adaptive capacity index showed a downward trend, and the areas with lower adaptive capacity were concentrated in the South-west and North-west. From the factor contribution model, the economic losses of fishery floods and the affected area had the greatest impact on the exposure index; fingerling production and freshwater fishery production had the greatest impact on the sensitivity index; the index with a lower contribution to the adaptive capacity index was the total power of fishery machinery and fishery technology promotion. Therefore, building reservoirs, optimizing aquaculture layout and promoting fishery modernization are the keys to reducing the vulnerability of inland fisheries to flood disasters.","[Lu, Honggang; Zheng, Jiaxi; Ou, Hanyun; Liu, Yinong; Li, Xijian] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Business Adm, Agr Econ, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Zheng, JX (corresponding author), Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Business Adm, Agr Econ, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",470507355@qq.com,"liu, yi/GXE-9662-2022",,"Key Project of Discipline Construction of Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, A Study on the Effective Connection between Consolidating and Expanding Poverty Alleviation Achievements and Rural Revitalization [XKHJ202118]","Key Project of Discipline Construction of Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, A Study on the Effective Connection between Consolidating and Expanding Poverty Alleviation Achievements and Rural Revitalization","This project was supported by the Key Project of Discipline Construction of Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, A Study on the Effective Connection between Consolidating and Expanding Poverty Alleviation Achievements and Rural Revitalization (Project No. XKHJ202118).",,40,0,0,10,13,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

These conflicts arise from the different perception that individuals, collectives, private companies and the State have about the potential impacts of aquaculture on the environment and quality of life. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of aquaculture projects in Chile is the main administrative tool for decision-making, allowing identify, predict, and propose preventive measures to mitigate negative consequences of this growing sector. This article analyzes the performance of the EIA in Chile concerning aquaculture projects between 1994 and 2019. Of the 5323 projects entering the Chilean EIA during this period, the EIA system-performance analysis selected the 71 most representative. For a reliable comparative analysis, the selected projects were first classified in accordance with the active regulation within the period. Subsequently, 14 performance indicators were selected and similarities-by means of a principal coordinate analysis-were explored. Significant differences between the third (SD40) and the first two (SD30 and SD95) regulations were observed. Based on these results and considering demands of local communities and social leaders (who request continuous articulations among technical areas, administrative tools, and policies to increase the sustainability standards of aquaculture), four opportunities for improving the EIA in aquaculture projects are proposed: incorporation of synergistic and cumulative effects, adaptation to climate change, development of a general methodology, and incorporation of early citizen participation (in projects having environmental charge) increasing the performance and confidence of the EIA. The introduced methodology enables comparisons of the EIA process in different regulatory periods using indicators, serving as guidance to evaluate the performance of the EIA in aquaculture. This methodology can also be used by other aquaculture producing countries around the world.","[Rodriguez-Luna, Dante] Catholic Univ Murcia, Dept Civil Engn, Murcia 30107, Spain; [Rodriguez-Luna, Dante; Alcala, Francisco Javier] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Ingn, Inst Ciencias Quim Aplicadas, Santiago 8910060, Chile; [Vela, Nuria] Catholic Univ Murcia, Fac Hlth Sci, Appl Technol Grp Environm Hlth, Murcia 30107, Spain; [Alcala, Francisco Javier] CSIC, IGME, Geol Survey Spain, Rios Rosas 23, Madrid 28003, Spain; [Encina-Montoya, Francisco] Catholic Univ Temuco, Nucleus Environm Studies, Temuco 4781312, Chile",Universidad Catolica de Murcia; Universidad Autonoma de Chile; Universidad Catolica de Murcia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universidad Catolica de Temuco,"Encina-Montoya, F (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Temuco, Nucleus Environm Studies, Temuco 4781312, Chile.",derodriguez@alu.ucam.edu; nvela@ucam.edu; fj.alcala@igme.es; fencina@uct.cl,"Vela, Nuria/L-5843-2014; Alcalá, Francisco Javier/C-4533-2013","Vela, Nuria/0000-0002-9825-3326; Alcalá, Francisco Javier/0000-0002-8165-8669",,,,,55,4,4,4,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2021,13,16,,,,,,,9006,10.3390/su13169006,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13169006,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UH3SS,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000689855800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Cities are developing climate change action plans (CCAPs) focusing their efforts on reducing GHG emissions and adapting to climate change impacts. Despite having the highest urban population in the world, there are a few studies on urban CCAPs in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region. This study assessed the level of integration of mitigation and adaptation (IMA) in urban climate change plans across 44 major LAC cities. The level of IMA was measured by the utilization of the IMA index, a comprehensive evaluation framework of indicators. The results showed that more than half of the examined LAC cities have a moderate level of IMA. The study further explored and statistically analyzed 42 institutional, socioeconomic and environmental factors to identify which ones potentially drive or constrain the level of IMA. Five out of 42 factors were found to have a significant impact (p-value < 0.05) on the IMA index. Of the five significant factors, memberships in regional networks FLACMA and UCCI respectively, and donor agencies' contribution to the development of urban policies had a positive impact on IMA index; while the national climate fund and membership in the global network Urban LEDS had a negative impact. This suggests that cities are most likely to integrate mitigation and adaptation when the development of their CCAPs are supported by donor agencies or collaborating with other cities. The results highlight the important role of donor agencies, international organizations and cities' networks on providing the necessary capacity to cities for addressing climate change in an integrated manner.","[Kim, Hyejung] Global Green Growth Inst, Laos Country Off, Vientiane Capital, Laos; [Grafakos, Stelios] Global Green Growth Inst, Off Thought Leadership, Seoul, South Korea; [Grafakos, Stelios] Erasmus Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Dev Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Grafakos, S (corresponding author), Global Green Growth Inst, Off Thought Leadership, Seoul, South Korea.;Grafakos, S (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Dev Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",stelios.grafakos@gggi.org,,"Grafakos, Stelios/0000-0002-6821-0667; Kim, Hyejung/0000-0001-9387-7036",,,,,35,9,10,2,4,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

Rapid urbanization and industrialization in China urge the search for integrated strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change, which not only limit to traditional infrastructure sectors, but also cover urban green infrastructure, because plants and soils function as carbon sinks through biotic sequestration. This study presents a nationwide study about how urban green infrastructure could contribute to the carbon balance in 35 major Chinese cities. By the end of 2010, the total area of urban green spaces (the dominant components of urban green infrastructure) accounts for 6.38% of the total land area of these cities and represented 51.7% of the total urban green spaces of all 657 cities in China. Based on empirical data from the literature, the total amount of carbon stored in the vegetation of the urban green infrastructure of 35 cities was estimated at 18.7 million tons, with an average carbon density of 21.34 t/ha. In 2010, the amount of carbon sequestration totaled 1.90 million tons with an average carbon sequestration rate of 2.16 t/ha/year. Collectively, only 0.33% of the carbon emissions from fossil fuel combustion can be offset, ranging from 0.01% in Hohhot to 22.45% in Haikou. Nevertheless, the dominance of young vegetation stands in Chinese urban green infrastructure suggests this small carbon sequestration efficiency could become substantial in the near future, given that appropriate policies and management practices are adopted to promote urban green infrastructure for climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Diversification not only expands the number of potential crop types for market, it also improves agroecosystem functioning by building redundancy into the agricultural system and allowing for innovation in areas exhibiting impacts of climate variability. While the driving forces behind and impacts of crop diversification have been extensively investigated, there are particular issues for the prospects of crop diversification to reduce household vulnerability within semiarid agricultural systems. The decision to diversify crops is a particularly challenging one for farmers in semi-arid systems. Semi-arid systems can exhibit greater variability in annual precipitation in areas that are marginal for agricultural production. Changes to the timing of the growing season (onset of rains) and mid-season dry periods in particular pose significant challenges to farmers in semi-arid ecosystems. This paper examines the spatial diversification of crop types across an upland-lowland gradient on Mount Kenya's northwestern slopes. We perform regression analyses using household-level survey data collected during the summer of 2012 to investigate the factors contributing to varying levels of crop diversification and implications for crop production in a semi-arid irrigated agricultural system. We hypothesize that the study area locations at higher elevations will be able to grow a greater variety of crops due to climate suitability. Our analysis demonstrates that household-level income, field size, exposure to agricultural extension officers, and suitability of environmental conditions are related to the likelihood of smallholder crop diversification. More favorable growing conditions appear to outweigh limitations posed by inaccessibility and financial constraints, which has implications for adaptation to climate change in semi-arid ecosystems. We discuss the results in the context of challenges posed by global environmental change. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In Ghana, only few studies have documented these linkages. To establish this link the study provides historical and predicted climatic changes for two drought sensitive agro-ecological zones in Ghana and further determines how these changes have influenced crop production within the two zones. This objective was attained via Markov chain and Fuzzy modelling. Results from the Markov chain model point to the fact that the Guinea savanna agro-ecological zone has experienced delayed rains from 1960 to 2008 while the Sudan savanna agro-ecological zone had slightly earlier rains for the same period. Results of Fuzzy Modelling indicate that very suitable and moderately suitable croplands for millet and sorghum production are evenly distributed within the two agro-ecological zones. For Ghana to adapt to climate change and thereby achieve food security, it is important to pursue strategies such as expansion of irrigated agricultural areas, improvement of crop water productivity in rain-fed agriculture, crop improvement and specialisation, and improvement in indigenous technology. It is also important to encourage farmers in the Sudan and Guinea Savanna zones to focus on the production of cereals and legumes (e.g. sorghum, millet and soybeans) as the edaphic and climatic factors favour these crops and will give the farmers a competitive advantage. It may be necessary to consider the development of the study area as the main production and supply source of selected cereals and legumes for the entire country in order to free lands in other regions for the production of crops highly suitable for those regions on the basis of their edaphic and climatic conditions.","[Armah, Frederick A.; Afrifa, Ernest K.

Analysis of rainfall and river flow records during the 20th century demonstrates high levels of interannual and interdecadal variability. This is experienced locally and regionally in the headwater regions of the Nile and internationally through its effects on downstream Nile flows in Sudan and Egypt. Examples of climate variability are presented from areas in the basin where it exerts a strong influence on society; the Ethiopian highlands (links with food security), Lake Victoria (management of non-stationary lake levels) and Egypt (exposure to interdecadal variability of Nile flows). These examples reveal adaptations across various scales by individuals and institutions acting alongside other social and economic considerations. Water resources management in the downstream riparian Egypt has involved institutional level reactive adaptations to prolonged periods of low and high Nile flows. Observed responses include the establishment of more robust contingency planning and early warning systems alongside strategic assessment of water use and planning in response to low flows during the 1980s. In the 1990s high flows have enabled Egypt to pursue opportunistic policies to expand irrigation. These policies are embedded in wider sociopolitical and economic considerations but increase Egypt's exposure and sensitivity to climate driven fluctuations in Nile flows. Analysis of climate change projections for the region shows there is no clear indication of how Nile flows will be affected because of uncertainty about future rainfall patterns in the basin. In many instances the most appropriate entry point for adaptation to climate change will be coping with climate variability and will play out against the certainty of looming national water scarcity in Egypt due to rapid population growth and its possible exacerbation by water demands from upstream riparians.

Therefore, assessing their vulnerabilities and the potential for natural habitats to contribute to protecting coastal areas and communities is essential for effective long-term planning, sustainability, and resilient coastal management. This study modeled and mapped coastal vulnerability using the InVEST 3.9.1 model developed by the Natural Capital Project Coastal Vulnerability model to explore the role of natural habitats in mitigating coastal hazards in Southern Al Sharqiya and Al Wusta Governorates of the Sultanate of Oman. The results showed that the highest hazard classification > 2.67 represented 18% of the coastal distribution, the intermediate hazard classification ranging between 2.31 and 2.66 represented 38% of the coastal distribution, and the lowest hazard classification ranging between 1.22 and 2.30) represented 44% of the coastal distribution. These results, however, did not account for the role of natural habitats in coastal protection. In terms of the role of natural habitats in mitigating coastal hazards, the presence of natural habitats reduced the extent of the highest exposed shoreline by 14% and 8% for the highest and intermediate areas, respectively. Under the natural habitat's scenario, the habitats could provide 59% protection for the coastal communities under the highest exposure category and 41% under the intermediate category. Under a no-habitat scenario, about 75% of the coastal communities are exposed and vulnerable to coastal hazards under the highest hazard exposure category and 25% under the intermediate category. These results demonstrate that it is critical, especially for policymakers, to enhance the protection of coastal ecosystems to achieve coastal resilience. This study buttresses the importance of coastal ecosystem assessments in ensuring coastal resilience and climate change adaptation processes for any coastal countries.","[Al Ruheili, Amna] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Agr & Marine Sci, Dept Plant Sci, Muscat 123, Oman; [Boluwade, Alaba] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Lazaridis Sch Business & Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Sultan Qaboos University; Wilfrid Laurier University,"Al Ruheili, A (corresponding author), Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Agr & Marine Sci, Dept Plant Sci, Muscat 123, Oman.",alruheli@squ.edu.om,,"Alruheili, Amna/0000-0003-3611-0423",,,,,43,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,FEB,2023,15,3,,,,,,,380,10.3390/w15030380,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15030380,,,13,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,8U8GE,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000930182700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article examines the connections between climatic and environmental change, human mobility and health. It presents case studies across three countries: Fiji, Bangladesh, and Burkina Faso. All case studies used qualitative methods, including semi-structured interviews, storytelling, and group discussions. The Fiji case study focuses on relocation of a coastal village exposed to erosion, flooding and saltwater intrusion; it highlights self-reported health risks and opportunities following relocation. The Bangladesh case study includes seven sites that variously experience flooding, cyclones and riverbank erosion; while residents use migration and (im)mobility as a coping strategy, there are associated health risks, particularly for those who feel trapped in new sites of residence. The case study from a village in Burkina Faso examines seasonal labour migration to the Ivory Coast and Mali during times of drought and reduced agricultural productivity, and discusses health risks for men who migrate and for women who remain in sending communities. These case studies illustrate that there is no consistent figure that represents a 'climate migrant', 'climate refugee', or 'trapped' person. Accordingly, we argue that where planetary health looks to highlight 'waves' of climate displacement, it may miss the 'tide' of slower onset climatic changes and smaller-scale and diverse forms of (im)mobility. However, even where climate-related mobility is broadly adaptive - e.g. providing opportunities for livelihood diversification, or migration away from environmental risks - there can be health risks and opportunities that are shaped by sociopolitical contexts, access to healthcare, altered food sources, and living and working conditions. Responsive solutions are required to protect and promote the health of mobile and immobile populations in a warming world.","[McMichael, Celia] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog Earth & Atmospher Sci, 221 Bouverie St, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia; [Schwerdtle, Patricia Nayna] Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg Inst Global Hlth, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Schwerdtle, Patricia Nayna] Monash Univ, Fac Med Nursing & Hlth Sci, Nursing & Midwifery, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Ayeb-Karlsson, Sonja] Univ Coll London UCL, Inst Risk & Disaster Reduct IRDR, London, England; [Ayeb-Karlsson, Sonja] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur, UNU EHS, Bonn, Germany",University of Melbourne; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Monash University; University of London; University College London,"McMichael, C (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog Earth & Atmospher Sci, 221 Bouverie St, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia.",celia.mcmichael@unimelb.edu.au,,"Ayeb-Karlsson, Dr Sonja/0000-0001-6124-2730","International Climate Initiative; German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety; German Foreign Office; Johanna Joos Foundation; UNHCR; Australian Research Council [DP190100604]; National Geographic Research Grant [HJ2-194R-18]; Munich Re-Foundation as part of the Gibika project","International Climate Initiative; German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety; German Foreign Office; Johanna Joos Foundation; UNHCR; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); National Geographic Research Grant(National Geographic Society); Munich Re-Foundation as part of the Gibika project","We thank the relevant communities and residents of field-sites in Fiji, Burkina Faso and Bangladesh for their generosity, contribution and time.

Recently, Deep Learning (DL) has emerged as a paradigm shift for LULC classification. To date, little research has focused on using DL methods for LULC mapping in semi-arid regions, and none that we are aware of have compared the use of different Sentinel-2 image band combinations for mapping LULC in semi-arid landscapes with deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Sentinel-2 multispectral image bands have varying spatial resolutions, and there is often high spectral similarity of different LULC features in semi-arid regions; therefore, selection of suitable Sentinel-2 bands could be an important factor for LULC mapping in these areas. Our study contributes to the remote sensing literature by testing different Sentinel-2 bands, as well as the transferability of well-optimized CNNs, for semi-arid LULC classification in semi-arid regions. We first trained a CNN model in one semi-arid study site (Gujranwala city, Gujranwala Saddar and Wazirabadtownships, Pakistan), and then applied the pre-trained model to map LULC in two additional semi-arid study sites (Lahore and Faisalabad city, Pakistan). Two different composite images were compared: (i) a four-band composite with 10 m spatial resolution image bands (Near-Infrared (NIR), green, blue, and red bands), and (ii) a ten-band composite made by adding two Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands and four vegetation red-edge bands to the four-band composite. Experimental results corroborate the validity of the proposed CNN architecture. Notably, the four-band CNN model has shown robustness in semi-arid regions, where spatially and spectrally confusing land-covers are present.","[Ali, Kamran] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Inst Geog Informat Syst, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Johnson, Brian A.] Inst Global Environm Strategies, Nat Resources & Ecosyst Serv Area, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan,"Ali, K (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Inst Geog Informat Syst, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.",kali.ms17igis@igis.nust.edu.pk,,"Johnson, Brian/0000-0003-1911-3585",,,,,50,0,0,7,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,NOV,2022,22,22,,,,,,,8750,10.3390/s22228750,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22228750,,,21,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,6K7IK,36433346,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000887670700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

People living in high disaster-prone impoverished areas can benefit from risk reduction interventions and subsequent adaptation of new technologies and behavior if those interventions diminish the perceived risk of disaster. Perceived risk of disaster plays an important role in influencing adaptive behavior. Disaster risk reduction interventions therefore can be benefitted from inclusive local consultation during the planning and implementation of the risk reduction interventions by taking local people's perceived risk of disaster into account. We studied a national-level disaster risk reduction program called 'The comprehensive Disaster Management Program (CDMP)' in Bangladesh to understand the linkage between risk reduction interventions, perceived risk of disaster, and adaptation. Following a mixed-method approach, we collected quantitative administrative data, interviewed local people, and conducted Focus Group Discussions in two disaster-prone neighboring coastal unions of Bangladesh. We have found that if risk reduction interventions designed by the central government are not aligned with the perceived risk of the local people, the implementation of these interventions does not reduce perceived risk significantly, and consequently, people do not adopt new technologies and behavior to increase their resilience to climate change shocks. Furthermore, people's valuation of a risk reduction intervention in reducing the perceived risk of disasters does not change after an actual disaster takes place insinuating the relative accuracy and robustness of local people's assessment of such interventions. We also found that risk reduction interventions implemented in a holistic way addressing multiple sources of risks can reduce perceived risk significantly. Lastly, we demonstrated that reducing perceived risk is a necessary condition but is not sufficient to encourage adaptation. Our study can contribute to improving the design and implementation of large-scale risk-reduction interventions implemented at the community level.","[Haque, Ashraful] Northsouth Univ & Sci, Adjunct Fac, Econs, Bangladesh; [Fatema, Kaniz] BRAC Microfinance, Sylhet, Bangladesh",,"Haque, A (corresponding author), Northsouth Univ & Sci, Adjunct Fac, Econs, Bangladesh.",haqash.01@gmail.com; kanizfatema303@gmail.com,,,,,,,48,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

As the most direct signal of drought, evapotranspiration deserves a more systematic and comprehensive study. Further depicting their divergence of potential (ETp) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) will help to explore the limitation of evapotranspiration. In this paper, the multi-source remote sensing datasets from the Climate Research Unit (CRU), Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on experiment (GRACE-FO), the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) during 2002 to 2020 were employed to explore the influence of meteorological, hydrological and botanical factors on ETp, ETa and their divergence - reduction of evapotranspiration (E-r) which represents regional vegetation and water limitations. According to the Pearson correlation analysis and the Boruta Algorithm based on Random Forest, the temperature is the first decisive promoter of evapotranspiration in the most area while the sparse vegetation is the primary or second determinant limiting the evapotranspiration in 61.84% of the world. In addition, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) data from 2030 to 2090 and the support vector machine regression (SVMR) model were applied to predict the future global ETp, ETa and E-r on the pixel scale. Predicted results of the model considering the water change not only can highly improve the model performance (with higher R-2), but also can simulate the drought in Europe and the more intense ETa in Africa. Thus, Er proposed in this study provide a good reference for regional ETa except for ETp. The future evapotranspiration value derived by introducing the water storage changes into the machine learning model in this study is also valuable for climate change adaptation and drought warning.

This has significant implications for educational institutions and the populations they serve. As the current crop of landscape architecture students struggles to define its role within the climate crisis and its related social and political underpinnings, a core mission of colleges and universities moving forward should be to provide students with applied knowledge about how climate change affects the landscape. This goes beyond coursework in climate science or policy; for landscape architecture students to be leaders in the response to climate change, they need applied, practical skills. An ever-growing body of the literature focuses on landscape design strategies for climate change adaptation; however, few frameworks integrate these strategies with the hands-on experience students will need to face real-world challenges after graduation. Educational institutions have the potential to utilize their campuses as demonstration sites for applied ecosystem research programs and actively engage students with the design, implementation, politics, and ongoing stewardship of these landscapes. This paper uses a case study methodology to understand how experiential and public-engaged learning pedagogies contribute to student preparedness to address climate change. It examines three cases of engaged learning at the University of California, Davis campus and attributes their impact to intentional connections with research, to the delegation of responsibility; to the openness of spaces for experimentation, and to self-reflection that connects climate with everyday behavior. By promoting experiential learning programs that require students to actively use their heads and their hands to construct and sustainably manage their own campus landscapes, service-learning studios and internships can provide opportunities for students to address the real scenarios of climate crisis and resilience.","[Kiers, A.

Recognizing the potentially catastrophic ramifications of inaction, local governments are increasingly involved in resilience-building activities that are informed by a vast body of research related to different socio-economic, environmental, and institutional aspects of urban planning and design. However, despite its significant impacts on growth and evolution of cities, limited research exists on how urban form can enhance resilience by increasing the abilities to plan for, absorb, recover from, and adapt to adverse events. As a step towards filling this gap, this paper explores how meso-scale urban form elements can affect urban resilience. This is done through synthesizing theoretical and empirical evidence reported in the literature. The focus is on morphological parameters related to the following urban form elements: neighborhoods, blocks, lots, and open spaces. Results show that existing evidence is mainly related to the associations between neighborhood density, size and configuration of open spaces, and land use mix' and resilience to 'climate change impacts', 'earthquakes', 'social issues', and 'resource scarcity'. There is also considerable evidence on the association between design of blocks/lots and resilience in terms of climate change adaptation/mitigation and adaptability to changing circumstances. The analysis also shows that each element influences and is influenced by other elements in the urban system and different elements should not be studied in isolation and the interplay between them should be considered. Existing evidence on conflicts is mainly related to density, but measures related to other elements may also involve conflicts. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations for future research towards improving resilience of urban form at the meso-scale.","[Sharifi, Ayyoob] 1-3-1 Kagamiyama, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima 7398530, Japan",,"Sharifi, A (corresponding author), 1-3-1 Kagamiyama, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima 7398530, Japan.",sharifi@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,"Sharifi, Ayyoob/M-7584-2013","Sharifi, Ayyoob/0000-0002-8983-8613",,,,,127,69,70,22,129,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-2751,1873-6084,,CITIES,Cities,OCT,2019,93,,,,,,238,252,,10.1016/j.cities.2019.05.010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2019.05.010,,,15,Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Urban Studies,JA9AR,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000488142900021,View Full Record in Web of Science

This high vulnerability is due to the socioeconomic limitations and high environmental sensitivity which affect the biophysical and socioeconomic components of their farming systems. Therefore, systems' functionality and farmers' livelihoods will also be affected, with significant implications for global food security, land-use/land-cover change processes and agrobiodiversity conservation. Thus, less vulnerable and more resilient smallholder farming systems constitute an important requisite for sustainable land management and to safeguard the livelihoods of millions of rural and urban households. This study compares a comprehensive socioeconomic and environmental dataset collected in 2015-2016 based on household interviews of 30 farmers of highland agroforestry systems and 30 farmers of conventional agriculture systems, to determine which system provides better opportunities to reduce exposure and sensitivity. A modified Climate Change Questionnaire Version 2 of the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT) was applied to collect the data. The interview data are based on the perceptions of Kayambi indigenous farmers about the levels of exposure and sensitivity of their farming systems during the last decade. Descriptive statistics were applied to analyze the data from the 60 farms. Results indicate that both agroforesters and conventional farmers clearly perceived increases in temperature and reductions in precipitation for the last decade, and expected this trend to continue in the next decade. Furthermore, conventional farmers perceived greater exposure to droughts (20%), solar radiation (43%), and pests, weeds and disease outbreaks (40%) than agroforesters. Additionally, results emphasize the better ability of agroforestry systems to reduce exposure and sensitivity to climate change and variability. These findings support the well-known assumptions about the key role played by agroforestry systems for climate change adaptation and mitigation, especially in developing countries.","[Cordova, Raid; Hogarth, Nicholas J.; Kanninen, Markku] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Viikki Trop Resources Inst VITRI, Latokartanonkaari 7,POB 27, Helsinki 0014, Finland; [Hogarth, Nicholas J.] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, Helsinki 0014, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Cordova, R (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Viikki Trop Resources Inst VITRI, Latokartanonkaari 7,POB 27, Helsinki 0014, Finland.",raul.cordova@helsinki.fi; nicholas.hogarth@helsinki.fi; markku.kanninen@helsinki.fi,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Córdova, Raúl/N-8161-2019; Kanninen, Markku/AAW-9606-2021","Kanninen, Markku/0000-0002-5708-9443; Hogarth, Nicholas/0000-0003-0954-5982; Cordova, Raul/0000-0002-9302-7469","National Secretariat of Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation (SENESCYT); University of Helsinki; Viikki Tropical Resources Institute (VITRI)","National Secretariat of Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation (SENESCYT); University of Helsinki; Viikki Tropical Resources Institute (VITRI)","This study was supported by the Ecuadorian people and government through a scholarship from the National Secretariat of Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation (SENESCYT).

In 2011, the Tenth Circuit upheld the Roadless Rule in Wyoming v. USDA after a decade of litigation. Subsequently, in October 2012, the Supreme Court refused to take up challenges to the Tenth Circuit's ruling. Given the Forest Service's new focus on managing for climate change and the importance of Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs) protected by the Roadless Rule, this Note examines whether management for climate change adaptation and mitigation is feasible, necessary, and defensible in IRAs. As background, Parts I and II describe the history and terms of the Roadless Rule and the projected effects of climate change on forest ecosystems. This Note explains the benefits of purely passive management of IRAs in light of climate change effects and discusses arguments against active management in IRAs, but because the Rule explicitly allows some level of active management in IRAs, Part III summarizes the relevant scientific literature on climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies that may be extended to IRAs. Part IV examines the Rule's language, the case law, and the Forest Service's statutory framework to analyze the extent to which the Agency may implement active management in IRAs, including strategies that do not adhere to historical conditions. This Note concludes that: 1) if the Agency seeks to actively manage IRAs, it needs a comprehensive set of criteria for prioritizing roadless areas for climate change mitigation and adaptation treatments, and 2) the Agency may benefit from modifying the Rule's language if it deems that management outside of the historical range of variability is necessary.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Law, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Long, E (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Law, Boalt Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,144,1,1,0,10,UNIV CALIFORNIA  BERKELEY SCH LAW,BERKELEY,"BOAT HALL, 588 SIMON HALL, BERKELEY, CA 94720-7200 USA",0046-1121,,,ECOL LAW QUART,Ecol.

Previous studies have qualitatively documented the impacts of climate change on boundary shifts in the farming-pastoral ecotone (FPE); however, the quantitative methods for detecting climate contributions remain relatively limited. Based on long-term data of meteorological stations and interpretations of land use since 1970, climate and land use boundaries of the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s were delineated. To detect climate contributions to the FPE boundary shifts, we developed two quantitative methods to explore the spatial-temporal pattern of climate and land use boundary at the east-west (or south-north) (FishNet method) and transect directions (Digital Shoreline Analysis System, DSAS method). The results indicated that significant differences were exhibited in climate boundaries, land use boundaries, as well as climate contributions in different regions during different periods. The northwest FPE had smaller variations, while the northeast FPE had greater shifts. In the northwest part of the southeast fringe of the Greater Hinggan Mountains and the Inner Mongolian Plateau, the shifts of climate boundaries were significantly related to the land use boundaries. The climate contributions at an east-west direction ranged from 10.7% to 44.4%, and those at a south-north direction varied from 4.7% to 55.9%. The majority of the results from the DSAS were consistent with those from the FishNet. The DSAS method is more accurate and suitable for precise detection at a small scale, whereas the FishNet method is simple to conduct statistical analysis rapidly and directly at a large scale. Our research will be helpful to adapt to climate change, to develop the productive potential, as well as to protect the environment of the FPE in northern China.","[Shi, Wenjiao; Liu, Yiting] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Shi, Wenjiao] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Shi, Wenjiao; Liu, Yiting] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xiaoli] Hebei Normal Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Key Lab Environm Evolvement & Ecol Construct Hebe, Shijiazhuang 050024, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Beijing Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Hebei Normal University","Shi, XL (corresponding author), Hebei Normal Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Key Lab Environm Evolvement & Ecol Construct Hebe, Shijiazhuang 050024, Peoples R China.",shiwj@lreis.ac.cn; hnushixiaoli@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41401113, 41371002]; Foundation of Excellent Young Talents of IGSNRR, CAS [2016RC201]; Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science [OFSLRSS201622]; Key Project of Physical Geography of Hebei Province; China Scholarship Council","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Foundation of Excellent Young Talents of IGSNRR, CAS; Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science; Key Project of Physical Geography of Hebei Province; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council)","Foundation: National Natural Science Foundation of China, No. 41401113, No. 41371002; Foundation of Excellent Young Talents of IGSNRR, CAS, No. 2016RC201; The Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, No. OFSLRSS201622; The Key Project of Physical Geography of Hebei Province; China Scholarship Council",,33,9,15,2,33,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1009-637X,1861-9568,,J GEOGR SCI,J.

A central element in the strategy of addressing these major environmental challenges is to maintain the central role of Earth's essential soil functions and related ecosystem services. Many soil functions are affected by soil structure in terms of particle aggregation and porosity. The objective of this work is to model soil structure and biomass dynamics, nutrients uptake, and yields using the 1D Integrated Critical Zone (1D-ICZ) model which is a mechanistic mathematical description of soil processes and functions. The 1D-ICZ model simulates the coupled processes that underpin major soil functions including water flow and storage, biomass production, carbon and nutrient sequestration, pollutant transformation, and supporting biological processes, and thus is capable of quantifying essential soil ecosystem services. The model was validated using data derived from a field experiment where tomato plants were grown using different treatments of commercial mineral fertilizers, compost, manure, and a 30% manure-70% compost amendment. Detailed data have been collected over four growing seasons on soil and soil solution chemistry, aggregate formation, and plant production. The model has been able to capture the biomass production, the temporal dynamics of the water-stable aggregate formation and the dynamics of carbon and nutrient sequestration in the different sizes aggregates as well as the variability of water filtration and transformation efficiency in the different amendment treatments. The model results demonstrate the value of applying computational simulation tools such as the 1D-ICZ model to test options for improved land management measures and to support sustainable land care practices.","[Kotronakis, M.; Giannakis, G.

Depolderisation consists of reopening polders to the sea via tidal gates, creating breaches in the dikes or dismantling them altogether. Although this technique has rarely been used in France, in comparison with the UK or the USA, it has begun to arouse interest, especially in the wake of storm Xynthia which in 2010 heavily damaged the French Atlantic reclaimed coast. In the Arcachon Bay, researchers have demonstrated that managing flooding risk through depolderisation leads to ecosystemic benefits, such as a more flexible sea defence through the restoration of saltmarshes, biodiversity enhancement and nature-based recreation. They have also investigated the social acceptability of depolderisation - the main topic of this article. Several methods were used to analyse this acceptability: thorough interviews, a questionnaire survey answered by 675 polder users and inhabitants and a survey on their willingness to pay. The results show that the local people and some of the stakeholders are largely opposed to depolderisation, preferring the reinforcement of sea dikes. This refusal is not linked to a fear of the sea but to a deep attachment to local polders and their uses, and to the slow pace of national policy development on coastal risk management. The fact that similar results have been obtained in other European countries confirms some of these results. This article is a contribution to the debate initiated in developed countries on more flexible or natural ways of managing coastal risks and adaptation to climate change, and on the social obstacles that hinder renewed and sustainable coastal policies.

Numerous previous research papers have discussed green-space size, type, and vegetation density, as well as many other factors that might influence green-space cooling effects. However, little has been done with regard to exploring and quantifying the characteristics of the green-space cool island (UCI). It is also largely unknown whether or how the patterns of green space and land use, as well as the adjacent urban thermal environment, affect UCIs. In this paper, the land surface temperature (LST) was retrieved from satellite imagery. The UCI was identified, and one of the UCI characteristics, the UCI intensity, was defined. Multiple linear regression models were then used to explore and quantify the combined effects of factors related to the UCI intensity. The results show that the intensity differed between UCIs, and correlated significantly with the extent of and mean temperature reduction associated with an UCI. Multiple linear regression analysis found that UCI intensity was affected by areas of forest vegetation and its spatial arrangements, as well as by the composition of the cool island and its neighboring thermal environment. The study validated the suitability of using intensity as an indicator of the UCI. Identifying the UCI as a result of the green-space cooling effect, will help in the management and planning of the spatial arrangement of green spaces in cities to reduce the effects of the urban thermal environment and help cities adapt to climate change.

Destruction or disturbance therefore reduces sink capacity and leads to significant CO2 emissions. This study reports the first national estimates of: 1) total carbon storage, 2) CO2 emissions from anthropogenic activities, 3) the potential for restoration to enhance carbon sequestration for blue carbon ecosystems in South Africa. Mangrove ecosystems have the greatest carbon storage per unit area (253-534 Mg C ha(-1)), followed by salt marshes (100-199 Mg C ha-1) and seagrasses (45-144 Mg C ha(-1)). Salt marshes are the most extensive and contribute 67 % to the national carbon stock of 4000 Gg C. Since 1930, 6500 ha has been lost across all blue carbon ecosystems (26 % of the natural extent), equivalent to losing 1086 Gg C from the national carbon stock. Historic CO2 emissions were estimated at an average rate of 30,266 t CO(2)e yr(-1). Despite losses, a total of 3998 ha could be restored to increase carbon sequestration and CO2 removals of 14,845 tCO(2)e.yr(-1). Extractive activities have declined rapidly in recent decades, but abiotic pressures on estuarine ecosystems (flow modification, reduced water quality, and artificial breaching) have been increasing. There is an urgent need to quantify the potential impact of these pressures and include themin estuarine management and restoration plans. Blue carbon ecosystems cover a relatively small area in South Africa, but they are valued for their multiple ecosystem services that contribute towards climate change adaptation and biodiversity co-benefits. These ecosystems need to be included in national policies driving climate change response in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land-Use (AFOLU) sector, such as incorporating them into the wetland subcategory of the national GHG inventory.","[Raw, J.

However, these buildings may experience excessive vibrations, resulting in safety and serviceability issues due to wind or earthquake loads. This paper presents a dynamic analysis of a 42-story-tall hybrid-timber building, along with a comparative study of the performance of three damping devices: (i) pendulum pounding tuned mass damper (PTMD), (ii) tuned mass damper inerter (TMDI), and (iii) tuned mass damper (TMD). First, we evaluate the vibration reduction capability of the TMD and the TMDI under filtered white noise and variable frequency sinusoidal excitations. Then, we propose a robust pendulum PTMD designed using the Hertz contact law to minimize the responses under seismic excitations. For a fair comparison, the mass of the TMD, TMDI, and pendulum PTMD is kept the same. The results show that the pendulum PTMD has higher performance and can reduce the peak accelerations under earthquake loads when both TMD and TMDI fail to achieve this requirement. The superior performance of the proposed device in reducing peak accelerations relates to the reduction in damage to structural and nonstructural components under seismic loads. Nevertheless, coupling the inerter and TMD to form a TMDI may shift the optimum frequency and damping ratios, leading to reduced performance. Compared to TMD and TMDI, the proposed pendulum PTMD is more robust, with higher performance in reducing the base shear (55.7%), base moment (41%), and inter-story drift ratio (40%). The dominant capabilities of this novel device in a timber-hybrid building under different excitations reveal benefits that can shape the future of the physical infrastructure and contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation for improved disaster resilience and circular economy policies.","[Chapain, Suvash; Aly, Aly Mousaad] Louisiana State Univ, Windstorm Impact Sci & Engn WISE Res Lab, 3230 H Patrick F Taylor Hall, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Aly, Aly Mousaad] Oregon State Univ, Sch Civil & Construct Engn, OH Hinsdale Wave Res Lab, 3550 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Oregon State University,"Aly, AM (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Windstorm Impact Sci & Engn WISE Res Lab, 3230 H Patrick F Taylor Hall, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.;Aly, AM (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Sch Civil & Construct Engn, OH Hinsdale Wave Res Lab, 3550 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",aly@lsu.edu,,,Louisiana Board of Regents (ITRS program: LEQSF) [(2022-25)-RD-B-02]; Louisiana State University (LSU) NSF I-Corps; LSU Faculty Grant; LSU Economic Development Assistantships; NSF EPSCoR program,Louisiana Board of Regents (ITRS program: LEQSF); Louisiana State University (LSU) NSF I-Corps; LSU Faculty Grant; LSU Economic Development Assistantships; NSF EPSCoR program(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)),"The second author (A.M.

Lessons from experiences of international financing and allocating mechanisms provide valuable references for establishing the Chinese GCF. This study aims to explore the feasibility of several well-recognized schemes for financing and allocating the Chinese GCF among China's 30 provinces. These include: financing schemes of historical emission responsibility (HR), ability-to-pay (AP) and preference score compromises (PSC); as well as allocating schemes of carbon emissions intensity (CI), carbon emissions per capital (CC), GDP per capital (GC) and PSC. This study derives several important findings. Firstly, given different financing schemes, the coastal economically developed provinces including Shandong, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Zhejiang would collectively shoulder most of the financing responsibility (almost 70% in total) and play central roles in climate financing. Shandong province presents high financing responsibilities mainly due to its export trades of primary products which rely on the development of high-polluted industries. Other three provinces show high financing responsibilities mainly due to the rapid growth of their industries (petrochemical, steel, building materials, electric power, etc.) for economic development. Secondly, the inland economically backward provinces including Shanxi, Ningxia, Guizhou, Xinjiang, and Gansu would be the top five largest recipients of the funds, obtaining more than 30% of total disbursements. The innovations and contributions of the present study are as follows: Firstly, this paper systematically explored the feasibility and alternative schemes for Chinese GCF for the first time. Further, it introduces PSC methods based on diversified approaches to explore suitable financing and allocating schemes. The schemes proposed would establish theoretical foundations for the Chinese GCF and would also promote the development of other kinds of financing for China and countries with similar economic features.","[Xu, Meng; Qin, Zhongfeng; Wei, Yigang] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Qin, Zhongfeng; Wei, Yigang] Beijing Key Lab Emergency Support Simulat Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beihang University,"Qin, ZF (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.;Qin, ZF (corresponding author), Beijing Key Lab Emergency Support Simulat Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xumeng1007@buaa.edu.cn; qin@buaa.edu.cn; weiyg@buaa.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72071008, 71771011, 72174020, 71904009]; Beijing Social Science Foundation [20GLC054]; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [19YJC840041]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Social Science Foundation; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences,"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 72071008; 71771011; 72174020; 71904009), Beijing Social Science Foundation (No. 20GLC054), and the MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (No. 19YJC840041).",,64,2,2,3,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Accurate measurement and estimation remain a major challenge in geophysical, biological, and environmental studies. Pioneering work, represented by Dalton and Penman, and the development of theories and experiments on turbulent exchange in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), laid the foundation for mainstream methodologies in ET estimation. Since the 1990s, eddy covariance (EC) systems and satellite remote sensing have been widely applied from cold to tropical and from arid to humid regions. They cover water surfaces, wetlands, forests, croplands, grasslands, barelands, and urban areas, offering an exceptional number of reports on diverse ET processes. Surface nocturnal ET, hysteresis between ET and environmental forces, turbulence intermittency, island effects on heterogeneous surfaces, and phase transition between underlying surfaces are examples of reported new phenomena, posing theoretical and practical challenges to mainstream ET methodologies. Additionally, based on non-conventional theories, new methods have emerged, such as maximum entropy production and nonparametric approaches. Furthermore, high-frequency on-site observation and aerospace remote sensing technology in combination form multi-scale observations across plant stomata, leaves, plants, canopies, landscapes, and basins. This promotes an insightful understanding of diverse ET processes and synthesizes the common mechanisms of the processes between and across spatial and temporal scales. All the recent achievements in conception, model, and technology serve as the basis for breaking through the known difficulties in ET estimation. We expect that they will provide a rigorous, reliable scientific basis and experimental support to address theoretical arguments of global significance, such as the water-heat-carbon cycle, and solve practical needs of national importance, including agricultural irrigation and food security, precise management of water resources and eco-environmental protection, and regulation of the urban thermal environment and climate change adaptation.","[Liu, Yuanbo; Cui, Yifan] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Guoyu; Yan, Chunhua] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Sch Environm & Energy, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hongsheng] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Lab Climate & Ocean Atmosphere Studies, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yonghui; Han, Shumin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, Ctr Agr Resources Res, Key Lab Agr Water Resources, Shijiazhuang 050022, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yinsheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yinsheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang, Quan] Shizuoka Univ, Fac Agr, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan; [Zhao, Wenzhi; Ji, Xibin] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Wenzhi; Ji, Xibin] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Ecohydrol Inland River Basin, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Jia, Li] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Yujiu] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Ma, Ning] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yonghui; Cui, Yifan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology, CAS; Peking University; University Town of Shenzhen; Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Genetics & Developmental Biology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shizuoka University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Sun Yat Sen University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Liu, YB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.",ybliu@niglas.ac.cn,"Wang, Quan/M-2011-2019; Jia, li/GPW-8015-2022; zhang, han/I-8297-2015; Ma, Ning/AEN-5541-2022","Wang, Quan/0000-0001-5483-0243; zhang, han/0000-0002-0166-1973; Ma, Ning/0000-0003-4580-0661; Jia, Li/0000-0002-3108-8645","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51879255, 41430855]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We sincerely thank the three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on the early version of the manuscript.

However, these models do not account for crop growth and crop yield, and thus cannot be used for evaluating long-term impacts of climate and management strategies on water use efficiency and farm profitability of agricultural systems while managing the aquifers sustainably. This study presented a linkage between DSSAT, an agronomic model, and MODFLOW, a groundwater flow model. The linkage between these two models occurred on an annual basis, with rates of irrigation and deep percolation from an ensemble of field-scale DSSAT simulations converted to pumping rates and recharge rates for the MODFLOW simulation. MODFLOW simulated groundwater head, which can be used to update saturated thickness and thereby well capacities for each pumping well in the model domain. Simulated well capacities were then used to constrain irrigation applications in the DSSAT simulations during the following growing season. Python scripts were used to convert output from one model to input files for the other model. The DSSAT-MODFLOW modeling system was applied to the Ogallala aquifer underlying Finney County, Kansas, a region experiencing significant groundwater depletion due to irrigation practices, and was tested against observed water table elevation and crop yield. Over a decadal period, well capacity decreased by >50 % for many pumping wells in the county. A no-irrigation scenario for this same time period resulted in average water table elevation increasing by 2 m, but also a 70 % decline in crop yield. Additional work is needed to balance groundwater conservation with crop yield. The DSSAT-MODFLOW modeling system can be used in regions worldwide to assess changes in irrigation technologies, crop selection, and climate change adaptation strategies.","[Xiang, Zaichen; Bailey, Ryan T.; Nozari, Soheil] Colorado State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Husain, Zainab; Kisekka, Isaya] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources Biol & Agr Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Sharda, Vaishali] Kansas State Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Gowda, Prasanna] USDA ARS, Grazinglands Res Lab, El Reno, OK 73036 USA",Colorado State University; University of California System; University of California Davis; Kansas State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Xiang, ZC (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",xzckay@colostate.edu; rtbailey@colostate.edu; Soheil.Nozari@colostate.edu; zhusain@ucdavis.edu; ikisekka@ucdavis.edu; vsharda@ksu.edu; Prasanna.Gowda@ars.usda.gov,"Kisekka, Isaya/ABE-8416-2020; Nozari, Soheil/GXG-3269-2022","Kisekka, Isaya/0000-0002-2460-7777; XIANG, ZAICHEN/0000-0003-3565-9131","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture [2016-68007-25066]","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","This work was supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, under award number 2016-68007-25066, Sustaining agriculture through adaptive management to preserve the Ogallala aquifer under a changing climate.

The adverse effects of global climate change have no limitations, and if these effects are overlooked by the human, they shall spread to all areas rapidly. The plants, which are so important for all living creatures, shall be faced with deaths, migrations or adaptation challenges in the future because of the climate change-originated geographical alteration on the variables such as air temperature and precipitation. These reasons make essential the estimations of geographical distribution of plants in the future. In the study, the geographic-climatic suitability of maize, safflower, canola (rape), cotton, wheat and switchgrass was projected for 2070, and the current and future conditions were compared. The applied steps in the study are; (1) the climatic data-obtained from Worldclim as current and 2070-projected data, (2) the identification of essential temperature and precipitation intervals for crops' growth from EcoCrop, (3) application of the Climate Change Adaptation Modeler (CCAM)'s sub-model Crop Climatic Suitability Modeling (CCSM) in TerrSet, a Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing software by Clark Labs, and finally (4) generation of the climatic suitability maps for each crop for current and future. With this study, the climate-based geographic suitability of plants was evaluated for Turkey where is dominated by Mediterranean climate pattern as 41.1% in Koppen Climate Classification. In the study, the projected areal suitability of maize, switchgrass and cotton shall not change significantly according to current conditions. Safflower's and canola's areal suitability shall expand and displace, respectively. Here, the major loser in areal suitability shall be wheat in Turkey.

The importance of these ecosystem services in urban environments, and the central role that cities play in the lives of people around the world, have motivated various attempts to quantify the value of ecosystem services provided by urban forests. This paper reviews existing research in the fields of urban forestry, economics, sociology, and health on the value of urban ecosystem services, with a focus on cultural services, a category of ecosystem services that is of key importance to human well-being but that has suffered from a lack of empirical research. The review identified 38 studies that examined the value of mixed vegetation, 31 studies that examined the value of trees, and 43 studies that examined the value of green spaces. Psychological health is the most-studied ecosystem service category, with most research in this area focusing on the services of mixed vegetation. Social health, community economic development, and tourism are the least-studied, with most research in these areas focusing on mixed vegetation and trees. Multiple metrics were used to quantify the value of urban greenery within each ecosystem service category but only 11 metrics were assigned a monetary value. Gaps in the literature that present strong opportunities for future research include: the value of urban forests for improving social health, equitable access to ecosystem services, the impact of urban forests on community economic development, and economic valuation and green exposure metrics. We hope that this review stimulates future research in the areas highlighted and that municipalities consider including evaluations of a broad range of ecosystem services during land use planning and budgeting processes.","[Nesbitt, Lorien; Barron, Sara; Sheppard, Stephen R.

Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is a method allowing implementation of agricultural practices in compliance with the efforts to combat climate change. CSA is an approach guiding agricultural systems under changing climate conditions to provide sustainable development and food safety. The targets of this approach included sustainable increase in agricultural production, resistance and adaptation to climate change and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Farmer participation and level of consciousness play a significant role in successful implementation of CSA. The present study was conducted to put forth farmers' adaptation of climate change. Farmer perceptions or approaches to CSA were taken into consideration. In the study, the literature was examined to analyze the adoption of CSA and the typology of CSA applications was developed. The typology consists of five categories: (1) soil management, (2) water management, (3) chemical input management, (4) crop diversification and (5) planting trees/agroforestry. Household survey data were used to create and test hypotheses about farmers' adoption of CSA. Nonparametric tests were used to estimate the socioeconomic variables that were effective in the adoption of CSA categories. The results generally show that CSA categories have high application potential among farmers. The factors influencing farmer decisions on these issues were identified as education, participation into agricultural meetings, land size and agricultural income. Such factors may guide policymakers while taking measures against climate change.","[Everest, Bengu] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Canakkale, Turkey",Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University,"Everest, B (corresponding author), Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Canakkale, Turkey.",beverest@comu.edu.tr,,,,,,,73,5,5,4,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

However, to fully understand the potential of shrub willow as an alternative crop on marginal cropland, more research is needed to understand the potential of shrub willow for providing a variety of ecosystem services. At the same time, there is much need for research developing strategies to value ecosystem services beyond conventional valuation systems (e.g., monetary, intrinsic). In this context, this project investigates the ecosystem services of shrub willow woody biomass from an environmental science perspective, and proposes a new avenue to assess ecosystem services for management purposes based on the relative value of key ecosystem services under various land management strategies (i.e., willow vs. corn vs. hay). On marginal cropland in the US Northeast, shrub willow may be used to replace crops like corn or hay. Transitioning from conventional corn or hay to willow tends to reduce nutrient loss and erosion, improve biodiversity and adaptability to climate change, and increase access to recreational activities. However, it is unlikely to change soil carbon pools or greenhouse gas emissions at the soil-atmosphere interface. By encouraging decision makers to weigh the pros and cons of each management decision (i.e., willow vs. corn vs. hay) based on the situation, the ecosystems services valuation method used here provides a clear framework for decision making in a watershed management context.","[Bressler, Alison; Vidon, Philippe; Volk, Timothy] SUNY Syracuse, Sch Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Forest & Nat Resource Management, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Hirsch, Paul] SUNY Syracuse, Sch Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm Studies, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry,"Bressler, A (corresponding author), SUNY Syracuse, Sch Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Forest & Nat Resource Management, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",asbress1@umich.edu,"Hirsch, Paul/AAW-3087-2021; Volk, Timothy/R-4005-2019","Volk, Timothy/0000-0002-6969-9281","New York State Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA); Empire State Development Division of Science, Technology and Innovation (NYSTAR); Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant from the United State Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA NIFA) [2012-68005-19703]","New York State Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA); Empire State Development Division of Science, Technology and Innovation (NYSTAR); Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant from the United State Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA NIFA)","This work was made possible by the funding from the New York State Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), the Empire State Development Division of Science, Technology and Innovation (NYSTAR), and through the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant No. 2012-68005-19703 from the United State Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA NIFA).

Adapting to climate change through a combination of improved input efficiency, additional fertilizers and adjusting the sowing time of current varieties can increase yield by similar to 17 %. With improved varieties, yield can be enhanced by similar to 25 % in 2020 climate scenario. But, projected benefits may reduce thereafter. Development of short-duration varieties and improved crop husbandry becomes essential for sustaining mustard yield in future climates. As climatically suitable period for mustard cultivation may reduce in future, short-duration (< 130 days) cultivars with 63 % pod filling period will become more adaptable. There is a need to look beyond the suggested adaptation strategy to minimize the yield reduction in net vulnerable regions.","[Kumar, Soora Naresh; Aggarwal, Pramod Kumar; Uttam, Kumar; Surabhi, Jain; Rani, D.

Using an independently constructed archival database of donor-funded interventions in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and Senegal in response to the persistence of drought in the 1970s and 1980s, the spatial distribution of these interventions is examined in relation to population density and to trends in precipitation and in greenness. Three categories of environmental change are classified: 1) regions at the northern grassland/shrubland edge of the Sahel where NDVI varies interannually with precipitation, 2) densely populated cropland regions of the Sahel where significant trends in precipitation and NDVI decouple at interannual time scales, and 3) regions at the southern savanna edge of the Sahel where NDVI variation is independent of precipitation. Examination of the spatial distribution of environmental change, number of development projects, and population density brings to the fore the second category, covering the cropland areas where population density and regreening are higher than average. While few, regions in this category coincide with emerging hotspots of regreening in northern Burkina Faso and southern central Niger known from case study literature. In examining the impact of efforts to rejuvenate the Sahelian environment and livelihoods in the aftermath of the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s against the backdrop of a varying and uncertain climate, the transition from desertification to regreening discourses is framed in the context of adaptation to climate change.","[Stith, Mimi] Boston Univ, Dept Anthropol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Giannini, Alessandra; del Corral, John] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Earth Inst, 61 Route 9W, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Adamo, Susana; de Sherbinin, Alex] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Ctr Int Earth Sci Informat Network, Palisades, NY 10964 USA",Boston University; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Giannini, A (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Earth Inst, 61 Route 9W, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",alesall@iri.columbia.edu,"Giannini, Alessandra/F-7163-2016","Giannini, Alessandra/0000-0001-5425-4995; de Sherbinin, Alex/0000-0002-8875-4864; Adamo, Susana Beatriz/0000-0002-9168-7172",Earth Institute (EI) Cross-cutting Initiative; NSF Faculty Early Career Development'' grant [AGS-0955372]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Office of Global Programs) [NA07GP0213]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NNG08HZ11C]; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences [0955372] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Earth Institute (EI) Cross-cutting Initiative; NSF Faculty Early Career Development'' grant; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Office of Global Programs)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"This study would not have been possible without the financial support of the Earth Institute (EI) Cross-cutting Initiative, a small-grant opportunity that funded a research assistantship and catalyzed interaction among scientists in different units of the EI.

Yet coastal communities are facing a wider array of different stressors that affect the sustainability of natural resources and the adaptive capacity of local residents. The ability of communities and households to adapt is influenced by the nature, number, and magnitude of the changes with which they have to contend. In this paper, we present the range of 36 socio-economic (i.e. economic, social, governance and conflict) and biophysical (i.e. climate change and other environmental) stressors that emerged from qualitative interviews in seven coastal communities on the Andaman coast of Thailand. These stressors were then integrated into a quantitative survey of 237 households wherein participants were asked to rate the level of impact of these stressors on household livelihoods. Ratings showed that economic and some climate change stressors - extreme weather events and changes in rainfall patterns and seasons - were scored higher than other stressors. The paper also examines the relationships between community and various individual and household characteristics - such as gender, age, livelihoods, levels of social capital, and socio-economic status - and the perceived level of impacts of various stressors on household livelihoods. Overall, community and livelihoods had the most differentiated impacts on perceptions of stressors but few other prominent patterns emerged. In conclusion, this paper discusses the implications of the results for current climate change vulnerability and adaptation policy and practice in Thailand and elsewhere.","[Bennett, Nathan James] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Bennett, Nathan James] Univ Victoria, Ctr Global Studies, Victoria, BC V8W 3R4, Canada; [Dearden, Philip] Univ Victoria, Marine Protected Areas Res Grp, Dept Geog, Victoria, BC V8W 3R4, Canada; [Peredo, Ana Maria] Univ Victoria, Peter B Gustavson Sch Business, Victoria, BC V8W 3R4, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of Victoria; University of Victoria; University of Victoria,"Bennett, NJ (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",njbennet@uvic.ca,"Bennett, Nathan J/ABG-6787-2020","Bennett, Nathan J/0000-0003-4852-3401",,,,,65,46,47,1,54,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Survey-based data (presents farmers' personal perceptions and adaptations to climate change) associated with external biophysical-socioeconomic data (presents real-world climate change) were used to develop a farmer-centered framework to explore climate change impacts and agricultural adaptations at a local level. A case study at Bin County (1980s-2010s), Northeast China, suggested that increased annual average temperature (0.6 degrees C per decade) and decreased annual precipitation (46 mm per decade, both from meteorological datasets) were correctly perceived by 76 and 66.9%, respectively, of farmers from the survey, and that a longer growing season was confirmed by 70% of them. These reasonably correct perceptions enabled local farmers to make appropriate adaptations to cope with climate change: Longer season alternative varieties were found for maize and rice, which led to a significant yield increase for both crops. The longer season also affected crop choice: More farmers selected maize instead of soybean, as implicated from survey results by a large increase in the maize growing area. Comparing warming-related factors, we found that precipitation and agricultural disasters were the least likely causes for farmers' agricultural decisions. As a result, crop and variety selection, rather than disaster prevention and infrastructure improvement, was the most common ways for farmers to adapt to the notable warming trend in the study region.","[Yu Qiang-yi; Wu Wen-bin; Xia Tian; Yang Peng; Tang Hua-jun] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Key Lab Agriinformat, Minist Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Liu Zhen-huan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Geog & Planning Sch, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Verburg, Peter H.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, NL-1087 Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Lu Zhong-jun] Heilongjiang Acad Agr Sci, Remote Sensing Tech Ctr, Harbin 150086, Peoples R China; [You Liang-zhi] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Environm & Prod Technol Div, Washington, DC 20006 USA","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning, CAAS; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Sun Yat Sen University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)","Wu, WB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Key Lab Agriinformat, Minist Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",yuqiangyi@caas.cn; wuwenbin@caas.cn,"Verburg, Peter H/Z-1582-2019; Yu, Qiangyi/AFR-0194-2022; Yu, Qiangyi/J-9360-2014; Verburg, Peter/A-8469-2010","Yu, Qiangyi/0000-0002-6457-3583; Verburg, Peter/0000-0002-6977-7104","National Basic Research Program of China [2010CB951504]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41271112, 40930101]; National Nonprofit Institute Research Grant of CAAS [IARRP-2014-16]",National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Nonprofit Institute Research Grant of CAAS,"This work is partly financed by the National Basic Research Program of China (2010CB951504), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41271112 and 40930101), and the National Nonprofit Institute Research Grant of CAAS (IARRP-2014-16).

This review paper addresses climate change resilience in pavements by considering major vulnerability issues and adaptation measures. First, a review on foundational information of climate change related to transportation infrastructure is provided to bring all transportation professionals and practitioners to the same knowledge base on climate change terminology. Such information includes sources of climate information, climate scenarios, downscaling climate data, and uncertainty in climate projection information. Relevant climate stressors to pavements are discussed in some depth, including the most significant ones, which are increases in temperature and precipitation intensity. Thus, the proposed different engineering-informed adaptation measures relevant to the climate stressors of interest were evidence-based with reference to published peer-reviewed articles and case studies. Such adaptation solutions are related to monitoring pavement key performance parameters and pavement adaptations in structural design, robust materials and mix design, along with adaptation in maintenance, regulation, and construction. Efforts to adapt pavement systems to climate change are ongoing. In addition to such research works, this study concludes that impacts of adaptation measures on pavement and environment should be incorporated in the decision-making process in planning and design. This makes it important to integrate practical adaptation strategies in design and construction standards and guides, and implement awareness and education of climate change adaptation among engineers and practitioners.","[Saleh, Mohamed; Hashemian, Leila] Univ Alberta, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada",University of Alberta,"Hashemian, L (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada.",msaleh1@ualberta.ca; hashemia@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,36,0,0,5,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2022,14,4,,,,,,,2410,10.3390/su14042410,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14042410,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZT8RI,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000769417100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study investigated the trends and variability of precipitation extremes to explore statistically significant trends in extreme hydrological conditions over the last 35 years in the Wabi Shebele basin of Ethiopia. Two reanalysis climate products: Enhancing National Climate Services (ENACTS) and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) were evaluated against ground observations using cumulative distribution function and statistical measures. The result shows that the CHIRPS data set performed well and captured the precipitation extremes measured by rain gauges. The Mann-Kendall trend test analysis conducted using three extreme precipitation indices: annual maximum precipitation (AMP) (i.e., annual highest 1-day precipitation amount), R10 (i.e., the yearly count of days when precipitation >= 10 mm), and R95P (i.e., 95% percentile precipitation events). The result indicates an increasing tendency over the western-eastern highland and southern part of the basin; In contrast, it indicates decreasing trends over the middle of the study area. Quantile perturbation analysis using R95P reveals high oscillations at 5-year intervals within a confidence interval (CI), particularly at the basin's western-eastern highlands and southern lowlands. Since the 2000s, a periodicity analysis of maximum yearly precipitation using the autocorrelation function has revealed cycles at 2-year to 5-year intervals over the western-eastern highlands of the basin.

Moreover, the adaptive capacity of traditional knowledge and ancient systems is also evaluated, in order to contribute for future climate change adaptation planning. Design/methodology/approach The vulnerability of cultural heritage to climate change was considered as the degree to which an identified cultural heritage value was susceptible to, or would be adversely affected by, the effects of climate change, including climate variability and extreme temperatures. In order to establish a vulnerability assessment, this paper will assess different definitions regarding vulnerability, exposure and sensitivity, crossing it with indicators of physical parameters, in order to propose an adaptive capacity for the site, based on ancient traditional knowledge. Findings Nonetheless, the entailed research helped establish a framework that contributes to outline the vulnerability and the potential for adaptive capacity of World Heritage properties, especially earthen sites located in regions exposed to rising climate change impact. Research limitations/implications The research faced some limitations regarding access to data and to site visits, due to COVID-19 restrictions that were in place.

The UGI improves urban eco-system functions to protect human health and wellbeing, both locally and globally. Pakistan lacks inclusive and resilient land-use planning policies as well as frameworks to protect its inhabitants, and ecosystems from the rising climatic hazards. So, this research aims to determine and assemble sustainable UGI planning indicators based on local stakeholder's perspectives. It is to develop a comprehensive and integrative indicator-based framework model to build climate-resilient urban regions in Pakistan's northwest parts. The in-depth online expert's survey is administered through 172 questionnaires themed around UGI, urban resilience and climate change adaptation. The data is analysed by using Relative Importance Index (RII) and Interquartile Range Technique (IQR). The finding shows potential twenty-two (primary and secondary) sustainable UGI indicators, classified into three main categories; Extremely Important (E-Imp); Important (Imp) and Moderately important (M-Imp) levels.

Using the historical simulations and projections under the four combined scenarios of the shared socioeconomic pathways and the forcing levels of the Representative Concentration Pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) provided by the multimodel ensemble mean of 10 models in phase six of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the projected spatial and temporal changes of future summer precipitation over the YRB and the possible physical mechanisms underlying future summer precipitation changes are investigated. Large discrepancies in precipitation exist among the four scenarios during the latter half period of the 21st century, with precipitation under SSP5-8.5 being the largest. Nevertheless, the precipitation under each of the four scenarios shows a similar spatial pattern over the YRB, with an east-west-oriented gradient. A comparison of projected moisture transport into the YRB among the four scenarios reveals two channels (westerlies and monsoon flow) under SSP5-8.5, whereas the monsoon flow from adjacent oceans is important under the other three scenarios. Further analysis of the unique features of the projected moisture flux and substantial increase in summer precipitation under SSP5-8.5 indicates that the future summer precipitation trend over the YRB can be mainly attributed to an increase in evaporation and moisture advection.","[Li, Jiao; Zhao, Yang] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Li, Jiao] China Meteorol Adm, Henan Key Lab Agrometeorol Support & Appl Tech, Zhengzhou 450003, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yang] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Tang, Zhenfei] Fujian Key Lab Severe Weather, Fujian Prov Meteorol Bur, Fuzhou 350001, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; China Meteorological Administration; Seoul National University (SNU),"Zhao, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Zhao, Y (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea.;Tang, ZF (corresponding author), Fujian Key Lab Severe Weather, Fujian Prov Meteorol Bur, Fuzhou 350001, Peoples R China.",lijiao0606@126.com; zy5000609@snu.ac.kr; 20161111047@nuist.edu.cn,,"Tang, Zhenfei/0000-0002-5965-6376; Zhao, Yang/0000-0002-3306-9835",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC0406602]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MEST) [2019R1A6A1A10073437],"National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MEST)(Ministry of Education, Science & Technology (MEST), Republic of KoreaNational Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government)","This research was jointly funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant 2018YFC1505805), National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MEST) (grant 2019R1A6A1A10073437), and National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant (No. 2018YFC0406602).",,50,4,4,2,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,DEC,2020,11,12,,,,,,,1307,10.3390/atmos11121307,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11121307,,,13,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,PJ3SZ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000601693300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Study focus: This study develops watershed management alternatives which can ensure optimal climate change adaptation benefits under different climate scenarios. The climate scenarios were developed using the statistically bias corrected, multi-model ensemble mean and the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. The hydrological impact of climate change was assessed using a multi-gauge calibrated and validated the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Watershed management alternatives were prioritized using a multi-criteria decision analysis which intercompared watershed management criteria and alternatives through the Analytic Hierarchy Process. New hydrological insights: The findings showed a consistent decline of rainfall, surface runoff and total water yield under all climate scenarios and climate impact scenarios. Water harvesting structures were the most prioritized watershed management alternatives to reduce climate change impacts. More than half of the watersheds of the Jemma sub-basin are highly and optimally suitable for in-situ water harvesting under baseline and future climate scenarios. Observed terrace and anticipated in-situ water harvesting structures significantly (p<0.05) reduced surface runoff and thereby significantly increase soil water under baseline and future climate scenarios. However, both in-situ and ex-situ water harvesting structures caused an insignificant change in the total water yield under climate scenarios. We conclude implementing in-situ water harvesting structures can help to increase green water without a decline in blue water.","[Worku, Gebrekidan; Teferi, Ermias] Addis Ababa Univ, Ctr Environm & Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Bantider, Amare] Addis Ababa Univ, Ctr Food Secur Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Teferi, Ermias; Bantider, Amare] Addis Ababa Univ, Water & Land Resources Ctr, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Dile, Yihun T.] Texas A&M Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, College Stn, TX USA; [Worku, Gebrekidan] Debretabor Univ, Dept Nat Resources Management, Debra Tabor, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University; Addis Ababa University; Addis Ababa University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Worku, G (corresponding author), Addis Ababa Univ, Ctr Environm & Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",gebrwor@dtu.edu.et,"Tefera, Gebrekidan/AAD-6222-2022; Tefera, Gebrekidan Worku/AFJ-7307-2022; Worku, Gebrekidan/AAO-2396-2021; Bantider, Amare/GWZ-9391-2022","Tefera, Gebrekidan Worku/0000-0003-3750-0490; Teferi, Ermias/0000-0002-4481-5362",Addis Ababa University; Debretabor University; Water and Land Resources Centre of Ethiopia; International Foundation for Science (IFS) [W_6227-1]; ESRC [ES/S008179/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Addis Ababa University; Debretabor University; Water and Land Resources Centre of Ethiopia; International Foundation for Science (IFS)(International Foundation for Science); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This study was made possible through financial support to the first author from Addis Ababa University, Debretabor University and the Water and Land Resources Centre of Ethiopia.

However, the potential of NbS to provide the intended benefits has not been rigorously assessed. There are concerns over their reliability and cost-effectiveness compared to engineered alternatives, and their resilience to climate change. Trade-offs can arise if climate mitigation policy encourages NbS with low biodiversity value, such as afforestation with non-native monocultures. This can result in maladaptation, especially in a rapidly changing world where biodiversity-based resilience and multi-functional landscapes are key. Here, we highlight the rise of NbS in climate policy-focusing on their potential for climate change adaptation as well as mitigation-and discuss barriers to their evidence-based implementation. We outline the major financial and governance challenges to implementing NbS at scale, highlighting avenues for further research. As climate policy turns increasingly towards greenhouse gas removal approaches such as afforestation, we stress the urgent need for natural and social scientists to engage with policy makers. They must ensure that NbS can achieve their potential to tackle both the climate and biodiversity crisis while also contributing to sustainable development. This will require systemic change in the way we conduct research and run our institutions.

However, an increasing number of extreme events associated with the impacts of climate change, natural hazards and human-induced threats are posing significant problems in conserving and managing CH worldwide. Consequently, improved climate change adaptation and enhanced hazard/threat mitigation strategies have become critical (but to-date under-researched) considerations. The purpose of this paper is to identify the key hazards and threats to CH sites, the most common types of risks to CH and the strategies being adopted to mitigate or even eradicate those risks. Design/methodology/approach This paper reviews 80 CH case studies from around the world, which have been presented at a UNESCO International Training Course between 2006 and 2016. The case studies cover 45 different countries and provide practical insights into the key challenges being encountered in a variety of at risk locations. Findings The analysis assesses the key natural hazards and human-induced threats to the sites, an overview of the typical impacts to the tangible components of heritage and identifies the types of strategies being adopted to mitigate the risks, some of which could be transferred across cultural and geographical contexts. Originality/value The paper provides a wealth of useful information related to how challenges faced by CH sites might be addressed in the future.","[Bosher, Lee; Chmutina, Ksenia] Loughborough Univ, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Kim, Dowon; Okubo, Takeyuki; Jigyasu, Rohit] Ritsumeikan Univ, Inst Disaster Mitigat Urban Cultural Heritage, Kyoto, Japan",Loughborough University; Ritsumeikan University,"Bosher, L (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Loughborough, Leics, England.",L.Bosher@lboro.ac.uk; kim21@fc.ritsumei.ac.jp; okubo-t@se.ritsumei.ac.jp; k.chmutina@lboro.ac.uk; rohit.jigyasu@gmail.com,"kim, dowon/HIZ-7666-2022; Okubo, Takeyuki/GZH-3429-2022; okubo, takeyuki/GXN-4314-2022","Jigyasu, Rohit/0000-0002-5785-6761",Daiwa Foundation [14/15-35]; British Academy Visiting Fellowship [VF1\102103]; International Collaboration grant from Loughborough University,Daiwa Foundation; British Academy Visiting Fellowship; International Collaboration grant from Loughborough University,"This study was funded in part by a Daiwa Foundation Grant (14/15-35), a British Academy Visiting Fellowship (VF1\102103) and an International Collaboration grant from Loughborough University.

Climate change in the form of higher temperature, reduced rainfall, and increased rainfall variability reduces crop yield and threatens food security in low income and agriculture-based economies. This study reviews impact of climate change and variability, and climate change adaptation strategies employed at farm level in response to perceived changes in temperature and precipitation. Climate change negatively affects agriculture, nutrition, ground water availability, soil organic matter and soil quality, health conditions, growth and poverty. The survey reveals that Ethiopian farmers adopt many strategies in response to climate change. These strategies include use of improved crop varieties, agroforestry practices, crop diversification, soil conservation practices, tree planting, off-farm activities, irrigation practices, adjusting planting dates, selling of assets, food aid, and permanent and temporary migration in search of employment are the most important adaptation strategies by smallholder farmers. However, level of education, gender, age, wealth of the head of household, access to extension and credit, information and climate social capital, agroecological settings, and temperature all influence farmer's choices; lack of information on adaptation methods, financial constraints, and lack of access to land as main barriers to adapt climate change and variability.

Using high-resolution climate projections, infrastructure maps, and forecasts of peak electricity demand for Los Angeles County (LAC), we estimated vulnerabilities in the electricity infrastructure to 2060. We considered rising air temperatures under IPCC RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 at 2 km(2) grid cell resolution, two local government population growth scenarios, different efficiency implementations of new residential and commercial buildings, air conditioners (AC), and higher AC penetration. Results were that generators, substations, and transmission lines could lose up to 20% of safe operating capacities (MW). Moreover, based on recent historical load factors for substations in the Southern California Edison service territory, 848-6,724 MW (4-32%) of additional capacity, distributed energy resources, and/or peak load shifting could be needed by 2060 to avoid hardware overloading and outages. If peak load is not mitigated, and/or additional infrastructure capacity not added, then all scenarios result in > 100% substation overloading in Santa Clarita, which would trigger automatic outages, and > 20% substation overloading in at least Lancaster, Palmdale, and Pomona in which protection gear could trip outages within 30 min.

We present a multi-scale, multiobjective framework for generating a diverse family of stormwater best management practice (BMP) plans for entire watersheds. Each of these alternative BMP configurations are non-dominated by any other identified solution with respect to cost of the implementation of the management plan and sediment loading predicted at the outflow of the watershed; those solutions are then pruned with respect to dominance in sensitivity to predicted changes in precipitation patterns. We first use GIS data to automatically precompute a set of cost-optimal BMP configurations for each subwatershed, over its entire range of possible treatment levels. We then formulate each solution as a real-valued vector of treatment levels for the subwatersheds and employ a staged multiobjective optimization approach using differential evolution to generate sets of non-dominated solutions. Finally, selected solutions are mapped back to the corresponding preoptimized BMP configurations for each subwatershed. The integrated method is demonstrated on the Bartlett Brook mixed-used impaired watershed in South Burlington, VT, and patterns in BMP configurations along the non-dominated front are investigated. Watershed managers and other stakeholders could use this approach to assess the relative trade-offs of alternative stormwater BMP configurations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We develop a multicriteria model that draws on distributive justice's interconnections with the risk drivers of social vulnerabilities, flood hazard exposures, and the adaptive capacity of urban form (through land uses and town plans). The model assesses who is unequally at-risk to flooding events, hence, should be prioritized in adaptation responses; where are the high-risk priority areas located; and how can urban form adaptive interventions advance climate justice in the priority areas. We test the model in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where there are indications of increased rainfall events and disparities in social vulnerabilities. Our methodology started with surveying Toronto-based flooding experts who assigned weights to the risk drivers based on their importance. Using ArcGIS, we then mapped and overlayed the risk drivers' values in all the neighborhoods across the city based on the experts' assigned weights. Accordingly, we identified four high-risk tower communities with old infrastructure and vulnerable populations as the priority neighborhoods for adaptation interventions within the urban form. These four neighborhoods are typical of inner-city tower blocks built in the 20(th) century across North America, Europe, and Asia based on modern architectural ideas. Considering the lifespan of these blocks, this study calls for future studies to investigate how these types of neighborhoods can be adapted to climate change to advance climate justice.","[Mohtat, Niloofar; Khirfan, Luna] Univ Waterloo, Fac Environm, Sch Planning, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Mohtat, N (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Fac Environm, Sch Planning, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",nmohtat@uwaterloo.ca,,,,,,,113,0,0,2,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9634,,FRONT SUSTAIN CITIES,Front.

Pastureland ecosystems are increasingly being affected by climate and other anthropogenic changes, such as socio-economic and cultural changes, challenging nomadic livelihoods in the drylands. The research presented in this paper is based on extensive semi-structured interviews with local herders, key informants, and focus group discussions in Northeast Mongolia. Nomadic herders' perception and practices, supported by meteorological data, reveal that climate change has affected the provisioning of key ecosystem services, especially the availability of water and the quality and availability of pastureland. Many herders are now moving three times per year, not four, because of problems with water availability and increased dependence on local centres. For pastureland, changes in the absolute volume of rainfall is not the main problem. Rather, fine-grained changes in the timing of rainfall are interfering with plant growth, reducing pastureland quality. Together these are impacting livelihoods substantially. Such changes present challenges for current and future management of pastureland and adaptation to climate change at local and regional scales. Herd sizes have also increased in response to expanding market opportunities. Common property management changes are beginning to increase local herders' control over access to their neighbouring groups' traditional pasture and water. More extensive adaptation will be needed. The study suggests that valuing, maintaining, and conserving traditional ecological knowledge is essential if nomadic livelihoods are to be sustained through these changes.","[Tugjamba, Navchaa; Walkerden, Greg; Miller, Fiona] Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Sch Social Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Tugjamba, Navchaa] Mongolian Natl Univ Educ, Dept Geog, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",Macquarie University; Mongolian National University of Education,"Tugjamba, N (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Sch Social Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Tugjamba, N (corresponding author), Mongolian Natl Univ Educ, Dept Geog, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.",nalichaa@msue.edu.mn,,"Miller, Fiona/0000-0003-4427-6466; Walkerden, Greg/0000-0001-5520-7090; Tugjamba, Navchaa/0000-0001-8436-3068",Macquarie University through the International Macquarie Research Excellence Scholarship program (iMQRES),Macquarie University through the International Macquarie Research Excellence Scholarship program (iMQRES),This research study was supported by Macquarie University through the International Macquarie Research Excellence Scholarship program (iMQRES) to the first author<BOLD>. </BOLD>We thank all participants who generously shared their precious time and valuable knowledge and experiences of human and nature relations.,,49,3,3,6,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

This study investigates whether future climate conditions could influence P. maximum cell-wall structure and hydrolytic performance. To analyze interactions with environmental factors in field conditions, a combined Free-air Temperature and CO2 Controlled Enhancement (Trop-T-FACE) facility was used to investigate the isolated and combined effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eC) (600 mu mol.mol(-1)) and elevated temperature (eT) by 2 degrees C more than the ambient temperature, on cell-wall composition, cellulose crystallinity, accessibility, and hydrolysis yields. The elevated temperature treatments (eT and eT + eC) exhibited the most pronounced effects on the P. maximum cell wall. Warming reduced the starch content and the crystallinity index (CI) of cellulose and increased the cellulose content. Fluorescent protein-tagged carbohydrate-binding modules analysis demonstrated that warming improved total cellulose surface exposure/accessibility in eT and eT + eC by 181% and 132%, respectively. Consequently, glucan conversion yields were improved by 7.07% and 5.37%, showing that warming led to lower recalcitrance in P. maximum biomass, which positively affects its use in biorefineries. This work therefore provides important information from an ecological and economic point of view, allowing us to understand the mitigation process applied by this forage grass under future climate conditions. It might assist in selecting tropical forage grasses that are efficiently adapted to climate change, with a positive effect on bioenergy production.

This study evaluated the impacts of climate change on the hydrological regime by predicting the change in both monthly and seasonal streamflow, and identified water supply and demand relations under supply management options and environmental flow maintenance. To reach a better understanding of the consequences of possible climate change scenarios and adaptive management options on water supply, an integrated modeling approach was conducted by using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) and water evaluation and planning model (WEAP). Future scenarios were developed for the future period: 2060s (2051-2070), using an ensemble of three general circulation model (GCM) simulations: GFDL-CM3, GISS-E2-R-CC, and IPSL-CM5A-MR, driven by the climate projection for representative concentration pathways (RCPs): 6.0 (medium emission scenario). The results indicated that, firstly, the future streamflow will decrease, resulting in a decline of future water availability. Secondly, water supply under natural flow conditions would support 46,167 ha of irrigation schemes and the water shortages will be more noticeable when environmental flow maintenance was considered. The study concludes that reservoir construction would be necessary for agriculture mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Furthermore, the water resources management options considering both supply and demand management are more effective and useful than supply management only, particularly in dealing with climate change impacts.","[Touch, Tharo; Jiang, Yanan] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Water Resources & Architectural Engn, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Touch, Tharo; Oeurng, Chantha] Inst Technol Cambodia, Fac Hydrol & Water Resources Engn, Phnom Penh 12156, Cambodia; [Oeurng, Chantha] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Mokhtar, Ali] Northwest A&F Univ, Chinese Acad Sci & Minist Water Resources, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Mokhtar, Ali] Cairo Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Engn, Giza 12613, Egypt","Northwest A&F University - China; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Ministry of Water Resources; Northwest A&F University - China; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University","Jiang, YN (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Water Resources & Architectural Engn, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Oeurng, C (corresponding author), Inst Technol Cambodia, Fac Hydrol & Water Resources Engn, Phnom Penh 12156, Cambodia.;Oeurng, C (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",tharo.touch@yahoo.com; chantha@itc.edu.kh; yananjiang@nwafu.edu.cn; Ali.mokhtar@agr.cu.edu.eg,"Parween, Shama/AFQ-4232-2022","Tharo, Touch/0000-0003-1901-9484",Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC),Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council),This study was funded by a grant from Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC).,,58,8,8,1,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2020,12,9,,,,,,,2462,10.3390/w12092462,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12092462,,,26,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,OE7KM,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000580705100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The agriculture sector is one of the most vulnerable sectors with implications for smallholder farmers in semi-arid regions of Africa in terms of poverty and food security. Several researches have been carried out on perception and adaptation with a little investigation to unpack the gender differences and how this influence adaptation strategies. This research investigates gender difference and gender-specific adaptation strategies to climate change and variability. A household survey was conducted from August to December 2014 using a pre-tested questionnaire where 150 males and 150 female farmers were randomly sampled from 14 communities within the Bolgatanga Municipality and Bongo district. Results show the existence of gender differences in the adaptation strategies. Both gender groups perceived climatic change and variability but only 49% male and 40% female headed household (HH) have adopted strategies to cope with increasing temperatures while 56% male and 49% female have adapted to decreasing precipitation. On the other hand, 62% male and 60% female HH have adapted to increasing drought spells. The main differences between male and female adaptation strategies are that males prefer to migrate and seek employment in other parts of the country whereas females prefer to engage in off-farm jobs such as trading, basketry and shea-butter processing. The age of farmers, access to extension services, credit, perceived loss of soil fertility, among other factors influenced farmers adaptation strategies. Policy decisions to promote adaptation to climate change and variability should take these factors into consideration.","[Mensah, Michael] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architecture, Coll Art & Built Environm, Kumasi, Ghana; [Mensah, Michael; Vlek, Paul L.

As an integrated, people-centred, and planet sensitive approach, SSE aims to generate values for the local communities and people based on the principles of equity, inclusion, cooperation, solidarity and democracy. Its activities are primarily focused on meeting the needs of communities and creating an inclusive and sustainable society where socially vulnerable groups are also empowered. The Korean government established various supportive legal frameworks and policies for SSE in the past decade, and as a result, and a large range of SSE organizations and enterprises (SEOEs) has rapidly appeared in the country. While there is growing consensus that SEOEs in South Korea are potentially well-positioned to address the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is less clear how well it is doing in practice. This study uses the existing data and analysis to put together an assessment of the economic, social and environmental impacts of SSE in South Korea, and relates these impacts to the SDGs. Specifically, this study looks at SEOEs in urban agriculture and circular economy sectors to examine their role in building sustainable and innovative business and helping the country adapt to climate change. This study presents a number of evidence that SSE can be a key means of the achievement of SDGs, particularly 1, 2, 3, 8, 11, 12 and 13.","[Lee, S.] Univ Wisconsin, Dev Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Lee, S (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dev Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",sy81sunshine@gmail.com,,,,,,,32,28,28,0,48,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1350-4509,1745-2627,,INT J SUST DEV WORLD,Int.

Industrialization and global change processes affect SOC dynamics inmultiple, often opposing, ways. Herewe present a detailed SOC balance in Spanish cropland from 1900 to 2008, as a model of a Mediterranean, industrialized agriculture. Net Primary Productivity (NPP) and soil C inputs were estimated based on yield and management data. Changes in SOC stocks were modeled using HSOC, a simplemodelwith one inert and two active C pools, which combines RothCmodel parameters with humification coefficients. Crop yields increased by 227% during the studied period, but total C exported fromthe agroecosystem only increased by 73%, total NPP by 30%, and soil C inputs by 20%. There was a continued decline in SOC during the 20th century, and cropland SOC levels in 2008 were 17% below their 1933 peak. SOC trends were driven by historical changes in land uses, management practices and climate. Cropland expansion was themain driver of SOC loss until mid-20th century, followed by the decline in soil C inputs during the fast agricultural industrialization starting in the 1950s, which reduced harvest indices and weed biomass production, particularly in woody cropping systems. C inputs started recovering in the 1980s, mainly through increasing crop residue return. The upward trend in SOC mineralization rates was an increasingly important driver of SOC losses, triggered by irrigation expansion, soil cover loss and climate change-driven temperature rise.

The crop is grown in different seasons in a year with varying exposure to weather extremes, including high temperatures at critical growth stages which are expected to increase with climate change. This study assesses the impact of current and future heat stress on maize and the benefit of heat-tolerant varieties in SA. Annual mean maximum temperatures may increase by 1.4-1.8 A degrees C in 2030 and 2.1-2.6 A degrees C in 2050, with large monthly, seasonal, and spatial variations across SA. The extent of heat stressed areas in SA could increase by up to 12 % in 2030 and 21 % in 2050 relative to the baseline. The impact of heat stress and the benefit from heat-tolerant varieties vary with the level of temperature increase and planting season. At a regional scale, climate change would reduce rainfed maize yield by an average of 3.3-6.4 % in 2030 and 5.2-12.2 % in 2050 and irrigated yield by 3-8 % in 2030 and 5-14 % in 2050 if current varieties were grown under the future climate. Under projected climate, heat-tolerant varieties could minimize yield loss (relative to current maize varieties) by up to 36 and 93 % in 2030 and 33 and 86 % in 2050 under rainfed and irrigated conditions, respectively. Heat-tolerant maize varieties, therefore, have the potential to shield maize farmers from severe yield loss due to heat stress and help them adapt to climate change impacts.","[Tesfaye, Kindie; Getaneh, Fite] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Zaidi, P.

However, the scarcity of in situ data hampers an efficient analysis of drought in the country. The present dataset was created for agricultural drought characterization in the Sahelian climate zone of Niger. The dataset comprises the three-month scale and monthly time series of a composite drought index (CDI) and their corresponding drought classes at a spatial resolution of 1 km(2) for the period 2000-2020. The CDI was generated from remote sensing data, namely CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). A weighing technique combining entropy and Euclidian distance was applied in the CDI derivation. From the present dataset, the extraction of the CDI time series can be performed for any location of the study area using its geographic coordinates. Therefore, seasonal drought characteristics, such as onset, end, duration, severity and frequency can be computed from the CDI time series using the theory of runs. The availability of the present dataset is relevant for the socio-economic assessment of drought impacts at small spatial scales, such as district and household level. This dataset is also important for the assessment of drought characteristics in remote areas or areas inaccessible due to civil insecurity in the country as it was entirely generated from remote sensing data. Finally, by including temperature data, the dataset enables drought modelling under global warming.","[Garba, Issa; Abdourahamane, Zakari Seybou] Agrhymet Reg Ctr, POB 11011, Niamey, Niger; [Mirzabaev, Alisher] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Abdourahamane, ZS (corresponding author), Agrhymet Reg Ctr, POB 11011, Niamey, Niger.",abdourahamane.zakari@cilss.int,,,German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) [2014.0690.9],German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),"This research was funded by the Program of Accompanying Research on Agricultural Innovation (PARI) [2014.0690.9], supported by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).",,31,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2306-5729,,DATA,Data,FEB,2023,8,2,,,,,,,28,10.3390/data8020028,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/data8020028,,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Multidisciplinary Sciences",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Computer Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics,9G7CP,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000938306800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Growing extreme heat events caused by climate change have a serious impact on OTCs, especially in urban areas. Quantitatively characterizing and evaluating the spatiotemporal changes in OTCs are essential, and more applications are needed in urban agglomerations. Therefore, taking the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration as the study area, this study aimed to quantitatively assess the summer regional OTC from 1981 to 2020. First, the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) was used as the indicator of daily thermal stress, and then a Composite Thermal Comfort Score was proposed to evaluate the long-term, summertime, regional OTC considering the extent, duration, and intensity of daytime and nighttime thermal stress. The results showed that (a) the increase in UTCI (0.32?/10a at daytime and 0.21?/10a at nighttime) and heat stress frequency (0.88 at daytime and 0.39 d/10a at nighttime) were manifested over BTH, indicating a worse OTC. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity was also demonstrated. (b) The general OTC showed a decreasing north-south gradient pattern. At daytime, the northern mountainous zone presented the best OTC, the southern plain zone, especially Hengshui, Langfang, and Cangzhou, showed the worst. At nighttime, the mountain-plain transition zone showed the best OTC, the northern mountainous zone showed the worst since more cold stress occurred. Our findings will be useful in informing climate change adaptation strategies to ensure urban resilience as extreme heat increases in the context of climate change.","[Huang, Junwang; Shen, Shi; Cheng, Changxiu] Beijing Normal Univ, Key Lab Environm Change & Nat Disaster, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Junwang; Shen, Shi; Zhao, Min; Cheng, Changxiu] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Junwang; Shen, Shi; Zhao, Min] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Ctr Geodata & Anal, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Changxiu] Natl Tibetan Plateau Data Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University,"Shen, S (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Key Lab Environm Change & Nat Disaster, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Shen, S; Zhao, M (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Shen, S; Zhao, M (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Ctr Geodata & Anal, Beijing, Peoples R China.",shens@bnu.edu.cn; zhaomin@bnu.edu.cn,,"chen, shi/0000-0001-9126-229X",National Key Research and Development Plan of China; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation;  [2019YFA0606901];  [XDA23100303];  [2022T150057],National Key Research and Development Plan of China; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); ; ; ,"Acknowledgments Supported by the National Key Research and Development Plan of China (2019YFA0606901), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA23100303), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2022T150057).",,97,0,0,6,6,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2471-1403,,,GEOHEALTH,GeoHealth,JAN,2023,7,1,,,,,,,e2022GH000725,10.1029/2022GH000725,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022GH000725,,,22,"Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",8R7GQ,36594002,"Green Accepted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000928059500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

At the same time, they are confronted by the necessity to increase food availability for a growing population, but also to ensure a sustainable use of natural resources. In this process, agriculture is not just the fiend responsible for an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, nor the victim of rising temperatures and extreme weather events. Agriculture is also an ally in climate change mitigation and adaptation because the selection of ad hoc crop varieties and livestock can lower the environmental impact of farming and the implementation of better management practices can promote soil conservation. Whether agriculture will have a positive or a negative impact on climate change adaptation and mitigation will depend on the rural policies implemented, but it will also be contingent on an adequate understanding of the interconnections existing between weather, climate, and farming. This review explores such interconnections by focusing on the history of agricultural meteorology, which is the research field that studies the impact of weather and climate on crops, livestock, farming operations, and plant and animal pests and diseases. The article discusses stakeholders, institutions, and main developments in agricultural meteorology, and describes how the agenda of agricultural meteorology has shifted over time. At the beginning of the 20th century, research in agricultural meteorology focused on increasing the profitability of farming. In the 21st century, instead, the main goal of agricultural meteorology is to ensure food security and guarantee sustainability.

At one time, mitigation (reduction) of human emissions of greenhouse gases appeared to offer the best response to prevent the worst impacts of a changing climate. It soon became clear, however, that the world would not be able to reduce emissions quickly enough or to a level sufficient to prevent, in the words of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Climate change is already altering the frequency and severity of extreme weather events worldwide, and these trends are expected to increase in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, it is well recognized that adapting in place to the changing climate is necessary. Yet, that may not be enough. An additional step in responding to climate risks is emerging, one that requires fundamentally and permanently changing the human interactions with nature in parts of the world. This strategy is often referred to as managed retreat, but that term has become controversial, and other terms are needed that express inclusion of the positive societal benefits that can emerge from proactive action. This paper provides a review of the emerging themes within the literature of managed retreat as a climate risk management approach, uses examples from the transportation and infrastructure sector, collects and identifies important nomenclature and definitions, key decision-making considerations, and research gaps that warrant immediate attention. The results of this review are intended to be useful to academic climate change adaptation researchers and infrastructure practitioners alike.","[Dundon, Leah A.; Abkowitz, Mark] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2301 Vanderbilt Pl,PMB 351831, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",Vanderbilt University,"Dundon, LA (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2301 Vanderbilt Pl,PMB 351831, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",leah.a.dundon@vanderbilt.edu; mark.abkowitz@vanderbilt.edu,,,Maritime Transportation Research and Education Center at the University of Arkansas,Maritime Transportation Research and Education Center at the University of Arkansas,"The authors would like to acknowledge the Maritime Transportation Research and Education Center at the University of Arkansas, and the assistance of Ms. Rashmi Jha.",,92,6,6,1,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

Conversely, either through lack of information about risks at destinations or as outcome of balancing those risks, people might move to locations where they are more exposed to climatic risk than at their origin locations. Climate damages, whose quantification informs understanding of societal exposure and vulnerability, are typically computed by integrated assessment models (IAMs). Yet migration is hardly included in commonly used IAMs. In this paper, we investigate how border policy, a key influence on international migration flows, affects exposure and vulnerability to climate change impacts. To this aim, we include international migration and remittance dynamics explicitly in a widely used IAM employing a gravity model and compare four scenarios of border policy. We then quantify effects of border policy on population distribution, income, exposure, and vulnerability and of CO2 emissions and temperature increase for the period 2015 to 2100 along five scenarios of future development and climate change. We find that most migrants tend to move to areas where they are less exposed and vulnerable than where they came from. Our results confirm that migration and remittances can positively contribute to climate change adaptation. Crucially, our findings imply that restrictive border policy can increase exposure and vulnerability, by trapping people in areas where they are more exposed and vulnerable than where they would otherwise migrate. These results suggest that the consequences of migration policy should play a greater part in deliberations about international climate policy.","[Benveniste, Helene; Oppenheimer, Michael; Fleurbaey, Marc] Princeton Univ, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Oppenheimer, Michael] Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Fleurbaey, Marc] Princeton Univ, Univ Ctr Human Values, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Fleurbaey, Marc] CNRS, Paris Sch Econ, Paris Jourdan Sci Econ, F-75014 Paris, France",Princeton University; Princeton University; Princeton University; Paris School of Economics; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole des Ponts ParisTech,"Benveniste, H (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",helene.benveniste@princeton.edu,"Fleurbaey, Marc/HHS-9231-2022","Oppenheimer, Michael/0000-0002-9708-5914; Benveniste, Helene/0000-0003-1627-0219; Fleurbaey, Marc/0000-0002-5342-8065",,,,,50,13,13,2,8,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,1091-6490,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Denser soil surface conditions and large amounts of crop residues, however, may be a constraint for early plant establishment, especially in irrigated production areas with high yield potential. Genotype by tillage interactions for yield are not well understood and it is unknown whether tillage should be an evaluation factor in breeding programs. Twenty-six CIMMYT bread (Tritieum aestivum) and durum (Triticum turgidum) wheat genotypes, created between 1964 and 2009, were tested for yield and agronomic performance at CIMMYT's experimental station near Ciudad Obregon, Mexico, over six years. Treatments included conventional and permanent raised beds with full and reduced irrigation. The objectives were to study breeding progress in distinct agronomic systems and to elucidate the importance of tillage and genotype by tillage interaction for yield and agronomic traits. Breeding progress was achieved irrespective of agronomic treatment. Tillage influenced plant growth and number of grains per m(2) in both wheat types. In bread wheat, genotype by tillage interaction was significant for yield, test weight, and growth parameters. However, no cross -over effects were detected and rank changes were small. In durum wheat, genotype by tillage interaction was only significant for plant growth. The results do not indicate the need for separate breeding programs. However, the question of a need for selection under zero tillage to increase breeding progress is yet to be answered.","[Honsdorf, Nora; Mulvaney, Michael J.; Singh, Ravi P.; Ammar, Karim; Burgueno, Juan; Govaerts, Bram; Verhulst, Nele] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Apdo Postal 6-641, Mexico City 06600, DF, Mexico; [Mulvaney, Michael J.] Univ Florida, Agron Dept, West Florida Res & Educ Ctr, 4253 Expt Rd,Hwy 182, Jay, FL 32565 USA",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Govaerts, B (corresponding author), Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Apdo Postal 6-641, Mexico City 06600, DF, Mexico.",b.govaerts@cgiar.org,"Singh, Ravi Prakash/I-5575-2019; Mulvaney, Michael/AAJ-7077-2020","Burgueno, Juan/0000-0002-1468-4867; Govaerts, Bram/0000-0002-6109-7286; Verhulst, Nele/0000-0001-5032-4386",,,,,48,14,14,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-4290,1872-6852,,FIELD CROP RES,Field Crop.

This study sets out to examine the characteristics of forest owners' in Sweden, the information and knowledge-sharing networks they draw upon for decision-making, and their perceptions of climate risks, their forests' resilience, the need for adaptation, and perceived adaptive capacity. By applying the concept of ego-network analysis, the empirical data was generated by a quantitative survey distributed to 3000 private forest owners' in Sweden in 2014 with a response rate of 31%. The results show that there is a positive correlation, even though it is generally weak, between forest owner climate perceptions and (i) network features, i.e. network size and heterogeneity, and (ii) presence of certain alter groups (i.e. network members or actors). Results indicate that forest owners' social networks currently serve only a minimal function of sharing knowledge of climate change and adaptation. Moreover, considering the fairly infrequent contact between respondents and alter groups, the timing of knowledge sharing is important. In conclusion we suggest those actors that forest owners' most frequently communicate with, especially forestry experts providing advisory services (e.g. forest owner associations, companies, and authorities) have a clear role to communicate both the risks of climate change and opportunities for adaptation. Peers are valuable in connecting information about climate risks and adaptation to the actual forest property.","[Andre, Karin; Swartling, Asa Gerger; Vulturius, Gregor] Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm Ctr, Linnegatan 87D, S-11523 Stockholm, Sweden; [Baird, Julia; Plummer, Ryan] Brock Univ, Environm Sustainabil Res Ctr, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada; [Vulturius, Gregor] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Drummond St, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Plummer, Ryan] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, S-11419 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm Environment Institute; Brock University; University of Edinburgh; Stockholm University,"Andre, K (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm Ctr, Linnegatan 87D, S-11523 Stockholm, Sweden.",karin.andre@sei-international.org,"Swartling, Åsa C Gerger/J-1420-2018","Swartling, Åsa C Gerger/0000-0003-3616-7323; Andre, Karin/0000-0002-0373-0143",Swedish Foundation for Environmental Research (Mistra),Swedish Foundation for Environmental Research (Mistra),"The authors wish to thank all respondents for their participation.

Prior studies of climate change effects in protected areas have largely focused on average climatic conditions. However, extreme weather may have stronger effects on wildlife populations and habitats than changes in averages. Our goal was to quantify future changes in the frequency of extreme heat, drought, and false springs, during the avian breeding season, in 415 National Wildlife Refuges in the conterminous United States. We analyzed spatially detailed data on extreme weather frequencies during the historical period (1950-2005) and under different scenarios of future climate change by mid- and late-21st century. We found that all wildlife refuges will likely experience substantial changes in the frequencies of extreme weather, but the types of projected changes differed among refuges. Extreme heat is projected to increase dramatically in all wildlife refuges, whereas changes in droughts and false springs are projected to increase or decrease on a regional basis. Half of all wildlife refuges are projected to see increases in frequency (>20% higher than the current rate) in at least two types of weather extremes by mid-century. Wildlife refuges in the Southwest and Pacific Southwest are projected to exhibit the fastest rates of change, and may deserve extra attention. Climate change adaptation strategies in protected areas, such as the U.S. wildlife refuges, may need to seriously consider future changes in extreme weather, including the considerable spatial variation of these changes.

They can thereby help to mitigate climate change-induced impacts and serve as proactive adaptation options for municipalities. We explore the various contexts in which nature-based solutions are relevant for climate mitigation and adaptation in urban areas, identify indicators for assessing the effectiveness of nature-based solutions and related knowledge gaps. In addition, we explore existing barriers and potential opportunities for increasing the scale and effectiveness of nature-based solution implementation. The results were derived from an inter- and transdisciplinary workshop with experts from research, municipalities, policy, and society. As an outcome of the workshop discussions and building on existing evidence, we highlight three main needs for future science and policy agendas when dealing with nature-based solutions: (i) produce stronger evidence on nature-based solutions for climate change adaptation and mitigation and raise awareness by increasing implementation; (ii) adapt for governance challenges in implementing nature-based solutions by using reflexive approaches, which implies bringing together new networks of society, nature-based solution ambassadors, and practitioners; (iii) consider socio-environmental justice and social cohesion when implementing nature-based solutions by using integrated governance approaches that take into account an integrative and transdisciplinary participation of diverse actors. Taking these needs into account, nature-based solutions can serve as climate mitigation and adaptation tools that produce additional cobenefits for societal well-being, thereby serving as strong investment options for sustainable urban planning.","[Kabisch, Nadja; Bonn, Aletta] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecosyst Serv, Leipzig, Germany; [Kabisch, Nadja; Bonn, Aletta] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Kabisch, Nadja; Haase, Dagmar] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Berlin, Germany; [Frantzeskaki, Niki] Erasmus Univ, DRIFT Dutch Res Inst Transit, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Pauleit, Stephan] Tech Univ Munich, Strateg Landscape Planning & Management, D-80290 Munich, Germany; [Naumann, Sandra; Davis, McKenna] Inst Ecol, Berlin, Germany; [Artmann, Martina] Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev IOER, Dresden, Germany; [Artmann, Martina] Salzburg Univ, Res Grp Urban & Landscape Ecol, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Haase, Dagmar] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Leipzig, Germany; [Knapp, Sonja] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Commun Ecol, Leipzig, Germany; [Korn, Horst; Stadler, Jutta] German Fed Agcy Nat Conservat, Bonn, Germany; [Zaunberger, Karin] Commiss European Communities, Environm Directorate Gen, Brussels, Belgium; [Bonn, Aletta] Univ Jena, D-07745 Jena, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Humboldt University of Berlin; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Technical University of Munich; Leibniz Institut fur okologische Raumentwicklung; Salzburg University; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Kabisch, N (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecosyst Serv, Leipzig, Germany.;Kabisch, N (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany.;Kabisch, N (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Berlin, Germany.",,"Knapp, Sonja/D-5989-2015; Bonn, Aletta/A-2164-2013; Kabisch, Nadja/ABE-6198-2020; Frantzeskaki, Niki/AAN-1044-2021","Knapp, Sonja/0000-0001-5792-4691; Bonn, Aletta/0000-0002-8345-4600; Kabisch, Nadja/0000-0002-8925-4423; Frantzeskaki, Niki/0000-0002-6983-448X; Artmann, Martina/0000-0003-3119-4314; Pauleit, Stephan/0000-0002-0056-6720; Haase, Dagmar/0000-0003-4065-5194","German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation; German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety [3514 80 020A]","German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation; German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety","We would like to sincerely thank all participants for their active contribution to the expert workshop on which this paper builds.

The flow of water, or the system flow, running through this infrastructure is a hydraulic variable required to satisfy water demand for crops. The majority of general ocean-atmospheric circulation models indicate warmer and dryer environments in most of Mexico, with significant effects on evapotranspiration of crops, a basic agronomic variable for determining the capacity of hydro-agricultural infrastructure. The present work presents the development of a methodology to evaluate the integrated evapotranspiration of crops in large irrigation areas containing diversified crop patterns with different planting dates and agricultural cycles. This serves as a basis to analyze the resulting changes in infrastructure given projected climate change scenarios assuming two possible agricultural adaptation actions. The Santa Rosa Irrigation Users Association is analyzed as a case study, located in Rio Fuerte Irrigation District 075, Sinaloa, Mexico. The results indicate an increase of 5% in the design flow capacity of large irrigation areas for the climate change adaptation measures analyzed for the middle of the century with an A1B emissions scenario. Likewise, an increase of 5% in the design capacity will also occur for small irrigation areas with and without adaptation measures. In terms of the annual volume requirement given the same A1B emissions scenario and the adaptation measurements studied, there would be an increase of 8.5%. It is concluded that the methodology developed can be applied to any irrigation district in Mexico to analyze the impact of climate change on irrigation infrastructure.","[Iniguez, Mauro; Ojeda-Bustamante, Waldo] Inst Mexicano Tecnol Agua, Paseo Cuauhnahuac 8535, Jiutepec 62550, Morelos, Mexico; [Diaz-Delgado, Carlos] Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Fac Ingn, CIRA, Cerro Coatepec S-N,Ciudad Univ, Toluca 50130, Estado De Mexic, Mexico",,"Ojeda-Bustamante, W (corresponding author), Inst Mexicano Tecnol Agua, Paseo Cuauhnahuac 8535, Jiutepec 62550, Morelos, Mexico.",mic@tlaloc.imta.mx; wojeda@tlaloc.imta.mx; cdiazd@uaemex.mx,"Ojeda-Bustamante, Waldo/A-4095-2011","Ojeda-Bustamante, Waldo/0000-0001-7183-9637",,,,,24,2,3,0,9,INST MEXICANO TECHNOLOGIAAGUA,MORELOS,"APARTADO POSTAL 202, MORELOS 62550 CIVAC, MEXICO",0187-8336,2007-2422,,TECNOL CIENC AGUA,Tecnol.

Rural areas, nonetheless, harbor opportunities to mitigate global climate changes. Identification of innovative adaptation strategies used by small-scale farmers, therefore, is crucial in order to understand the extent of their implications. This paper identifies the relationships between livelihood units and landscapes that they depend upon, in a small-scale farm community. It examines their experiences of increasing climatic variability, and how the different groups in the community are adapting to it. The study was conducted in a typical rural ejido community on the Pacific coast of Mexico (Ejido Ticuiz), where a detailed socio-cultural profile was obtained by means of semi-structured interviews. In the study area we encountered a range of individual and community-based adaptation strategies, built on farmers' recognition of the different types of landscapes which supply goods and benefits. Small-scale farmers have used their landscape diversity to build adaptation strategies to guarantee the supply of goods and benefits to cope with uncertain of climate events. Households rather than individuals or the community as an institution were depicted as the core socio-cultural group for better understanding of patterns, behavior and aspirations related to climate change adaptation at local level. The adaptation capacities of rural communities could be significantly strengthened if political, financial and institutional support is targeted at households rather than at individuals or the community level only.

Conservation planning and implementation under climate change are challenging due to uncertainties about climate impacts and the effectiveness of adaptation options. Strategically building flexibility into conservation plans so they can be adjusted over time in response to unforeseen events, or new information, is one solution to this challenge. Yet, there are a wide range of mechanisms to choose from to enhance flexibility and so there is a need for a more structured approach to inform building flexibility into conservation plans. To achieve this, we conceptualize flexible strategies as three types, procedural flexibility, resource flexibility, and action flexibility, and explicitly link these to climate risks and steps in conservation decision-making processes. We discuss how this framework can guide choices of flexible strategies, including identifying the costs and benefits, and illustrate this using examples. This provides a new conceptual tool for conservation organizations to make strategic choices about flexibility for climate adaptation.","[Rhodes, Jonathan R.] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Rhodes, Jonathan R.] Univ Queensland, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Armsworth, Paul R.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 569 Dabney Hall,1416 Circle Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Iacona, Gwenllian] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Biodivers Outcomes, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Shah, Payal] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol Grad Univ, 1919-1 Tancha, Onna Son, Okinawa 9040495, Japan; [Gordon, Ascelin] RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Wilson, Kerrie A.] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Runting, Rebecca K.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog Earth & Atmospher Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Bryan, Brett A.] Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Queensland; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Okinawa Institute of Science & Technology Graduate University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Melbourne; Deakin University,"Rhodes, JR (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.;Rhodes, JR (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",j.rhodes@uq.edu,"Gordon, Ascelin/I-9184-2012; Rhodes, Jonathan/C-4841-2008","Gordon, Ascelin/0000-0002-0648-0346; Rhodes, Jonathan/0000-0001-6746-7412","Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions [CE1101014]; Australian Research Council Future Fellowship [FT200100096]; Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Research Award [DE210100492]; Australian Research Council [DE210100492, CE1101014, FT200100096] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council Future Fellowship(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Research Award(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This work was partially funded by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions (CE1101014).

Therefore, significant attention must be devoted to the development of efficient adaptation strategies. More specifically, the reoperation of water resources systems to keep the overall performance within acceptable limits should be prioritized to avoid, or at least delay as much as possible, costly infrastructural investments. This manuscript presents a hydrologically-driven approach to support the reoperation of multipurpose multireservoir systems. The approach is organized around 1) the use of a large ensemble of GCM hydro-climate projections to drive a climate stress test; 2) the bottom-up clustering of those hydrologic projections based on hydrologic attributes that are both relevant to the region of interest and interpretable by the operators; and finally, 3) the identification of adaptation measures for each cluster after developing a one-way coupling of an optimization model with a simulation model. The climate impact assessment is illustrated with the multipurpose multireservoir system of the Lievre River basin in Quebec (Canada). Results show that cluster-specific, adapted, operating rules can improve the performance of the system and reveal its operational flexibility with respect to the different operating objectives.","[Sant'Anna, Caio; Tilmant, Amaury] Laval Univ, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Pulido-Velazquez, Manuel] Univ Politecn Valencia, Valencia, Spain",Laval University; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Sant'Anna, C (corresponding author), Laval Univ, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",,,"Tilmant, Amaury/0000-0001-9586-5274",MELCC (Quebecs Ministere de lEnvironnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques) [PACC 2013-2020]; NSERC Discovery Grant (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada); Compute Canada; Fonds vert,MELCC (Quebecs Ministere de lEnvironnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques); NSERC Discovery Grant (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Compute Canada; Fonds vert,"The work was partly supported by a project funded by MELCC (Quebecs Ministere de lEnvironnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques) through two programs: PACC 2013-2020 and Fonds vert.

However, its co-benefits in climate adaptation have not been sufficiently explored, which may result in a lack of insights about co-benefits and prevent wider roll-out and scaling-up. This paper aims at exploring co-benefits of solar-powered irrigation, an adaptation measure, taking a project in a drought-prone area of the northwest part of Bangladesh as a case. Using both interviews and focused group discussion, this research finds that besides generating co-benefits in climate mitigation, there are substantial adaptation co-benefits in various forms including vulnerability reduction and enhancement of resilience. However, many of the co-benefits in climate adaptation are indirect and less visible and realizable in the long-term, such as informal social group formation, improved financial strength, and employment opportunity.

With the country being a major recipient of official development assistance, Mozambique's development strongly depends on donor investments. Against this background, we aim to encourage the mainstreaming of climate adaptation into development assistance. An analysis of donor investments at a sub-national level showed that a significant proportion of development assistance was invested in climate-sensitive sectors in regions highly exposed to extreme weather conditions. Major damage caused by weather extremes motivates a stronger integration of climate policies into development assistance. Although Mozambique ha:; a supportive legislative environment and climate awareness among donors was found to be high, the limited institutional capacity restricted mainstreaming initiatives. Given major barriers at the national level, bilateral and multilateral donors are able to play a key role in fostering mainstreaming in Mozambique. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Efforts to enhance farmers' adaptation to climate change are hindered by lack of information on how they are experiencing and responding to climate change. Therefore, this paper examines smallholder farmers' perceptions of climate change, factors influencing their perceptions, and the impacts and adaptation strategies adopted over the past three to four decades. A list of farmers was obtained from the Agricultural Marketing Cooperative Society (AMCOS) and filtered on the basis of age and farming experience. In order to explore factors influencing household perceptions of climate change, a structured questionnaire was administered to the randomly selected household heads. Data on rainfall and temperature were acquired from Lyamungo and Burka Coffee estate (Northern Highlands zone) and Mbimba and Mbinga (Southern Highlands zone) offices of the Tanzania Meteorological Agency (TMA) with the exception of data from Burka Coffee estate, which were acquired from a private operator. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to analyze the data. Farmers' perceptions were consistent with meteorological data both pointing to significant decline in rainfall and increase in temperature since 1979. Factors such as level of education, farming experience, and access to climate information influenced farmers' perception on climate change aspects. Based on these results, it is recommended to enhance timely and accurate weather information delivery along with developing institutions responsible for education and extension services provision. The focus of education or training should be on attenuating the impacts of climate change through relevant adaptation measures in each coffee-growing region.","[Mbwambo, Suzana G.] Tanzania Coffee Res Inst TaCRI, Moshi POB 3004, Moshi, Tanzania; [Mourice, Sixbert K.; Tarimo, Akwilin J.

According to a representative public opinion survey 34% of Hungarian citizens believe that corporations are responsible for climate change. The business sector is motivated to take an active role in the mitigation and adaptation of climate change. As a result, the last few decades saw a marked increase in corporate measures aiming at the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as other initiatives to tackle climate-related problems which result in numerous social issues. The aim of this paper is to assess whether Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) can be applied as a tool in agribusiness fostering steps towards the implementation of the climate-oriented and sustainable agriculture in Hungary. The research makes an effort to explore the role and opportunities of the Hungarian agricultural sector in adapting to climate change, it also examines the extent of the mitigation and adaptation activities appearing in the CSR portfolio of the companies and what specific measures are taken to realize them. The results of the evaluation show that climate-oriented CSR activities of the companies are relatively undeveloped, but businesses are working to reduce the impact of climate change on the usage of exercising adaptation strategies. There are several actions that can help to reduce vulnerability to the consequences of climate change in the agriculture sector. The results can support not only companies but other decision-makers decisions in climate-oriented CSR activities in agribusiness.","[Biro, Kinga; Csete, Maria Szalmane] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Environm Econ, Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Biro, K (corresponding author), Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Environm Econ, Budapest, Hungary.",biro@eik.bme.hu; csete@eik.bme.hu,"Csete, Maria/AAP-1198-2021; Biró, Kinga/AAS-8171-2020","Csete, Maria/0000-0001-7170-9402; Biro, Dr. Kinga/0000-0002-9406-9038",Budapest University of Technology and Economics; Higher Education Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME FIKP-VIZ); Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences,Budapest University of Technology and Economics; Higher Education Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME FIKP-VIZ); Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences(Hungarian Academy of Sciences),Open access funding provided by Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

Climate change has enhanced the frequency and intensity of extreme events in Bangladesh, thus resulting in loss of biodiversity and agricultural crop production. However, trend studies in the frequency of climatic variables like rainfall at the micro-scale are less explored in the previous literature. Therefore, this study aims to explore the spatiotemporal trends in the frequency of daily rainfall using different statistical models based on 23 station data from 1975 to 2017 in Bangladesh. The statistical results show that the frequency of rainfall ranges of < 5 mm, > 10 to <= 15 mm, > 15 to <= 20 mm, and > 25 to <= 30 mm exhibited an increasing trend while rainfall ranges of > 5 to <= 10 mm, > 20 to <= 25 mm, > 30 to <= 35 mm, and > 35 mm displayed a decreasing trend (p > 0.10). The jump test results indicate that only one jump occurred in the average rainfall ranges of > 15 to <= 20 mm (p < 0.10). The changes in temporal trends of different rainfall frequency ranges show an irregular pattern during the study period. The spatial map of trends among various rainfall ranges over sub-climatic regions is heterogeneous nature which varies from region wise and station wise. The probability density function (PDFs) of rainfall frequency ranges will move upward in the future and broaden with an increase in the forthcoming period. To adapt to climate change, the findings highlight the need for the advancement of water resource management and reallocation of agricultural adaptation plans in Bangladesh.","[Islam, Abu Reza Md Towfiqul; Rahman, Md Siddiqur; Khatun, Runa] Begum Rokeya Univ, Dept Disaster Management, Rangpur 5400, Bangladesh; [Islam, Abu Reza Md Towfiqul; Hu, Zhenghua] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Appl Meteorol, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Islam, AMT (corresponding author), Begum Rokeya Univ, Dept Disaster Management, Rangpur 5400, Bangladesh.;Islam, AMT (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Appl Meteorol, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",towfiq_dm@brur.ac.bd,"Rahman, Mohammad Siddiqur/HGC-0208-2022; Islam, Abu Reza Md.

In this letter, we study the role of large storage operations as flexible means of adaptation to climate change. In particular, we explore the impacts of different climate projections for different future time horizons on the multi-purpose operations of the existing system of large dams in the Red River basin (China-Laos-Vietnam). We identify the main vulnerabilities of current system operations, understand the risk of failure across sectors by exploring the evolution of the system tradeoffs, quantify how the uncertainty associated to climate scenarios is expanded by the storage operations, and assess the expected costs if no adaptation is implemented. Results show that, depending on the climate scenario and the time horizon considered, the existing operations are predicted to change on average from -7 to + 5% in hydropower production,+ 35 to + 520% in flood damages, and + 15 to + 160% in water supply deficit. These negative impacts can be partially mitigated by adapting the existing operations to future climate, reducing the loss of hydropower to 5%, potentially saving around 34.4 million US$ year(-1) at the national scale. Since the Red River is paradigmatic of many river basins across south east Asia, where new large dams are under construction or are planned to support fast growing economies, our results can support policy makers in prioritizing responses and adaptation strategies to the changing climate.","[Giuliani, Matteo; Castelletti, Andrea; Soncini-Sessa, Rodolfo] Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Pzza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Anghileri, Daniela; Castelletti, Andrea] ETH, Inst Environm Engn, Wolfgang Pauli Str 15, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Phuong Nam Vu] Inst Water Resources Planning, 162A Tran Quang Khai St, Hanoi, Vietnam",Polytechnic University of Milan; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Giuliani, M (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Pzza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",matteo.giuliani@polimi.it; daniela.anghileri@sccer-soe.ethz.ch; andrea.castelletti@polimi.it; namvu.iwrp@gmail.com; rodolfo.soncini@polimi.it,"Castelletti, Andrea/AAG-7111-2020; Anghileri, Daniela/AAN-2177-2020","Anghileri, Daniela/0000-0001-6220-8593; Giuliani, Matteo/0000-0002-4780-9347; Castelletti, Andrea/0000-0002-7923-1498",IMRR-Integrated and sustainable water Management of the Red-Thai Binh Rivers System in changing climate research project - Italian Ministry of Foreign Affair as part of its development cooperation program,IMRR-Integrated and sustainable water Management of the Red-Thai Binh Rivers System in changing climate research project - Italian Ministry of Foreign Affair as part of its development cooperation program,"This work was partially supported by the IMRR-Integrated and sustainable water Management of the Red-Thai Binh Rivers System in changing climate research project funded by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affair as part of its development cooperation program.

Crops suitable for temperate and Mediterranean climates were selected from four groups: oilseeds (e.g. oilseed rape, sunflower), starch crops (e.g. potatoes), cereals (e.g. barley) and solid biofuel crops (e.g. sorghum, Miscanthus). The impact of climate change under different scenarios and GCMs on the potential future distribution of these crops was determined, based on predicted future climatic conditions. Climate scenarios based on four IPCC SRES emission scenarios, A1FI A2, B1 and B2, implemented by four global climate models, HadCM3, CSIRO2, PCM and CGCM2, were used. The potential distribution of temperate oilseeds, cereals, starch crops and solid biofuels is predicted to increase in northern Europe by the 2080s, due to increasing temperatures, and decrease in southern Europe (e.g. Spain, Portugal, southern France, Italy, and Greece) due to increased drought. Mediterranean oil and solid biofuel crops, currently restricted to southern Europe, are predicted to extend further north due to higher summer temperatures. Effects become more pronounced with time and are greatest under the A1FI scenario and for models predicting the greatest climate forcing. Different climate models produce different regional patterns. All models predict that bioenergy crop production in Spain is especially vulnerable to climate change, with many temperate crops predicted to decline dramatically by the 2080s. The choice of bioenergy crops in southern Europe will be severely reduced in future unless measures are taken to adapt to climate change. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies have projected the NSWS changes; however, the changes of NSWS with different GWLs have yet to be studied. In this paper, we employ the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model large ensembles to evaluate the contributions of different GWLs to the NSWS changes. The results show that the NSWS decreases over the Northern Hemisphere (NH) mid-to-high latitudes and increases over the Southern Hemisphere (SH) as the GWL increases by 1.5 degrees C-4.0 degrees C relative to the preindustrial period, and that these characteristics are more significant with the stronger GWL. The probability density of the NSWS shifts toward weak winds over NH and strong winds over SH between the current climate and the 4.0 degrees C GWL. Compared to 1.5 degrees C GWL, the NSWS decreases -0.066 m s(-1) over NH and increases +0.065 m s(-1) over SH with 4.0 degrees C GWL, especially for East Asia and South America, the decrease and increase are most significant, which reach -0.21 and +0.093 m s(-1), respectively. Changes in the temperature gradient induced by global warming could be the primary factor causing the interhemispheric asymmetry of future NSWS changes. Intensified global warming induces the reduction in Hadley, Ferrell, and Polar cells over NH and the strengthening of the Hadley cell over SH could be another determinant of asymmetry changes in NSWS between two hemispheres.","[Zha, Jinlin; Zhao, Deming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, CAS Key Lab Reg Climate & Environm Temperate East, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Zha, Jinlin; Wu, Jian; Fan, Wenxuan] Yunnan Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Key Lab Atmospher Environm & Proc Boundary Layer, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Shen, Cheng] Gaochun Meteorol Bur, Nanjing 211300, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhibo] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Lab Climate & Atmosphere Ocean Studies, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Sun, Ming] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Azorin-Molina, Cesar] Consejo Super Invest Cient CIDE CSIC, Ctr Invest Desertificac, Valencia, Spain; [Azorin-Molina, Cesar; Deng, Kaiqiang] Univ Gothenburg, Reg Climate Grp, Dept Earth Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Yunnan University; Peking University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); University of Valencia; CSIC-GV-UV - Centro de Investigaciones sobre Desertificacion (CIDE); University of Gothenburg","Zhao, DM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, CAS Key Lab Reg Climate & Environm Temperate East, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",zhaodm@tea.ac.cn,"Azorin-Molina, Cesar/ABB-5381-2021; Li, Zhibo/AAK-4293-2020; Li (李), Zhibo (智博)/GQI-1420-2022; shen, cheng/AAJ-8625-2021","Li (李), Zhibo (智博)/0000-0001-9135-1583; shen, cheng/0000-0003-1727-2638; Deng, Kaiqiang/0000-0001-6587-0902; fan, wenxuan/0000-0003-2457-5821; ZHAO, Deming/0000-0003-0063-9376; Zha, Jinlin/0000-0001-8292-7464","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFA0606004]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42005023, 41875178, 41865001, 41775087]; Nanjing Meteorological Bureau Scientific Project [NJ202103]; Program for Special Research Assistant Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Program for Key Laboratory in University of Yunnan Province; Ramon y Cajal fellowship [RYC-2017-22830]; BBVA Foundation; MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE [VR-2017-03780, RTI2018-095749-A-I00]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Nanjing Meteorological Bureau Scientific Project; Program for Special Research Assistant Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Program for Key Laboratory in University of Yunnan Province; Ramon y Cajal fellowship(Spanish Government); BBVA Foundation(BBVA Foundation); MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE","The work is supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFA0606004), National Natural Science Foundation of China (42005023, 41875178, 41865001, 41775087), Nanjing Meteorological Bureau Scientific Project (NJ202103), the Program for Special Research Assistant Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Program for Key Laboratory in University of Yunnan Province, and the C.A.M. was supported by Ramon y Cajal fellowship (RYC-2017-22830), the Leonardo grant 2021 from the BBVA Foundation, and the Grant Nos.

Climate change-induced losses and damages to ecosystem services (l&d-ES) thus have significant impacts on societies. Yet, little of the work on losses and damages (l&d) has focused on ecosystem services. Also in international climate negotiations, where the debate emerged with the establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM), there remains space for better understanding and addressing l&d-ES. Part of the explanation of this lies in the challenge of assessing such l&d. To address this gap, this paper reviews scientific literature and data obtained from Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNAs) to explore ways forward for more in depth assessments. The review confirms that little attention has been given to the topic, identifying 27 relevant scientific papers with only 6 providing a disaggregated monetary value for l&d-ES. Also amongst the 64 analyised PDNAs, only 12 report such disaggregated value; valuing just one ecosystem service per impacted ecosystem. The review finds that the majority of both the scientific literature and the PDNAs relies on extrapolating values from the literature. To enhance l&d-ES assessment and, with that, the opportunity for better understanding, recognition and uptake by e.g. the WIM, this paper makes three recommendations: 1. establishing a baseline of ecosystems recognized for their services of disaster risk reduction and/or climate change adaptation, while highlighting the need for an accessible and representative benefit transfer database; 2. enhancing collaboration between scientists and practitioners; and 3. quantitatively increasing data on l&d-ES.","[Janzen, Sally; van der Geest, Kees; Narvaez, Liliana; Sebesvari, Zita] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur, Bonn, Germany; [Emerton, Lucy] Environm Management Grp, Colombo, Sri Lanka",,"Janzen, S (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur, Bonn, Germany.",janzen@ehs.unu.edu,"van der Geest, Kees/GWM-4976-2022","van der Geest, Kees/0000-0002-5013-1004; Narvaez Marulanda, Blanca Liliana/0000-0002-8822-4126; Emerton, Lucy/0000-0003-1626-6324",,,,,68,2,2,2,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

With increase in use of road-salts, ponds become vulnerable to high levels of salt pollution and may impair their biological communities and ecosystem functions. However, understanding the impacts of these two threats combined are limited. In this study, we experimentally investigated the impacts of mad-salt pollution and the expected future increase in drought events on ponds' physical conditions, communities and ecosystem functions. In a two-way factorial design, 20 experimental mesocosms were used to test the individual and combined effects of climate change-driven drought events and salt pollution on natural pond ecosystems. Treatments were presence or absence of water salinization to mimic pollution by mad-salts, and drying to mimic drought events. Our drought treatment doubled water salinity during the experimental period. While salt additions significantly affected ponds' physical conditions and leaf litter decomposition, both salt additions and drying showed no independent impacts on pond biota and ecosystem functions. However, our path analysis revealed that drying indirectly reduced leaf litter decomposition and ecosystem productivity through changes in ponds' physical conditions, although it did not affect biomass of insects and periphyton. Overall, our findings suggest that anticipated drought events will amplify road-salt pollution, and subsequently affect ponds' biodiversity, food webs, and ecosystem functions. Implications for restoration, conservation and climate change adaptation may include actively managing snow-melting salts and long-term monitoring of changes in ponds' biophysical conditions and ecological functions.","[Siddig, Ahmed A.

In this systematic literature review of voluntary buyouts in the United States, we distill key learnings, identify remaining gaps, present avenues for future research, and make policy recommendations. We find that the buyout literature is nascent, but coalesces around the topics of buyout experience, buyout practice and implementation, housing policy, flood reduction, and justice and equity. Recommendations for future research include an increased emphasis on theory, the contexts in which buyouts occur, longitudinal studies, and more explicit recognition of researcher and disciplinary bias.","[Greer, Alex] Univ Albany, Coll Emergency Preparedness Homeland Secur & Cybe, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Brokopp Binder, Sherri] BrokoppBinder Res & Consulting, Allentown, PA USA; [Zavar, Elyse] Univ North Texas, Dept Emergency Management & Disaster Sci, Denton, TX 76203 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton,"Greer, A (corresponding author), Univ Albany, Coll Emergency Preparedness Homeland Secur & Cybe, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",agreer@albany.edu,"Greer, Alex/ABB-8560-2021","Greer, Alex/0000-0002-5910-1637",,,,,77,4,4,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1051-1482,2152-050X,,HOUS POLICY DEBATE,Hous.

But the formulation of strategies for adapting risk management practice to climate changes requires knowledge of the related risks for people and economic values. The main goals of this work were (1) the development of a method for analysing and comparing risks induced by different natural hazard types, (2) highlighting the most relevant natural hazard processes and related damages, (3) the development of an information system for the monitoring of the temporal development of natural hazard risk and (4) the visualisation of the resulting information for the wider public. A comparative exposure analysis provides the basis for pointing out the hot spots of natural hazard risks in the province of Carinthia, Austria. An analysis of flood risks in all municipalities provides the basis for setting the priorities in the planning of flood protection measures. The methods form the basis for a monitoring system that periodically observes the temporal development of natural hazard risks. This makes it possible firstly to identify situations in which natural hazard risks are rising and secondly to differentiate between the most relevant factors responsible for the increasing risks. The factors that most influence the natural risks could be made evident and eventual climate signals could be pointed out. Only with this information can the discussion about potential increases in natural risks due to climate change be separated from other influencing factors and be made at an objective level.","[Zischg, A.] Abenis AG, Chur, Switzerland; [Schober, S.; Sereinig, N.] Prov Govt Carinthia, Dept Water Resources Management, Klagenfurt, Austria; [Rauter, M.] Carinthia Univ Appl Sci, Sch Geoinformat, Klagenfurt, Austria; [Seymann, C.] Torrent & Avalanche Control Serv, Klagenfurt, Austria; [Goldschmidt, F.; Baek, R.] Prov Govt Carinthia, Dept Geol & Soil Protect, Klagenfurt, Austria; [Schleicher, E.] Prov Govt Carinthia, Dept Land Use Planning, Klagenfurt, Austria",,"Zischg, A (corresponding author), Abenis AG, Chur, Switzerland.",a.zischg@abenis.ch,"Zischg, Andreas Paul/G-3382-2014","Zischg, Andreas Paul/0000-0002-4749-7670",project AdaptAlp-Adaptation to Climate Change in the Alps; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF),project AdaptAlp-Adaptation to Climate Change in the Alps; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Commission),The work this article describes was partially financed by the project AdaptAlp-Adaptation to Climate Change in the Alps.

Previous scholarship suggests that a democratic decentralized approach, one that fosters inclusive participation and representation, is central to achieving equitable and sustainable outcomes of adaptation. However, recent studies frequently characterize the adaptation process as dominated by a techoscientific approach, among expert and elite actors, that tends to obscure or neglect the perceptions and desires of more marginalized members of society. This paper employs a values-based approach to better understand motivational factors for a closed and non-inclusive adaptation process. Through a case study of early, yet formidable stages of adaptation planning in the urban, coastal region of Hampton Roads, Virginia, empirical data among the epistemic community were gathered by interviews and participant observation at de facto adaptation planning forums. Research results document an exclusionary process favoring the participation and representation of technocratic elites and the exclusion of elected officials and local citizens. When linking these case study findings to value theory, inferences are made that adaptation planning in Hampton Roads is motivated by dominant institutional actor values of power and security, those that are theorized to be in opposition to values fostering social and environmental justice. In light of these research results, this paper calls for a critically reflexive adaptation practice, thereby challenging values, assumptions, and beliefs of the self, as well as social structures and power relations that shape adaptation planning.","[Haverkamp, Jamie A.

Wheat production is threatened by the climate variability and extremes climate events especially heat waves and drought. The present study focused to develop the wheat plant for self-irrigation through optimizing leaf architecture and surface properties for precise irrigation.MethodsThirty-four genotypes were selected from 1796 genotypes with all combinations of leaf angle and leaf rolling. These genotypes were characterized for morpho-physiological traits and soil moisture content at stem-elongation and booting stages. Further, a core set of ten genotypes was evaluated for stem flow efficiency and leaf wettability.ResultsBiplot, heat map, and correlation analysis indicated wide diversity and traits association. The environmental parameters indicated substantial amount of air moisture (> 60% relative humidity) at the critical wheat growth stages. Leaf angle showed negative association with leaf rolling, physiological and yield traits, adaxial and abaxial contact angle while leaf angle showed positive association with the stem flow water. The wettability and air moisture harvesting indicated that the genotypes (coded as 1, 7, and 18) having semi-erect to erect leaf angle, spiral rolling, and hydrophilic leaf surface (<90(o)) with contact angle hysteresis less than 10(o) had higher soil moisture content (6-8%) and moisture harvesting efficiency (3.5 ml).ConclusionsThese findings can provide the basis to develop self-irrigating, drought-tolerant wheat cultivars as an adaptation to climate change.","[Hakeem, Sadia; Ali, Zulfiqar; Saddique, Muhammad Abu Bakar; Merrium, Sabah] MNS Univ Agr, Inst Plant Breeding & Biotechnol, Multan, Pakistan; [Ali, Zulfiqar] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Plant Breeding & Genet, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Ali, Zulfiqar] Islamic Org Food Secur, Programs & Projects Dept, Mangilik Yel Ave 55-21 AIFC,Unit 4,C4 2, Astana, Kazakhstan; [Arslan, Muhammad; Habib-ur-Rahman, Muhammad] Univ Bonn, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat INRES, Crop Sci Grp, Bonn, Germany; [Habib-ur-Rahman, Muhammad] MNS Univ Agr, Dept Agron, Multan, Pakistan",,"Ali, Z (corresponding author), MNS Univ Agr, Inst Plant Breeding & Biotechnol, Multan, Pakistan.;Ali, Z (corresponding author), Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Plant Breeding & Genet, Faisalabad, Pakistan.;Ali, Z (corresponding author), Islamic Org Food Secur, Programs & Projects Dept, Mangilik Yel Ave 55-21 AIFC,Unit 4,C4 2, Astana, Kazakhstan.;Arslan, M; Habib-ur-Rahman, M (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat INRES, Crop Sci Grp, Bonn, Germany.;Habib-ur-Rahman, M (corresponding author), MNS Univ Agr, Dept Agron, Multan, Pakistan.",Zulfiqar_ali@uaf.edu.pk; m.arslan@uni-bonn.de; mhabibur@uni-bonn.de,,"Merrium, Sabah/0000-0002-6221-2143; Ali, Zulfiqar/0000-0003-1228-3338",,,,,35,0,0,1,1,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2229,,,BMC PLANT BIOL,BMC Plant Biol.,FEB 27,2023,23,1,,,,,,,115,10.1186/s12870-023-04123-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-023-04123-z,,,12,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,9J0NJ,36849909,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000939894800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, the lack of preparedness for flooding events in inland regions will compound the losses. However, the causes, impacts, and responses to these disasters in inland areas remain poorly understood. Here, using the recent 7 center dot 20 flood disaster in 2021 in the inland province of Henan, China, as an example, we examine the extreme flood, the impacts, and how the climate extremeness and inappropriate human responses caused the great damage. Results showed that the average cumulative precipitation in Zhengzhou was above 250 mm when the flood happened. 10.29 % of the total area and 7.55 % of the total population in Zhengzhou were flooded. Cropland, urban built-up, industrial, and residential areas were hit hardest in terms of land cover type and urban function zone. The Zhengzhou flood was a compound effect of multiple natural hazards reaching the region simultaneously and, on top of this, the region's extreme lack of preparation. Our paper not only took the human response into the current flood risk and flood control system but also put forward transformative measures to improve cities' adaptability to climate change in China and beyond.

While this is the case in many scenarios, there can be cases in which the converse is also true, resulting in more expert learners reporting higher intrinsic cognitive load than novices for the same problem. This can occur in relation to problems involving complex systems (e.g., ecological systems), for which novices' problem representations may underestimate problem complexity and therefore report lower intrinsic load than experts. This finding is borne out in the current paper. Samples, Methods & ResultsIn Study 1 with 118 participants from the Black Forest area in Germany, participants with higher levels of forestry and ecological expertise evaluated a problem relating to the restructuring of the Black Forest to adapt to climate change as more complex than did novices. In Study 2 (within-subjects design, n = 66 primary-school students), we conceptually replicated this finding in a domain more typical of cognitive load theory studies, mathematics. We found that higher prior knowledge also reduced the underestimation of the complexity of 'tricky', but frequently used, mathematics word problems. ConclusionOur findings suggest that cognitive load theory's assumptions about intrinsic load and prior knowledge should be refined, as there seems to exist a sub-set of problem-solving tasks for which the traditional relationship between prior knowledge and reported ICL is reversed.","[Endres, Tino; Lovell, Oliver; Renkl, Alexander] Albert Ludwig Univ Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; [Lovell, Oliver] Brighton Grammar Sch, Crowther Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Morkunas, David] Bentleigh West Primary Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Riess, Werner] Univ Educ Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; [Endres, Tino] Univ Freiburg, Dept Psychol Educ & Dev Psychol, Engelbergerstr 41, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg; Freiburg University of Education; University of Freiburg; University of Freiburg,"Endres, T (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Dept Psychol Educ & Dev Psychol, Engelbergerstr 41, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",tino.endres@psychologie.uni-freiburg.de,"Renkl, Alexander/K-6130-2012; Riess, Werner/K-9737-2018","Riess, Werner/0000-0002-3657-3359; Endres, Tino/0000-0003-3334-4064",,,,,27,0,0,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0007-0998,2044-8279,,BRIT J EDUC PSYCHOL,Br.

Zero discharge cattle effluent management to irrigate fodder crops is a mitigation option, so it is considered a key factor for adaptation to climate change. This paper presents the result of an on site pilot scale (three-stage, vertical flow filtration system using lapilli). This is a low-cost solution in terms of finance and energy, which does not require the addition of chemicals, to treat a cattle effluent. The effluent's quality obtained allowed it to be injected in a drip system with low risks of obstruction. And the pilot system allowed to obtain elimination values for the main parameters of effluent's quality (TSS and COD, 98% and 80% respectively) similar or greater than the ones obtained in other treatments of low cost and energy, and gives values contemplated in reclaimed water reuse guidelines of many countries. Furthermore, elimination rate for the BOD5 obtained 35 mgL(-1) in treated effluent. High removal rates were obtained for N, P, K, Cu, Fe and Mn, medium for Ca, Mg and Zn and low for B and Na. These shows that the pilot system and fodder crop combination provide an optimal solution to small farms, controlling sanitary risks. The tested flow allows the use of this system by conventional small farms, which represented 94% of total cow farms in Canary Islands.","[Mendoza-Grimon, V.; Hernandez-Moreno, J.

At the same time, livestock food chains are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. Agriculture and livestock in particular will need to play a greater role than they have hitherto in reducing emissions in the future. Adaptation and mitigation may require significant changes in production technology and farming systems, which could affect productivity. Given what is currently known about the likely impacts on livestock systems, however, the costs of mitigating and adapting to climate change in the aggregate may not represent an enormous constraint to the growth of the global livestock sector, in its bid to meet increasing demand for livestock products. Different livestock systems have different capacities to adapt or to take on board the policy and regulatory changes that may be required in the future. Vulnerability of households dependent on livestock, particularly in the drier areas of developing countries, is likely to increase substantially, with concomitant impacts on poverty and inequity. The capacity of these systems to adapt and to yield up their carbon sequestration potential deserves considerable further study. Comprehensive frameworks need to be developed to assess impacts and trade-offs, in order to identify and target adaptation and mitigation options that are appropriate for specific contexts, and that can contribute to environmental sustainability as well as to poverty alleviation and economic development.","[Thornton, Philip K.] ILRI, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Gerber, Pierre J.] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Livestock Informat Sector Anal & Policy Branch AG, I-00153 Rome, Italy",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Thornton, PK (corresponding author), ILRI, POB 30709, Nairobi 00100, Kenya.",p.thornton@cgiar.org,"Thornton, Philip/AAB-8806-2020","Thornton, Philip/0000-0002-1854-0182",,,,,53,66,67,3,48,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Several studies argue that this upward trend is due to rapid growth in the population and wealth exposed to disasters. Others argue that rising extreme weather events due to anthropogenic climate change are responsible for the increase. Hence, the causes of the increase in disaster impacts remain elusive. Disaster impacts relative to income are higher in low-income countries, but existing studies are mostly from developed countries or at the cross-country level. Here we assess the spatiotemporal trends of climatic disaster impacts and vulnerability and their attribution to climatic and socioeconomic factors at the subnational scale in a low-income country, using Nepal as a case study. Loss of life is the most extreme consequence of disasters. Therefore, we employed human mortality as a measure of disaster impacts, and mortality normalized by exposed population as a measure of human vulnerability. We found that climatic disaster frequency and mortality increased in Nepal from 1992 to 2021. However, vulnerability decreased, most likely due to economic growth and progress in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Disaster mortality is positively correlated with disaster frequency and negatively correlated with per capita income but is not correlated with the exposed population. Hence, population growth may not have caused the rise in disaster mortality in Nepal. The strong rise in disaster incidence, potentially due to climate change, has overcome the effect of decreasing vulnerability and caused the rise in disaster mortality.","[Chapagain, Dipesh; Borgemeister, Christian] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res, Genscherallee 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Bharati, Luna] Int Ctr Water Resources & Global Change, D-56002 Koblenz, Germany",University of Bonn,"Chapagain, D (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res, Genscherallee 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",dipesh@uni-bonn.de; bharati@bafg.de; cb@uni-bonn.de,,"Chapagain, Dipesh/0000-0002-2418-6343",doctoral scholarship program of the Heinrich Boll Foundation,doctoral scholarship program of the Heinrich Boll Foundation,We are thankful to Dr. Sanam K.

Pakistan is a developing country that is most vulnerable to extreme and harsh climatic conditions, especially in Southeast Asia. Climate change has often adverse effects on Pakistan because it is often affected by severe weather conditions. Although, some studies have reported on farmers' perceptiveness regarding climate change adaptation and mitigation, there is still insufficient awareness among Pakistanis' farmers. Key knowledge is very important for farmers to overcome the harsh climatic conditions for harvesting and saving crops. To bridge this gap, this research discovered the awareness level of climate change, weather conditions, and related factors among Pakistani farmers. Through a stratified random sampling technique, 500 structured questionnaires were distributed among the farmers in four districts of Punjab Pakistan for study analysis. The probit model was used to analyze the farmer's perception regarding climate change, socio-demographic and economic variables. The findings of this research showed that 75% of farmers are aware of climate change. Perception of climate change between farmers was directly associated with agriculture experience, farmers' age, land ownership status, level of education, information sources, and access to extension. Also, our research showed that farmers' assessment of adaptive behavior showed that farmers are actively implementing crop diversification, irrigation, and other adaptation strategies. Results of this study will help government agencies and policymakers in Pakistan and other regions to develop sustainable adaptation measures in the framework of climate change.","[Mehmood, Muhammad Sajid; Li, Gang] Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian 710127, Peoples R China; [Mehmood, Muhammad Sajid; Li, Gang] Northwest Univ, Shaanxi Key Lab Earth Surface Syst & Environm Car, Xian 710127, Peoples R China; [Khan, Ahsan Riaz] Bahauddin Zakariya Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Multan, Pakistan; [Siddiqui, Badar Naseem; Tareen, Waqar Ul Hassan] PMAS Arid Agr Univ, Dept Agr Extens, Rawalpindi 4600, Pakistan; [Kubra, Amara Tul] BZU Bahadur Sub Campus Layyah, Dept Sociol, Layyah 31200, Pakistan; [Ateeq-Ur-Rehman, Muhammad] PMAS Arid Agr Univ, Dept Sociol, Rawalpindi 4600, Pakistan",Northwest University Xi'an; Northwest University Xi'an; Bahauddin Zakariya University,"Li, G (corresponding author), Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian 710127, Peoples R China.;Li, G (corresponding author), Northwest Univ, Shaanxi Key Lab Earth Surface Syst & Environm Car, Xian 710127, Peoples R China.",liglzu@gmail.com,"Mehmood, Muhammad Sajid/ABH-9577-2022; Khan, Ahsan Riaz/AAV-1156-2021","Mehmood, Muhammad Sajid/0000-0002-2055-3505; Khan, Ahsan Riaz/0000-0001-9683-4728; , Amara Tul Kubra/0000-0001-9955-7340; Siddiqui, Badar Naseem/0000-0003-3785-2584; Li, Gang/0000-0003-0465-9892; Tareen, Waqar Ul Hassan/0000-0002-0782-6644",,,,,48,1,1,2,18,UNIV FEDERAL SANTA MARIA,SANTA MARIA,"CIDADE UNIV, BAIRRO CAMOBI, SANTA MARIA, RS 97105-900, BRAZIL",0103-8478,1678-4596,,CIENC RURAL,Cienc.

Isolating and quantifying their contributions to these hydrological alterations helps us to comprehensively understand the response mechanism and patterns of hydrological process to the two kinds of factors. Here we develop a general framework using hydrological model and 33 indicators to describe hydrological process and quantify the impact from climate and human. And we select the Upper Minjiang River (UMR) as a case to explore its feasibility. The results indicate that our approach successfully recognizes the characteristics of river flow regimes in different scenarios and quantitatively separates the climate and human contributions to multi-dimensional hydrological alterations. Among these indicators, 26 of 33 indicators decrease over the past half-century (1961-2012) in the UMR, with change rates ranging from 1.3% to 33.2%, and the human impacts are the dominant factor affecting hydrological processes, with an average relative contribution rate of 58.6%. Climate change causes an increase in most indicators, with an average relative contribution rate of 41.4%. Specifically, changes in precipitation and reservoir operation may play a considerable role in inducing these alterations.

Here, we analyze the projected changes in EASM circulation and precipitation under different warming levels from 1.5 to 5 degrees C above the preindustrial global mean temperature, using large-ensemble simulations conducted with Canadian Earth System Model version 2. We find that the model projects enhanced monsoon circulation and precipitation with global warming. The 850-hPa meridional winds, precipitation, and 500-hPa vertical ascending motion will be enhanced nonlinearly, while the total column precipitable water will increase quasi-linearly. The increase in precipitable water in the wet EASM region is only slightly greater than global average but the increase in precipitation is much greater than global one, with enhanced 500-hPa vertical ascending motion contrary to global mean. The increased low-level land-sea thermal contrast leads to the enhanced EASM meridional circulation and thus bring a large amount of moisture into Eastern China, providing favorable conditions for additional increase in precipitation. A simplified moisture budget analysis shows that the dynamic component related to strengthening monsoon circulation plays dominant role in the increase in EASM precipitation when the global temperature increases by more than approximately 2 degrees C, while the thermodynamic component caused by increased water vapor is important when the warming is smaller.","[Li, Zhibo; Li, Tim] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ KLME, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Key Lab Meteorol Disasters, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Sun, Ying; Ding, Yihui; Hu, Ting] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Lab Climate Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhibo; Sun, Ying; Li, Tim] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, CIC FEMD, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Tim] Univ Hawaii, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Li, Tim] Univ Hawaii, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; China Meteorological Administration; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii System,"Sun, Y (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Lab Climate Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Sun, Y (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, CIC FEMD, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",sunying@cma.gov.cn,"Li, Zhibo/AAK-4293-2020; Li (李), Zhibo (智博)/GQI-1420-2022","Li (李), Zhibo (智博)/0000-0001-9135-1583","National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFA0605604, 2018YFC1507702, 2017YFA0603802]; National Science Foundation of China [41675074]; Climate Change Project [CCSF201905]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Climate Change Project,"We thank four anonymous reviewers for their insightful and constructive comments.

J,"Scharf, B; Zluwa, I",,,,"Scharf, Bernhard; Zluwa, Irene",,,Case study investigation of the building physical properties of seven different green roof systems,ENERGY AND BUILDINGS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Building greenery; Green roofs; Building physics; Heat flux; U-value,HEAT-ISLAND; ENERGY; IMPACT,"Green roofs help to regulate the urban climate not only by evapotranspiration but also because of their insulating effects leading to reduced energy demand in summer and winter. Microclimate models as ENVI-met allow to calculate effects of green roofs and their contribution to climate change adaptation. Most models are based on generalized assumptions concerning evapotranspiration, albedo, heat flux and u-value of green roofs. Building physics software as ArchiPHYSIK lacks of available data concerning green roofs. This paper provides a detailed description of seven different green roof systems (differing in thicknesses, materials and construction layers) and their insulating performance over a period of 15 months. This shall allow researchers to choose more specific data for their work and improve the accuracy of green roof simulations and energy efficiency calculations. The results show clearly, that green roofs, as living dynamic systems respond differently on climatic framework conditions. The calculated u-values range from 0.944W/m(2) K - measured for a 12 cm thick one layer green roof - to 0.299 W/m(2) K of a 30 cm thick two layer green roof. The tested green roofs have been selected to be able to analyze the influence of different materials, construction types and thicknesses on insulation performance. Apart from construction thickness, water capacity of growing layer and drainage material, their pore volume and the application of drainage boards have been identified as relevant factors.

Presented in this study are analyses of precipitation data from 567 Environment Canada hydro-meteorological stations using the web-based IDF_CC tool, which applies a novel equidistance quantile-matching downscaling method to generate future IDF curve information. Results for the year 2100 based on The Second Generation Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2) and a multimodel ensemble median of 24 global climate models (GCMs) were generated. A natural neighbor spatial interpolation method was used to generate results for ungauged locations. One in 5-year, 2-h and one in 100-year, 24-h precipitation events were explored. Results based on CanESM2 indicated a reduction in extreme precipitation in central regions of Canada under specific analyses and increases in other regions. Relative to the multimodel ensemble median approach, the CanESM2 results suggested more spatial variability in change of IDFs, and the ensemble median generated generally lower values than CanESM2. By using the median value that lowers the importance of extreme outputs, the ensemble median approach obscured uncertainty associated with GCM outputs. While the IDF_CC tool helps fill an important gap related to accessing local climate change information, it is important to consider uncertainty in GCM outputs when making climate change adaptation decisions.

However, the distribution and fate of OC in coastal areas with multiple sedimentary environments, especially in underdeveloped coastal areas, have been underappreciated and lacked sufficient understanding.Materials and methods In this paper, the characteristics and fate of OC in four sedimentary environments (mangrove, sandy coast, bay, and estuary) in a coastal area in Guangdong, China, were compared. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and suspended sediment (SPS) concentrations in water phases as well as total organic carbon (TOC) content and grain size distribution in sediments were determined.Results and discussion The DOC concentrations and TOC contents were 0.006-13.66 mg L-1 and 0.04-9.51%, respectively, indicating a large spatial heterogeneity. The DOC levels showed an increasing trend into the bays and a decreasing trend along the estuaries, relating to hydrodynamic conditions for OC transport. The SPS concentrations were positively correlated with the TOC/DOC ratios in estuaries, confirming the carrier role of SPS in water-sediment systems. No significant differences in DOC concentrations were found under different water column depths, inferring that water-sediment ratios were not a limiting factor for DOC levels. The actual OC storage of the whole mangrove sedimentary environment was underestimated by 18.2% when calculated using the OC levels of the largest mangrove.Conclusion Our results suggest that the OC storage estimation in multiple sedimentary environments could be underestimated. This study provides new insight for management and protection of coastline eco-environments and the estimation of carbon stock in the hopes of adapting to climate change.","[Song, Xin; Dong, Jianwei; Yu, Yue; Geng, Le; Yuan, Zhenwei; Du, Yongfen] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hongbing] China Geol Survey, Haikou Marine Geol Survey Ctr, Haikou 570100, Peoples R China; [Xie, Hui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China","Nanjing Normal University; China Geological Survey; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology, CAS","Dong, JW; Du, YF (corresponding author), Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.",jwdong@njnu.edu.cn; yfdu@njnu.edu.cn,,,"Nanjing Normal University [164320H1847, DD20208013]; multiphasic material exchange and interactions of Chaoshan Coastal Zone [184080H202B297]; Comprehensive Geological Survey of Chaoshan Coastal Zone [CD-1652462858696]",Nanjing Normal University; multiphasic material exchange and interactions of Chaoshan Coastal Zone; Comprehensive Geological Survey of Chaoshan Coastal Zone,"We thank the Chaoshan Coastal Zone Project Team of Haikou Marine Geological Survey Center for their help in the field sampling.

To investigate this relationship at the country scale, this study uses a case study in Iran to 1) measure the cooperative relationship among climate change professionals using the network analysis approach and 2) analyze the potential of the network in promoting adaptation measures based on sustainable development. Social network analysis, which is both a quantitative and qualitative method of grounded theory, was used to analyze the data. Data collection was performed using two questionnaires, including network analysis and a survey, as well as a number of semistructured interviews with the climate change professionals. The data were collected from climate change professionals, including a sample of 55 individuals who were surveyed as a cross section of representative participants from a variety of sectors and organizations. The network relationship results have been analyzed using different tests at three levels (micro, macro, and the interactions between the two). The results have shown that the connectedness of the network is 23.7%, with 42.4% mutual links. The transitivity rate in the network is 51.39%, which determines the possibility of each professional communicating with a third party. According to the normalized degree index, 34.29% of the cases are in contact with other researchers in the network and 53.15% received a connection from others.

However, determining the possible effects of climate change is an absolute necessity for planning by decision-makers. The aim of the study was the evaluation of the CSM-CROPGRO-Sunflower model of DSSAT4.7 and the assessment of impact of climate change on sunflower yield under future climate projections. For this purpose, a 2-year sunflower field experiment was conducted under semi-arid conditions in the Konya province of Turkey. Rainfed and irrigated treatments were used for model analysis. For the assessment of impact of climate change, three global climate models and two representative concentration pathways, i.e. 4.5 and 8.5 were selected. The evaluation of the model showed that the model was able to simulate yield reasonably well, with normalized root mean square error of 1.3% for the irrigated treatment and 17.7% for the rainfed treatment, a d-index of 0.98 and a modelling efficiency of 0.93 for the overall model performance. For the climate change scenarios, the model predicted that yield will decrease in a range of 2.9-39.6% under rainfed conditions and will increase in a range of 7.4-38.5% under irrigated conditions. Results suggest that temperature increases due to climate change will cause a shortening of plant growth cycles. Projection results also confirmed that increasing temperatures due to climate change will cause an increase in sunflower water requirements in the future. Thus, the results reveal the necessity to apply adequate water management strategies for adaptation to climate change for sunflower production.","[Gurkan, Hudaverdi; Bayraktar, Nilgun; Yildirim, Y.

In this study in the Northern Limestone Alps in Austria we have chosen model calculations (LandscapeDNDC) in order to resolve the complex long-term interactions of management and climate change and their effect on nitrogen dynamics, and the consequences for nitrate leaching from forest soils into the karst groundwater. Our study highlights the dominant role of forest management in controlling nitrate leaching. Both clear-cut and shelterwood-cut disrupt the nitrogen cycle to an extent that causes peak concentrations and high fluxes into the seepage water. While this effect is well known, our modelling approach has revealed additional positive as well as negative impacts of the expected climatic changes on nitrate leaching. First, we show that peak nitrate concentrations during post-cutting periods were elevated under all climate scenarios. The maximal effects of climatic changes on nitrate concentration peaks were 20-24 mg L-1 in 2090 with shelterwood or clear-cut management. Second, climate change significantly decreased the cumulative nitrate losses over full forest rotation periods (by 10-20%). The stronger the expected temperature increase and precipitation decrease (in summer), the lesser were the observed nitrate losses. However, mean annual seepage water nitrate concentrations and cumulative nitrate leaching were higher under continuous forest cover management than with shelterwood-cut and clear-cut systems. Watershed management can thus be adapted to climate change by either reducing peak concentrations or long-term loads of nitrate in the karst groundwater. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper aims to identify the micro-level challenges of the agriculture sector and then shows how macro-level planning could be developed and may help the rural peasants of Bangladesh to better cope with the adverse conditions generated as a result of disaster impacts and/or climate change-induced threats. Design/methodology/approach The paper, based on a secondary literature review and primary data generated by the author, shows that agriculture happens as a system where many microelements and processes contribute and benefits from it do not only confine into the final product generation. Using both the primary and secondary data, the paper shows how simplistic approaches to assess disaster impacts on agriculture in Bangladesh are taking place and thus leaving scopes to read properly the more complex and cyclic forms of hazard impacts in the sector by using the systems thinking approach and complex systems methodology.

Although, tea is a major commercial crop in many countries in tropical and sub-tropical regions, including China, India and Sri Lanka, tea agroforestry systems (TAFS) have remained little studied for their role in carbon management and climate change adaptation/mitigation actions. We, therefore, undertook a detailed study on the storage of organic carbon in above- and below-ground vegetation and soil under age chronosequence of TAFS in North East India. The specific aim of this study was to quantify variations in soil physical and chemical properties, carbon storage in shade trees and tea bushes, and ecosystem carbon stocks under the chronosequence of TAFS. This study has established significant variations in soil properties and carbon storage in different aged TAFS. One of the salient findings is the decrease in soil bulk density and increase in water holding capacity with the age of TAFS in the 0-50 cm depth. The total vegetation C stock (shade trees + tea bushes + litter biomass) increased with increase in the age of TAFS, and the increase was as high as 25% in > 20 years compared to younger (< 10 years old) TAFS.

Recently, the increasing frequency of tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, i.e., Phylin and Hudhud in Andhra Pradesh coast, and the devastating impact of the 2004 tsunami in India increased the significance in assessing the vulnerability of the coastal lands to inundation and flooding, notably in the context of climate change-induced sea level rise. This study aims to estimate a coastal vulnerability index (CVI) for the coastal subregion of Krishna-Godavari delta and to use the calculated index to evaluate the vulnerability of 14 coastal talukas of the Krishna-Godavari delta region. This CVI is calculated by using four geological and three physical parameters characterizing the vulnerability of the study coastal region, including regional slope, coastal elevation, geomorphology, significant wave height, mean tidal range and relative sea level using different conventional and remotely sensed data. Using a composite coastal vulnerability index based on the relative risk rating of those parameters, each of the 14 coastal talukas was classified according to their vulnerability. The CVI results depict that coasts are least and most vulnerable to inundation, flooding and erosion of coastal lands where geological parameters are more efficient to CVI. The paper alerts to decision makers and planners to mitigate the natural disaster and manage the coastal zone and is a primary step toward prioritizing coastal lands for climate change adaptation strategies in the view of increased storminess and projected sea level rise.","[Pramanik, Malay Kumar] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Ctr Int Polit Org & Disarmament, New Delhi 110067, India; [Biswas, Sumantra Sarathi; Mondal, Biswajit; Pal, Raghunath] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Ctr Study Reg Dev, New Delhi 110067, India","Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi; Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi","Pramanik, MK (corresponding author), Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Ctr Int Polit Org & Disarmament, New Delhi 110067, India.",malaygeo@gmail.com,"MONDAL, BISWAJIT/X-8269-2018; Pramanik, Malay/AAU-1085-2021; Pal, Raghunath/AAX-2655-2021; Pal, Raghunath/AAW-6911-2021; Biswas, Sumantra Sarathi/AAZ-1763-2020","MONDAL, BISWAJIT/0000-0002-6624-8581; Pramanik, Malay/0000-0002-7085-1236; Pal, Raghunath/0000-0003-1926-6792; Biswas, Sumantra Sarathi/0000-0002-0069-1361",,,,,51,31,31,5,59,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

However, research indicates that there is a significant discrepancy in energy performance for heating and cooling between passive houses in different climate zones. Therefore, this research develops a comparative analysis on the energy saving potential of passive houses with the conventional around China. A sensitivity analysis of thermal characteristics of building envelope (insulation of exterior walls and windows, and airtightness) on energy consumption is further carried out to improve the climate adaptability of passive house. Moreover, the variation of energy consumption under different heat gain intensity is also compared, to evaluate the effects of envelope thermal characteristics comprehensively. Results suggest that the decrease of exterior wall insulation leads to the greatest increase in energy consumption, especially in severe cold zone in China. However, the optimal insulation may change with the internal heat gain intensity, for instance, the decrease of insulation (from 0.4 to 1.0 W/(m(2)center dot K)) could reduce the energy consumption by 4.65 kW center dot h/(m(2)center dot a) when the heat gain increases to 20 W/m(2) for buildings in Hot Summer and Cold Winter zone in China.","[Duan Meng-fan; Wu Yi-fan; Wu Xiao-ying; Lin Bo-rong] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Bldg Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Duan Meng-fan; Sun Hong-li; Wu Yi-fan; Wu Xiao-ying; Lin Bo-rong] Tsinghua Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Eco Planning & Green Bldg, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Sun Hong-li] Sichuan Univ, Coll Architecture & Environm, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; Sichuan University,"Lin, BR (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Bldg Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Lin, BR (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Eco Planning & Green Bldg, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",linbr@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China [51825802]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFE0106100],National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); National Key R&D Program of China,Project(51825802) supported by the National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China; Project (2018YFE0106100) supported by the National Key R&D Program of China,,42,0,0,8,8,JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIV,HUNAN,"EDITORIAL OFF, CHANGSHA, CHINA MAINLAND, HUNAN 410083, PEOPLES R CHINA",2095-2899,2227-5223,,J CENT SOUTH UNIV,J.

Understanding the barriers that can impede preservation is of paramount importance, as is developing solutions that facilitate the planning and management of vulnerable cultural resources. Using online survey research, we elicited the opinions of diverse experts across southeastern United States, a region with cultural resources that are particularly vulnerable to flooding and erosion from storms and sea level rise. We asked experts to identify the greatest challenges facing cultural heritage policy and practice from coastal climate change threats, and to identify strategies and information needs to overcome those challenges. Using content analysis, we identified institutional, technical and financial barriers and needs. Findings revealed that the most salient barriers included the lack of processes and preservation guidelines for planning and implementing climate adaptation actions, as well as inadequate funding and limited knowledge about the intersection of climate change and cultural heritage. Experts perceived that principal needs to overcome identified barriers included increased research on climate adaptation strategies and impacts to cultural heritage characteristics from adaptation, as well as collaboration among diverse multi-level actors.

Specific indicators of productivity, adaptation and mitigation are commonly used in support of claims about the climate smartness of practices. However, it is rare that these three objectives can be optimized simultaneously by any one strategy. In evaluating the relative climate smartness of different agricultural practices, plans and policies, there is a need for metrics that can simultaneously represent all three objectives and therefore be used in comparing strategies that have different benefits and trade-offs across this triad of objectives. In this context, a method for developing a Climate Smartness Index (CSI) is presented. The process of developing the index follows four steps: (1) defining system specific climate smartness; (2) selecting relevant indicators; (3) normalizing against reference values from a systematic literature review; and (4) aggregating and weighting. The CSI presented here has been developed for application in a systematic review of rice irrigation strategies and it combines normalized water productivity (WP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) The CSI was developed for application to data from published field experiments that assessed the impact of water management practices in irrigated rice, focusing on practices heralded as climate-smart strategies, such as Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD). The analysis shows that the CSI can provide a consistent judgment of the treatments based on the evidence of water efficiency and reduced GHGI reported in such studies. Using ameasurable and replicable index supports the aim of generating a reliable quantification of the climate smartness of agricultural practices. The same four step process can be used to build metrics for a broad range of CSA practice, policy and planning.","[Arenas-Calle, Laura N., I; Challinor, Andrew J.] Univ Leeds, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Whitfield, Stephen] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Arenas-Calle, LN (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",eelnac@leeds.ac.uk,"Challinor, Andrew J/C-4992-2008","Challinor, Andrew J/0000-0002-8551-6617",CGIAR Trust Fund,CGIAR Trust Fund(CGIAR),"This work was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from the CGIAR Trust Fund and through bilateral funding agreements.

Most existing models simulate streamflow by establishing a quantitative relationship among climate, human activities, and streamflow and assuming the relationship is stationary in the long term. However, in a changing environment, this relationship may vary over time, resulting in the poor performance of many existing streamflow simulation models. In this study, inspired by data stream mining, adapting the gradient-boosted regression tree (XGBoost) to work in an online setting, a new statistically based model, called an online gradient-boosted regression tree (online XGBoost), is proposed to simulate streamflow dynamically in a changing environment. Here, the data of streamflow, climatic variables, and human activities are regarded as a data stream and the change in their relationships is treated as concept drift. The proposed model has two attractive properties. First, it makes it possible to capture the changed relationship between streamflow and its impact factors with the concept of a drift detection algorithm. Second, it can be used to simulate streamflow dynamically by updating models based on the concept drift detection results. Taking the Qingliu River catchment as a case study, the results show that the proposed method achieved good performance on monthly streamflow simulations during 1989 and 2010 with a Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) of 0.73. Furthermore, it outperformed comparable methods, including four statistically based methods (online support vector regression, online regression tree, online random forest regression, and online boosting tree regression) and four lumped parameter hydrological models (SimHyd, Sacramento, soil moisture accounting and routing, and Tank). The proposed model provides a useful tool for streamflow simulation in a changing environment. Findings will help water resource managers adapt to climate change.","[Zhang, Heng; Yang, Qinli] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Resources & Environm, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Shao, Junming] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Guoqing] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute,"Yang, QL (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Resources & Environm, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",qinli.yang@uestc.edu.cn,"Wang, Guoqing/AAM-8111-2020","Wang, Guoqing/0000-0002-9121-9571","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0601501, 2016YFB0502303]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41601025, 61403062, 41830863]; State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering [2017490211]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2672018ZYGX2018J087]; Fok Ying Tong Education Foundation for Young Teachers in the Higher Education Institutions of China [161062]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Fok Ying Tong Education Foundation for Young Teachers in the Higher Education Institutions of China(Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation),"This work was sponsored by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant Nos. 2016YFA0601501 and 2016YFB0502303), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41601025, 61403062, 41830863), State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering (Grant No. 2017490211), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 2672018ZYGX2018J087), and Fok Ying Tong Education Foundation for Young Teachers in the Higher Education Institutions of China (Grant No. 161062).",,55,23,23,6,56,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1084-0699,1943-5584,,J HYDROL ENG,J.

In response to the European Commission's Communication on Green Infrastructure from 2013, the GREEN SURGE project aimed to further advance the development of UGI in European cities by (i) strengthening the conceptual foundations of UGI, (ii) developing improved methods and tools for assessment of its state, benefits and governance and, (iii) applying these to build a stronger evidence base. This paper aims to provide an overall synthesis of the project's main achievements. GREEN SURGE adopted an inter-and transdisciplinary approach. Urban Learning Labs and focal Learning Alliances in five cities were instrumental for intensive collaboration between disciplines and across science and practice. Pan-European surveys, e.g. of planning and governance practice or human-nature interactions established the state-of-the-art across the continent and identified good practices. The project consolidated green infrastructure planning and governance conceptually, and it mapped opportunities for better linking government-led planning with bottom-up initiatives for creating and managing UGI. It also introduced a framework for knowledge integration to support UGI valuation. Importantly, development and application of the concept of biocultural diversity gave new insights into human-nature relationships in multicultural urban societies. The results strongly call for more context-sensitive development of UGI that addresses the different needs and diverse cultural practices of people engaging with nature. In a nutshell, GREEN SURGE showed that UGI indeed can make a major contribution to sustainable and resilient urbanisation. Transdisciplinary research in urban labs, if well-conceived, has shown to hold great potential to advance UGI concepts, methods, knowledge and practice.","[Pauleit, Stephan; Hansen, Rieke; Rall, Emily] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci, Chair Strateg Landscape Planning & Management, Emil Ramann Str 6, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Ambrose-Oji, Bianca] Ctr Ecosyst Soc & Biosecur, Forest Res, Farnham GU10 4LH, Surrey, England; [Andersson, Erik] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 9A, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Anton, Barbara] European Secretarial, ICLEI Local Govt Sustainabil, Leopoldring, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany; [Buijs, Arjen; Elands, Birgit] Wageningen Univ & Res, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Haase, Dagmar] Humboldt Univ, Inst Geog, Rudower Chaussee 16, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Haase, Dagmar] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Permoser Str 15, D-04275 Leipzig, Germany; [Hansen, Rieke] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Landscape Architecture, Jakobstr 2, D-52056 Aachen, Germany; [Kowarik, Ingo] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Ecol Ecosyst Sci Plant Ecol, Rothenburgstr 12, D-12165 Berlin, Germany; [Kowarik, Ingo] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Kronenberg, Jakub] Univ Lodz, Dept Reg Econ & Environm, POW 3-5, PL-90255 Lodz, Poland; [Mattijssen, Thomas; Olafsson, Anton Stahl] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Mattijssen, Thomas] Wageningen Econ Res, Prinses Beatrixlaan 582, NL-2595 BM The Hague, Netherlands; [van der Jagt, Alexander P.

This study aimed to calculate and analyze the spatial and temporal changes in the IWD of four crops spring barley, oat, winter wheat, and potato between 1902 and 2010 in Germany by using the modeling software AgroHyd Farmmodel. Climatic conditions in Germany continued to change over the investigation period, with an increase in temperature of 0.01 K/yr and an increase in precipitation of 1 mm/yr. Nevertheless, no significant increasing or decreasing trend in IWD was noted in the analysis. The IWD for the investigated crops in the area of the current Federal Republic of Germany over the 109 years was 112 mm/yr, varying between 100 and 127 mm/yr. Changes in cropping pattern and cultivated area over the last century caused large differences in the IWD calculated for each administrative district. The mean annual IWD of over the study period (which was divided into 4 parts) varied between 13,455 Mm(3)/yr in the earliest period (1902-1919) and 4717 Mm(3)/yr in the latest period (1990-2010). Policy and management measures to adapt to climate change are currently being debated in Germany. The presented results suggest that the effects of the choice of crops (in this case, changes in cropping pattern in the German nation states) had a stronger influence on regional water resources than those of climate variability. Thus, the influence of climate change on water resources is relativized which brings an important input into the debate. (C) 2016 Elsevier BM.

Yet the integration of climate change con-siderations into local decision making tools designed to govern activities affecting the environment, such as Environ-mental Impact Assessments (EIAs), remains underdeveloped and inconsistently applied for proposed policies, programs, plans and projects. This study reviews progress across a range of 19 EIA regimes and identifies and assesses regulations and guidelines that have been established to promote the integration of climate change considerations within EIAs. A typology of levels of integration is developed to guide analysis across multiple EIA regimes. The findings identify a global and growing requirement for climate change aspects to be considered within EIAs and describe the range of ways this is done across the regimes selected. Climate change is typically concerned with the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from proposed developments in EIAs. Fewer regimes are concerned with climate change adap-tation, and in general, an integration deficit is identified for regimes where climate change is only partially considered. Examples of high integration indicate that EIA holds the potential to play a substantive role in climate change governance at project level decision making, suggesting the tools hold promise for local level climate governance. However, many do-mestic obstacles can militate against integration, including political, socio-technical, and economic imperatives, particu-larly for exemptions of sector and scope. Nevertheless, examples also indicate advances can be made through jurisprudence during the EIA review stage to establish new precedents of how climate should be considered in EIAs. Po-tential future research and practice directions are identified, and recommendations include the development of regulations and practice guidelines; inclusion of climate change adaptation; strengthening post-decision monitoring; application to all relevant sectors and activities; alignment with SEA; and integration across all stages of the EIA process.","[Mayembe, Rose; Simpson, Nicholas Philip; Norton, Marieke] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Upper Campus, Cape Town, South Africa; [Rumble, Olivia] Univ Cape Town, Inst Marine & Environm Law, Kramer Law Bldg,Middle Campus, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Simpson, NP (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Upper Campus, Cape Town, South Africa.",mymros001@myuct.ac.za; nick.simpson@uct.ac.za; olivia.rumble@uct.ac.za; marieke.norton@uct.ac.za,"Simpson, Nicholas/AAC-4578-2022","Simpson, Nicholas/0000-0002-9041-982X","UK Government's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada [109419-001]","UK Government's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada(CGIAR)","NPS was funded by the UK Government's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office and the International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada (Grant no. 109419-001) .",,54,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

Potential climate change-related increases in flood intensity are therefore of major societal concern as more than 40 million people live in flood-prone areas in downstream Bangladesh. Here we report on new flood projections using a hydrological model forced by bias-adjusted ensembles of the latest-generation global climate models of CMIP6 (SSP5-8.5/SSP1-2.6) in comparison to CMIP5 (RCP8.5/RCP2.6). Results suggest increases in peak flow magnitude of 36% (16%) on average under SSP5-8.5 (SSP1-2.6), compared to 60% (17%) under RCP8.5 (RCP2.6) by 2070-2099 relative to 1971-2000. Under RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5 (2070-2099), the largest increase in flood risk is projected for the Ganges watershed, where higher flood peaks become the 'new norm' as early as mid-2030 implying a relatively short time window for adaptation. In the Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers, the climate impact signal on peak flow emerges after 2070 (CMIP5 and CMIP6 projections). Flood peak synchronization, when annual peak flow occurs simultaneously at (at least) two rivers leading to large flooding events within Bangladesh, show a consistent increase under both projections. While the variability across the ensemble remains high, the increases in flood magnitude are robust in the study basins. Our findings emphasize the need of stringent climate mitigation policies to reduce the climate change impact on peak flows (as presented using SSP1-2.6/RCP2.6) and to subsequently minimize adverse socioeconomic impacts and adaptation costs. Considering Bangladesh's high overall vulnerability to climate change and its downstream location, synergies between climate change adaptation and mitigation and transboundary cooperation will need to be strengthened to improve overall climate resilience and achieve sustainable development.","[Gaedeke, Anne; Wortmann, Michel; Menz, Christoph; Krysanova, Valentina; Lange, Stefan; Hattermann, Fred Fokko] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Gaedeke, Anne; Wortmann, Michel; Menz, Christoph; Krysanova, Valentina; Lange, Stefan; Hattermann, Fred Fokko] Leibniz Assoc, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Wortmann, Michel] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Islam, A.

However, the resultant economic consequences and productivity loss are less understood. This review aims to summarize the retrospective and potential future economic burden of workplace heat exposure in the context of climate change. Methods: Literature was searched from database inception to October 2020 using Embase, PubMed, and Scopus. Articles were limited to original human studies investigating costs from occupational heat stress in English. Results: Twenty studies met criteria for inclusion. Eighteen studies estimated costs secondary to heat-induced labor productivity loss. Predicted global costs from lost worktime, in US$, were 280 billion in 1995, 311 billion in 2010 (approximate to 0.5% of GDP), 2.4-2.5 trillion in 2030 (>1% of GDP) and up to 4.0% of GDP by 2100. Three studies estimated heat-related healthcare expenses from occupational injuries with averaged annual costs (US$) exceeding 1 million in Spain, 1 million in Guangzhou, China and 250,000 in Adelaide, Australia. Low- and middle-income countries and countries with warmer climates had greater losses as a proportion of GDP. Greater costs per worker were observed in outdoor industries, medium-sized businesses, amongst males, and workers aged 25-44 years. Conclusions: The estimated global economic burden of occupational heat stress is substantial. Climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies should be implemented to likely minimize future costs. Further research exploring the relationship between occupational heat stress and related expenses from lost productivity, decreased work efficiency and healthcare, and costs stratified by demographic factors, is warranted. Key messages. The estimated retrospective and future economic burden from occupational heat stress is large. Responding to climate change is crucial to minimize this burden. Analyzing heat-attributable occupational costs may guide the development of workplace heat management policies and practices as part of global warming strategies.","[Borg, Matthew A.; Xiang, Jianjun; Anikeeva, Olga; Pisaniello, Dino; Hansen, Alana; Dear, Keith; Bi, Peng] Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, 57 North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Zander, Kerstin] Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Sim, Malcolm R.] Monash Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Preventat Med, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, Alfred Ctr, 553 St Kilda Rd, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Xiang, Jianjun] Fujian Med Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China",University of Adelaide; Charles Darwin University; Monash University; Fujian Medical University,"Bi, P (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, 57 North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.",matthew.borg@adelaide.edu.au; jianjun.xiang@adelaide.edu.au; olga.anikeeva@adelaide.edu.au; dino.pisaniello@adelaide.edu.au; alana.hansen@adelaide.edu.au; kerstin.zander@cdu.edu.au; keith.dear@adelaide.edu.au; malcolm.sim@monash.edu; peng.bi@adelaide.edu.au,"Borg, Matthew Anthony/T-5544-2019; Anikeeva, Olga/X-6271-2019","Borg, Matthew Anthony/0000-0003-4741-553X; Anikeeva, Olga/0000-0001-7558-3149; Dear, Keith/0000-0002-0788-7404; Bi, Peng/0000-0002-3238-3427",Australian Research Council (ARC) [DP190102869]; University of Adelaide Faculty of Health Sciences Divisional Scholarship,Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council); University of Adelaide Faculty of Health Sciences Divisional Scholarship,"This work was supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC Discovery Project Grant -DP190102869).

It therefore offers too small a sample of extreme low-flow events to properly explore the long-term evolution of their characteristics and associated impacts. To overcome this limit, this work first presents a daily 140-year ensemble reconstructed streamflow dataset for a reference network of near-natural catchments in France. This dataset, called SCOPE Hydro (Spatially COherent Probabilistic Extended Hydrological dataset), is based on (1) a probabilistic precipitation, temperature, and reference evapo-transpiration downscaling of the Twentieth Century Reanalysis over France, called SCOPE Climate, and (2) continuous hydrological modelling using SCOPE Climate as forcings over the whole period. This work then introduces tools for defining spatio-temporal extreme low-flow events. Extreme low-flow events are first locally defined through the sequent peak algorithm using a novel combination of a fixed threshold and a daily variable threshold. A dedicated spatial matching procedure is then established to identify spatio-temporal events across France. This procedure is furthermore adapted to the SCOPE Hydro 25-member ensemble to characterize in a probabilistic way unrecorded historical events at the national scale. Extreme low-flow events are described and compared in a spatially and temporally homogeneous way over 140 years on a large set of catchments. Results highlight well-known recent events like 1976 or 19891990, but also older and relatively forgotten ones like the 1878 and 1893 events. These results contribute to improving our knowledge of historical events and provide a selection of benchmark events for climate change adaptation purposes. Moreover, this study allows for further detailed analyses of the effect of climate variability and anthropogenic climate change on low-flow hydrology at the scale of France.","[Caillouet, Laurie; Vidal, Jean-Philippe; Sauquet, Eric; Devers, Alexandre] Irstea, UR HHLY, Hydrol & Hydraul Res Unit, 5 Rue Doua,BP32108, F-69616 Villeurbanne, France; [Graff, Benjamin] CNR, 2 Rue Andre Bonin, F-69004 Lyon, France",INRAE,"Caillouet, L (corresponding author), Irstea, UR HHLY, Hydrol & Hydraul Res Unit, 5 Rue Doua,BP32108, F-69616 Villeurbanne, France.",laurie.caillouet@gmail.com,"Vidal, Jean-Philippe/E-6187-2010; Devers, Alexandre/S-9216-2017","Vidal, Jean-Philippe/0000-0002-3748-6150; Sauquet, Eric/0000-0001-9539-7730; Devers, Alexandre/0000-0001-6708-0066",Irstea; CNR,Irstea; CNR(Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR)),"The authors would like to thank Meteo-France for providing access to the Safran database.

Therefore, a set of expert survey has been done to identify current and project future climate limitations to crop production and explore appropriate adaptation measures in NFR. Droughts have been the largest limitation for maize (Zea mays L.) in NSL and SSL, and for soybean (Glycine max L Merr.) in SSL. Chilling damage has been the largest limitation for rice (Oryza sativa L) production in XA, SJ and CB. Projected climate change is expected to be beneficial for expanding the crop growing season, and to provide more suitable conditions for sowing and harvest. Autumn frost will occur later in most parts of NFR, and chilling damage will also decrease, particularly for rice production in XA and SJ. Drought and heat stress are expected to become more severe for maize and soybean production in most parts of NFR. Also, plant diseases, pests and weeds are considered to become more severe for crop production under climate change. Adaptation measures that have already been implemented in recent decades to cope with current climatic limitations include changes in timing of cultivation, variety choice, soil tillage practices, crop protection, irrigation and use of plastic film for soil cover. With the projected climate change and increasing risk of climatic extremes, additional adaptation measures will become relevant for sustaining and improving productivity of crops in NFR to ensure food security in China.

To understand the implications of climate change on cotton production in India, cotton production to the different scenarios (A2, B2 and A1B) of future climate was simulated using the simulation model Infocrop-cotton. The GCM projections showed a nearly 3.95, 3.20 and 1.85 A degrees C rise in mean temperature of cotton growing regions of India for the A2, B2 and A1B scenarios, respectively. Simulation results using the Infocrop-cotton model indicated that seed cotton yield declined by 477 kg ha(-1) for the A2 scenario and by 268 kg ha(-1) for the B2 scenario; while it was non-significant for the A1B scenario. However, it became non-significant under elevated [CO2] levels across all the scenarios. The yield decline was higher in the northern zone over the southern zone. The impact of climate change on rainfed cotton which covers more than 60 % of the country's total cotton production area (mostly in the central zone) and is dependent on the monsoons is likely to be minimum, possibly on account of marginal increase in rainfall levels. Results of this assessment suggest that productivity in northern India may marginally decline; while in central and southern India, productivity may either remain the same or increase. At the national level, therefore, cotton production is unlikely to change with climate change. Adaptive measures such as changes in planting time and more responsive cultivars may further boost cotton production in India.","[Hebbar, K. B.; Venugopalan, M. V.; Prakash, A.

Future climate (temperature and precipitation) from four general circulation models (GCMs) that are found to perform well in the Mekong region and a regional circulation model (PRECIS) are downscaled using a delta change approach. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to assess future changes in sediment flux attributable to climate change. Results indicate up to 3.0 degrees C shift in seasonal temperature and 27% (decrease) to 41% (increase) in seasonal precipitation. The largest increase in temperature is observed in the dry season while the largest change in precipitation is observed in the wet season. In general, temperature shows increasing trends but changes in precipitation are not unidirectional and vary depending on the greenhouse gas emission scenarios (GHGES), climate models, prediction period and season. The simulation results show that the changes in annual stream discharges are likely to range from a 17% decrease to 66% increase in the future, which will lead to predicted changes in annual sediment yield ranging from a 27% decrease to about 160% increase. Changes in intra-annual (monthly) discharge as well as sediment yield are even greater (-62 to 105% in discharge and -88 to 243% in sediment yield). A higher discharge and sediment flux are expected during the wet seasons, although the highest relative changes are observed during the dry months. The results indicate high uncertainties in the direction and magnitude of changes of discharge as well as sediment yields due to climate change. As the projected climate change impact on sediment varies remarkably between the different climate models, the uncertainty should be taken into account in both sediment management and climate change adaptation.","[Shrestha, B.; Babel, M.

From a Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) and LVI-IPCC index, the results established that the average farmer was moderately vulnerable, with farmers in the north showing significantly higher vulnerability than those in the south of Ghana. Exposure to climate change was found to contribute more to the vulnerability of the farm households. The beta regression analysis shows that row planting and use of early maturing varieties had positive significant effects on vulnerability, while refilling, strip cropping, mulching, and land rotation had negative significant effects on vulnerability. From a 2SLS, there is a positive feedback between livelihood vulnerability and climate adaptation intensity. Considering the low adoption, and the importance of strip cropping, mulching, and land rotation in reducing the vulnerability farm households, there is the need for actors in the agriculture sector to establish demonstration farms to train farmers on how to adopt as well as the benefits of these technologies.

The adoption of centralized water, energy, and cost-intensive technology has proven ineffective in addressing the complex water-related challenges that have arisen as a consequence of growing urbanization in developing nations. Constructed wetlands have emerged as an effective wastewater treatment solution with natural applications. The fundamental goal of this study is to offer a complete overview of the wide variety of practices, uses, and investigations of constructed wetlands systems for eliminating different pollutants from wastewater in developing countries leading to placing them in the context of climate change, environmental resource planning, and sustainable wastewater treatment systems. CWs offer significant levels of treatment performances with hybrid systems achieving contaminant removal efficiencies up to 93.82% for total suspended solids, 85.65% for chemical oxygen demand, and 80.11% for ammonia nitrogen which is adequate with respect to other viable alternatives. In terms of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD5), the highest elimination (84.06%) was achieved in hybrid systems when compared to Free water surface CWs (65.34%), Horizontal sub-surface CWs (75.1%), and Floating treatment wetland (55.29%). The maximum power density generation through the microbial fuel cell-based constructed wetlands ranges between 50 and 86 mW/m(2) in Bangladesh (integrated tidal flow) and 852 mW/m(3) in China (vertical flow), and the production of bioenergy has been evidenced up to 1,836.5 GJ/hector/year. Annually, wastewater treatment plant systems (WTPs) generate around a hundred times more Methane (CH4), Nitrous oxide (N2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2) than CWs. In metropolitan cities, WTPs may lead to a considerable increase in upstream land use, which could be minimized by promoting CWs in these areas. The potential utility of different CWs in protecting and preserving estuarine quality within the present regulatory framework is finally addressed in the study, emphasizing that it can balance the impacts of industrial expansions in developing countries for subsequent mitigation and adaptation to climate change.","[Islam, Md.

They are the primary policy instrument for protecting people's health in the face of rising global temperatures. However, evidence on engagement with health in the NDCs is scarce. In this study, we aimed to examine how public health is incorporated in the NDCs, and how different patterns of engagement might be related to broader inequalities and tensions in global climate politics. Methods We analysed the NDCs in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change registry submitted by 185 countries. Using content analysis and natural language processing (NLP) methods, we developed measures of health engagement. Multivariate regression analyses examined whether country-level factors (eg, population size, gross domestic product [GDP], and climate-related exposures) were associated with greater health engagement. Using NLP methods, we compared health engagement with other climate-related challenges (ie, economy, energy, and agriculture) and examined broader differences in the keyword terms used in countries with high and low health engagement in their NDCs. Findings Countries that did not mention health in their NDCs were clustered in high-income countries, whereas greater health engagement was concentrated in low-income and middle-income countries. Having a low GDP per capita and being a small island developing state were associated with higher levels of health engagement. In addition, higher levels of population exposure to temperature change and ambient air pollution were associated with more health coverage included in a country's NDC. Variation in health engagement was greater than for other climate-related issues and reflected wider differences in countries' approaches to the NDCs. Interpretation A focus on health in the NDCs follows broader patterns of global inequalities. Poorer and climate-vulnerable countries that contribute least to climate change are more likely to engage with health in their NDCs, while richer countries focus on non-health sectors in their NDCs, such as energy and the economy.

To adapt to climate change and ensure food security with a fixed area of arable land, utilizing a multiple cropping frequency each year is regarded as an efficient method of offsetting the projected negative yield impacts on staple crops. Given that climate warming prolongs the potential growing season and benefits the expansion of multi-cropping systems, this research investigated whether changes in precipitation will keep pace with temperature in the marginal double-cropping area of northern China under two scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Our results indicated that northern China will experience consistent warming, which will cause the limits of the double-cropping system to move remarkably towards the northeast and northwest in this century. However, the increased precipitation may not be sufficient to alleviate the water deficiency in the double-crop rotation and support the realisation of double-cropping benefits due to increasing heat resources. Although the potential yield will be considerable in the marginal double-cropping area after future expansion, the instability of rain-fed yields will gradually increase with the decrease in precipitation in the marginal region unless supplemental irrigation is applied. The insufficient precipitation was projected to negatively affect the potential yield in this area by 56-67 %. Moreover, the coefficient of variation of yield was great due to the large spatial distribution difference in the cumulated precipitation. After adopting limited irrigation in key wheat growth periods, this negative effect was predicted to be alleviated by approximately 10-12 %. In the entire marginal region, the northeast faces the lowest risk of precipitation deficiency during double-cropping system expansion. It was concluded that the double-cropping system is an efficient adaptation strategy worth encouraging in the context of climate change; however, this approach should be considered only after considering the local cumulative precipitation and the condition of the water supply.","[Gao, Jiqing; Yang, Xiaoguang; Liu, Zhijuan; Zhao, Jin; Sun, Shuang] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, 2 Yuanmingyuan West Rd, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Bangyou] CSIRO Agr & Food, Queensland Biosci Precinct, 306 Carmody Rd, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia",China Agricultural University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Yang, XG (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, 2 Yuanmingyuan West Rd, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",gaojiqingcau@163.com; yangxg@cau.edu.cn; Bangyou.Zheng@csiro.au; zhijuanliu@cau.edu.cn; jinzhao@cau.edu.cn; sunshuang@cma.gov.cn,"yang, xiao/HJI-7815-2023; Liu, Zhijuan/AEA-8412-2022","Liu, Zhijuan/0000-0001-7082-6439",Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2016YFD0300101-03],"Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Grant No. 2016YFD0300101-03).,,49,3,4,1,29,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1161-0301,1873-7331,,EUR J AGRON,Eur.

However, impact studies are often conducted at a spatial scale that is too coarse to capture the specificity of individual catchments, and, importantly, the changes they focus on are not necessarily the changes most critical to stakeholders. While recent studies have combined hydrological and electricity market modeling, they tend to aggregate all climate impacts by focusing solely on reservoir profitability. Here, we collaborated with Groupe E, a hydroelectricity company operating several reservoirs in the Swiss pre-Alps, and we co-produced hydroclimatic projections tailored to support the upcoming negotiations of their water concession renewal. We started by identifying the vulnerabilities of their activities to climate change; together, we then selected streamflow and electricity demand indices to characterize the associated risks and opportunities. We provided Groupe E with figures showing the projected impacts, which were refined over several meetings. The selected indices enabled us to assess a variety of impacts induced by changes in (i) the seasonal water volume distribution, (ii) low flows, (iii) high flows, and (iv) electricity demand. This enabled us to identify key opportunities (e.g., the future increase in reservoir inflow in winter, when electricity prices have historically been high) and risks (e.g., the expected increase in consecutive days of low flows in summer and fall which is likely to make it more difficult to meet residual flow requirements). We highlight that the hydrological opportunities and risks associated with reservoir management in a changing climate depend on a range of factors beyond those covered by traditional impact studies. This stakeholder-centered approach, which relies on identifying stakeholder's needs and using them to inform the production and visualization of impact projections, is transferable to other climate impact studies, in the field of water resources and beyond.","[Hakala, Kirsti; Seibert, Jan] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Addor, Nans] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Climat Res Unit, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Gobbe, Thibault; Ruffieux, Johann] Grp E SA, Energy Board, CH-1763 Granges Paccot, Switzerland; [Seibert, Jan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Sci & Assessment, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Hakala, Kirsti] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Addor, Nans] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",University of Zurich; University of East Anglia; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Melbourne; University of Exeter,"Hakala, K (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.;Hakala, K (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",kirsti.hakala@unimelb.edu.au,"Seibert, Jan/B-1432-2009; Hakala, Kirsti/M-7884-2018","Seibert, Jan/0000-0002-6314-2124; Hakala, Kirsti/0000-0002-4914-8845; Addor, Nans/0000-0002-6057-3930",,,,,54,4,5,1,9,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

However, even bigger challenges lie ahead because of the growing societal demands. For example, the global population of 7.2 billion in 2013 is projected to reach 9.2 billion by 2050 and stabilize at 10 billion by 2100. The growing and increasingly affluent population, with preference towards more and more meat-based diet, is likely to jeopardize the finite, fragile, and dwindling soil and water resources which are already under great stress in densely populated countries in Asia and elsewhere. Economic growth and increase in gross domestic product also lead to generation of waste or by-products, along with contamination and eutrophication of water resources. International trade in food/feed products also involves transfer of virtual water, which is a serious issue when water-scarce countries export virtual water to water-endowed countries. The problem is confounded by the present and future climate change driven by the growing energy demands of the carbon civilization. Thus, adaptation to climate change represents both a threat and an opportunity for sustainable development. Adaptive strategies must be sustainable socially and environmentally and advance the Millennium Development Goals, while buffering agroecosystems against extreme climate events (e.g., pedologic, agronomic, and ecologic drought). Thus, recognizing and addressing the water-soil-waste nexus is important to achieving climate-strategic agriculture. Sustainable intensification of agroecosystems, producing more per unit consumption of essential resources, must consider judicious management of hydrological and biogeochemical cycles (C, N, P, S). The soil C pool must be managed and enhanced to offset anthropogenic emissions, and mitigate/adapt to the climate change. The pace of adoption of recommended land use and soil-/plant-/animal-management practices can be kept at par with advances in scientific knowledge through continuous dialogue between scientists on the one hand and policy makers / land managers on the other to translate research data into policy and action plans.","Ohio State Univ, Carbon Management & Sequestrat Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Lal, R (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Carbon Management & Sequestrat Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",lal.1@osu.edu,"Lal, Rattan/D-2505-2013",,,,,,53,37,39,0,122,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1436-8730,1522-2624,,J PLANT NUTR SOIL SC,J.

It is generally expected that elevated [CO2] will increase crop production. However, other environmental factors such as temperature along with management practices could further modify a crop's response to CO2. The goal of this study was to determine the interactive effects of elevated [CO2] and above-optimum temperature on growth, development and yield of two peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) cultivars, e.g., Pronto and Georgia Green. One of the objectives was to determine if there was any variation in response between these two cultivars with respect to possible adaptation to climate change. Peanut plants were grown in controlled environment chambers in the University of Georgia Envirotron under conditions of non-limiting water and nutrient supply. Plants were exposed to day/night air temperatures of 33/21A degrees C (T (A)), 35.5/23.5A degrees C (T (A) + 2.5A degrees C), and 38/26A degrees C (T (A) + 5A degrees C) along with CO2 treatments of 400 and 700 mu mol CO2 mol (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) air. The selected range of temperatures was based on the temperatures that are common for southwest Georgia during the summer months. The results showed that LAI of both cultivars responded positively, e.g., 28.3% for Pronto and 49.3% for Georgia Green to elevated [CO2]. Overall, elevated [CO2] alone resulted in a significant increase in total biomass at final harvest across all temperatures (P < 0.0001), but decreased final seed yield (P < 0.0005), except for Georgia Green at (T (A) + 5A degrees C). The higher temperatures compared to T (A) reduced the relative response of total biomass to CO2 for both cultivars. It can be concluded that final seed yield response to CO2 depends on the sensitivity of individual cultivars to temperature, especially during the reproductive development stage.","[Bannayan, M.] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Agr, Mashhad, Iran; [Bannayan, M.; Tojo Soler, C.

The aim of this study was to examine various perceptions and individual characteristics associated with wood heating through a survey about CC adaptations. Methods: A telephone survey (n = 2,545) of adults living in the southern part of the province of Quebec (Canada) was conducted in the early fall season of 2005. The questionnaire used closed questions and measured the respondents' beliefs and current adaptations about CC. Calibration weighting was used to adjust the data analysis for the respondent's age and language under stratified sampling based on health regions. Results: More than three out of four respondents had access to a single source of energy at home, which was mainly electricity; 22.2% combined two sources or more; 18.5% heated with wood occasionally or daily during the winter. The prevalence of wood heating was higher in the peripheral regions than in the more urban regions, where there was a higher proportion of respondents living in apartments. The prevalence was also higher with participants completely disagreeing (38.5%) with the eventual prohibition of wood heating when there is smog in winter, compared to respondents somewhat disagreeing (24.2%) or agreeing (somewhat: 17.5%; completely: 10.4%) with the adoption of this strategy. It appears that the perception of living in a region susceptible to winter smog, smog warnings in the media, or the belief in the human contribution to CC, did not influence significantly wood heating practices. Conclusion: Increased residential wood heating could very well become a maladaptation to climate change, given its known consequences on winter smog and respiratory health. It would thus be appropriate to implement a long-term national program on improved and controlled residential wood heating. This would constitute a  no-regrets adaptation to climate change, while reducing air pollution and its associated health impacts.","[Belanger, Diane] Ctr Rech CHUQ, Quebec City, PQ GIV 5B3, Canada; [Belanger, Diane] Inst Natl Sante Publ Quebec, Quebec City, PQ GIV 5B3, Canada; [Valois, Pierre] Univ Laval, Fac Sci Educ, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Abdous, Belkacem] Ctr Rech CHUQ, Quebec City, PQ GIV 2M2, Canada",Laval University; Institut national de sante publique du Quebec (INSPQ); Laval University; Laval University,"Gosselin, P (corresponding author), Ouranos & Univ Laval, Inst Natl Sante Publ Quebec, 945 Ave Wolfe, Quebec City, PQ G1V 5B3, Canada.",diane.belanger@crchul.ulaval.ca; pierre-l.gosselin@crchul.ulaval.ca; pierre.valois@fse.ulaval.ca; belkacem.abdous@crchul.ulaval.ca,,,,,,,40,8,8,0,2,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2458,,,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,BMC Public Health,MAY 28,2008,8,,,,,,,,184,10.1186/1471-2458-8-184,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-8-184,,,13,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",319LF,18507833,"Green Accepted, Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000257164400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite their importance, trends and temperature variability associated with other climate variables over the Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar are not fully understood. This study investigates the annual and seasonal variations in air temperature and RH, as well as dew point temperature and their relationships, based on 47 meteorological stations located around Myanmar from 2001 to 2019. The results indicate that an increasing trend in air temperature was observed in the central, western, deltaic and southern regions of Myanmar. In contrast, air temperatures trended downward in the eastern (southern Shan state), northern (Hkakabo Razi Mountain) and western (Chin state) parts of the country. RH exhibited a significant increase in the northern region and a decrease in the central dry zone. A lower RH always accompanied high temperatures. Dew points increased in the deltaic and southern parts of Myanmar, as opposed to in the eastern (south Shan state) and western (Chin state) parts of the country. Moreover, in comparison to the daily RH variability, the observed daily temperature variability had a relatively stronger influence on Myanmar's climate, whereas dew points typically remained stationary for a day. The associated linkage between the RH and the dew point temperature was significantly linear, with a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.65. The annual (seasonal) correlation of air temperature and dew point was highly correlated in the winter, where R-2 was measured at 0.71 (0.75). During the rainy season, however, the annual (seasonal) R-2 was measured at only 0.30 (0.04). However, the air temperature and RH showed a weak positive correlation of 0.20 (0.26) in summer (winter) and a weak positive correlation in the rainy season (0.01). This study's findings are important for enhancing seasonal forecasts of extreme heat and can aid policy-makers in formulating better climate change adaptation plans.","[Sein, Zin Mie Mie] Wuxi Univ, Coll Int Students, Wuxi 214105, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ullah, Irfan; Iyakaremye, Vedaste; Zhi, Xiefei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Azam, Kamran] Univ Haripur, Dept Management Sci, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 22780, Pakistan; [Ma, Xieyao] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Syed, Sidra] Univ Peshawar, Inst Peace & Conflicts Studies, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan; [Zhi, Xiefei] Weather Online Inst Meteorol Applicat, Wuxi 214000, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Wuxi University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of Peshawar,"Ullah, I; Zhi, XF (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.;Zhi, XF (corresponding author), Weather Online Inst Meteorol Applicat, Wuxi 214000, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",irfan.marwat@nuist.edu.cn; zhi@nuist.edu.cn,"Azam, Kamran/D-7431-2019; Azam, Kamran/AAB-6077-2020; Iyakaremye, Vedaste/AGK-7642-2022; Ullah, Irfan/AEN-0985-2022; Zhi, Xiefei/AGU-6880-2022","Azam, Kamran/0000-0002-5188-8914; Azam, Kamran/0000-0002-5188-8914; Zhi, Xiefei/0000-0003-4414-0497",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41877158]; National (Key) Basic R&D Program of China [2012CB955204],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National (Key) Basic R&D Program of China,"The National Natural Science Foundation of China with Grant No: 41877158 financially supported this work.

The aim of the study is to provide an overview of the accident, highlighting the causes and the consequences of this compound disaster. Furthermore, the study analyses the emergency response and clean-up activities in order to identify lessons learned, and propose recommendations for future flood triggered oil spills. The work presented is based on the integration of information available in newspaper articles, government documents and reports, and data and interviews collected during two field trips in the affected area. The permanence of oil and the strong oil odour in adjacent crops as well as on irrigation canals and citizens' houses was revealed during the first field trip, about one month after the accident. The analysis of the documentation on metal working oil revealed that it might have long-lasting impact in terms of environmental pollution. The presence of oil impacted also the implemented emergency response actions, since vertical evacuation, practiced by many residents during the disaster, actually put many of them in more danger as they ended up trapped in oil-covered floodwaters with strong vapours that were reported to cause nausea and skin irritation. Remarkably, it was also found that a previous oil spill had already occurred at the same site following a severe flooding event, highlighting the need to improve preparedness and develop more effective strategies for accident prevention. Disaster preparedness that specifically considers both the natural hazard and the potential for related technological scenarios should be enhanced, in particular regarding chemical accidents triggered by floods. Japan, as well as other parts of the World, is experiencing stronger rainfall events due to a changing climate leading to unprecedented flooding. Therefore, industry, government and citizens should consider the possibility of an increase of weather-related compound disasters in planning and implementation of climate change adaptation strategies.","[Misuri, Alessio; Cozzani, Valerio] Univ Bologna, Dept Civil Chem Environm & Mat Engn, Bologna, Italy; [Misuri, Alessio; Cruz, Ana Maria; Park, Hyejeong] Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Kyoto, Japan; [Garnier, Emmanuel] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, Chronoenvironm Lab, Besancon, France; [Ohtsu, Nobuhito] Govt Japan, Natl Res Inst Fire & Disaster, Fire & Disaster Management Agcy, Tokyo, Japan; [Hokugo, Akihiko] Kobe Univ, Res Ctr Urban Safety & Secur, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Fujita, Isamu] Natl Res & Dev Agcy, Port & Airport Res Inst, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Aoki, Shin-ichi] Osaka Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Suita, Osaka, Japan",University of Bologna; Kyoto University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Franche-Comte; Kobe University; Port & Airport Research Institute; Osaka University,"Cruz, AM (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Kyoto, Japan.",cruznaranjo.anamaria.2u@kyoto-u.ac.jp,,"Misuri, Alessio/0000-0002-0441-9947","Natural Disaster Research Council, Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [Kaken Grant] [17K01336]; MIUR -Italian Ministry for Scientific Research under the PRIN 2017 program [2017CEYPS8]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17K01336] Funding Source: KAKEN","Natural Disaster Research Council, Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [Kaken Grant]; MIUR -Italian Ministry for Scientific Research under the PRIN 2017 program(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors wish to inform that the present work has been partly funded by the Natural Disaster Research Council, Japan; the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [Kaken Grant 17K01336, April 2017-March 2021]; and the MIUR -Italian Ministry for Scientific Research under the PRIN 2017 program [Grant 2017CEYPS8].",,89,6,6,9,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

Four indices namely, Annual maximum of maximum temperature (TXx), Extreme heat wave days frequency (HWFI), Annual maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation (RX5day), and Consecutive Dry Days (CDD) were investigated under four socioeconomic scenarios (SSP1-2.6; SSP2-4.5; SSP3-7.0; SSP5-8.5) over the entire globe and its 26 Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) regions. The projections show an increase in intensity and frequency of hot temperature and precipitation extremes over land. The intensity of the hottest days (as measured by TXx) is projected to increase more in extratropical regions than in the tropics, while the frequency of extremely hot days (as measured by HWFI) is projected to increase more in the tropics. Drought frequency (as measured by CDD) is projected to increase more over Brazil, the Mediterranean, South Africa, and Australia. Meanwhile, the Asian monsoon regions (i.e., South Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia) become more prone to extreme flash flooding events later in the twenty-first century as shown by the higher RX5day index projections. The projected changes in extremes reveal large spatial variability within each SREX region. The spatial variability of the studied extreme events increases with increasing greenhouse gas concentration (GHG) and is higher at the end of the twenty-first century. The projected change in the extremes and the pattern of their spatial variability is minimum under the low-emission scenario SSP1-2.6. Our results indicate that an increased concentration of GHG leads to substantial increases in the extremes and their intensities. Hence, limiting CO2 emissions could substantially limit the risks associated with increases in extreme events in the twenty-first century.","[Almazroui, Mansour; Ismail, Muhammad; Islam, M.

In regions with low forest cover, elevated river temperature is often associated with a lack of bankside shading. Consequently, river managers have advocated riparian tree planting as a strategy to reduce temperature extremes. However, the effect of riparian shading on river temperature varies substantially between locations. Process-based models can elucidate the relative importance of woodland and other factors driving river temperature and thus improve understanding of spatial variability of the effect of shading, but characterising the spatial distribution and height of riparian tree cover necessary to parameterise these models remains a significant challenge. Here, we document a novel approach that combines Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry acquired from a drone to characterise the riparian canopy with a process based temperature model (Heat Source) to simulate the effects of tree shading on river temperature. Our approach was applied in the Gimock Burn, a tributary of the Aberdeenshire Dee, Scotland. Results show that SIM approximates true canopy elevation with a good degree of accuracy (R-2 = 0.96) and reveals notable spatial heterogeneity in shading. When these data were incorporated into a process-based temperature model, it was possible to simulate river temperatures with a similarly-high level of accuracy (RMSE <0.7 degrees C) to a model parameterised using 'conventional' LiDAR tree height data. We subsequently demonstrate the utility of our approach for quantifying the magnitude of shading effects on stream temperature by comparing simulated temperatures against another model from which all riparian woodland has been removed. Our findings highlight drone-based SIM as an effective tool for characterising riparian shading and improving river temperature models. This research provides valuable insights into the effects of riparian woodland on river temperature and the potential of bankside tree planting for climate change adaptation.

J,"Berga, L",,,,"Berga, Luis",,,The Role of Hydropower in Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation: A Review,ENGINEERING,,,English,Review,,,,,,Renewable energy; Hydropower; Climate change mitigation; Impacts of climate change,,"Hydropower is a clean, renewable, and environmentally friendly source of energy. It produces 3930 (TW.h).a(-1), and yields 16% of the world's generated electricity and about 78% of renewable electricity generation (in 2015). Hydropower and climate change show a double relationship. On the one hand, as an important renewable energy resource, hydropower contributes significantly to the avoidance of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to the mitigation of global warming. On the other hand, climate change is likely to alter river discharge, impacting water availability and hydropower generation. Hydropower contributes significantly to the reduction of GHG emissions and to energy supply security. Compared with conventional coal power plants, hydropower prevents the emission of about 3 GT CO2 per year, which represents about 9% of global annual CO2 emissions. Hydropower projects may also have an enabling role beyond the electricity sector, as a financing instrument for multipurpose reservoirs and as an adaptive measure regarding the impacts of climate change on water resources, because regulated basins with large reservoir capacities are more resilient to water resource changes, less vulnerable to climate change, and act as a storage buffer against climate change. At the global level, the overall impact of climate change on existing hydropower generation may be expected to be small, or even slightly positive. However, there is the possibility of substantial variations across regions and even within countries. In conclusion, the general verdict on hydropower is that it is a cheap and mature technology that contributes significantly to climate change mitigation, and could play an important role in the climate change adaptation of water resource availability. However, careful attention is necessary to mitigate the substantial environmental and social costs. Roughly more than a terawatt of capacity could be added in upcoming decades. (C) 2016 THE AUTHORS.

Using a process-based ecosystem model (the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model, DLEM), we quantified the magnitude and spatiotemporal variations of contemporary (2000s) global NPP, and projected its potential responses to climate and CO2 changes in the 21st century under the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 and B1 of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We estimated a global terrestrial NPP of 54.6 (52.8-56.4) PgC yr(-1) as a result of multiple factors during 2000-2009. Climate change would either reduce global NPP (4.6%) under the A2 scenario or slightly enhance NPP (2.2%) under the B1 scenario during 2010-2099. In response to climate change, global NPP would first increase until surface air temperature increases by 1.5 degrees C (until the 2030s) and then level-off or decline after it increases by more than 1.5 degrees C (after the 2030s). This result supports the Copenhagen Accord Acknowledgement, which states that staying below 2 degrees C may not be sufficient and the need to potentially aim for staying below 1.5 degrees C. The CO2 fertilization effect would result in a 12%-13.9% increase in global NPP during the 21st century. The relative CO2 fertilization effect, i.e. change in NPP on per CO2 (ppm) bases, is projected to first increase quickly then level off in the 2070s and even decline by the end of the 2080s, possibly due to CO2 saturation and nutrient limitation. Terrestrial NPP responses to climate change and elevated atmospheric CO2 largely varied among biomes, with the largest increases in the tundra and boreal needleleaf deciduous forest. Compared to the low emission scenario (B1), the high emission scenario (A2) would lead to larger spatiotemporal variations in NPP, and more dramatic and counteracting impacts from climate and increasing atmospheric CO2.","[Pan, Shufen; Tian, Hanqin; Dangal, Shree R.

Thus, the climatic information must be assessed systematically and applied strategically into the planning process. This paper presents a tool named Urban Climate Map System (UCMS) that has proven capable of helping compact cities to incorporate climate effects in planning processes in a systematic way. UCMS is developed and presented in a Geographic Information System (GIS) platform in which the lessons learned and experience gained from interdisciplinary studies can be included. The methodology of UCMS of compact cities, the construction procedure, and the basic input factors - including the natural climate resources and planning data - are described. Some literatures that shed light on the applicability of UMCS are reported. The Municipality of Arnhem is one of Dutch compact urban areas and still under fast urban development and urban renewal. There is an urgent need for local planners and policy makers to protect local climate and open landscape resources and make climate change adaptation in urban construction. Thus, Arnhem is chosen to carry out a case study of UCMS. Although it is the first work of Urban Climatic Mapping in The Netherlands, it serves as a useful climatic information platform to local planners and policy makers for their daily on-going works. We attempt to use a quick method to collect available climatic and planning data and create an information platform for planning use. It relies mostly on literature and theoretical understanding that has been well practiced elsewhere. The effort here is to synergize the established understanding for a case at hand and demonstrate how useful guidance can still be made for planners and policy makers.

It has been argued by several researchers that perceiving climate change is a pre-condition for the adoption of adaptation strategies to reduce vulnerabilities. In this regard, studies are limited to explore the question 'is the perceptions of changing climate primarily motivate the smallholders to take adaptation actions?' In this nexus, the present paper seeks to understand the linkages between smallholders' climate change perception and the changes in their farming practices. The study was conducted in the seven villages of Sub-Himalayan West Bengal, India, using participatory rural appraisal (PRA) tools. Key results show, (1) respondents perceived increased warming and decreased precipitation in accordance with the scientific analysis; (2) abundance of groundwater, misconceptions and lack of awareness shaped respondents' agricultural risk perception, and despite decreasing precipitation, water management appeared less risky (3) incorporation of irrigation, diversification towards high valued and high yielding crops, as well as farm mechanizations were the major changes in the farming practices; and, (4) except water management, rest of the changes were not necessarily made to adapt with climate change instead to increase crop yield and profit. It is noticed that the changes in farming practices perhaps made the farmers unconsciously adapted to climate change. Still, a prolonged continuation of some of those practices may lead to maladaptation. In this regard, we have given direction towards necessary policy formulation and future research to achieve sustainability.","[Datta, Pritha; Behera, Bhagirath] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur,"Datta, P (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",dattapritha3@gmail.com; bhagirath9@gmail.com,,"Datta, Pritha/0000-0002-6563-8561",,,,,73,2,2,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0343-2521,1572-9893,,GEOJOURNAL,GeoJournal,OCT,2022,87,5,,,,,3621,3637,,10.1007/s10708-021-10450-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-021-10450-1,,JUN 2021,17,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,5S6RU,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000660813000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results showed that EbA helps to reduce climate vulnerability and enhance socio-ecosystem resilience. However, it often lacks innovativeness in addressing the risk and vulnerability associated with the changing climate. Though EbA is spelled out in most of Nepal's climate change policies, it faces sustainability issues due to low priority, lack of a proper institutional mechanism, and inadequate budget provisions. The EbA related activities are implemented on a small scale, runs for a short period, and failed to demonstrate tangible impacts. The sustainability of the EbA practices in Nepal will be ensured, only if it is mainstreamed in the government's regular planning process, receives enough budget from the government, and has robust institutional mechanisms in place for implementing and monitoring EbA activities.

In this study, we combine meteorological data from 18 local stations, field surveys on agricultural practices and agronomic information on the growth of millet to demonstrate the crop suitability to the present climate and the ability of Senegalese farmers to adapt their practices to climate variability, and to disseminate them. From data collected in both 665 villages and 1061 farmers, our study provides quantitative evidence of the responsive adaptation of farmers in the Sahel where the recent resumption of rainfall has provided new agricultural opportunities. Statistical models and cropping simulations show that these farmers innovate by reintroducing and disseminating a long cycle millet cultivar-more suitable for wet environments. We note that although this adaptation is a clear response to recent changes in quantity and distribution of rainfall, its adoption remains limited (50% of the villages visited and 25% of the surveyed agricultural producers have cultivated the new millet variety) and varies strongly within the same climatic context and by characteristics of farmers (willing and capacity), indicating different agricultural strategies (diversification, market exchanges). If land access and development of cash crops are hindrances to the adoption of sanio, poverty is clearly not a barrier and adaptation is not a lever for wealth creation. Such adaptative capacities, together with government incentives for farmers to sustainably adapt to climate change, can be important in reducing climate risks in the coming years.","[Lalou, Richard] Univ Paris, IRD, MERIT, F-75006 Paris, France; [Sultan, Benjamin] Univ Avignon, ESPACE DEV, Univ Montpellier, IRD,Univ Guyane,Univ Reunion,Univ Antilles, 500 Rue Jean Francois Breton, F-34093 Montpellier, France; [Muller, Bertrand] SupAgro, UMR AGAP, CIRAD, INRA, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Ndonky, Alphousseyni] Aix Marseille Univ, LPED, IRD, Campus Int UCAD IRD, Dakar, Senegal",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Avignon Universite; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; University of La Reunion; CIRAD; INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Universite de Montpellier; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Lalou, R (corresponding author), Univ Paris, IRD, MERIT, F-75006 Paris, France.",richard.lalou@ird.fr,"Sultan, Benjamin/C-8957-2012; LALOU, Richard/A-7322-2017","Sultan, Benjamin/0000-0003-0416-0338; LALOU, Richard/0000-0001-9489-7661",French National Research Agency (ANR) through the ESCAPE project [ANR-10-CEPL-005]; NERC/DFID Future Climate For Africa programme under the AMMA-2050 project [NE/M020126/1]; NERC [NE/M020428/1] Funding Source: UKRI,French National Research Agency (ANR) through the ESCAPE project(French National Research Agency (ANR)); NERC/DFID Future Climate For Africa programme under the AMMA-2050 project; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We thank G.

Thus, any perennial crop loss incurred due to the effects of climate change will also negatively impact food security and, more generally, the livelihoods of smallholders, farmers and rural communities. It is foreseen that in the not so distant future (2050), climate change and increased land use for food crop production, to meet increasing demands for food as the world's population increases, will negatively impact global production of perennial crops such as coffee and cocoa by reducing the availability of land suitable for their cultivation. Furthermore, the current trend towards full sun systems with excessive use of external inputs (agrochemicals, irrigation) increases the vulnerability of the cocoa and coffee sectors to climate change. To reconcile the need for food crops and the demand for export crops such as coffee and cocoa, under the scenarios of climate change and population growth, innovative production systems have to be developed. Such systems should also contribute to the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change and provide other ecosystem services such as regulation of pests and diseases. Agroforestry systems are some of the production systems which can address these manifold demands. Here, ideas for the development of competitive and sustainable agroforestry systems and the evaluation of their environmental benefits are presented and reviewed.","[ten Hoopen, G.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a novel decision support system (DSS) for the location of green infrastructure. The goal of the designed solution is to inform users about the location of urban hydrological sinks, which gather stormwater in urban watersheds, and the amount of water which could accumulate in each location depending on the defined precipitation and the soil's moisture conditions. The designed DSS is based on a multicomponent methodology including both atmospheric and soil conditions. The DSS was tested using a sample that presents the results of stormwater accumulation calculations. The obtained results show which green areas are the most suitable locations for green infrastructure solutions and which facility is optimal because of its retention abilities and amount of accumulated stormwater. The application of the designed DSS allows us to maximise the benefits of the implementation of green infrastructure within the existing urban land use. The fully editable component of hydrological conditions allows for testing projections of the potential amount of accumulated water in different precipitation scenarios. The study provides a DSS for use by local authorities which enables them to concentrate actions in order to better adapt cities to climate change and environmental extremes.","[Kazak, Jan K.; Szewranski, Szymon] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Dept Spatial Econ, Ul Grunwaldzka 55, PL-50357 Wroclaw, Poland; [Chruscinski, Jakub] GeoTechnol Sp Zoo, Ul Dlugosza 60, PL-51162 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences,"Kazak, JK (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Dept Spatial Econ, Ul Grunwaldzka 55, PL-50357 Wroclaw, Poland.",jan.kazak@upwr.edu.pl; kuba.chruscinski@gmail.com; szymon.szewranski@upwr.edu.pl,"Kazak, Jan/S-7783-2016; Szewrański, Szymon/A-5697-2017","Kazak, Jan/0000-0002-1864-9954; Szewrański, Szymon/0000-0003-4652-7978",Department of Spatial Economy of the Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences from statutory funds,Department of Spatial Economy of the Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences from statutory funds,This research was funded by the Department of Spatial Economy of the Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences from statutory funds.,,98,37,38,3,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2018,10,12,,,,,,,4388,10.3390/su10124388,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10124388,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HG9OL,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000455338100054,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite the technology focus in the project, practice shows that the questions of what a technology is and how the key concepts of technology transfer and diffusion should be understood and operationalized remain diffuse. This paper explores the reasons for this by analysing the experience of the TNA project in using a framework for categorizing technologies according to the types of markets and non-markets in which they are diffused. While the framework has contributed to a higher degree of 'market literacy' among national stakeholders, four challenges in categorizing technologies have been identified: i) technologies comprising varying degrees of software, orgware and hardware; ii) technologies appearing as whole systems of production; iii) technologies covering different application markets; and iv) technologies situated on a continuum between research, development and diffusion. These challenges are proxies for the challenges in formulating plans of actions for technologies. If, due to a lack of conceptual clarity, it is not clear to countries whether the diffusion of a specific technology should be implemented by a project or by means of an enabling framework, the measures proposed in the action plans may be misleading. We therefore call for an increased focus on clarifying the technology concept in the training for the next generation of TNAs.","[Nygaard, Ivan; Hansen, Ulrich Elmer] Tech Univ Denmark, Roskilde, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Nygaard, I (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Roskilde, Denmark.",ivny@dtu.dk,"Nygaard, Ivan/Q-4058-2017","Nygaard, Ivan/0000-0002-7633-9241; Hansen, Ulrich Elmer/0000-0002-8997-6717",,,,,27,9,10,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

A great deal of research work has been carried out on different aspects of western Himalayan mountain ecosystems but the findings have yet to be correlated in the context of climate change. There is a need to strengthen climate data collection network which is presently insufficient to meet the requirement of climate change research. The climate data in the region is scarce and in many instances does not involve uniform methodology and standard instrumentation. The data reliability thus is uncertain as the data are based on crude collection methods without quality control. Climate change impacts also need to be categorized according to various climatic elements viz., rainfall, temperature, CO2 concentration, etc. Coordinated efforts are required for adaptation and mitigation as the vulnerable mountain ecosystems and communities are likely to face greater risk of climate change impacts than other ecosystems. Research and documentation is also required to validate the indigenous methods of adaptations and coping up mechanisms. Capacities of communities have to be enhanced and strategies are to be developed for adaptation to climate change. There is also a need to network with other potential players in this subject to utilize the synergy in the best interest of survival, and ensuring livelihood security of the inhabitants of the region and that of the adjacent lowlands. The balance between economic interests and ecological imperatives is also essential.","[Negi, G. C. S.; Kothyari, B. P.; Dhyani, P. P.] GBPIHED, Almora 263643, Uttarakhand, India; [Samal, P.

Path dependency is a prominent concept in the adaptation pathways literature, but insufficiently defined and operationalised. The present paper empirically tracks all constitutive elements of path dependency for four decades of flood risk management (FRM) in two alpine mountain regions in Austria, the Ennstal and Aist river catchments, using a mixed-methods approach. FRM governance has a critical role whether decisions lead to path dependency. Lock-in manifests not just in technical structures, but also in inertia of incumbent actor coalitions and management paradigms. Sub-optimality is hard to assess for lack of clearly defined protection targets; however, it appears in the ways that structural measures are implemented-too little, too late or with negative impacts on nature conservation. Past floods do not qualify as contingent events, as they have not fundamentally changed FRM practice. By contrast, technological and institutional shifts over longer periods, such as digital hazard maps and EU directives, have gradually reoriented FRM strategies. Institution-based self-reinforcing mechanisms are more prevalent than technology-based self-reinforcing mechanisms. Established actor coalitions combined with institutional density illustrate how those in charge uphold a path to defend their position, power and resources. Our recommendations for how to overcome path dependency in FRM governance are: encourage niche experiments, link FRM more closely with climate change adaptation, revise the national policy framework towards polycentric governance approaches and improve professional training.","[Seebauer, Sebastian] JOANNEUM Res Forschungsgesellschaft Mbh, Energy Syst & Soc, LIFE Inst Climate, Graz, Austria; [Thaler, Thomas] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Mt Risk Engn, Vienna, Austria; [Hanger-Kopp, Susanne; Schinko, Thomas] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Populat & Just Soc Program, Laxenburg, Austria; [Hanger-Kopp, Susanne] Dept Environm Syst Sci, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich","Seebauer, S (corresponding author), JOANNEUM Res Forschungsgesellschaft Mbh, Energy Syst & Soc, LIFE Inst Climate, Graz, Austria.",sebastian.seebauer@joanneum.at; thomas.thaler@boku.ac.at; hanger@iiasa.ac.at; schinko@iiasa.ac.at,"; Thaler, Thomas/O-7112-2014","Hanger, Susanne/0000-0001-7223-9991; Thaler, Thomas/0000-0003-3869-3722",,,,,67,0,0,3,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

The potential of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L.] Moench) to contribute to food security and livelihoods of smallholders in South Africa has not been realised, despite its resilience to heat and drought, due to its marginalisation in research, breeding, the scale of production, and policy support. Consequently, to reduce vulnerability and boost sorghum's position as a key climate change adaptation crop, in this review we examined some biophysical, socio-economic, socio-cultural and institutional barriers that constrain its production and performance on smallholder farms in South Africa. We further suggest pertinent issues to be addressed to improve production and productivity on smallholder farms. Increasing awareness, policy development and support, and capacitation of extension services, as well as improving market access, agronomic and cultural practices, and availability of more locally adapted sorghum varieties are requisite factors in addressing the prevailing constraints limiting sorghum production. Furthermore, tailored and site-specific studies at farm and landscape level are imperative for informed management and decision support. Thus, an integrated and multidisciplinary approach is key in fostering significant improvement in sorghum production and performance in smallholder systems in South Africa to reduce climate change vulnerability. Significance: Sorghum has the potential to bolster food and livelihoods of smallholder farmers in South Africa. Socio-economic, socio-cultural and biophysical challenges limit sorghum production and performance in South Africa. An integrated and multidisciplinary approach is required to optimise the opportunities to improve sorghum production and performance in South Africa.","[Dunjana, Nothando; Dube, Ernest] Nelson Mandela Univ, Sch Nat Resource Management, George, South Africa; [Chauke, Patience; Nciizah, Adornis] Agr Res Council, Nat Resources & Engn, Pretoria, South Africa; [Motsepe, Matiga; Madikiza, Seneo; Kgakatsi, Ikalafeng] Dept Agr Land Reform & Rural Dev, Pretoria, South Africa",Nelson Mandela University; Agricultural Research Council of South Africa,"Dunjana, N (corresponding author), Nelson Mandela Univ, Sch Nat Resource Management, George, South Africa.",ntandodunjana@yahoo.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Nciizah, Adornis/Q-4468-2018","Nciizah, Adornis/0000-0002-2481-5218",,,,,67,0,0,4,4,ACAD SCIENCE SOUTH AFRICA A S S AF,LYNWOOD RIDGE,"PO BOX 72135, LYNWOOD RIDGE 0040, SOUTH AFRICA",0038-2353,1996-7489,,S AFR J SCI,S.

Climate projections indicate that temperatures in the southern interior of BC will continue to increase, with concomitant negative impacts on human health. Successful climate change adaptation must include cross-sectoral action, inclusive of the health sector, to plan for and respond to climate-related events, including extreme heat. Intervention The objective of this project was to support the development and implementation of a Heat Alert and Response System (HARS) in a small, rural community. The health authority facilitated collaboration among provincial and local governments, community organizations, and First Nations partners to assess community assets, draft a plan for extreme heat, and prepare for a community-supported response during heat events. Outcomes Stakeholders expressed the importance of utilizing existing partnerships and community resources, such as physical and procedural infrastructure, in which to embed the HARS. It was imperative that the plan be simple, concise, and considerate of the community's unique context. Educational materials and a tailored method of dissemination were important for collective and individual risk mitigation. Implications A community-driven approach that utilized existing assets allowed for integration of HARS within municipal response plans and established infrastructure. The result is a sustainable public health intervention that has the potential to mitigate the negative health effects of extreme heat. Knowledge acquired through this initiative is informing similar HARS planning processes in other rural BC communities.","[Deegan, Heather E.] Interior Hlth, Populat Hlth, Kelowna, BC, Canada; [Green, Jenny] Interior Hlth, Populat Hlth, Kamloops, BC, Canada; [El Kurdi, Sylvia] BC Observ Populat & Publ Hlth, Kelowna, BC, Canada; [Pollock, Sue L.] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Fac Med, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Pollock, SL (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Fac Med, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",sue.pollock@interiorhealth.ca,,,Health Canada,Health Canada,This project was funded in association with Health Canada.

Change in the annual occurrence frequency of landfalling and non-landfalling weak, strong, and super TCs during 1980-2018 was analyzed. Results indicate that the super TCs have been more likely to make landfall in the northwest Pacific since 1980. Using an empirical orthogonal function-based method proposed to decompose the space-time field of TC occurrence into different patterns, the anthropogenic influence on the change in super TC occurrence was detected when the impacts of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific meridional mode (PMM), and the interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO) were separated. Results further show that TCs forming in the sea surface near land (6 degrees-21 degrees N, 130 degrees-137 degrees E) have been more likely to intensify to super TCs in recent years. These intensified TCs tend to favor subsequent landfall, which may be the reason for the increase in landfalling super TCs. The intensification of TC is mainly due to the increase in the intensification rate, which increases with increased sea surface temperature (SST), especially during the stronger wind periods. Along with the change in the occurrence of landfalling super TCs, the landfalling locations of super TCs also changed. For example, western South China, Southeast China, and Japan are facing an increase in landfalling super TCs. The destructiveness of super TCs to these economically developed and highly populated regions is great; more attention therefore should be paid to mitigate TC disasters.","[Xiao, Mingzhong] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Lunar & Planetary Sci, Macau, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Mingzhong] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Macau University of Science & Technology; Hohai University,"Xiao, MZ (corresponding author), Macau Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Lunar & Planetary Sci, Macau, Peoples R China.;Xiao, MZ (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",xmingzh@mail2.sysu,,,"Macao Young Scholars Program [AM201903]; Macau Science and Technology Development Fund [0045/2018/AFJ]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51909057, 42071055]",Macao Young Scholars Program; Macau Science and Technology Development Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is financially supported by a grant from the Macao Young Scholars Program'' (AM201903), the Macau Science and Technology Development Fund (0045/2018/AFJ), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51909057, 42071055).

To provide a suitable characterization of climate-related hazards in the North Adriatic Sea coast, a model chain, with progressively higher resolution was developed and implemented. It includes Global and Regional Circulation Models representing atmospheric and oceanic dynamics for the global and sub-continental domains, and hydrodynamic/wave models useful to analyze physical impacts of sea-level rise and coastal erosion at a sub-national/local scale. The model chain, integrating multiple types of numerical models running at different spatial scales, provides information about spatial and temporal patterns of relevant hazard metrics (e.g., sea temperature, atmospheric pressure, wave height), usable to represent climate-induced events causing potential environmental or socio-economic damages. Furthermore, it allows the discussion of some methodological problems concerning the application of climate scenarios and their dynamical downscaling to the assessment of the impacts in coastal zones. Based on a balanced across all energy sources emission scenario, the multi-model chain applied in the North Adriatic Sea allowed to assess the change in frequency of exceedance of wave height and bottom stress critical thresholds for sediment motion in the future scenario (2070-2100) compared to the reference period 1960 to 1990. As discussed in the paper, such projections can be used to develop coastal erosion hazard scenarios, which can then be applied to risk assessment studies, providing valuable information to mainstream climate change adaptation in coastal zone management.","[Torresan, Silvia; Gallina, Valentina; Gualdi, Silvio; Giubilato, Elisa; Critto, Andrea] Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Risk Assessment & Adaptat Strategies Div, Via Augusto Imperatore 16, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Torresan, Silvia; Gallina, Valentina; Critto, Andrea] Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Via Torino 155, I-30172 Venice, Italy; [Bellafiore, Debora; Umgiesser, Georg; Carniel, Sandro; Sclavo, Mauro; Benetazzo, Alvise] Natl Res Council Italy CNR, Inst Marine Sci ISMAR, Castello 2737-F, I-30122 Venice, Italy; [Umgiesser, Georg] Klaipeda Univ, CORPI, Coastal Res & Planning Inst, H Manto 84, LT-92294 Klaipeda, Lithuania",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze Marine (ISMAR-CNR); Klaipeda University,"Critto, A (corresponding author), Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Risk Assessment & Adaptat Strategies Div, Via Augusto Imperatore 16, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.;Critto, A (corresponding author), Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Via Torino 155, I-30172 Venice, Italy.",torresan@unive.it; valegallina@yahoo.it; silvio.gualdi@ingv.it; debora.bellafiore@ve.ismar.cnr.it; georg.umgiesser@ismar.cnr.it; sandro.carniel@ismar.cnr.it; mauro.sclavo@ismar.cnr.it; alvise.benetazzo@ve.ismar.cnr.it; giubilato@unive.it; critto@unive.it,"Gualdi, Silvio/F-3061-2015; Alvise, Benetazzo/AAJ-3501-2021; benetazzo, alvise/AGG-0076-2022; bellafiore, debora/AAW-9971-2020; Umgiesser, Georg/ABF-2127-2020","Gualdi, Silvio/0000-0001-7777-8935; benetazzo, alvise/0000-0002-9535-4922; bellafiore, debora/0000-0003-2442-3916; Umgiesser, Georg/0000-0001-9697-275X; GIUBILATO, Elisa/0000-0001-6335-0735","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research; Italian Ministry of Environment, Land, and Sea under GEMINA project","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Italian Ministry of Environment, Land, and Sea under GEMINA project","The research leading to these results has received funding from the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research and the Italian Ministry of Environment, Land, and Sea under GEMINA project.",,65,11,11,1,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUN,2019,11,6,,,,,,,,10.3390/w11061157,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11061157,,,18,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,II7BC,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000475346300045,View Full Record in Web of Science

Societal transformation in the context of multi-functional protection schemes offers potential in this regard. However, the drivers and barriers of societal transformation in hazard management are poorly understood. Here we interrogate drivers and barriers of societal transformation in natural hazard management through case studies in Austria, France and Ireland focusing on attempts to integratemulti-functional protection schemes in the context of flood and avalanche hazards. We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders connected to proposed transformative strategies in the selected case studies. We find that transformative approaches have been mainly supported by local initiatives instigated by local governments, residents, or NGOs with the aim of complementing conventional hazard management policies. Our analysis shows that local actors and stakeholders often pursue initiatives to address local problems or to seize local opportunities rather than to contribute to a broader societal transformation. According to our findings, key drivers of community-based initiatives with multiple functionality and use include: (i) lack of funding, (ii) lack of legal protection or (iii) lack of space, where classical risk management measures can no longer respond to new circumstances. In contrast, key barriers relate to: (i) lack of local capacities, (ii) lack of local political support and (iii) technological challenges in the implementation phase. These insights support European regions currently working on the implementation of climate change adaptation strategies arising from natural hazards. (C) 2018 The Authors.

These stem, in part, from a disconnect between the information that is produced and the information needs of local resource managers. A disproportionate focus on the natural and physical sciences in climate vulnerability and adaptation assessment obscure understandings of complex social systems and the interactions and feedbacks in social-ecological systems. We use a qualitative case study of bison management on Department of the Interior-managed and tribal lands to explore how a social-science driven Determinants and Analogue Vulnerability Assessment (DAVA) can inform ecological response models, specifically simulation models that account for multiple drivers of change. First, we illustrate how a DAVA approach can help to: 1) identify key processes, entities, and interactions across scales; 2) document local impacts, indicators, and monitoring efforts of drought and climate; and 3) identify major tradeoffs and uncertainties. We then demonstrate how qualitative narratives can inform simulation models by: 1) prioritizing model components included in modeling efforts; 2) framing joint management and climate scenarios; and 3) parameterizing and evaluating model performance. We do this by presenting a conceptual joint agent-based/state-and-transition simulation modeling framework. Simulation models can represent multiple interacting variables and can identify surprising, emergent outcomes that might not be evident from qualitative analysis alone, and we argue that qualitative case studies can ground simulation models in local contexts and help make them more structurally realistic and useful. Together, these can provide a step toward developing actionable climate change adaptation strategies.","[Beeton, Tyler A.; McNeeley, Shannon M.; Ojima, Dennis S.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, North Cent Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, NESB A309,1231 East Dr, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Miller, Brian W.] US Geol Survey, North Cent Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Ojima, Dennis S.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, 1231 East Dr, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Colorado State University,"Beeton, TA (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, NESB A309,1231 East Dr, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",Tyler.Beeton@colostate.edu,,"Miller, Brian/0000-0003-1716-1161","Department of the Interior North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center [G11AC90009, G14AP00180, G17AC00284]",Department of the Interior North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center,"We would like to thank the land and resource managers who agreed to participate in this study and share their local knowledges and observations.

One of the goals of the 2014 Scottish Climate Change Adaptation Programme is to identify the consequences of climate change for protected areas and to put in place adaptation or mitigation measures. As a contribution to the process, this paper develops a methodology to identify the relative level of risk to nationally and internationally important geological and geomorphological sites in Scotland from the impacts of climate change. The methodology is based on existing understanding of the likely responses of different types of geosite to specific aspects of climate change, such as changes in rainfall, rising sea levels or increased storminess, and is applied to assess the likelihood of damaging impacts on groups of similar geoheritage features in sites with similar characteristics. The results indicate that 80 (8.8%) of the similar to 900 nationally and internationally important geoheritage sites in Scotland are at 'high' risk from climate change. These include active soft-sediment coastal and fluvial features, finite Quaternary sediment exposures and landforms in coastal and river locations, active periglacial features, sites with palaeoenvironmental records, finite or restricted rock exposures and fossils. Using this risk-based assessment, development of indicative geoheritage climate-change actions have been prioritised for these sites. Depending on the characteristics of the sites, management options may range from 'do nothing' to rescue excavations and posterity recording. Monitoring is an essential part of the management process to trigger evidence-based interventions. (C) 2018 The Geologists' Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Research from the social sciences conducted in the past decade has focussed on adaptability or adaptive capacity as a key attribute for individuals and groups to possess for managing resilience. It is, therefore, timely to ask the following: do current ways of doing and organising RD&E in the dairy sector in New Zealand and Australia contribute to supporting farm adaptability? This paper reports on results from an examination of case studies of challenges to resilience in the dairy sector in Australia and New Zealand (i.e. dairy farm conversion, climate-change adaptation, consent to farm) and the contribution of dairy RD&E in enhancing resilience of farmers, their farms and the broader industry. Drawing on concepts from resilience studies and considering an empowerment perspective, the analysis of these cases suggest that, currently, agricultural RD&E supports adaptability in general, but varies in the strength of its presence and level of activity in the areas known to enhance adaptability. This analysis is used to generate principles for dairy scientists and others in the RD&E system to consider in (1) research designs, (2) engaging different farmers in research and (3) presenting research results differently. This represents a significant shift for the science and advisory communities to move to methods that acknowledge uncertainty and facilitate learning.","[Nettle, R.; Ayre, M.; Waller, S.] Univ Melbourne, Rural Innovat Res Grp, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Beilin, R.] Univ Melbourne, Landscape Sociol Grp, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Turner, L.; Hall, A.; Irvine, L.] Tasmanian Inst Agr, Burnie, Tas 7320, Australia; [Taylor, G.] DairyNZ, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; University of Tasmania; DairyNZ,"Nettle, R (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Rural Innovat Res Grp, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",ranettle@unimelb.edu.au,"Nettle, Ruth/AAI-2967-2021; Ayre, Margaret/AAE-1981-2020; Hall, Alison/AAT-6306-2020","Ayre, Margaret/0000-0001-7909-7391; Irvine, Lesley/0000-0002-4173-8488; Nettle, Ruth/0000-0001-8347-6693; Turner, Lydia/0000-0001-8954-7069","Dairy Australia; Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture; Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF); Australian Government, Canberra","Dairy Australia(Dairy Australia); Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture; Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF)(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Agriculture and Water Resources); Australian Government, Canberra(Australian Government)","The authors acknowledge the input and support from the following: funding provided for the DairySmart project from Dairy Australia and the Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture and the time provided by the Bracknell family (Farming case study-Tasmania); funding provided by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), Australian Government, Canberra and Dairy Australia, as well as the time and expertise provided by the project team, regional co-ordinators, farmers and service providers involved in the Dairy Businesses for Future Climates Project (DBfFC); and the time provided by the DairyNZ project manager in development of the case study; consent to farm case - New Zealand.",,66,7,7,0,44,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1836-0939,1836-5787,,ANIM PROD SCI,Anim.

In this context, some questions become important. For example, what are the temporal and spatial distribution and development trends of transportation resilience when considering the impact of multilpe extreme weather events on the urban transportation system? What is the degree of loss of urban transportation resilience (UT resilience) under different extreme event intensities, and how long will it take for the entire system to restore balance? In the future, if extreme weather events become more frequent and intense, what trends will urban transportation resilience show? Considering these problems, the current monitoring methods for transportation resilience under the influence of extreme events are lacking, especially the monitoring of the temporal and spatial dynamic changes of transportation resilience under the influence of compined extreme events. The development of big data mining technology and deep learning methods for spatiotemporal predictions made the construction of spatiotemporal data sets for evaluating and predicting UT resilience-intensity indicators possible. Such data sets reveal the temporal and spatial features and evolution of UT resilience intensity under the influence of compound extreme weather events, as well as the related future change trends. They indicate the key research areas that should be focused on, namely, the transportation resilience under climate warming. This work is especially important in planning efforts to adapt to climate change and rising sea levels and is relevant to policymakers, traffic managers, civil protection managers, and the general public.","[Ji, Tao; Yao, Yanhong; Dou, Yue; Deng, Shejun; Yu, Shijun] Yangzhou Univ, Coll Architectural Sci & Engn, Yangzhou 225127, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ji, Tao; Zhu, Yunqiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Liao, Huajun] SuperMap Software Co Ltd, Beijing 100015, Peoples R China","Yangzhou University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Ji, T (corresponding author), Yangzhou Univ, Coll Architectural Sci & Engn, Yangzhou 225127, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Ji, T; Zhu, YQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",jitao@yzu.edu.cn; Yaoyanhong1250@126.com; dy_DouYue@126.com; dsj@yzu.edu.cn; yushijun2011@163.com; zhuyq@lreis.ac.cn; liaohuajun@supermap.com,,"ji, tao/0000-0002-6157-2606",Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20210833]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2021M703175]; Humanities and Social Science Research Planning Fund Project [19YJC630007],Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Humanities and Social Science Research Planning Fund Project,"This research was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, grant number BK20210833; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, grant number 2021M703175; and Humanities and Social Science Research Planning Fund Project, grant number 19YJC630007.",,95,0,0,44,89,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2022,14,7,,,,,,,3880,10.3390/su14073880,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14073880,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0K4EA,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000780742200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The impacts of climate change on these metrics are assessed for two periods, the 2030s (2020-2049) and 2070s (2060-2089), and compared with those in the baseline period (1976-2005). The Future Science City Park in Beijing, China, is selected as our study area. The results show that all four flood events are well simulated, with both efficiency coefficients and correlation coefficients being over 0.8. The number of overloaded manholes and the total flooding volume are projected to increase 19.3%-44.8% and 171%-716% under 20-year rainfall events due to climate change in the two future periods. The spatial distribution of overloaded manholes with different increased flooding volumes is projected to expand to almost the whole area from the region with lowland and limited drainage capacity. Furthermore, the maximum inundation area and depth are projected to increase obviously. This study will be helpful for designing and improving the drainage system, controlling urban flooding, and adapting to climate change.","[Hou, Jinjin; Zhang, Yongyong; Xia, Jun; Wang, Yueling; Zhang, Shiyan; Leng, Guoyong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proces, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hou, Jinjin; Dou, Ming] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Water Conservancy Sci & Engn, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China; [Pan, Xingyao; Yang, Moyuan] Beijing Water Sci & Technol Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Zhengzhou University","Zhang, YY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proces, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangyy003@igsnrr.ac.cn,,"Zhang, Shiyan/0000-0002-2585-0584; Wang, Yueling/0000-0003-2773-2108",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA23040301]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42071041],Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA23040301), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42071041).

Nonetheless, how soil prokaryotes of different water tables respond to climate change remains largely unknown. This study used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to evaluate the variation in soil prokaryotes under scenarios of warming, rainfall reduction, and their combination in different water table peatlands on the Zoige Plateau in China. Stimulated climate change affected some of the diversity indexes and relative abundances of soil prokaryotes in three water table peatlands. Additionally, those from the dry-rewetting event peatland had the most dominant phyla (genera) that showed significant changes in a relative abundance due to the simulated climate change treatments. Regarding functional microbial groups of carbon and nitrogen cycling, simulated climate change did not affect the abundances of the Euryarchaeota, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Methanobacterium in three water table peatlands, except NC10 and Nitrospirae. Redundancy analysis showed that the prokaryotic community variation was primary impacted by site properties of the different water table peatlands rather than the simulated climate change treatments. Moreover, the water table, total carbon, total nitrogen, and soil pH were the primary factors for the overall variation in the soil prokaryotic structure. This study provides a theoretical guidance for management strategies in the Zoige peatland, under climate change scenarios. More attention should be given to the interactive effects of peatland water table drawdown and simulated climate changes for better restorative efforts in water table drawdown, rather than simply adapting to climate change.","[Li, Wei; Chen, Huai; Yan, Zhiying; Rui, Junpeng; Wu, Ning; He, Yixin] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utilizat, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei; Chen, Huai; Yan, Zhiying; Rui, Junpeng; Wu, Ning; He, Yixin] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Ecol Restorat Biodivers Conservat Key Lab Sichuan, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei; Chen, Huai; Wu, Ning; He, Yixin] Chinese Acad Sci, Zoige Peatland & Global Change Res Stn, Hongyuan, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei] Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei] Yunnan Univ, Yunnan Key Lab Plateau Mt Ecol & Restorat Degrade, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Huai] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Gang] Southwest Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Life Sci & Engn, Mianyang, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chengdu Institute of Biology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chengdu Institute of Biology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Yunnan University; Yunnan University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Southwest University of Science & Technology - China","Chen, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utilizat, Chengdu, Peoples R China.;Chen, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Ecol Restorat Biodivers Conservat Key Lab Sichuan, Chengdu, Peoples R China.;Chen, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Zoige Peatland & Global Change Res Stn, Hongyuan, Peoples R China.;Chen, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",chenhuai@bib.ac.cn; wuning@cib.ac.cn,"Chen, Huai/AAI-1024-2020; Chen, Huai/A-7418-2015","Chen, Huai/0000-0001-7650-289X; Chen, Huai/0000-0001-7650-289X",Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA2005010404]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0501804]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences of Chinese Academy of Sciences [QYZDB-SSW-DQC007]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [91851108]; Key Research and Development Program of Sichuan Province [20ZDYF1477]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition [2019QZKK0304],Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences of Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research and Development Program of Sichuan Province; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition,"N This study was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA2005010404), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition (2019QZKK0304), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0501804), the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences of Chinese Academy of Sciences (QYZDB-SSW-DQC007), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (91851108), and the Key Research and Development Program of Sichuan Province (20ZDYF1477).",,52,3,4,11,45,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-302X,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

This concept is being applied to buildings through new standards such as the Living Building Challenge, yet examples of implementation of regenerative design at the urban scale are rare. While this is a promising direction for sustainable design, in theory new metrics, design tools and workflows need to be developed to translate regenerative design concepts into practice effectively. Among other factors, barriers to implementation remain rooted in the shortcomings of existing urban simulation tools to evaluate a wide range of performance metrics simultaneously. This paper thus proposes a prototype workflow to evaluate regenerative performance using existing evaluation tools in a single digital workflow. A series of existing and customised plugins, most of which are already in use and open source, were integrated into a multi-parametric workflow based on the Grasshopper visual programming tool. The workflow was tested on Malaga as a case study and incorporated key performance indicators related to outdoor human thermal comfort, biophilia, daylight performance, and energy use and production, based on data exchange and synergies across the different tools. These indicators were evaluated for present and future climate scenarios obtained from a weather generator. This paper demonstrates the potential of this workflow to receive visual feedback on various aspects of regenerative urban design, thus enabling designers to more effectively pursue an evidence-based urban design process.","[Naboni, Emanuele; Brizzi, Giambattista] Royal Danish Acad Fine Arts, Inst Architecture & Technol, Sch Architecture, DK-1425 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Naboni, Emanuele; Brizzi, Giambattista] Royal Danish Acad Fine Arts, Inst Architecture & Technol, Sch Design, DK-1425 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Naboni, Emanuele; Brizzi, Giambattista] Royal Danish Acad Fine Arts, Inst Architecture & Technol, Sch Conservat, DK-1425 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Natanian, Jonathan; Chokhachian, Ata] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Architecture, Chair Bldg Technol & Climate Respons Design, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Florio, Pietro] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Solar Energy & Bldg Phys Lab LESO PE, LE 0 02 Batiment LE Stn 18, CH-1015 Lausanne, VD, Switzerland; [Galanos, Theodoros] Austrian Inst Technol, Vienna, Austria; [Rastogi, Parag] Arbnco Ltd, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Technical University of Munich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT),"Naboni, E (corresponding author), Royal Danish Acad Fine Arts, Inst Architecture & Technol, Sch Architecture, DK-1425 Copenhagen, Denmark.;Naboni, E (corresponding author), Royal Danish Acad Fine Arts, Inst Architecture & Technol, Sch Design, DK-1425 Copenhagen, Denmark.;Naboni, E (corresponding author), Royal Danish Acad Fine Arts, Inst Architecture & Technol, Sch Conservat, DK-1425 Copenhagen, Denmark.;Natanian, J (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Architecture, Chair Bldg Technol & Climate Respons Design, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",jonathan.natanian@tum.de,"Florio, Pietro/GOE-5510-2022; Chokhachian, Ata/I-9073-2017; Rastogi, Parag/L-1411-2015","Florio, Pietro/0000-0001-7866-7401; Chokhachian, Ata/0000-0002-2543-6893; naboni, emanuele/0000-0002-6381-6491; Rastogi, Parag/0000-0002-9026-8080; Natanian, Jonathan/0000-0002-8563-3346",COST Action [CA16114]; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD); SCCER -FEEB D,COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)); German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); SCCER -FEEB D,The article was developed with the support of the COST Action CA16114 'RESTORE: Rethinking Sustainability towards a Regenerative Economy.

In these systems and in a full-sun pasture, photosynthetically active radiation transmission, air temperature, relative humidity, black globe temperature, and wind speed were measured. These variables were used to calculate black globe temperature and humidity index (BGHI) and radiant thermal load (RU). Higher animal thermal comfort was observed in the silvopastoral systems due to changes in the microclimate induced by the trees; notably, a decrease in solar radiation transmission. Fewer hours of potential animal thermal stress (BGHI > 79) were observed in the silvopastoral systems than under the full-sun conditions, with differences up to 3 h per day. The silvopastoral systems presented lower radiant thermal load than the full-sun pasture with differences up to 22% achieved. The assessed silvopastoral systems may help livestock adapt to climate change, since they achieved the limit of BGHI considered to cause stress to animals following an increase of 2.2 degrees C in air temperature, compared with full-sun pastures.","[Macedo Pezzopane, Jose Ricardo; Franceschi Nicodemo, Maria Luiza; Garcia, Alexandre Rossetto] Embrapa Pecuaria Sudeste, Empresa Brasileira Pesquisa Agr, POB 339, BR-13560970 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Bosi, Cristiam] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, Av Padua Dias 11, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Lulu, Jorge] Embrapa Agrossilvipastoril, Empresa Brasileira Pesquisa Agr, Rod Pioneiros MT 222,Km 2,5,POB 343, BR-78550970 Sinop, MT, Brazil",Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA); Universidade de Sao Paulo; Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA),"Pezzopane, JRM (corresponding author), Embrapa Pecuaria Sudeste, Empresa Brasileira Pesquisa Agr, POB 339, BR-13560970 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.",jose.pezzopane@embrapa.br; marialuiza.nicodemo@embrapa.br; cristiambosi@usp.br; alexandre.garcia@embrapa.br; jorge.lulu@embrapa.br,"Bosi, Cristiam/L-2415-2016; Pezzopane, José Ricardo/AAG-7792-2021; Garcia, Alexandre Rossetto/G-1477-2012","Bosi, Cristiam/0000-0001-8318-6477; Pezzopane, José Ricardo/0000-0001-5462-6090; Garcia, Alexandre Rossetto/0000-0002-3354-1474","CNPq [478067/2013-5]; FAPESP [2016/02959-1, 2015/26627-5, 308723/2015-5, 2014/11931-8]",CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),The study was carried out with financial support from CNPq (Grant no. 478067/2013-5) and FAPESP (Grants nos. 2016/02959-1 and 2015/26627-5).

This paper examines the gender difference in environmental concern in the case of Ethiopia, Oromia regional state. For this, 140 individuals are sampled from the study areas. The result reveals that women play triple role in their communities: reproductive role, productive role, and community roles. The result also shows that women are more likely to depend on natural resources and hence more likely vulnerable to climate change effects. However, there is no statistically significant difference between women and men in terms of climate change awareness and choice of climate change adaptation strategies. The estimated logit model predicts that women are 31.25 times more likely to participate in environmental conservation than men. Increase in the daily work load by 1 hour is more likely to reduce the individual participation in environmental conservation by 0.237 times. The result also shows that increase in livestock possession decreases individual participation in environmental conservations. A number of policy implications are drawn. There is a need to increase the incentive and distribution of improved cooking stoves and biogas so as to decrease the women work loads. There is also a need to engage civil society organizations, government institutions, and relevant women's networks to ensure inclusive approaches to the implementation of gender-responsive forest policies. Finally, the regional government is advised to organize gender-awareness seminars and workshops for forestry officials, including decision-makers and policy committee members.","[Huluka, Admassu Tesso] Ethiopian Civil Serv Univ, Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",,"Huluka, AT (corresponding author), Ethiopian Civil Serv Univ, Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",admassutesso@gmail.com,,"Huluka, Admassu Tesso/0000-0002-1946-0977",,,,,33,0,0,3,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1886,,,COGENT SOC SCI,Cogent Soc.

A combined spatial analysis of the stable isotope composition of groundwater, surface water, and precipitation could help to understand groundwater sources and recharge processes. In this study, we collected 297 groundwater and stream water samples across Ethiopia and analyzed them for the oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios. The isotope data were then interpolated into isoscapes for the entire country using the Cokriging method based on their spatial autocorrelation and covariance with elevation, annual mean precipitation, and temperature. These are the first groundwater and stream isoscapes for Ethiopia. By comparing the spatial isotopic distribution of the two water resources with local precipitation, we showed distinct groundwater recharge patterns in different regions in terms of their water sources, timing, seasonality, and the degree of surface and groundwater interaction. We found that the groundwater recharge was generally biased towards the main rainy season. However, in the relatively dry southeastern Ethiopia, groundwater could receive significant input from infrequent high-intensity rainfalls associated with tropical cyclones, but additional precipitation and groundwater isotope data are needed to further test our hypothesis in this data-poor region. Overall, this study has largely expanded the spatial coverage of water stable isotope data and filled significant data gaps in Ethiopia, which could be used to provide vital information in the arid and semi-arid parts of the country where water resources are critical in climate change adaptation strategies.","[Bedaso, Zelalem; Wu, Shuang-Ye] Univ Dayton, Dept Geol, 300 Coll Pk, Dayton, OH 45469 USA",University of Dayton,"Bedaso, Z (corresponding author), Univ Dayton, Dept Geol, 300 Coll Pk, Dayton, OH 45469 USA.",zbedaso1@udayton.edu,,"Bedaso, Zelalem/0000-0002-7844-3288",University of Dayton Research Council [IGRU02],University of Dayton Research Council,This project was partly supported by the University of Dayton Research Council Seed Grant #IGRU02.

In this study, expert opinions according to their expertise in hydrology, ecology, and sociology were surveyed and compared in terms of (1) recognition and ranking of hydrological ecosystem services (HESs) and (2) willingness to pay for HESs. The decision-making process was also investigated, specifically the rankings of factors in experts' plans for climate change adaptation. The experts' recognition of and opinions concerning HESs were positively correlated at various levels with intention to pay (i.e., whether respondents were willing to pay for HESs). Most experts recognized the importance of HESs and allocated high average scores of 9.15, 8.17, and 8.41 to water yield, sediment export, and nutrient export, respectively, using a scale from 1 (least important) to 10 (most important). The percentage of sociologists (100%) exhibited greater intention to pay than those of hydrologists (70%) and ecologists (93%), respectively. Experts prioritized environmental impact over economic cost in policy decision-making, and they differed significantly by field in terms of their rankings of the functional, economic, environmental, and social considerations of decision-making. The results revealed significant differences among experts in their decision-making preferences according to their fields of knowledge. The experts of a specific study field may be more willing to pay for that than for another.

Often considered a pristine and isolated region, the Southern Ocean is becoming increasingly more affected by the impacts of climate change. The legal framework governing fisheries and protecting the marine environment of the Southern Ocean is both global and regional. On the global level, most of the waters around Antarctica fall under the high seas regime of the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), although seven states have asserted a claim to the territorial sea adjacent to their Antarctic territories under the Antarctic Treaty. On a regional level, the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) manages fisheries. As climate change will inevitably have impacts on the Southern Ocean, it is important to assess how the current legal framework addresses this issue. The recommendations for climate change adaptation given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are threefold: international cooperation, precautionary approach and ecosystem approach. By evaluating the extent to which these recommendations have been implemented in the global and regional legal frameworks, the flexibility and resilience to tackle climate change of the provisions can be assessed. On the global level, specific provisions from UNCLOS and the Fish Stock Agreement (FSA) provide for both the precautionary and ecosystem approaches. Regionally, CCAMLR has shown to be at the forefront in integrating the precautionary and ecosystem approaches in fishery management, providing an example of sustainable adaptation strategies for other Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs).","[Wendebourg, Mara R.] Kings Coll London, Dickson Poon Sch Law, Somerset House East Wing, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; King's College London,"Wendebourg, MR (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Dickson Poon Sch Law, Somerset House East Wing, London WC2R 2LS, England.",mara.wendebourg@kcl.ac.uk,,"Wendebourg, Mara/0000-0002-6104-5945",,,,,55,9,9,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

More than a decade after the Least Developed Countries Fund approved adaptation funds for 18 countries in 2003, it is possible to take the stock of investment data and to test empirically whether equity and efficiency have been factored into adaptation investment decision-making. To evaluate equity, one must determine if resources were distributed to areas of greatest need. Vulnerability assessments provide information on the global distribution of the need for adaptation. To evaluate efficiency, one must compare cost and benefit of an investment. Although it is difficult to assess ex-ante the cost and benefit of investment strategies, it is possible to measure efficient use of expenditures with readiness assessment, as a metric of capacity to deploy adaptation resources. We used vulnerability and readiness measures of the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative (ND-GAIN) Country Index as proxies of equity and efficiency. This article quantitatively interrogates-through the lens of public fund allocation-the roles of vulnerability and readiness in shaping adaptation investment decisions. Our findings suggest that countries facing increasing impacts from climate change have received more adaptation investments from international sources than countries with less vulnerability. Further, international investments also preferentially flow to countries that are more ready to deploy adaptation resources. Since the most vulnerable countries are likely to be less ready for investment, our findings support the efforts to improve the investment potential of the most vulnerable countries by investing first to enhance their readiness, in order to unlock adaptation solutions.","[Chen, Chen; Regan, Patrick] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame Global Adaptat Initiat, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Chen, Chen] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame Initiat Global Dev, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Chen, Chen] 1400 East Angela Blvd, South Bend, IN 46617 USA; [Hellmann, Jessica] Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Berrang-Ford, Lea] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Noble, Ian] Australian Natl Univ, Climate Change Inst, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Regan, Patrick] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Polit Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; McGill University; Australian National University; University of Notre Dame,"Chen, C (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame Global Adaptat Initiat, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.;Chen, C (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame Initiat Global Dev, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.;Chen, C (corresponding author), 1400 East Angela Blvd, South Bend, IN 46617 USA.",cchen8@nd.edu,,,,,,,118,26,27,4,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

In this context, efficient management of water resources emerges as a critical issue. This requires the adoption of technological innovations, investment in infrastructure, adequate institutional arrangements, and informed decision makers. To understand farmers' perceptions and their implementation of climate change adaptation strategies with regards to water management, primary information was captured in the Limari and Maule river basins in Chile. Farmers identified stressors for agriculture; climate change, droughts, and lack of water appeared as the most relevant stressors compared to others productive, economic, and institutional factors; revealing a rising relevance of climate related factors. While most producers perceived climate changes in recent years (92.9 %), a significant proportion (61.1 %) claim to have experienced drought, whereas only a fraction (31.9 %) have implemented a strategy to deal with this situation. Identified actions were classified in four groups: investments for water accumulation, modernization of irrigation systems, rationalization of water use, and partnership activities. Using a multinomial logit model these strategies were related to socioeconomic and productive characteristics. Results show that gender and farm size are relevant for investments, implementation and improvement of irrigation systems. For all the strategies described, access to weather information was a relevant element. The study provides empirical evidence of a recent increase in the importance assigned to climate factors by producers and adaptation options that can be supported by agricultural policy.","[Roco, Lisandro] Univ Catolica Maule, Fac Agr & Forestry, Dept Forestry, POB 617,Ave San Miguel 3605, Talca, Chile; [Poblete, David] Univ Valparaiso, Sch Civil Engn, Valparaiso, Chile; [Meza, Francisco] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Agron & Ingn Forestal, Dept Ecosistemas & Medioambiente, Ctr Interdisciplinario Cambio Global, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Catolica del Maule; Universidad de Valparaiso; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Roco, L (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Maule, Fac Agr & Forestry, Dept Forestry, POB 617,Ave San Miguel 3605, Talca, Chile.",lroco@ucm.cl,"Meza, Francisco J/F-9297-2014; Poblete, David/GQY-9675-2022; Roco, Lisandro/ABE-7011-2020","Roco, Lisandro/0000-0002-6267-8461; Meza, Francisco/0000-0002-9853-227X; poblete, david/0000-0003-4465-5108",project Support system for decision making to reduce vulnerability in irrigated agriculture facing climate change and variability [D10i1051],project Support system for decision making to reduce vulnerability in irrigated agriculture facing climate change and variability,"This work was developed under the project Support system for decision making to reduce vulnerability in irrigated agriculture facing climate change and variability, code No D10i1051, founded by FONDEF Chile and implemented by Centro Interdisciplinario de Cambio Global UC.

The SPEI and SDI at different time scales are assessed both at the entire Jialing River basin and at the regional levels of the three sub basins. The results show that the SPEI and SDI are very suitable for assessing the changes and relationships of climatic and hydrological droughts in large basins. Based on the assessment, for the Jialing River basin, climatic and hydrological droughts have the increasing tendency during recent several decades, and the increasing trend of climatic droughts is significant or extremely significant in the western and northern basin, while hydrological drought has a less significant increasing trend. Additionally, climatic and hydrological droughts tend to increase in the next few years. The results also show that on short time scales, climatic droughts have one or two months lag impact on hydrological droughts in the north-west area of the basin, and have one month lag impact in south-east area of the basin.

The accumulated knowledge and experience can be organized and assessed to foster further research and better practise. Two greenwall types provide the analytic framework based on plant growth form as the overarching criterion, namely the mechanically-dependent climber (CGW) and mechanically-independent herb-shrub (HGW). The intrinsic and extrinsic wall factors, subsumed under structural, surface, dimension, geometry, location, and ambience, determine the vertical-habitat foundation to receive vegetation. The comprehensive greenwall design factors provide a structured assessment. CGW has four design factors, including climbing, air gap, substrate, and vegetation. The more elaborate HGW has five design factors, including substrate, container, air gap, water-nutrient, and vegetation. With justifications related to existing state of classification and terminology, a triple-criteria greenwall classification scheme is proposed. Adopting the key criteria of training-system and wall toe substrate, CGW are split into 16 subtypes. For HGW, the substrate-system and elevated-substrate criteria identify 8 subtypes. The representative CGW and HGW subtypes are depicted in concise diagrams. The systematic classification can inform greenwall designers to determine and plan for the preferred subtype. The pros and cons of CGW and HGW are compared based on 35 key designs and management issues to optimize matching greenwall choice with expectation, preference, and site potentials and limitations. The findings provide practical hints to enhance greenwall management. The greenwall nomenclature package is recommended to facilitate scientific communication. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This has implications for both equity and effectiveness, because shared responsibility assumes that individuals have capacity and that the decisions they make will not conflict with other public values. This article explores how law assigns responsibility for climate adaptation by examining its approach to a specific climate impact in Australia: the increasing frequency and severity of bushfire. Australia faces heightened bushfire risk from the interplay of climate change effects and demographic shifts. While planning laws attempt to limit exposure of new communities to fire risks, adapting existing communities involves hazard mitigation across the landscape, through fuel reduction - accomplished by controlled burning or clearing of brush and timber - and the construction of fuel breaks. Most Australian jurisdictions impose some form of obligation on land managers or owners to mitigate fire risk. However, the effectiveness of shifting responsibility onto individual landholders, measured in terms of bushfire risk mitigation, is not established. The shifting of responsibility also has implications for equity because shared responsibility for fire management assumes that individuals know what must be done and have the capacity to do it themselves or pay others to. The law also privileges bushfire protection above other public values, including the protection of biodiversity and cultural values. To account for the complexity of adaptation decision-making, bushfire mitigation laws should avoid creating inequities and should include mechanisms for resolving trade-offs between competing values.","[McDonald, Jan; McCormack, Phillipa C.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Law, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [McCormack, Phillipa C.] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide Law Sch, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Tasmania; University of Adelaide,"McDonald, J (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Law, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",jan.mcdonald@utas.edu.au; phillipa.mccormack@adelaide.edu.au,"McCormack, Phillipa/GYA-3008-2022; McCormack, Phillipa C/N-3668-2017","McCormack, Phillipa C/0000-0001-6751-8291",,,,,112,1,1,0,1,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1878-6553,1878-6561,,CLIM LAW,Clim.

Recent revelations of the extent of the current and potential climate impact in this realm such as with the quality of water, the structure of the coasts, and the potential and witnessed impact on the built infrastructure give these political authorities impetus to minimize their vulnerability and plan for the future. In fact, a growing number of subnational government bodies in the United States have initiated climate adaptation planning efforts; these initiatives emphasize an array of climate impacts, but at different scales, scopes, and levels of sophistication. Meanwhile, the current body of climate adaptation literature has not taken a comprehensive look at these plans nor have they questioned what prompts local adaptation planning, at what scope and scale action is being taken, or what prioritizes certain policy responses over others. This paper presents a case-based analysis of seven urban climate adaptation planning initiatives, drawing from a review of publicly available planning documents and interviews with stakeholders directly involved in the planning process to provide a preliminary understanding of these issues. The paper also offers insight into the state of implementation of adaptation strategies, highlighting the role of low upfront costs and cobenefits with issues already on the local agenda in prompting anticipatory adaptation.","[Poyar, Kyle Andrew; Beller-Simms, Nancy] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Climate Program Off, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Poyar, Kyle Andrew] Oak Ridge Associated Univ, Oak Ridge, TN USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Poyar, KA (corresponding author), Brown Univ, 69 Brown St,Box 5254, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",poyar.kyle@gmail.com,,,,,,,42,10,11,2,13,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1948-8327,1948-8335,,WEATHER CLIM SOC,Weather Clim.

This article explores the initial phase of organizing for climate adaptation in Boston, Massachusetts, examining how multiple actors, including business, government, and community organization, are interacting as they attempt to comprehend, assess, and act on this issue. To understand this process of organizing, we develop the concept of risk regime' as a contingently stabilized system with governance, economic, and discursive dimensions. We draw from theories of risk, organizational resilience, and urban regimes and value regimes to develop the risk regime' framework, which provides a nuanced view of contestation, collaboration, and accommodation among actors with differential interests, knowledge, and influence on the process. We suggest how the character, evolution, and stabilization of the regime is influenced by competing imaginaries regarding, for example, the nature and manageability of risk, the need for radical change, and the role of markets versus regulations in addressing tensions between economic and sustainability goals. We demonstrate that the regime for adaptation has grown out of the organizational and discursive infrastructure for addressing climate mitigation, or carbon control, but that the unique character of adaptation presents different, and perhaps more difficult challenges.","[Wissman-Weber, Nichole K.] Univ Massachusetts, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Levy, David L.] Univ Massachusetts, Management, Boston, MA 02125 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,"Wissman-Weber, NK (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Coll Management, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",nichole.weber001@umb.edu,,,,,,,65,10,10,3,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1350-5084,1461-7323,,ORGANIZATION,Organization,JUL,2018,25,4,,,SI,,491,516,,10.1177/1350508418775812,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1350508418775812,,,26,Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GO0GZ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000439604800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Beyond formal adaptation infrastructure like insurance and public disaster support programmes, it can be difficult to identify the role that informal social capital-such as relationships, trust, and mutual support between community members-plays in climate adaptation. Drawing on a multi-site qualitative study in the Canadian Prairie region, this paper examines how three forms of social capital (bonding, bridging, and linking) shape rural communities' adaptation to climate extremes. Based on in-depth interviews with 163 community members, the findings demonstrate how social capital contributes to adaptive capacity, particularly in rural areas where more formal supports may be absent or lacking. We examine how social capital is affected by existing socio-economic sensitivities, such as rural depopulation, which can reduce informal social capital while simultaneously increasing people's dependence on it. The findings indicate the strengths and limitations of bonding and bridging social capital, particularly in the face of future climate extremes that may exceed local adaptive capacity. Further, we find that informal social capital may also reinforce gender inequality, exclusion, and inter-group differences, indicating its limitations for socially inclusive adaptation. Addressing these structural factors can help communities move past coping and toward long-term adaptation. In the face of increasing climate risks, our findings suggest the importance of public supports that are attentive to local strengths, gaps, and social relations.","[Fletcher, Amber J.; Akwen, Nancy Sah; Diaz, Harry P.] Univ Regina, Dept Sociol & Social Studies, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [Hurlbert, Margot] Univ Regina, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, Regina, SK, Canada",University of Regina; University of Regina,"Fletcher, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Regina, Dept Sociol & Social Studies, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.",Amber.Fletcher@uregina.ca; Nancy.Sah.Akwen@uregina.ca; Margot.Hurlbert@uregina.ca; Hany.Diaz@uregina.ca,,"Fletcher, Amber/0000-0001-5965-2925",International Development Research Council (IDRC) [106372-008],International Development Research Council (IDRC),"Funding for this research was provided by the International Development Research Council (IDRC), grant number 106372-008.",,68,10,10,3,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Consequently, semi-arid and dry areas have been identified as vulnerable land, requiring attention from both science and policy perspectives. In some regions, such as the Mediterranean region, land degradation is particularly intense, although there are no extreme ecological conditions. In these contexts, a wide range of formal and informal responses is necessary to face particularly complex and spatially differentiated territorial processes. However, the fit of responses has been demonstrated to be different over time and space according to the underlying socioeconomic context and the specific ecological conditions. The present commentary discusses this sort of entropy in the policy response to land degradation in Southern Europe, outlining the intrinsic complexity of human-nature dynamics at the base of such processes. Reflecting the need of differentiated regional strategies and more specific national measures to combat desertification, three policy frameworks (agro-environmental, economic, social) with an indirect impact on fighting land degradation have been considered, delineating the importance of policy assemblages. Finally, the importance of policy impact assessment methodologies was highlighted, focusing on the possible responses reinforcing a continental strategy against land degradation. By evidencing the role of participatory planning, developmental policies indirectly addressing land degradation reveal to be an important vector of more specific measures abating desertification risk, creating, in turn, a favorable context for direct interventions of mitigation or adaptation to climate change.","[Halbac-Cotoara-Zamfir, Rares] Politehn Univ Timisoara, Dept Overland Commun Ways Fdn & Cadastral Survey, 1 AI Curea St, Timisoara 300224, Romania; [Smiraglia, Daniela] Italian Inst Environm Protect & Res ISPRA, Via Vitaliano Brancati 48, I-00144 Rome, Italy; [Quaranta, Giovanni; Salvia, Rosanna] Univ Basilicata, Dept Math Comp Sci & Econ, Via Ateneo Lucano 10, I-85100 Potenza, Italy; [Salvati, Luca] Univ Macerata, Dept Econ & Law, Via Armaroli 43, I-62100 Macerata, Italy; [Gimenez-Morera, Antonio] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Econ & Ciencias Sociales, Cami Vera S-N, ES-46022 Valencia, Spain",Polytechnic University of Timisoara; Italian Institute for Environmental Protection & Research (ISPRA); University of Basilicata; University of Macerata; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Smiraglia, D (corresponding author), Italian Inst Environm Protect & Res ISPRA, Via Vitaliano Brancati 48, I-00144 Rome, Italy.",rares.halbac-cotoara-zamfir@upt.ro; daniela.smiraglia@isprambiente.it; giovanni.quaranta@unibas.it; rosanna.salvia@unibas.it; luca.salvati@unimc.it; angimo1@doctor.upv.es,"salvia, rosanna/H-8017-2019; Salvati, Luca/AAS-6179-2021; Halbac-Cotoara-Zamfir, Rares/E-3429-2012; Smiraglia, Daniela/O-2429-2016","salvia, rosanna/0000-0003-0349-781X; Halbac-Cotoara-Zamfir, Rares/0000-0002-3766-6493; Smiraglia, Daniela/0000-0002-0427-248X; Quaranta, Giovanni/0000-0002-3509-4807",,,,,149,14,15,1,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2020,12,20,,,,,,,8313,10.3390/su12208313,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12208313,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OI1XV,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000583081200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The impact of changing climate threatens rainfed food production as well as the food security of millions of people in the tropics and subtropics. The Government of India initiated Watershed Development Programmes (WDPs) for the overall development of these areas. We, therefore, established a comprehensive, location-specific, bottom-up tool to analyse and compare the climate vulnerability of watershed areas. For this, we deducted a new Climate Vulnerability Index for Rainfed Tropics (CVIRFT) to evaluate the potential effectiveness of programmes to adapt to climate change impacts. The CVIRFT comprises of three dimensions of vulnerability, i.e., adaptive capacity, exposure and sensitivity. These dimensions consist of ten major components and 59 indicators with emphasis on rainfed farming and WDP interventions. To test the tool, we collected primary data through household surveys (n = 215, split among three watershed communities) in Kerala. We show that there were strong variations in the exposure dimension, moderate in sensitivity and negligible in adaptive capacity across the watersheds. After analysing the major components under the dimensions, we suggest focusing on policy orientation towards redesigning of the WDPs with emphasis to economic diversification, livelihood strategies, social networking coupled with stakeholder participation, natural resource management and risk spread through credit and insurance flexibility. The CVIRFT is replicable to similar physio-geographic areas of rainfed farming, with the refinement of indicators suited to the locality.","[Sathyan, Archana Raghavan; Breuer, Lutz] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Res Ctr Bio Syst Land Use & Nutr iFZ, Inst Landscape Ecol & Resources Management ILR, Heinrich Buff Ring 26-32, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Funk, Christoph] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Stat & Econometr, Licherstr 64, D-35394 Giessen, Germany; [Aenis, Thomas] Humboldt Univ, Extens & Commun Grp, Luisenstr 53, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Breuer, Lutz] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Ctr Int Dev & Environm Res, Senckenbergstr 3, D-35390 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen; Justus Liebig University Giessen; Humboldt University of Berlin; Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Sathyan, AR (corresponding author), Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Res Ctr Bio Syst Land Use & Nutr iFZ, Inst Landscape Ecol & Resources Management ILR, Heinrich Buff Ring 26-32, D-35392 Giessen, Germany.",Raghavan.S.Archana@agrar.uni-giessen.de; Christoph.Funk@wirtschaft.uni-giessen.de; thomas.aenis@agrar.hu-berlin.de; lutz.breuer@umwelt.uni-giessen.de,"Breuer, Lutz/C-6652-2013; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Raghavan Sathyan, Archana/AAY-1991-2021","Breuer, Lutz/0000-0001-9720-1076; Raghavan Sathyan, Archana/0000-0002-7526-4452; Aenis, Thomas/0000-0002-1403-5779; Funk, Christoph/0000-0001-7388-4415","Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, Bonn, Germany [PKZ: 91538032, ST42]; Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, Bonn, Germany","Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, Bonn, Germany(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, Bonn, Germany(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD))","This research was funded by Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, Bonn, Germany, grant number [ST42-for Development-Related Post Graduate Courses, 50,077,057 and PKZ: 91538032] and the APC was funded by [Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, Bonn, Germany].",,98,7,8,1,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2018,10,9,,,,,,,3357,10.3390/su10093357,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10093357,,,27,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GW3DA,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000446770200400,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this study is to evaluate the vulnerability of rural subsistence farmers in Uganda to climate risk. A mixed methods approach used semi-structured and guided interviews, and participatory techniques to explore perception, livelihood response and socio-economic status. Perception of climate risk varied, with wealthier farmers perceiving drought as highest risk, whilst poorer farmers perceived extreme heavy rainfall. Farmers implemented many general livelihood coping and anticipatory responses (54.7 %) to perceived impacts from drought, rainfall variability and extreme heavy rainfall. Examples included food storage, livestock maintenance and planting drought-resistant varieties. Other responses (45.3 %) were specific to individual climatic events, and farmers had no response to cope with rainfall variability. Climate risk was not the only driver of vulnerability. Soil infertility, pests and diseases, and economic instability also sustained decreasing trends in income. Adaptive capacity of households differed with external and internal attributes of sensitivity. Farmers with more land, education, access to governmental extension, a non-farm livelihood, larger households and older age had more capacity to buffer shock through increased assets and entitlements than poorer farmers who were more likely to engage in opportunistic behaviour like casual labouring. Few livelihood responses associated with perceived threat from the climate indicating response to a broader range of stressors. Conclusions determined inequality in livelihood response as a fundamental driver in households' ability to cope and adapt to climate risk.","[Cooper, Sarah Jane] Belgrave Farm Cottage, Wrexham Rd, Chester CH4 9DH, Cheshire, England; [Wheeler, Tim] NERC, Sci & Innovat, Polaris House,North Star Ave, Swindon SN2 1EU, Wilts, England",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC),"Cooper, SJ (corresponding author), Belgrave Farm Cottage, Wrexham Rd, Chester CH4 9DH, Cheshire, England.",sas23x@gmail.com; timler@nerc.ac.uk,,,,,,,90,29,29,3,55,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Based on field observations spanning from 1981 to 2009 at 167 agricultural meteorological stations across China, we found that solar radiation and temperature over the observed maize growth period had decreasing trends during 1981-2009, and maize yields were positively correlated with these climate variables in major production regions. The decreasing trends in solar radiation and temperature during maize growth period were mainly ascribed to the adoption of late maturity cultivars with longer reproductive growth period (RGP). The adoption of late maturing cultivars with longer RGP contributed substantially to grain yield increase during the last three decades. The climate trends during maize growth period varied among different production areas. During 1981-2009, decreases in mean temperature, precipitation and solar radiation over maize growth period jointly reduced yield most by 13.2-17.3% in southwestern China, by contrast in northwestern China increases in mean temperature, precipitation and solar radiation jointly increased yield most by 12.9-14.4%. Our findings highlight that the adaptations of maize production system to climate change through shifts of sowing date and genotypes are underway and should be taken into accounted when evaluating climate change impacts.

It addresses these objectives drawing from secondary data, 367 household surveys and 7 agency interviews. The findings show that about two thirds (63%) of urban residents in the case study area are climate illiterate, and this has affected the slow uptake of nature based solutions as climate management intervention. The urban residents acknowledge the importance of nature based solutions but identify barriers such as poor consideration of the role of natural infrastructure and their incorporation in the planning process, inadequate technical capacity and guidance for incorporating NbS in climate planning, high cost requirements of NbS interventions, disparate interests from various institutions, and a general lack of knowledge, appreciation and interest from urban residents. The study concludes that mainstreaming and upscaling NbS in urban systems will require major investments which should vary from one city to the other depending on perculiar needs.","[Boateng, Emmanuel Adu; Asibey, Michael Osei; Adutwum, Isaac Osei; Blija, Daniel Kwame] KNUST, Coll Art & Built Environm, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana; [Cobbinah, Patrick Brandful] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Melbourne,"Asibey, MO (corresponding author), KNUST, Coll Art & Built Environm, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana.",emmanuelboateng247@gmail.com; asibeymichael@yahoo.com; patrick.cobbinah@unimelb.edu.au; isaacoseiadutwum@gmail.com; danielblija3@gmail.com,,,,,,,42,0,0,8,8,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

SSAs find themselves operating in mature markets characterized by increased competition by larger ski areas and multi-resort ski conglomerates. Due to their smaller size they have strategic disadvantages, which makes precise positioning in the market and added value creation for their customers necessary. This study examines strategies of SSAs by exploring the influence of different governance structures. Using a comparative case study approach to gain an in-depth understanding of strategies of SSAs, this paper examines two SSAs with different governance structures, one in the U.S. and one in Europe. Data gathering includes nineteen in-depth interviews with various stake-holders of both SSAs, archival data, and on-site observations. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis. The findings highlight three core differentiating factors: (1) technology and innovation, (2) market positioning, and (3) communication and collaboration with stakeholders. While both SSAs pursue a differentiation strategy and target similar groups of customers, they apply different segmentation and marketing strategies, climate change adaptation measures, and service offerings. The findings contribute to the development and management of SSAs as they explain different strategies regarding innovation, market positioning and collaboration with stakeholders due to contrasting governance structures and highlight stakeholders' awareness to climate change and sustainability.","[Hetzenauer, Katrin; Pikkemaat, Birgit] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Strateg Management Mkt & Tourism, Innsbruck, Austria; [Albinsson, Pia A.] Appalachian State Univ, Walker Coll Business, Dept Mkt & Supply Chain Management, Boone, NC 28608 USA",University of Innsbruck; University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Albinsson, PA (corresponding author), Appalachian State Univ, Walker Coll Business, Dept Mkt & Supply Chain Management, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",birgit.pikkemaat@uibk.ac.at; albinssonpa@appstate.edu,,"Albinsson, Pia/0000-0002-8591-5191",,,,,63,0,0,3,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-0780,2213-0799,,J OUTDOOR REC TOUR,J.

It shows how plans to enroll fishing communities into programs to adapt to or to slow coastal erosion are based on simplified environmental narratives that rely on global climate change as the main cause of coastal erosion. They discount local processes and local explanations, as well as scientific studies that outline complex multi-scalar explanations for coastal erosion. Government narratives frame global climate change, as manifested in increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes and other hydrometereological extreme events and sea level rise, as the main causes of changes in coastal environments, including coastal erosion They fail to acknowledge other causes including the environmental degradation caused by the influential oil industry. In contrast, fishers' more complex and locally -embedded narratives are shaped by their long-term struggles against the state-owned oil company, whom they hold primarily responsible for coastal erosion in their communities. Scientists similarly emphasize the importance of local and regional processes, with climate change understood primarily as having significant impacts in the future, but less so in the recent past. Differences in temporal and geographical scaling among these narratives highlight the importance of considering how the translation of climate change adaptation programming from the global to diverse local situations would ideally consider site-specific power relations as well as community-based perspectives.","[Vazquez, Luz Maria] York Univ, Sess Fac, Dept Social Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Vandergeest, Peter] York Univ, Fac Environm & Urban Change, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Vandergeest, Peter] York Univ, York Ctr Asian Res, Toronto, ON, Canada",York University - Canada; York University - Canada; York University - Canada,"Vazquez, LM (corresponding author), York Univ, Sess Fac, Dept Social Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada.",lvazquez@yorku.ca; pvander@yorku.ca,,,"Faculty of Graduate Studies, York University, Toronto, Canada","Faculty of Graduate Studies, York University, Toronto, Canada","1 Luz Maria Vazquez, PhD, Sessional Faculty, Department of Social Science, York University, Toronto, Canada.

This study presents a copula-based probabilistic framework for projecting future changes in multivariable drought characteristics through convection-permitting Weather Research and Forecasting simulations with 4-km horizontal grid spacing. A probabilistic multivariate drought index is introduced to examine the joint effects of drought indicators with uncertainty intervals for four major river basins located in South Central Texas of the United States. Markov chain Monte Carlo is used to address uncertainties in assessing copula parameters and in predicting climate-induced changes in hydrological regimes. Our findings reveal that the severity and intensity of drought episodes can be amplified when considering the compound effects of soil moisture and runoff regimes by using the probabilistic multivariate drought index. The South Central Texas region is projected to experience more drought events with shorter duration and higher intensity in a changing climate. The drought severity will not necessarily increase due to the decreasing drought duration. In addition, our findings indicate that the intensity of future droughts is expected to increase as a result of the deficiency of soil moisture even though precipitation extremes are projected to become more frequent. Moreover, climate change impacts on multivariate drought characteristics will intensify with the increasing temporal scales (i.e., short-, medium-, and long-term droughts) although the number of future drought events may decrease by the end of this century.","[Zhang, B.; Wang, S.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Y.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Geosci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Wang, S (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",shuo.s.wang@polyu.edu.hk,"Wang, Shuo/I-3017-2013; Zhang, Boen/GPK-7523-2022","Wang, Shuo/0000-0001-7827-187X; Zhang, Boen/0000-0002-4633-3033",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51809223]; Hong Kong Polytechnic University [1-ZE8S],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hong Kong Polytechnic University(Hong Kong Polytechnic University),"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 51809223) and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University Start-up Grant (grant 1-ZE8S).

In Thailand, the rising sea level exacerbates the vulnerability of coastal communities to changes in geographic conditions seriously affecting communities with low adaptive capacity and mostly dependent on natural resources. This paper identifies the potential vulnerability of coastal fishing communities which are prone to severe sea-level rises, like in the case of Laemsing District in Chanthaburi Province, Thailand. Climate simulation, Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing techniques were applied to quantify potential sea-level change (exposure), inundated areas and affected households (sensitivity). Adaptive capacity was analyzed in terms of social, human, institutional, economic, and natural conditions. Based on A1F1 (the worst case of future greenhouse gas emissions) and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies model EH (GISS-EH) best estimate for 2050, relative sea-level increase from 2000 would be 0.50 m, resulting in a loss of about 87.77 km(2) of land and inundation of 2060 households. Opinions on alleviating vulnerability suggested that each condition of vulnerability is associated with two stages of development, urgent and medium. Laemsing District can face the serious effects of seawater inundation in the future. The results of this paper could be appropriately used as a reference for mainstreaming climate change adaptation into development policies and raising the awareness of stakeholders on how to cope with sea-level change and its impacts.","[Panpeng, Jirawat] Asian Inst Technol, Sch Environm Resources & Dev, Climate Change & Sustainable Dev Program, POB 4, Klongluang 12120, Pathumthani, Thailand; [Ahmad, Mokbul Morshed] Asian Inst Technol, Sch Environm Resources & Dev, Reg & Rural Dev Planning Program, POB 4, Klongluang 12120, Pathumthani, Thailand",Asian Institute of Technology; Asian Institute of Technology,"Panpeng, J (corresponding author), Asian Inst Technol, Sch Environm Resources & Dev, Climate Change & Sustainable Dev Program, POB 4, Klongluang 12120, Pathumthani, Thailand.",jpanpeng54@gmail.com; morshed@ait.asia,"Ahmad, Mokbul Morshed/AAE-5819-2020","Ahmad, Mokbul Morshed/0000-0002-4003-0920",MyCOE/SERVIR Fellowship Program in Southeast Asia,MyCOE/SERVIR Fellowship Program in Southeast Asia,"The authors would like to express sincere thanks to Ed Sarobol and K.R.

Based on a case study of the village of Beidian, located in a drought-prone region in northern China, this study demonstrates that when faced with multiple pressures of regional climate change, drought risk and rural poverty, reasonable adjustments in land use patterns can serve as an effective adaptation strategy in the agricultural sector. We used household questionnaires, in-depth interviews with village managers, and land use surveys at the farming plot level to quantify the relationship between land use change and drought mitigation effects. Our findings indicate that in the past decade, the farming practices in Beidian have transformed from a complete reliance on the winter wheat-summer corn rotation to a new diversified mode of apple as the main crop and corn and coarse cereals as the subsidiary crops. The current farming mode is proven to possess a stronger adaptive capacity to drought due to its higher water-saving efficiency and economic benefit, which facilitates rural poverty reduction and socio-economic development. This study presents a feasible approach to address adaptation strategies at the local level, which provides policymakers with information on how to best support farm-level adaptation and to reduce farmers' vulnerability to climatic extremes within the broader context of climate change.

Ecosystem assessments, particularly the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and the UK National Ecosystem Assessment, have reviewed the benefits that society gains from the natural environment, but they under-represent and undervalue the contribution of geodiversity. Geodiversity underpins and delivers many vital ecosystem services, informs their management and is an important element of natural capital. This includes the application of knowledge of physical processes and evidence from Quaternary archives of recent environmental change to help future-proof ecosystems and their services. Key principles include working with natural processes, based on understanding their spatial and temporal dynamics, and adopting where possible soft engineering practices to enable multiple benefits for nature and society. The ecosystem approach and the need for climate change adaptation require more integrated approaches to geodiversity, biodiversity and landscape conservation and management to enable a more sustainable future. Engaging with these issues will also demonstrate the wider relevance today of geodiversity and geoconservation. Contributing successfully in these critical areas requires closer partnership working, both across the geoscience and geoconservation communities, and with other sectors of nature conservation, policy makers, planners and communities, as well as other disciplines. Geoscience has an essential contribution to make in addressing knowledge gaps recognised in ecosystem assessment and in implementing robust solutions to broader environmental, economic and social issues.

However, the extent to which migration is caused by climate hazards, in contrast or addition to other intervening factors, is a point of debate in literature. In this study, we conducted a systematic literature review to identify and consolidate factors which directly and indirectly influence climate change migration. In our review of the literature, we found a total of 21 economic, environmental, demographic, political, social, and personal intervening decision-making factors which affect climate migration. Causal interactions between these factors were identified using an axial qualitative coding technique called purposive text analysis. By combining causal links, a semi-quantitative causal loop diagram was created that represented factor interaction and feedback within the climate migration system. Using this model, we highlight influential feedback loops and point to how intervention strategies may cause downstream effects. This research helps to address calls for a better understanding of the complex decision-making dynamics in climate migration. In particular, results from our causal feedback loops show that intervention strategies targeted toward economic factors such as financial capital and livelihoods, as well as food security, would have the greatest impact in assisting climate-affected communities. These results help inform climate migration policy and aid planners in the future to better understand the interconnected system of factors that lead to the emergent outcome of climate migration.This article is categorized under:Vulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change > Learning from Cases and AnalogiesThe Social Status of Climate Change Knowledge > Climate Science and Decision Making","[Nabong, Emily C.; Hocking, Lauren; Opdyke, Aaron] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Walters, Jeffrey P.] Univ Washington Tacoma, Tacoma, WA USA",University of Sydney; University of Washington; University of Washington Tacoma,"Nabong, EC (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",emily.nabong@sydney.edu.au,,,Sydney Southeast Asia Centre,Sydney Southeast Asia Centre,"The authors would like to acknowledge the Sydney Southeast Asia Centre for their support of this research.

Using case studies mostly from Narok County and reviewing the increasingly rich literature on pastoralism and conservation in East Africa, we show that pastoralists employ three main strategies to adapt their livelihood systems: intensification (changes in land use systems to increase productivity per hectare); extensification (through territorial expansion into unoccupied areas or territories of neighbouring communities in our cases); and diversification (the combination of pastoralism with other livelihood strategies, mainly farming, conservation, tourism, business and wage jobs, often through migration to small towns or urban centres). Maasai communities have been quick to adopt these strategies, individually or in combination, in order to overcome ecological and socio-economic stress and to pursue opportunities as they arise. Since these strategies are generally compatible with extensive pastoralism, this land use will continue to play a key role in sustaining the livelihoods of people living in semi-arid and arid rangelands. However, when intensification and diversification through the adoption of ranching and farming occur, the rangeland becomes fragmented, with severe impacts on wildlife. In such cases, incentives for sustaining conservation and wildlife tourism will need to increase to compensate land holders for foregoing these more intensive land uses, thus moving towards reconciliation of ecological sustainability and strengthened livelihoods. These findings are illuminated by Gunderson and Holling's (2002) panarchy model and its nested adaptive cycles, where resilience is achieved by providing for change through loosening and reorganising connections between elements in the system.","[Pollini, Jacques] McGill Univ, Maasai Pastoral Soc, I CAN Project, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Galaty, John G.] McGill Univ, Anthropol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Galaty, John G.] Canadian African Studies Assoc, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Galaty, John G.] McGill Assoc Univ Teachers, Res Project Pastoral Property & Poverty PPP, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Galaty, John G.] McGill Assoc Univ Teachers, Inst Canopy Conservat Partnership Project I CAN, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University; McGill University,"Pollini, J (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Maasai Pastoral Soc, I CAN Project, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",jacques.pollini2@mcgill.ca; john.galaty@mcgill.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; International Development Research Centre,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); International Development Research Centre,"We acknowledge the support of the partnership project on `the institutional canopy of conservation', funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the International Development Research Centre; collaboration with partners in research sites, including Ramson Karmushu and Mali Olekaunga at IMPACT in Laikipia and Samburu, Simon Maison Tongoyo and Stanley Kimaren Riamit at ILEPA in Narok, and Samson Ole Silantoi, Lampat Parashina, and John Kamanga at SORALO in Narok and Kajiado Counties; andthe ongoing support of McGill University, including the assistance of Kariuki Kirigia, a doctoral student on the project, for insights and field collaboration in Narok, and of Eliana Miskey and the Arts Research Internship Awards (ARIA) programme for preparation of the map",,82,3,3,2,11,WHITE HORSE PRESS,ISLE OF HARRIS,"1 STROND, ISLE OF HARRIS HS5 3UD, ENGLAND",0822-7942,1752-2366,,NOMAD PEOPLES,Nomad.

MOENCH; SWEET SORGHUM; ANAEROBIC-DIGESTION; BIOENERGY; MAIZE,"The experiments comprised three vegetation periods of five sorghum varieties. Novel data on the development of biomass yield, maturity level and biogas production were gained. Dry matter (DM) biomass yield ranged between 15.7 and 20.67 t ha(-1) when sorghumwas grown as main crop. The variety SOR 4 achieved a methane yield of 6500 m(3) ha(-1). The suitability of different sorghum varieties as summer catch crops was measured and assessed by combining growing degree days (GDD; temperatures > 10 degrees C) and maturity stage. This paper introduces a correlation of yields in course of the vegetation period with GDD values which enables to transfer yield and economic efficiency predictions from present results to other sites. Sorghum is able to provide high-yields when used as catch crop, whereby an adapted varietal selection is indispensable. The sorghum variety SOR 2 (year2) of 1100 growing degree days (GDD) proofed to be fast ripening and is especially suitable as a summer catch crop. This variety achieved mean DM yields of 12.4 t ha(-1) when used as summer catch crop. Within this study crop maturities between 20 and 45% DM were investigated. Within this range, no decrease in specific methane yield with the increase in maturity and DM yield was observed. The three year experimental data also included one year with low precipitation. The statistical analysis did not reveal a significant influence of the precipitation on the biomass yield which confirms the drought resistance of sorghum. This result is especially important in view of adaptation to climate change. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - Conceptually, the approach follows the definition of vulnerability as used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, but it has modified this basic concept. It clearly distinguishes between three time slices (presence, near and remote future) not only regarding the change in the climatic conditions but also socio-economic development trends. Findings - The paper concentrates on the selected methodological framework, the collaborative research design and those preliminary results of the nationwide vulnerability assessment that are transferable to other settings. Practical implications - A Vulnerability Network (Netzwerk Vulnerabilitaet) emerged from an applied research project commissioned under the Adaptation Action Plan of the German Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety and the Federal Environment Agency. The assessment serves as evidence basis for the implementation of the German Adaptation Strategy. Thus, all relevant federal authorities and agencies are represented in the Vulnerability Network. Originality/value - The approach is the first really integrative vulnerability assessment for the whole Germany, as it considers not only 16 sectors but also interconnections between these sectors and cumulative effects for three different time slices. Moreover, the normative component of the assessment was clearly separated from the analytic one. The Vulnerability Network as a whole has been responsible for all normative decisions to be taken during the assessment procedure thus ensuring a wide understanding and acceptance of commonly achieved results.","[Greiving, Stefan; Fleischhauer, Mark; Lindner, Christian; Lueckenkoetter, Johannes] Plan Risk Consult, Dortmund, Germany; [Zebisch, Marc; Schneiderbauer, Stefan] EURAC Res, Inst Appl Remote Sensing, Bolzano, Italy; [Buth, Mareike; Kahlenborn, Walter] Adelphi Consult GmbH, Berlin, Germany; [Schauser, Inke] Umweltbundesamt, KomPass, Dessau, Germany",European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano,"Greiving, S (corresponding author), Plan Risk Consult, Dortmund, Germany.",stefan.greiving@tu-dortmund.de,"Zebisch, Marc/GQQ-9291-2022; Schneiderbauer, Stefan/E-8662-2017","Schneiderbauer, Stefan/0000-0001-7587-849X; Zebisch, Marc/0000-0002-3530-7219",German Federal Environmental Agency [Z 6 - 50 205 5/10],German Federal Environmental Agency,The work was conducted within the project Netzwerk Vulnerabilitat (Z 6 - 50 205 5/10) funded by the German Federal Environmental Agency.,,42,13,13,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Herein, the authors present a technique that extends the latitudinal projections of the 2D atmospheric model of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Integrated Global System Model (IGSM) by applying longitudinally resolved patterns from observations, and from climate model projections archived from exercises carried out for the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The method maps the IGSM zonal means across longitude using a set of transformation coefficients, and this approach is demonstrated in application to near-surface air temperature and precipitation, for which high-quality observational datasets and model simulations of climate change are available. The current climatology of the transformation coefficients is observationally based. To estimate how these coefficients may alter with climate, the authors characterize the climate models' spatial responses, relative to their zonal mean, from transient increases in trace-gas concentrations and then normalize these responses against their corresponding transient global temperature responses. This procedure allows for the construction of metaensembles of regional climate outcomes, combining the ensembles of the MIT IGSM-which produce global and latitudinal climate projections, with uncertainty, under different global climate policy scenarios-with regionally resolved patterns from the archived IPCC climate model projections. This hybridization of the climate model longitudinal projections with the global and latitudinal patterns projected by the IGSM can, in principle, be applied to any given state or flux variable that has the sufficient observational and model-based information.","[Schlosser, C.

Changes in water table depth and surface water coverage affect natural and cultivated vegetation, wildlife, and people. Here, we describe groundwater dynamics and water-body expansion in a 10-year flooding cycle in the valuable agricultural lands of Western Pampas. We analysed water-table depth, surface water coverage, and rainfall from 1996 to 2005 covering similar to 28 000 km(2). We characterized the dynamics of water storage based on groundwater observations and remote sensing estimates of the coverage (LANDSAT) and elevation (ENVISAT) of water bodies as well as water storage anomalies captured by the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE). Surface water coverage fluctuated from 3 to 28% and groundwater levels displayed a similar to 2.5 m change. Regional water storage raised by similar to 800 mm with 63% of this water accretion accounted by groundwater. Ground and surface water dynamics were closely coupled but this link differed between lowlands and highlands and depending on whether the system was at the gaining or retraction stage. This asymmetrical behaviour was likely caused by shifts in regional connectivity. Regional surface + groundwater storage compared well with water storage anomalies obtained from GRACE, suggesting that this tool may represent a methodological shortcut to estimate water storage changes. The tight connection between ground and surface water, and the relatively slow process of cumulative water accretion and coalescence of water bodies that precedes flood events offer the opportunity of developing warning systems that could help land managers to adapt to climate changes.

We examine the effects of climate variability and change on corn yields in the Southeast United States using a regional climate model nested within a global climate model (GCM) simulation of the equilibrium atmospheric CO2 concentration of 540 ppm. In addition to a climate scenario with normal variance, we modify the GCM outputs to simulate a scenario with a highly variable climate. We find that climate variability poses a serious challenge to the abilities of farmers and their supporting institutions to adapt. Consistently lower corn yields, especially in the scenario with a highly variable climate, illustrate that farmers' abilities to make informed choices about their cropping decisions can be constrained by their inabilities to exit from their current technological regimes or path dependence. We also incorporate farmers' responses to climate change using three adaptation scenarios: no adaptation, perfect knowledge, and a scenario that mimics diffusion of knowledge across the landscape. Regardless of adaptation scenario and variance structure, the most common result is a decline in corn production to the point where yield reductions of 1 percent to 20 percent occur across 60 percent to 80 percent of the region. The advantage of the perfect knowledge adaptation scenario declines through time compared to the diffusion-process adaptation scenario. We posit that the cost of path dependence to farmers, in the form of yield reductions, is likely unavoidable because the inherent variability of the climate system will result in adaptation choices that will be suboptimal for some years.","[Chhetri, Netra B.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning & Consortium Sci Po, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Easterling, William E.] Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Terando, Adam] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Biol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Mearns, Linda] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Mearns, Linda] Inst Study Soc & Environm, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; North Carolina State University; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Chhetri, NB (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning & Consortium Sci Po, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",Netra.Chhetri@asu.edu; billeasterling@psu.edu; adam_terando@ncsu.edu; lindam@ucar.edu,,"Terando, Adam/0000-0002-9280-043X",,,,,34,44,44,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-5608,1467-8306,,ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR,Ann.

However, climate change threats to water resources are similar for both climatic regions. Therefore, this article discusses water dimensions, security, and governance for these different regions, i.e., non-arid Canada and arid Qatar, that distinctly respond to their water-related challenges. Limitations of the article include lesser water-related literature availability for Qatar than for Canada. Canada's water resources appear vulnerable to climate change as it is projected to face >0.6 degrees C above the global average of 1.6 degrees C for the 20th-century temperature. Qatar is extremely vulnerable to dust storms, and rising sea levels, with the maximum temperature approaching 50 degrees C during the summer, and flooding during the winter. The sustainable use of water resources needs to address social, economic, political, climate change, and environmental dimensions of water. Other than climate change impacts and high per capita consumption of water, Qatar faces challenges of a rise in population (similar to 29 million as of now), acute shortage of freshwater from rainfall (similar to 80 mm per annum), high evapotranspiration (similar to 95% of the total rainfall), depletion of groundwater, and low agricultural productivity due to infertile lands and water scarcity, all leading to food insecurity. The sustainable use of water resources requires improved regulations for water governance and management. Comparisons of water sustainability issues, dimensions, security, and governance facilitate discussions to improve water governance structures for resource sustainability, food security, and climate change adaptability, and show how one country could learn from the experiences of the other.","[Abbas, Farhat] Univ Doha Sci & Technol, Coll Engn Technol, POB 24449, Doha, Qatar; [Al-Naemi, Salem] Univ Doha Sci & Technol, Off President, POB 24449, Doha, Qatar; [Farooque, Aitazaz A.] Univ Prince Edward Isl, Fac Sustainable Design Engn, Charlottetown, PE C1A 4P3, Canada; [Farooque, Aitazaz A.] Univ Prince Edward Isl, Canadian Ctr Climate Change & Adaptat, St Peters Bay, PE C0A 2A0, Canada; [Phillips, Michael] Univ Doha Sci & Technol, Directorate Appl Res Innovat & Econ Dev, POB 24449, Doha, Qatar",University of Prince Edward Island; University of Prince Edward Island,"Abbas, F (corresponding author), Univ Doha Sci & Technol, Coll Engn Technol, POB 24449, Doha, Qatar.",farhat.abbas@udst.edu.qa,,,"Directorate of Applied Research, Innovation and Economic Development, University of Doha for Science and Technology-Qatar","Directorate of Applied Research, Innovation and Economic Development, University of Doha for Science and Technology-Qatar","Support from the Directorate of Applied Research, Innovation and Economic Development, University of Doha for Science and Technology-Qatar is highly appreciated.",,154,0,0,15,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JAN,2023,15,1,,,,,,,208,10.3390/w15010208,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15010208,,,20,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,7R3AR,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000909948700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, existing datasets are currently fragmented, incomplete, and partial in their coverage. This study presents results from a more comprehensive, granular, and descriptive attempt to compile a dataset of global funding patterns on energy and climate research. To do so, it identified 114,201 potential projects funded by 154 research councils across 17 countries and the European Commission from 1990 to 2020 (with projected funding up until 2026). A smaller sample of 1000 illustrative projects were examined in greater detail. It finds that there are difficulties with accessible and available public data, including an inaccuracy of data on published websites or inadequate tracking and updating of project details. Research on energy and climate change is supported by a surprisingly broad base of inquiry, including research from the social sciences and economics but also the arts and humanities, engineering and technology, life sciences and medicine, and natural and physical sciences. Climate change adaptation research is the most funded general area, followed by climate mitigation via energy systems, transportation and mobility, geo/climate engineering, and industrial decarbonization. Funding has been allocated unevenly in favor of some specific technologies, e.g. resilience and adaption, energy efficiency, and electric vehicles. Publicly funded research benefits a very particular set of disciplines, e.g. communication studies, economics, computer science, and chemical engineering. Moreover, the funded projects reveal a striking diversity of methods, including literature reviews, surveys and original data collection, the development of intellectual property, case studies, qualitative research and energy modeling.","[Sovacool, Benjamin K.; Daniels, Chux; AbdulRafiu, Abbas] Univ Sussex Business Sch, Sci Policy Res Unit, Falmer, England",,"Sovacool, BK (corresponding author), Univ Sussex Business Sch, Sci Policy Res Unit, Falmer, England.",benjaminso@hih.au.dk,"Abbas, Abdul/GZG-9848-2022","Abbas, Abdul/0000-0003-2682-0616; Daniels, Chux/0000-0002-5179-4176","Industrial Decarbonisation Research and Innovation Centre (IDRIC) in the United Kingdom - UKRI; EPSRC [EP/V027050/1]; Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF), Nigeria [POSS7924897311]","Industrial Decarbonisation Research and Innovation Centre (IDRIC) in the United Kingdom - UKRI; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF), Nigeria","The authors thank and acknowledge support for this paper from the Industrial Decarbonisation Research and Innovation Centre (IDRIC) in the United Kingdom, funded by the UKRI and EPSRC via Grant Number EP/V027050/1 and the Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF), Nigeria via award POSS7924897311.

These perspectives remain dominant, particularly in policy and media circles, despite academic critique and the recent emergence of more diverse approaches. In this intervention, we contribute to the recent turn in environmental migration research by seeking to better ground and pluralize our understanding of how environmental change and human mobility relate. We do so by offering a mobilities perspective that centers on the practices, motives, and experiences of mobility and immobility in the context of environmental change: When and why do people decide to move-or not to move-in response to environmental changes? How do they cope with migration pressures? Where do they move, under what conditions, and who can or must stay behind? This approach attends to the diverse aspirations and differential capabilities that underlie particular practices of movement or nonmovement, reflecting both individual characteristics as well as interconnections with uneven power relations across local, regional, and global scales. A mobilities approach offers a starting point for an expanded research agenda on environmental im/mobilities. This enables academic analysis and policy discussion of the human (im)mobility-environmental change nexus to become better attuned to the actual practice and heterogeneous needs of those affected.

These case studies were chosen to explore the conditions for emergence of adaptive governance in heavily regulated and developed social-ecological systems nested within a hierarchical governmental system. We summarize resilience assessments conducted in each system to provide a synthesis and reference by the other articles in this special feature. We also present a general framework used to evaluate the interactions between society and ecosystem regimes and the governance regimes chosen to mediate those interactions. The case studies show different ways that adaptive governance may be triggered, facilitated, or constrained by ecological and/or legal processes. The resilience assessments indicate that complex interactions among the governance and ecosystem components of these systems can produce different trajectories, which include patterns of (a) development and stabilization, (b) cycles of crisis and recovery, which includes lurches in adaptation and learning, and (3) periods of innovation, novelty, and transformation. Exploration of cross scale (Panarchy) interactions among levels and sectors of government and society illustrate that they may constrain development trajectories, but may also provide stability during crisis or innovation at smaller scales; create crises, but may also facilitate recovery; and constrain system transformation, but may also provide windows of opportunity in which transformation, and the resources to accomplish it, may occur.

The body of the literature on adaptation options is growing rapidly, but their feasibility and current state of implementation are rarely assessed. We discussed the practicability of adaptation options with conservation managers analysing three fields of action: reducing the vulnerability of conservation management, reducing the vulnerability of conservation targets (i.e. biodiversity) and climate change mitigation. For all options, feasibility, current state of implementation and existing obstacles to implementation were analysed, using the Federal State of Brandenburg, Germany, as a case study. Practitioners considered a large number of options useful, most of which have already been implemented at least in part. Those options considered broadly implemented resemble mainly conventional measures of conservation without direct relation to climate change. Managers are facing several obstacles for adapting to climate change, including political reluctance to change, financial and staff shortages in conservation administrations and conflictive EU funding schemes in agriculture. A certain reluctance to act, due to the high degree of uncertainty with regard to climate change scenarios and impacts, is widespread. A lack of knowledge of appropriate methods such as adaptive management often inhibits the implementation of adaptation options in the field of planning and management. Based on the findings for Brandenburg, we generally conclude that it is necessary to focus in particular on options that help to reduce vulnerability of conservation management itself, i.e. those that enhance management effectiveness. For instance, adaptive and proactive risk management can be applied as a no-regrets option, independently from specific climate change scenarios or impacts, strengthening action under uncertainty.","[Geyer, Juliane; Strixner, Lena; Kreft, Stefan; Ibisch, Pierre L.] Eberswalde Univ Sustainable Dev, Fac Forest & Environm, Ctr Econ & Ecosyst Management, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany; [Jeltsch, Florian] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Jeltsch, Florian] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res, ZALF, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Jeltsch, Florian] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development; University of Potsdam; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF),"Geyer, J (corresponding author), Eberswalde Univ Sustainable Dev, Fac Forest & Environm, Ctr Econ & Ecosyst Management, Alfred Moller Str 1, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany.",juliane.geyer@hnee.de,"Kreft, Stefan/AAE-5558-2021","Jeltsch, Florian/0000-0002-4670-6469",Faculty of Forest and Environment of the Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development Lincoln University (New Zealand); Academy of Sciences and Literature Mainz (Biodiversity in Change'' Program); Landesagentur fur Struktur und Arbeit (LASA) Brandenburg; European Social Fund; German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (project Germany's protected areas under climate change -risks and policy options''); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (INKA BB project),Faculty of Forest and Environment of the Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development Lincoln University (New Zealand); Academy of Sciences and Literature Mainz (Biodiversity in Change'' Program); Landesagentur fur Struktur und Arbeit (LASA) Brandenburg; European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (project Germany's protected areas under climate change -risks and policy options''); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (INKA BB project),"We thank the Faculty of Forest and Environment of the Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development Lincoln University (New Zealand), the Academy of Sciences and Literature Mainz (Biodiversity in Change'' Program, W.

Socioeconomic activities developed in this settlement are very closely linked to its climate. Any planning for socioeconomic opportunities in the mid- and long term must take into account the possible effects of climate change. To this aim, daily observed series of minimum and maximum temperatures, precipitation, relative humidity, cloud cover, and wind speed have been analyzed. For the climate projections, daily data generated by an ensemble of regional climate models (RCMs) have been used. To properly use RCM data at local scale, a quantile-quantile adjustment has been applied to the simulated regional projections. The method is based on detecting changes in the cumulative distribution functions between the recent past and successive time slices of the simulated climate and applying these, after calibration, to the recent past (observed) series. Results show an overall improvement in reproducing the present climate baseline when using calibrated series instead of raw RCM outputs, although the correction does not result in such clear improvement when dealing with very extreme rainfalls. Next, the corrected series are analyzed to quantify the climate change signal. An increase of the annual means for temperatures together with a decrease for the remaining variables is projected throughout the twenty-first century. Increases in weak and intense daily rainfalls and in high extremes for daily maximum temperature can also be expected. With this information at hand, the experts planning the future of SPdP can respond more effectively to the problem of local adaptation to climate change.","[Amengual, A.; Homar, V.; Romero, R.; Alonso, S.; Ramis, C.] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Fis, Grp Meteorol, Palma de Mallorca 07122, Spain; [Amengual, A.; Alonso, S.] Inst Med Estudis Avancats, Dept Recerca Canvi Global, Palma de Mallorca, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); ATTITUS Educacao,"Amengual, A (corresponding author), Univ Illes Balears, Dept Fis, Grp Meteorol, Edifici Mateu Orfila,Km 7-5, Palma de Mallorca 07122, Spain.",arnau.amengual@uib.es,"Amengual, Arnau/L-2783-2014; Homar Santaner, Victor/K-2678-2014","Homar Santaner, Victor/0000-0003-1459-2003; Amengual, Arnau/0000-0002-6108-2850; Ramis, Climent/0000-0001-6492-1309; Romero, Romualdo/0000-0002-9091-8688",El Consorci de la Platja de Palma; Balearic Islands; Spanish state governments through the Institut Mediterrani d'Estudis Avancats (IMEDEA; CSIC-UIB); MEDICANES [CGL2008-01271/CLI]; FEDER; ESTCENA [200800050084078]; Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Medio Rural y Marino; European Commission [GOCE-CT-2003-505539],El Consorci de la Platja de Palma; Balearic Islands; Spanish state governments through the Institut Mediterrani d'Estudis Avancats (IMEDEA; CSIC-UIB); MEDICANES; FEDER(European Commission); ESTCENA; Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Medio Rural y Marino(Spanish Government); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"The authors express their thanks and appreciation to Dr. Charles A.

Smallholder farmers are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change owing to their high dependence on agriculture for livelihood sustenance. Building smallholder farmers' livelihood resilience to the adverse effects of environmental change is critical to addressing their vulnerabilities. This paper comparatively assessed livelihood resilience of smallholder farmers in Isiolo County, Kenya and Northwestern Cameroon in the face of environmental changes. The results are based on household surveys of 339 farmers in Kenya and 350 farmers in Cameroon. Findings showed that using the same measures of livelihood resilience, farmers' resilience were significantly different in the Kenyan and Cameroonian study areas (p<0.05), with farmers in Cameroon being relatively more resilient than farmers in Kenya. In both study sites, a statistically significant causal relationship (p<0.05) existed between farmers' resilience and livelihood capital assets such as human capital (number of household members between 18 to 55 years, education level), natural capital (number of farms, size of farmland, number of agroforestry trees on the farm), financial capital (access to bank account, ownership of livestock, ownership of farmland, trees, and farm equipment), social capital (participation in agricultural group), and physical capital (use of irrigation). However, some livelihood capital assets were more important for building resilience in Isiolo County, Kenya while others were more important in Northwestern Cameroon. On the basis of these findings, it is recommended that climate change adaptation interventions and policies should take a critical look at the determinants of resilience in order to come up with effective plans of action that can enhance farmers' resilience to environmental changes occurring in Kenya and Cameroon, and elsewhere.","[Awazi, Nyong Princely] Univ Dschang, Dept Forestry, Dschang, Cameroon; [Quandt, Amy] San Diego State Univ, Dept Geog, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University,"Awazi, NP (corresponding author), Univ Dschang, Dept Forestry, Dschang, Cameroon.",nyongprincely@gmail.com; aquandt@sdsu.edu,"Awazi, Nyong Princely/AAO-1853-2020; Quandt, Amy/AAP-1716-2021","Awazi, Nyong Princely/0000-0002-0801-0719; ",US Borlaug Fellows in Global Food Security Graduate Research Grant [206766]; Institutional Review Board at the University of Colorado [14-0059],US Borlaug Fellows in Global Food Security Graduate Research Grant; Institutional Review Board at the University of Colorado,"We would like to acknowledge the communities and individuals in Kenya and Cameroon who participated in this research, as well as the research assistants and survey enumerators who played an integral role in data collection.

In the present study, heat and chilling accumulation conditions of a collection of 44 grapevine cultivars currently grown in Portugal are assessed at very high spatial resolution (similar to 1km) and for 1981-2015. Two bioclimatic indices that incorporate non-linear plant-temperature relationships are selected for this purpose: growing degree hoursGDH (February-October) and chilling portionsCP (October-February). The current thermal growing conditions of each variety are examined and three clusters of grapevine cultivars are identified based on their GDH medians, thus assembling varieties with close heat accumulation requirements and providing more physiologically consistent information when compared to previous studies, as non-linear plant-temperature relationships are herein taken into account. These new clusters are also a complement to previous bioclimatic zoning. Ensemble mean projections under two anthropogenic-driven scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, 2041-2070), from four EURO-CORDEX simulations, reveal a widespread increase of GDH and decrease of CP, but with spatial heterogeneities. The spatial variability of these indices throughout Portugal is projected to decrease (strongest increases of GDH in the coolest regions of the northeast) and to increase (strongest decreases of CP in the warmest regions of the south and west), respectively. The typical heat accumulation conditions of each cluster are projected to gradually shift north-eastwards and to higher-elevation areas, whereas insufficient chilling may represent a new challenge in warmer future climates. An unprecedented level of detail for a large collection of grapevine varieties in Portugal is provided, thus promoting a better planning of climate change adaptation measures.","[Santos, Joao A.; Costa, Ricardo; Fraga, Helder] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, Ctr Res & Technol Agroenvironm & Biol Sci, CITAB, UTAD, P-5000801 Vila Real, Portugal; [Santos, Joao A.] Escola Ciencias & Tecnol, Dept Fis, P-5000801 Vila Real, Portugal",University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro,"Santos, JA (corresponding author), Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, Ctr Res & Technol Agroenvironm & Biol Sci, CITAB, UTAD, P-5000801 Vila Real, Portugal.;Santos, JA (corresponding author), Escola Ciencias & Tecnol, Dept Fis, P-5000801 Vila Real, Portugal.",jsantos@utad.pt,"Fraga, Helder/D-8507-2012; Santos, João/HHZ-5595-2022; Santos, João Andrade/G-8805-2011","Fraga, Helder/0000-0002-7946-8786; Santos, João Andrade/0000-0002-8135-5078",INNOVINEWINE project [NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000038]; European Regional Development Fund through NORTE 2020 Programme; Agricultural and Rural Development Fund (EAFRD) [PA 53774]; Portuguese Government; European Investment Funds (FEDER/COMPETE/POCI) [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006958]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [UID/AGR/04033/2013];  [SFRH/BPD/119461/2016]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BPD/119461/2016] Funding Source: FCT,INNOVINEWINE project; European Regional Development Fund through NORTE 2020 Programme; Agricultural and Rural Development Fund (EAFRD); Portuguese Government(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); European Investment Funds (FEDER/COMPETE/POCI); Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); ; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia,"This work was supported by the INNOVINE&WINE project (NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000038), co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund through NORTE 2020 Programme; the ModelVitiDouro project (PA 53774), funded by the Agricultural and Rural Development Fund (EAFRD) and the Portuguese Government (Measure 4.1-Cooperation for Innovation PRODER Programme-Rural Development Programme); European Investment Funds (FEDER/COMPETE/POCI), POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006958, and Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), UID/AGR/04033/2013.

Results suggest that there are close links between climate drivers and armed conflict. Importantly, greater levels of adaptive capacity lead to a lower likelihood of armed conflict.

The aim is to thoroughly understand the economic feasibility of water-saving irrigation as an approach to coping with climate change. Based on the cost-effectiveness analysis, this study finds that water-saving irrigation is cost-effective in coping with climate change, and has benefits for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and for sustainable economic development. For the cost-effectiveness ratio of mitigation and adaptation, only that of channel lining is negative (for mitigation is -43.02 to -73.41 US$/t, for grain yield increase -34.35 to -20.13 US$/t, and for water saving -0.020 to -0.012 US$/m(3)). Sprinkler irrigation has the highest incremental cost for mitigation (476.03-691.64 US$/t), because when sprinkler irrigation is used, there may be additional energy needs to meet water pressure requirements, which may increase greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional irrigation. For mitigation, in districts where the pumping head for pressure is lower than the critical energy saving head, sprinkler irrigation should be avoided. Micro-irrigation has the highest incremental cost for adaptation followed by sprinkler irrigation and low-pressure pipe irrigation, but when considering the revenues from improved adaptation, all of the measures assessed are economically feasible. The results suggest that for mitigation and adaptation objectives, micro-irrigation performs best. From an economic perspective, channel lining is recommended. Therefore, a balanced development of channel lining and micro-irrigation according to different geographical conditions is recommended. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We suggest that consideration of the impact of climate change on the connectivity of crops for inoculum transmission may provide additional explanatory and predictive power in disease risk assessments, leading to improved recommendations for agricultural adaptation to climate change. In this study, a crop-growth model was combined with aerobiological models and a newly developed infection risk model to provide a framework for quantifying the impact of future climates on the risk of disease occurrence and spread. The integrated model uses standard meteorological variables and can be easily adapted to various crop pathosystems characterized by airborne inoculum. In a case study, the framework was used with data defining the spatial distribution of potato crops in Scotland and spatially coherent, probabilistic climate change data to project the future connectivity of crop distributions for Phytophthora infestans (causal agent of potato late blight) inoculum and the subsequent risk of infection. Projections and control recommendations are provided for multiple combinations of potato cultivar and CO2 emissions scenario, and temporal and spatial averaging schemes. Overall, we found that relative to current climatic conditions, the risk of late blight will increase in Scotland during the first half of the potato growing season and decrease during the second half. To guide adaptation strategies, we also investigated the potential impact of climate change-driven shifts in the cropping season. Advancing the start of the potato growing season by 1 month proved to be an effective strategy from both an agronomic and late blight management perspective.",,,,peter.skelsey@hutton.ac.uk,"Lees, Alison/S-8290-2019; Cooke, David/D-1933-2012","Cooke, David/0000-0002-9154-7954","Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services (RESAS) Division of the Scottish Government under Environmental Change and Food, Land and People Strategic Research Programmes","Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services (RESAS) Division of the Scottish Government under Environmental Change and Food, Land and People Strategic Research Programmes","We are grateful for financial support for this work in part from the Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services (RESAS) Division of the Scottish Government under its Environmental Change and Food, Land and People Strategic Research Programmes (2011-2016).",,54,11,11,2,51,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Mitigation measures of the type required to prevent major environmental damage in the future can only be effective if a global political approach based on agreed levels of climate change gas reduction is implemented. For its part the tourism industry is caught in a trap, unable to adopt meaningful mitigation strategies because of reluctance by consumers to bear the cost of changes that will be required but having to meet the cost of climate change mitigation and adaption strategies when they are introduced in the future. This article proposes a four stage problem definition and response framework with associated models that can be used by the industry to plan for and adapt to climate change both prior to and after the introduction of legislation and policies to combat climate change at the national and international levels.","[Prideaux, Bruce] James Cook Univ, Sch Business, Cairns, Australia; [McKercher, Bob] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Hotel & Tourism Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [McNamara, Karen Elizabeth] Univ S Pacific, Pacific Ctr Environm & Sustainable Dev, Suva, Fiji",James Cook University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; University of the South Pacific,"Prideaux, B (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Sch Business, Cairns, Australia.",bruce.prideaux@jcu.edu.au,"McKercher, Bob/ABD-9042-2021; McLean, Laurence JA/C-7367-2014; McNamara, Karen/D-7322-2013; Prideaux, Bruce/P-1043-2014","McKercher, Bob/0000-0001-7451-1266; McNamara, Karen/0000-0002-4511-8403; Prideaux, Bruce/0000-0002-3577-1951",,,,,44,7,7,3,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1094-1665,1741-6507,,ASIA PAC J TOUR RES,Asia Pac.

The conservation of biodiversity depends upon both policy and regulatory frameworks. Here, we identify priority policy developments that would support conservation in the UK in the light of technological developments, changes in knowledge or environmental change. 2. A team of seven representatives from governmental organizations, 17 from non-governmental organizations and six academics provided an assessment of the priority issues. The representatives consulted widely and identified a long-list of 117 issues. 3. Following voting and discussion during a 2-day meeting, these were reduced to a final list of 25 issues and their potential policy options and research needs were identified. Many of the policies related to recent changes in approaches to conservation, such as increased interest in ecosystem services, adaptation to climate change and landscape ecology. 4. We anticipate that this paper will be useful for policy makers, nature conservation delivery agencies, the research community and conservation policy advocates. 5. Although many of the options have global significance, we suggest that other countries consider an equivalent exercise. We recommend that such an exercise be carried out in the UK at regular intervals, say every 5 years, to explore how biodiversity conservation can best be supported by linked policy development and research in a changing world. 6. Synthesis and applications. Opportunities for policy development were prioritized and for each of the top 25 we identified the current context, policy options and research questions. These largely addressed new issues relating to developing topics such as ecosystem services, landscape planning and nanotechnology. We envisage that this will largely be used by researchers wishing to make a contribution to potential policy debates.","[Sutherland, William J.; Prior, Stephanie V.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Conservat Sci Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Albon, Steve D.] Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Allison, Hilary] Woodland Trust, Grantham NG31 6LL, Lincs, England; [Armstrong-Brown, Sue] Royal Soc Protect Birds, Sandy SG19 2DL, Beds, England; [Bailey, Mark J.] CEH Wallingford, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Nat Environm Res Council, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Brereton, Tom] Manor Yard, Wareham BH20 5QP, Dorset, England; [Boyd, Ian L.] Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland; [Carey, Peter] British Ecol Soc, London WC1N 2JU, England; [Carey, Peter] Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Edwards, Joan] Wildlife Trusts, Newark NG24 1WT, England; [Gill, Maggie] Scottish Govt, Area 1B, Edinburgh EH14 1TY, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hill, David] Environm Bank Ltd, Richmond DL11 6QH, Yorks, England; [Hodge, Ian] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Hunt, Alexander J.] Natl Trust, Swindon SN2 2NA, Wilts, England; [Le Quesne, Will J.

However, a central point about the proposed strategies is the effectiveness degree of the introduced measures and their proportionality and coordination with the other goals of the system. This study uses a combination simulation approach using the SWAT model and water footprint accounting framework to investigate water management activities' effects and rebound effects on water resources sustainability. The activities included expanding modern irrigation systems, developing rain-fed orchards, watershed management activities, and omitting water -intensive crops. Results show that although the growth of modern irrigation systems reduced water extraction by 50%, this strategy cannot be helpful in water-saving because the actual water use is not controlled and even caused a slight increase in water consumption of 0.6%. This measure also led to a significant reduction in return flow to the aquifer (80%). Results also indicate an intensification of blue water non-sustainability caused by the expansion of rain-fed orchards because of increased actual water use. Watershed management activities raise green water storage by 4%, positively impacting aquifer recharge, which is in line with the objectives of the water sector. However, it cannot be used as an effective strategy to create new water resources to deal with environmental crises such as wetlands restoration. Changing the water-intensive cropping pattern will effectively improve blue water and groundwater sustainability if the rebound effects are controlled. Thus, there will be a water saving of approximately 110 million m3 in water consumption with the alteration of rice cultivation into wheat in the studied basin.","[Nalbandan, Roya Bigdeli; Delavar, Majid; Abbasi, Hamid; Zaghiyan, Mohammad Reza] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Water Engn & Management, Tehran, Iran",Tarbiat Modares University,"Delavar, M (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Water Engn & Management, Tehran, Iran.",rbigdely93@gmail.com; m.delavar@modares.ac.ir; habbasi388@gmail.com; m.zaghiyan@modares.ac.ir,"Zaghiyan, Mohammad Reza/HHM-5209-2022","Zaghiyan, Mohammad Reza/0000-0001-5942-8739; Delavar, Majid/0000-0003-3897-8007","Ministry of Energy, Iran","Ministry of Energy, Iran","This work was supported by the Ministry of Energy, Iran in providing hydrological and dam operation data.

Contemporary planning interventions promise salvation via spatial fixes that might reduce carbon emissions, boost metropolitan economies, and allow urban society to thrive in spite of rising seas and climate disasters. New wetlands, floodgates, and other adaptive infrastructures allow water to coexist with urban space; new parks, such as New York's High Line and Chicago's 606, celebrate the interweaving of built and natural environments and suggest how outmoded infrastructure can be repurposed for civic benefit. While the climate dilemmas at hand are historically new, the use of landscaped environments in the service of solving social problems is not. Dating to the first generation of urban park development in the 19th century, planners have deployed green spaces as solutions to various cultural, political, and economic conundrums of the city. Offering an historical parallel and counterweight to investigations of contemporary urban-environmental dynamics, this paper investigates the period of park development that occurred in the 19th century in North America and Europe, using Chicago's Olmsted-designed South Park (the contemporary Washington and Jackson Parks) as a case study. I argue that green spaces' distinct nexus of (1) normative cultural meanings around nature, (2) power relations bound up in dominant landscape aesthetics, and (3) direct link to the economic realm via the structuring of land values have made green space development a powerful 'cultural fix': a means of using social space to mitigate perceived social crises. Understanding the historical foundations of green spaces' use as cultural fixes can inform contemporary analyses, particularly as new landscape ideologies emerge as part of broader green urbanism development and climate change adaptation strategies.","[Loughran, Kevin] Rice Univ, Houston, TX USA",Rice University,"Loughran, K (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Sociol, POB 1892, Houston, TX 77251 USA.",k.loughran@rice.edu,,,,,,,72,35,36,15,153,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0042-0980,1360-063X,,URBAN STUD,Urban Stud.,AUG,2020,57,11,,,SI,,2321,2338,,10.1177/0042098018763555,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0042098018763555,,,18,Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,MR2RL,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000553437500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

A hydrodynamic model was applied to simulate the transport and dispersion of fecal contaminants from CSO discharges and to quantify the impacts of climate and population changes on the water quality of the river used as a drinking water source in Quebec, Canada. The dispersion model was used to quantify Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentrations at drinking water intakes. Extreme flows during high and low water events were based on a frequency analysis in current and future climate scenarios. The increase of the number of discharges was quantified in current and future climate scenarios with regards to the frequency of overflows observed between 2009 and 2012. For future climate scenarios, effects of an increase of population were estimated according to current population growth statistics, independently of local changes in precipitation that are more difficult to predict than changes to regional scale hydrology. Under business-as-usual scenarios restricting increases in CSO discharge frequency, mean E. coli concentrations at downstream drinking water intakes are expected to increase by up to 87% depending on the future climate scenario and could lead to changes in drinking water treatment requirements for the worst case scenarios. The greatest uncertainties are related to future local discharge loads. Climate change adaptation with regards to drinking water quality must focus on characterizing the impacts of global change at a local scale. Source water protection planning must consider the impacts of climate and population change to avoid further degradation of water quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We used seven years of surface water and six years of soil solution water chemistry from a large (440 ha) restored wetland to examine how fertilizer legacy, changes in hydrology, and drought-induced salinization affect dissolved nutrient and carbon concentrations. To better understand the recovery trajectory of the restored wetland, we also sampled an active agricultural field and two mature forested wetlands. Our results show that nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in soil solution were 2-10 times higher in the restored wetland compared to two mature forested wetlands, presumably due to legacy fertilizer mobilized by reflooding. Despite elevated nutrient concentrations relative to reference wetlands, the restored wetland consistently attenuated N and P pulses delivered from an upstream farm. Even with continued loading, N and P concentrations in surface water throughout the restored wetland have decreased since the initial flooding. Our results suggest that high nutrient concentrations and export from wetlands restored on agricultural lands may be a severe but temporary problem. If field to wetland conversion is to become a more widespread method for ameliorating nutrient runoff and adapting coastal plain ecosystems to climate change, we should adopt new methods for minimizing the initial export phase of wetland restoration efforts.","[Ardon, Marcelo] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Helton, Ashley M.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Storrs, CT USA; [Scheuerell, Mark D.] NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA USA; [Bernhardt, Emily S.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC USA",North Carolina State University; University of Connecticut; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Duke University,"Ardon, M (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",mlardons@ncsu.edu,"Bernhardt, Emily/B-4541-2010; Bernhardt, Emily S/D-9940-2011; Scheuerell, Mark/N-6683-2016","Bernhardt, Emily S/0000-0003-3031-621X; Ardon, Marcelo/0000-0001-7275-2672; Scheuerell, Mark/0000-0002-8284-1254","GDSMB; U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science (BER) through the Coastal Center of the National - Institute for Climatic Change Research at Tulane University; NSF [DEB-1021149]; NC Sea Grant mini grant; Nature Conservancy [NSF-DBI-0805576, DBI-1216512, DEB-1452886, DEB-1713592, EF-1426892, EF-1713435]",GDSMB; U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science (BER) through the Coastal Center of the National - Institute for Climatic Change Research at Tulane University(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NC Sea Grant mini grant; Nature Conservancy,"This research was supported by GDSMB private gift in support of basic research, a grant to E.S.

However, little is known regarding effects on pre-admission health outcomes such as ambulance attendances, particularly in subtropical regions. Problem: This study investigated both main temperature effects and the added effects of heat waves on ambulance attendances in Brisbane, a subtropical city in Australia. Methods: Daily data relating to 783,935 ambulance attendances, along with data on meteorological variables and air pollutants, were collected for the period 2000-2007. Ambient temperature (main) effects were assessed using a distributed lag nonlinear approach that accounted for delayed effects of temperature, while added heat wave effects were incorporated separately using a local heat wave definition. Effect estimates were obtained for total, cardiovascular and respiratory attendances, and different age groups. Results: Main effects of temperature were found for total attendances, which increased by 50.6% (95% CI, 32.3%-71.4%) for a 9.5 degrees C increase above a reference temperature of 29 degrees C. An added heat wave effect on total attendances was observed (18.8%; 95% CI, 6.5%-32.5%). Significant effects were found for both respiratory and cardiovascular attendances, particularly for those aged 65 and above. Conclusion: Ambulance attendances can be significantly impacted by sustained periods of high temperatures, and are a valid source of early detection of the effects of extreme temperatures on the population. The planning of ambulance services may need to be adapted as a consequence of increasing numbers of heat waves in the future. Ambulance attendance data also should be utilized in the development of heat warning systems and climate change adaptation strategies.","[Turner, Lyle R.; Tong, Shilu] Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Sch Publ Hlth & Social Work, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Connell, Des] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Tong, Shilu] Anhui Med Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Griffith University; Anhui Medical University,"Tong, SL (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Sch Publ Hlth & Social Work, Victoria Pk Rd, Kelvin Grove, Qld 4059, Australia.",s.tong@qut.edu.au,"Connell, Des/AAG-4849-2020; Turner, Lyle R/I-9929-2012","Connell, Des/0000-0002-9909-1779; Turner, Lyle R/0000-0002-9696-9232",,,,,44,60,60,1,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1049-023X,1945-1938,,PREHOSP DISASTER MED,Prehospital Disaster Med.,OCT,2013,28,5,,,,,482,487,,10.1017/S1049023X13008789,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1049023X13008789,,,6,Emergency Medicine,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Emergency Medicine,VG1BB,23981779,Green Published,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000445145000013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, a framework to assess the three pillars of CSF, in terms of mitigation and adaptation to climate change and ecosystem service (ES) provision based on national forest inventory (NFI) data is currently lacking. In this study, we present an assessment framework of CSF based on forest indicators derived from NFI. To quantify the three pillars of CSF we defined 1) mitigation based on the forest carbon stock, 2) adaptation using biodiversity and susceptibility to disturbances caused by storm and bark beetles and 3) ES provision with timber production and protection against avalanches and rockfall. We demonstrate the application of this framework using Swiss NFI data and projections of future forest development under four different management scenarios. Our results show that, in general, the carbon stock is increasing at the national scale when current management practices are maintained. Increases are especially pronounced in the Jura and Southern Alps regions. Trade-offs occur between enhancing mitigation and adaption, and the sustainable provision of ES such as timber production. Scenarios with increased harvesting intensities lead to a higher timber supply in the short-term, while decreasing the carbon stock, biodiversity-related old-growth indicators and the protective function of forests. The indicator framework presented in this study provides a first methodological approach that can support policy making to balance the different forest services in the context of CSF.","[Mathys, A.

In particular, robust operational strategies are distinguished from risk-neutral expected value optimization in the sense that they should be satisfactory over a wider range of uncertainty and improve the ability of a reservoir system to adapt to climate change. In this study, a new framework named robust stochastic dynamic programming (RSDP) is proposed that couples robust optimization (RO) with the formulations of objective function or constraints used in stochastic dynamic programming (SDP). Two main approaches of RO, namely feasibility robustness and solution robustness, are both considered in the optimization algorithm. Consequently, this study uses the Boryeong multipurpose dam to evaluate three SDP framings: conventional-SDP (CSDP), RSDP-feasibility robustness (RSDP-F), and RSDP-solution robustness (RSDP-S). These three SDP formulations were used to derive optimal monthly release rules for the Boryeong Dam, and their relative performances were evaluated using simulations of a broader range of inflow scenarios. The simulation-based re-evaluations of the resulting reservoir operational policies were quantified using a wide range of metrics that include reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability, as well as regret-based robustness metrics. The results of this study suggest that the RSDP-S model not only increases the range of possible solutions, but also yields more desirable operation outcomes under extreme climate conditions with respect to both traditional and robustness metrics.","[Kim, Gi Joo; Kim, Young-Oh] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Reed, Patrick M.] Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Seoul National University (SNU); Cornell University,"Kim, YO (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",gjk_0494@snu.ac.kr; yokim05@snu.ac.kr; patrick.reed@cornell.edu,"Reed, Patrick/E-4435-2014","Reed, Patrick/0000-0002-7963-6102; Kim, Gi Joo/0000-0001-7577-9352",Korea Environment Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI) through the Advanced Water Management Research Program - Korea Ministry of Environment [83082],Korea Environment Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI) through the Advanced Water Management Research Program - Korea Ministry of Environment,"This research was supported by the Korea Environment Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI) through the Advanced Water Management Research Program, funded by the Korea Ministry of Environment (Grant No. 83082).

Agricultural is a complex system within the USA encompassing a large number of crops and livestock systems, and development of indicators to provide a signal of the impact of climate change on these different systems would be beneficial to the development of strategies for effective adaptation practices. A series of indicators were assembled to determine their potential for assessing agricultural response to climate change in the near term and long term and those with immediate capability of being implemented and those requiring more development. The available literature reveals indicators on livestock related to heat stress, soil erosion related to changes in precipitation, soil carbon changes in response to increasing carbon dioxide and soil management practices, economic response to climate change in agricultural production, and crop progress and productivity. Crop progress and productivity changes are readily observed data with a historical record for some crops extending back to the mid-1800s. This length of historical record coupled with the county-level observations from each state where a crop is grown and emerging pest populations provides a detailed set of observations to assess the impact of a changing climate on agriculture. Continued refinement of tools to assess climate impacts on agriculture will provide guidance on strategies to adapt to climate change.","[Hatfield, Jerry L.] USDA ARS, Natl Lab Agr & Environm, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Antle, John] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Garrett, Karen A.] Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Syst, Plant Pathol Dept, Gainesville, FL USA; [Garrett, Karen A.] Univ Florida, Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL USA; [Izaurralde, Roberto Cesar] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Izaurralde, Roberto Cesar] Texas A&M Univ, Res Prof Texas Agrilife, College Stn, TX USA; [Mader, Terry] Univ Nebraska, Lincoln, NE USA; [Marshall, Elizabeth] Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC USA; [Nearing, Mark] USDA ARS, Tucson, AZ USA; [Robertson, G.

However, the spatio-temporal dynamic changes in rice area are still unclear, although they may have important policy implications for environmental protection and adaptation to climate change. In this study, we aimed to identify the dynamic changes of the rice area in Heilongjiang Province of northeastern China by extracting data from multiple Landsat images. The study used ground quadrats selected from Google Earth and the extraction of a confusion matrix to verify the accuracy of extraction. The overall accuracy of the extracted rice area was higher than 95% as a result of using the artificial neural network (ANN) classification method. The results showed that the rice area increased by approximately 2.4x10(6) ha during the past 30 years at an annual rate of 8.0x10(4) ha, and most of the increase occurred after 2000. The central latitude of the rice area shifted northwards from 46 to 47 degrees N during the study period, and moved eastwards from 130 to 133 degrees E. The rice expansion area accounted for 98% of the total change in rice area, and rice loss was notably rare. The rice expansion was primarily from dryland. In addition, rice cultivation in marshland and grassland played a minor role in the rice expansion in this region.","[Li Zhi-peng; Long Yu-qiao; Tang Peng-qin; Li Zheng-guo; Wu Wen-bin; Hu Ya-nan; Yang Peng] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Key Lab Agriinformat, Minist Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Tan Jie-yang] Hunan Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Reg Planning, Changsha 410125, Hunan, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning, CAAS; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences","Yang, P (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Key Lab Agriinformat, Minist Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",lizhipeng@caas.cn; huyanan@caas.cn; yangpeng@caas.cn,"Li, Zhengguo/AAR-5191-2020",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41101170, 41201184]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We are grateful for the financial support for our initial and ongoing research from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41101170 and 41201184).,,25,12,15,3,48,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2095-3119,,,J INTEGR AGR,J.

It has been proposed that appropriately designed flood risk communication campaigns can stimulate floodplain inhabitants to prepare for flooding, and encourage adaptation to climate change. However, such campaigns do not always result in the desired action, and the effectiveness of communication in raising flood risk awareness and improving flood preparedness has hardly been studied. We evaluate different flood risk communication strategies, using an agent-based modelling approach, which is especially suitable for examining the effect of communication on each individual, and how flood risk communication can propagate through an individual's social network. Our modelling results show that tailored, people-centred, flood risk communication can be significantly more effective than the common approach of top-down government communication, even when tailored communication reaches fewer individuals. Furthermore, communication on how to protect against floods, in addition to providing information about flood risk, is much more effective than the traditional strategy of communicating only about flood risk. Another main finding is that a person's social network can have a significant effect on whether or not individuals take protective action. This leads to the recommendation that flood risk communication should aim at exploiting this natural amplifying effect of social networks, for instance, through the use of social media.

Evaluating the vulnerability of disadvantaged groups in the context of climate change has presented tremendous theoretical, methodological and policy challenges especially where vulnerability assessment research is focused at the local community level. This study addresses the challenges by developing an interdisciplinary methodology, based on expert knowledge, and uses the state of South Australia as a case study. It focuses on key indicators that measure the exposure of local communities to climate change and socio-economic vulnerabilities of local populations. A main contribution in this study is the novel incorporation of physical, environmental and socio-demographic data sets and extensive use of spatial modelling and estimation methods to spatially define climate change and social vulnerability hot spots. This paper assesses vulnerability under moderate and high Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change CO2 emission scenarios in order to generate an assessment model to be used before planning is done. The result is the creation of a practical tool through which decision-makers can better understand how the complexity of one's local spatial context influences the unique exposure, which different vulnerable communities have, to the impacts of climate change. This paper presents a useful tool that can be used in the initial assessment phase by planners and policy-makers to better assist those who are limited in their ability to adapt to climate change.","[Tan, Yan; Chadbourne, Michael] Univ Adelaide, Discipline Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Tan, Y (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Discipline Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",yan.tan@adelaide.edu.au,,"Tan, Yan/0000-0002-4013-1713",,,,,95,3,3,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2015,20,11,,,,,1265,1289,,10.1080/13549839.2014.901306,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2014.901306,,,25,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,V80AY,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000212156700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, in recent years mines across Canada have been affected by significant climatic hazards, several which are regarded to be symptomatic of climate change. For the mining sector, climate change is a pressing environmental threat and a significant business risk. The extent to which the mining sector is able to mitigate its own impact and adapt to climate change will affect its long-term success and prosperity, and have profound economic consequences for host communities. This paper draws upon case studies conducted with mining operations in Canada involving in-depth interviews with mining professionals and analysis of secondary sources to characterize the vulnerability of the Canadian mining industry to climate change. Five key findings are discussed: i) mines in the case studies are affected by climate events that are indicative of climate change, with examples of negative impacts over the past decade; ii) most mine infrastructure has been designed assuming that the climate is not changing; iii) most industry stakeholders interviewed view climate change as a minor concern; iv) limited adaption planning for future climate change is underway; v) significant vulnerabilities exist in the post-operational phase of mines. This paper argues for greater collaboration among mining companies, regulators, scientists and other industry stakeholders to develop practical adaptation strategies that can be integrated into existing and new mine operations, including in the post-operational phase.","[Pearce, Tristan D.; Smit, Barry] Univ Guelph, Dept Geog, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Ford, James David; Beaumier, Maude; Berrang-Ford, Lea] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; [Prno, Jason] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; [Duerden, Frank] Ryerson Univ, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada; [Pittman, Jeremy] Univ Regina, Dept Geog, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada",University of Guelph; McGill University; Wilfrid Laurier University; Toronto Metropolitan University; University of Regina,"Pearce, TD (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Geog, 20 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",tpearce@uoguelph.ca; james.ford@mcgill.ca; jprno@trailheadconsulting.ca; fduerden@ryerson.ca; pittman17@hotmail.com; maude.beaumier@mail.mcgill.ca; lea.berrangford@mcgill.ca; bsmit@uoguelph.ca,"Pearce, Tristan/L-9139-2019; Berrang Ford, Lea/H-5965-2013; Ford, James/A-4284-2013","Berrang Ford, Lea/0000-0001-9216-8035; Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456",David Suzuki Foundation; SSHRC; University of Guelph,David Suzuki Foundation; SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); University of Guelph,"The research was funded by the David Suzuki Foundation and also benefited from in-kind support from ArcticNorth Consulting, SSHRC Vanier Doctoral Scholarship, University of Guelph Scholarships, SSHRC Canada Research Chairs program, the Global Environmental Change Group in the Department of Geography at the University of Guelph, and the Climate Change Vulnerability and Adaptation Research Group at McGill University.

Banana, an important staple food and cash crop in East Africa, is threatened by Banana Xanthomonas Wilt (BXW) disease. Yet, there is no up-to-date information about the spatial distribution and extent of banana lands, especially in Rwanda, where banana plays a key role in food security and livelihood. Therefore, delineation of banana-cultivated lands is important to prioritize resource allocation for optimal productivity. We mapped the spatial extent of smallholder banana farmlands by acquiring and processing high-resolution (25 cm/px) multispectral unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) imageries, across four villages in Rwanda. Georeferenced ground-truth data on different land cover classes were combined with reflectance data and vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, and EVI2) and compared using pixel-based supervised multi-classifiers (support vector models-SVM, classification and regression trees-CART, and random forest-RF), based on varying ground-truth data richness. Results show that RF consistently outperformed other classifiers regardless of data richness, with overall accuracy above 95%, producer's/user's accuracies above 92%, and kappa coefficient above 0.94. Estimated banana farmland areal coverage provides concrete baseline for extension-delivery efforts in terms of targeting banana farmers relative to their scale of production, and highlights opportunity to combine UAV-derived data with machine-learning methods for rapid landcover classification.","[Kilwenge, Regina; Adewopo, Julius; Schut, Marc] Int Inst Trop Agr IITA, KG 563 ST,POB 1269, Kigali, Rwanda; [Sun, Zhanli] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Schut, Marc] Wageningen Univ, Knowledge Technol & Innovat Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); Wageningen University & Research,"Adewopo, J (corresponding author), Int Inst Trop Agr IITA, KG 563 ST,POB 1269, Kigali, Rwanda.",reginakil-wenge@gmail.com; j.adewopo@cgiar.org; sun@iamo.de; m.schut@cgiar.org,"Change, Structural/W-8306-2019; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; Sun, Zhanli/AAM-7015-2020; Schut, Marc/F-5488-2012","Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646; , IAMO/0000-0001-7922-9665; Sun, Zhanli/0000-0001-6204-4533; Adewopo, Julius/0000-0003-4831-2823; Schut, Marc/0000-0002-3361-4581",German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) Fund for International Agricultural Research (FIA) [81219434],German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) Fund for International Agricultural Research (FIA),"This work received financial support from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) commissioned and administered through the Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) Fund for International Agricultural Research (FIA), grant number 81219434.",,48,1,1,10,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,DEC,2021,13,24,,,,,,,4985,10.3390/rs13244985,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13244985,,,15,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,XZ1KO,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000737419500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Much of this is concentrated in urban and peri-urban areas where urban development spreads into hazard-prone areas. Often, this development is dominated by poor-quality homes in informal settlements or slums with poor tenure security. Lessons from a resilience-building project in the Pacific shows that a fit-for-purpose (FFP) approach to land administration can provide solutions by increasing the number of households with security of tenure, and consequently, improving resilience outcomes as informal settlements grow. This paper specifically discusses the influence of FFP land administration on reducing vulnerabilities to external shocks, such as climate change and COVID-19. It proposes ways to be better manage urban growth through the responsible governance of land tenure rights and more effective land-use planning to improve resilience to multiple shocks and stresses, hence, delivering improved access to safe land and shelter. Land administration systems can contribute to enhanced resilience to the shocks of climate extremes and pandemics by improving tenure security and enhancing land-use planning controls. It is argued that climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction need to be better mainstreamed into two major elements of land governance: (i) securing and safeguarding of land rights, and (ii) planning and control of land use.","[Mitchell, David; Ho, Serene] RMIT Univ, Sch Sci, Geospatial Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Barth, Bernhard] Reg Off Asia & Pacific, UH Habitat, Fukuoka 8100001, Japan; [Sait, M.

The weight of the burden of malaria on a society is determined by a complex interplay of environmental and social factors, including poverty, awareness and education, among others. A substantial share of the affected population is characterized by a general lack of anticipation and coping capacities, which renders them particularly vulnerable to the disease and its adverse side effects. This work aims at identifying interdependencies and feedback mechanisms in the malaria social vulnerability system and their variations in space by combining concepts, methods and tools from Climate Change Adaptation, Spatial Analysis, and Statistics and System Dynamics. The developed workflow is applied to a selected set of social, economic and biological vulnerability indicators covering five East-African Nations. As the study areas' local conditions vary in a multitude of aspects, the social vulnerability system is assumed to vary accordingly throughout space. The study areas' spatial entities were therefore aggregated into three system-regions using correlation-based clustering. Their respective correlation structures are displayed as Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs). While the three resulting CLDs do not necessarily display causal relations (as the set of social vulnerability indicators are likely linked through third variables and parts of the data are proxies), they give a good overview of the data, can be used as basis for discussions in participatory settings and can potentially enhance the understanding the malaria vulnerability system.","[Menk, Linda; Neuwirth, Christian; Kienberger, Stefan] Paris Lodron Univ Salzburg, Interfac Dept Geoinformat Z GIS, Schillerstr 30, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria",Salzburg University,"Menk, L (corresponding author), Paris Lodron Univ Salzburg, Interfac Dept Geoinformat Z GIS, Schillerstr 30, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria.",Linda.Menk@sbg.ac.at; Christian.Neuwirth@sbg.ac.at; Stefan.Kienberger@sbg.ac.at,,"Kienberger, Stefan/0000-0002-4800-4516",,,,,68,0,0,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2020,12,12,,,,,,,5112,10.3390/su12125112,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12125112,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ML1FF,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000549220100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Stressors, in this context, constitute environmental and socio-economic changes or events at local, national or global levels making the fisheries sector or fishers vulnerable. Climate change is expected to compound the consequences of these stressors on fisheries and livelihoods. Identifying and understanding the effects of important stressors are imperative for building and organising appropriate capacity to adapt and, ultimately, for successful adaptation. However, how climate-related and non-climate stressors jointly affect small-scale fisheries is still to be fully explored. In this paper, we use case studies of three coastal communities in,the Western Region of Ghana to gain insights into how multiple stressors combine to affect small-scale fisheries. The findings show that multiple stressors combine in complex ways, affecting fisheries-based livelihoods and the coastal landscape, vegetation and infrastructure. This suggests that any single stressor is just a part of a set of stressors that jointly affect small-scale coastal fisheries. This study proposes that the effects of climate-related stressors are better comprehended when analysed in light of the synergetic effect of multiple stressors. It has the potential to guide policy-makers and managers in designing and implementing improved strategies to enhance adaptive capacity in response to climate change. Moreover, this knowledge can present an opportunity and justification for solving other inherent developmental problems through climate change adaptation policies and actions.","[Freduah, George; Fidelman, Pedro; Smith, Timothy F.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, ML28,Locked Bag 4, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia; [Smith, Timothy F.] Brock Univ, Environm Sustainabil Res Ctr, St Catharines, ON, Canada; [Smith, Timothy F.] Uppsala Univ, Swedish Int Ctr Educ Sustainable Dev SWEDESD, Uppsala, Sweden",University of the Sunshine Coast; Brock University; Uppsala University,"Freduah, G (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, ML28,Locked Bag 4, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia.",gfreduah@usc.edu.au; contact@pedrofidelman.com; TSmith5@usc.edu.au,"Freduah, George/U-5638-2019; Freduah, George/Q-9663-2019; Fidelman, Pedro/N-1466-2014","Freduah, George/0000-0002-5476-8061; Fidelman, Pedro/0000-0001-7780-0952; Smith, Timothy/0000-0002-3991-5211","Too Big To Ignore (TBTI), a global research network and knowledge mobilization for elevating the profile of small-scale fisheries (SSF)","Too Big To Ignore (TBTI), a global research network and knowledge mobilization for elevating the profile of small-scale fisheries (SSF)","This study is part of a PhD research conducted at the University of the Sunshine Coast, Australia.

Thus Aiguamolls de l'Emporda can be regarded as a key case study to assess current knowledge and perceptions of the potential climate change effects on the coastal population and economies in the Spanish Mediterranean region. This study finds out that it is essential to gather and integrate local traditional knowledge with scientific knowledge in order to develop successful responses to climate change. Furthermore, it supports the position that vulnerability analysis must be participatory and must include social, cultural, environmental, economic and political dimensions, like it was the case in this research. According to the quantitative and qualitative data gathered, major climate change effects such as increase in air temperature over the past few decades, a decrease in precipitation but increase in its intensity, the increase in the severity of droughts, and the decrease in biodiversity and ecosystem services are the most pressing climate change effects and serious threats to the observed area. In addition to this, the location of the coastal municipalities (their exposure) also makes them directly vulnerable to coastal erosion, saltwater intrusion and sea level rise. Stakeholders also found that climate change adaptation is needed and this finding may suggest that even if cost of adaptation is high, further losses to the economy and ecosystems might be even higher.

The analytical results show that livelihood adaptation strategies of herders vary greatly across the border between Mongolia and Inner Mongolia, China. Local institutions played important roles in shaping and facilitating livelihood adaptation strategies of herders. Mobility and communal pooling were the two key categories of adaptation strategies in Mongolia, and they were shaped and facilitated by local communal institutions. Storage, livelihood diversification, and market exchange were the three key categories of adaptation strategies in Inner Mongolia, and they were mainly shaped and facilitated by local government and market institutions. Local institutions enhanced but also at times undermined adaptive capacity of herder communities in the two countries, but in different ways. Sedentary grazing has increased livelihood vulnerability of herders to climate variability and change. With grazing sedentarization, the purchase and storage of forage has become an important strategy of herders to adapt to the highly variable climate. The multilevel statistical models of forage purchasing behaviors show that the strategies of livestock management, household financial capital, environmental (i.e., precipitation and vegetation growth) variability, and the status of pasture degradation were the major determinants of this adaptation strategy.

The health and wellbeing sector must respond to these growing pressures in order to continue to provide safe, quality care. Adaptation and mitigation policies need to be developed at different scales, including at a regional government level. Numerous challenges exist; for example, the necessity for collaboration between multiple agencies across scales, the tailoring of policies to the health issues specific to regions, and constraints on existing regional and local resources and adaptive capacities, to name a few. This paper presents a multi-disciplinary collaborative approach used to develop a regional scale climate adaptation plan with the health sector. Starting from a scientific understanding of climate change impact on the health sector in Queensland, Australia, the approach used an innovative engagement strategy to a) better understand awareness of relevant stakeholders about current and future climate change impact on the health of the population and on service provision, b) identify on-ground barriers to effective adaptation faced by the sector stakeholders, c) identify opportunities and benefits which would arise from adaptation, and d) identify what conditions or support stakeholders required to overcome those barriers, take advantage of opportunities, and achieve benefits from adaptation. Analysis of these findings guided the development of specific policy directions for the sector. We found direct engagement between various key stakeholders such as health service providers (e.g. hospitals), critical infrastructure providers, academics, local government authorities, and sub-sectors such as aged care and early childhood care facilities, was a critical element of translating scientific evidence of climate change impacts on human health into a regional adaptation policy for the health and wellbeing sector. The resulting policy, grounded in the reality and experience of health and wellbeing sector stakeholders, reflects their insights and concerns, and served to develop a level of sectoral 'ownership' (not 'top-down' imposition) which will be important for its successful ongoing development and implementation.","[Tonmoy, Fahim N.; Rissik, David] BMT Commercial Australia Pty Ltd, 200 Creek St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Tonmoy, Fahim N.] Univ Sydney, Civil Engn Bldg J05, Sydney, NSW 2008, Australia; [Tonmoy, Fahim N.] Griffith Univ, G55 Parkland Dr, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Cooke, Susan M.; Armstrong, Fiona] Climate & Hlth Alliance Australia CAHA, 247 Flinders Lane, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Rissik, David] Griffith Univ, Sir Samuel Griffith Bldg N78-4-27,170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",University of Sydney; Griffith University; Griffith University,"Tonmoy, FN (corresponding author), BMT Commercial Australia Pty Ltd, 200 Creek St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",f.tonmoy@griffith.edu.au; sue.cooke@caha.org.au; fiona.armstrong@caha.org.au; d.rissik@griffith.edu.au,,"Cooke, Susan/0000-0002-0738-4014",Queensland Department of Environment and Science [EHP17082],Queensland Department of Environment and Science,This research was supported by a grant from Queensland Department of Environment and Science (Ref EHP17082)Authors would like to acknowledge the contribution from Jyotishma Rajan and David Putland from DES.

However, the differences in characteristics of climate change mitigation and adaptation have shown the possible reasons for a dichotomy in climate policy. This has motivated us to further look into whether cities could integrate their actions in climate change mitigation and adaptation in their planning and how they achieve benefits to overcome the dichotomy. To answer our research question, we have developed an analysis framework built on the endogenous risk theory to analyse how cities overcome the different characteristics to integrate their climate strategies and obtain benefits. The theory of endogenous risk involves seeing both climate change mitigation and adaptation as risk reduction strategies because both of them aim to reduce climate risks and can be carried out by actors who perceive such risks. Therefore, the actors will be more willing to integrate and implement both mitigation and adaptation policy. Our results show that mitigation and adaptation in cities are interlinked and that benefits of an integrated climate change policy exist. A list of entry points how cities overcome the dichotomy are also identified. Our research outcomes also provide a list of benefits identified by the cities in their integrated climate strategies and we call for more public disclosed data for future research and policy assessments.","[Huang-Lachmann, Jo-Ting; Guenther, Edeltraud] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, Sustainabil Management & Environm Accounting, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Huang-Lachmann, Jo-Ting; Guenther, Edeltraud] PRISMA Ctr Sustainabil Assessment & Policy, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Guenther, Edeltraud] United Nations Univ, Inst Integrated Management Mat Fluxes & Resources, D-01067 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Guenther, E (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, Sustainabil Management & Environm Accounting, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.;Guenther, E (corresponding author), PRISMA Ctr Sustainabil Assessment & Policy, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.;Guenther, E (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Integrated Management Mat Fluxes & Resources, D-01067 Dresden, Germany.",jo-ting.huang-lachmann@tu-dresden.de; ema@mailbox.tu-dresden.de,"Gunther, Edeltraud/D-5084-2017","Gunther, Edeltraud/0000-0001-6968-9238; Huang-Lachmann, Jo-Ting/0000-0002-6711-2539",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) [915308999],German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),The first author would like to sincerely thank the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) for the scholarship which made this research possible (grant number 915308999).

Multifunctional, they are used for flood protection, drought prevention and other purposes. Water reservoirs can also play a fundamental role in improving navigability on the lower section of the Vistula River from the Wloclawek barrage to the mouth of the Gdansk Bay. Their implementation is a determinant for the possibility of restoring the economic role of the river in question. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to determine the current navigation conditions and the state of the regulatory buildings on the Lower Vistula. The investments necessary to achieve international parameters of the waterway were also determined, together with the calculation of financial benefits related to their implementation. This was possible based on the conducted bathymetric measurements, spatial analyses, economic calculations and queries of the obtained studies. It was established that fairway depths of 1.4 m are ensured for 180 days per year on average. On the other hand, the construction of five barrages (Siarzewo, Solec Kujawski, Chelmno, Grudziadz and Gniew) will make it possible to achieve at least a navigability class IV (international) on the section of the Vistula River waterway. In addition, the barrages will enable the retention of 1.2 billion m(3) of water and will be associated with financial benefits such as shipping use, flood protection and counteracting the effects of drought. On this account, annual revenues may amount to approximately PLN 3.5 billion. This shows that the construction of the reservoirs is profitable, and the proposed solutions should be implemented in the context of sustainable water management and adaptation to climate change.","[Pieron, Lukasz; Wos, Krzysztof; Wrzosek, Krzysztof] State Water Holding Polish Waters, Zelazna 59A, PL-00848 Warsaw, Poland; [Pieron, Lukasz] Univ Siles Katowice, Bankowa 12, PL-40007 Katowice, Poland; [Wos, Krzysztof] Maritime Univ Szczecin, Fac Transport Engn & Econ, H Poboznego 11, PL-70500 Szczecin, Poland; [Wrzosek, Krzysztof] Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Bldg Serv, Hydro & Environm Engn Installat, Nowowiejska 20, PL-00653 Warsaw, Poland",Maritime University of Szczecin; Warsaw University of Technology,"Pieron, L (corresponding author), State Water Holding Polish Waters, Zelazna 59A, PL-00848 Warsaw, Poland.;Pieron, L (corresponding author), Univ Siles Katowice, Bankowa 12, PL-40007 Katowice, Poland.",lukasz.pieron@wody.gov.pl,,,,,,,46,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,DEC,2022,14,24,,,,,,,4042,10.3390/w14244042,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14244042,,,18,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,7G8HO,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000902758200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding agricultural ecosystem responses requires assessing the relative shift in climatic constraints on crop production at regional scales such as the temperate zone. In this work we propose an approach to modeling the growth, development and yield of Triticum durum Desf. under the climatic conditions of north-eastern Poland. The model implements 13 non-measurable parameters, including climate conditions, agronomic factors, physiological processes, biophysical parameters, yield components and biological yield (latent variables), which are described by 33 measurable predictors as well as grain and straw yield (manifest variables). The agronomic factors latent variable was correlated with nitrogen fertilization and sowing density, and biological yield was correlated with grain yield and straw yield. An analysis of the model parameters revealed that a one unit increase in agronomic factors increased biological yield by 0.575. In turn, biological yield was most effectively determined by climate conditions (score of 60-62) and biophysical parameters (score of 60-67) in the 2nd node detectable stage and at the end of heading. The modeled configuration of latent and manifest variables was responsible for less than 70% of potential biological yield, which indicates that the growth and development of durum wheat in north-eastern Europe can be further optimized to achieve high and stable yields. The proposed model accounts for local climate conditions and physiological processes in plants, and it can be implemented to optimize agronomic practices in the cultivation of durum wheat and, consequently, to expand the area under T. durum to regions with a temperate climate.","[Bozek, Kamila S.; Zuk-Golaszewska, Krystyna] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Fac Agr & Forestry, Dept Agrotechnol & Agribusiness, Ul Oczapowskiego 8, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland; [Bochenek, Anna] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Ctr Bioecon & Renewable Energies, Pl Lodzki 3, PL-10727 Olsztyn, Poland; [Golaszewski, Janusz] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Dept Genet Plant Breeding & Bioresource Engn, Fac Agr & Forestry, Pl Lodzki 3, PL-10727 Olsztyn, Poland; [Kalaji, Hazem M.] Univ Life Sci SGGW, Inst Biol, Dept Plant Physiol, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warmia & Mazury; University of Warmia & Mazury; University of Warmia & Mazury; Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Golaszewski, J (corresponding author), Univ Warmia & Mazury, Dept Genet Plant Breeding & Bioresource Engn, Fac Agr & Forestry, Pl Lodzki 3, PL-10727 Olsztyn, Poland.",janusz.golaszewski@uwm.edu.pl,"Kalaji, Mohamed Hazem/E-8086-2012","Kalaji, Mohamed Hazem/0000-0002-3833-4917","University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry, Department of Agrotechnology and Agribusiness [30.610.013-110]; Department of Genetics, Plant Breeding and Bioresource Engineering [30.610.007-110];  [010/RID/2018/19]","University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry, Department of Agrotechnology and Agribusiness; Department of Genetics, Plant Breeding and Bioresource Engineering; ","The results presented in this paper were obtained as part of a comprehensive study financed by the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry, Department of Agrotechnology and Agribusiness (grant No 30.610.013-110) and Department of Genetics, Plant Breeding and Bioresource Engineering (grant No. 30.610.007-110).

These droughts also affect the water resources. Because, many studies have been done for the sustainability of water use in the literature. Water footprint (WF) analysis is also a new concept that has been added to the literature. Water footprint concept for a region or any product, indicates the amount of water used or contaminated in the production stages. The aim of this article is to plan the water use by making detailed WF analysis in Sanliurfa where is effective drought and which is an important agricultural centers in Turkey. For this purpose, green and blue water footprints for 45 agricultural products growing in the work area were analyzed by using the areal rainfall averages of 11 years between 2009 and 2019. In addition, the average total WF value of the region was found as 8.01 billion m3/year by making WF analysis for livestock, industrial and domestic water use in the work area. It was understood that, 91% of underground and surface water resources in the province are used in the cultivation of agricultural products. It was determined that, 64% of the available freshwater is met from blue water resources, and this rate reaches up to 66% in the dry season. For more rational planning, the virtual water contents of important agricultural products were also calculated and compared with the economic value of these products. This study which is among the first WF analysis in Turkey is necessary for planning water resources and adaptation to climate change.","[Batan, Murat] Batman Univ, Engn Architecture Fac, Dept Civil Engn, TR-72100 Batman, Turkey",Batman University,"Batan, M (corresponding author), Batman Univ, Engn Architecture Fac, Dept Civil Engn, TR-72100 Batman, Turkey.",murat.batan@batman.edu.tr,,,,,,,71,1,1,0,5,"GAZI UNIV, FAC ENGINEERING ARCHITECTURE",ANKARA,"BAYAR BULVARI, MALTEPE, ANKARA, 06570, TURKEY",1300-1884,1304-4915,,J FAC ENG ARCHIT GAZ,J.

This article characterizes livestock production and evaluates the potential and limitations of organic conversion and the energy efficiency of conventional dual purpose (milk and meat) cattle production in a humid tropical region of Chiapas, Mexico. Our analysis indicates that for the Livestock Production Units (LPU) of the study region, the greater the organic livestock conversion index (OLCI, 0-100%), the lower the values for herd size, stocking rate, total feed supplement, annual cost of feed purchased for cattle, and production cost per cow; by contrast, those LPU with greater OLCI have greater economic efficiency. Furthermore, the greater the OLCI, the greater the values of the following indicators: Feeding management, Sustainable grassland management, Ecological weed control in grasses and crops, Veterinary prevention and care, Food safety, and Ecological farm management. A direct relationship exists between the potential for organic conversion (>OLCI) and energy and economic efficiency. Meanwhile, an inverse relationship was found between OLCI and energy efficiency on the one hand, and - on the other - use of direct and indirect energy, total energy input, energy output, and number of people that could be fed with the energy from milk and meat produced. Converting LPU to organic production and increasing their energy efficiency depends on farmers further developing their abilities to manage sustainable agricultural systems through advisory, technical assistance, and permanent financial support.

As a result, there are signs that climate change could have negative impacts on maple syrup production in the next decades, particularly for regions located at the southern margins of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) range. The purpose of this survey study is to present the beliefs and opinions of maple syrup producers of Canada (N = 241) and the U.S. (N = 113) on climate change in general, its impacts on sugar maple health and maple syrup production, and potential adaptation measures. Using conditional inference classification trees, we examined how the socio-economic profile of respondents and the geographic location and size of respondents' sugar bushes shaped the responses of survey participants. While a majority (75%) of respondents are confident that the average temperature on Earth is increasing, less than half (46%) believe that climate change will have negative impacts on maple syrup yield in the next 30 years. Political view was a significant predictor of these results, with respondents at the right right and center- right of the political spectrum being less likely to believe in climate change and less likely to anticipate negative effects of climate change on maple syrup production.

This interest was greater for respondents using vacuum tubing for sap collection than other collection methods.

However, land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) is the leading driver of biodiversity, ecosystem services, habitat, and ecosystem loss in most rural areas of developing countries. We evaluated LULCC in the Bobirwa sub-district of Botswana between 1995 and 2015. We employed the supervised classification's maximum likelihood algorithm on the 1995, 2005, and 2016 Landsat images to establish the implications of LULCC on the delivery of provisioning ecosystem services (ES) and ecosystem-based adaptation in the Limpopo Basin part of Botswana. Five major LULC classes-vegetation, cropland, bare land, built-up areas, and water bodies-were identified in the sub-district. The decline in vegetation by 50.67 km(2)/year between 1995 and 2016 was characterized by an increase in croplands (34.02 km(2)/year). These changes were attributed to the growing human population that induced farming households to expand croplands. Government programs also encouraged agricultural expansions by offering free inputs and compensating smallholder farmers for land preparation. Higher agricultural yields remained critically low while the loss of vegetated areas to croplands threatened biodiversity, habitats, and the sustainability of provisioning ES through impaired ecosystem functions. There is an urgent need to arrest all unnecessary agricultural expansions and enhance agricultural productivity from current land parcels. The government and other relevant stakeholders also need to strengthen the ecosystem management capacities of local communities and support them to develop and implement biodiversity-based village action plans. Engaging communities through participatory, biodiversity-based action planning promotes biodiversity conservation and the sustainable use of ecosystem resources.","[Mugari, Ephias] Univ Venda, Fac Sci Agr & Engn, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Private Bag X5050, ZA-0950 Thohoyandou, South Africa; [Mugari, Ephias; Masundire, Hillary] Univ Botswana, Fac Sci, Biol Sci Dept, Private Bag, Gaborone 0022, Botswana",University of Venda; University of Botswana,"Mugari, E (corresponding author), Univ Venda, Fac Sci Agr & Engn, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Private Bag X5050, ZA-0950 Thohoyandou, South Africa.;Mugari, E (corresponding author), Univ Botswana, Fac Sci, Biol Sci Dept, Private Bag, Gaborone 0022, Botswana.",mugarie@gmail.com,,"Mugari, Ephias/0000-0002-9205-9653",,,,,60,0,0,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,NOV,2022,11,11,,,,,,,2057,10.3390/land11112057,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11112057,,,20,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6V6XO,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000895188200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Synthetical assessment of coastal vulnerability is crucial for effective interventions and long-term planning. However, there have been few studies based on integrative analyses of ecological and physical characteristics and socioeconomic conditions in urban coastal areas. This study developed a holistic framework for assessing coastal vulnerability from three dimensions biophysical exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity - and applied it to the coast of Bohai Economic Rim, an extensive and important development zone in China. A composite vulnerability index (CVI) was developed for every 1 km(2) segment of the total 5627 km coastline and the areas that most prone to coastal hazards were identified by mapping the distribution patterns of the CVIs in the present and under future climate change scenarios. The CVIs show a spatial heterogeneity, with higher values concentrated along the southwestern and northeastern coasts and lower values concentrated along the southern coasts. Currently, 20% of the coastlines with approximately 350,000 people are highly vulnerable to coastal hazards. With sea-level rises under the future scenarios of the year 2100, more coastlines will be highly vulnerable, and the amount of highly threatened population was estimated to increase by 13-24%. Among the coastal cities, Dongying was categorized as having the highest vulnerability, mainly due to poor transportation and medical services and low GDP per capita, which contribute to low adaptive capacity. Our results can benefit decision-makers by highlighting prioritized areas and identifying the most important determinants of priority, facilitating location-specific interventions for climate-change adaptation and sustainable coastal management.","[Zhang, Yan; Wu, Tong; Han, Baolong; Lu, Fei; Ouyang, Zhiyun] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Arkema, Katie K.; Ruckelshaus, Mary] Stanford Univ, Nat Capital Project, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Arkema, Katie K.; Ruckelshaus, Mary] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES); Stanford University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Ouyang, ZY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.",zyouyang@rcees.ac.cn,,"Wu, Tong/0000-0002-5467-2094","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71533005, 41701549]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences [2013030]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71533005 and No. 41701549) and Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. 2013030).",,46,10,11,12,40,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0160-4120,1873-6750,,ENVIRON INT,Environ.

Hydrochemical and meteorological data were analyzed from 1997 to 2017, along with high-resolution in situ sensor measurements from 2016 to 2017. The results showed that even a relatively pristine wetland can become a source of highly bioavailable phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), and silicon (Si) during low-flow periods of high ecological sensitivity. The drivers of nutrient release were primary production and accumulation of biomass, which provided a carbon (C) source for microbial respiration and, via mineralization, a source of bioavailable nutrients for P and N co-limited microorganisms. During high-intensity nutrient release events, the dominant N-cycling process switched from denitrification to nitrate ammonification, and a positive feedback cycle of P and N release was sustained over several months during summer and fall. Temperature controls on microbial activity were the primary drivers of short-term (day-to-day) variability in P release, with subdaily (diurnal) fluctuations in P concentrations driven by water body metabolism. Interannual relationships between nutrient release and climate variables indicated memory effects of antecedent climate drivers through accumulated legacy organic matter from the previous year's biomass production. Natural flood management initiatives promote the use of wetlands as nature-based solutions in climate change adaptation, flood management, and soil and water conservation. This study highlights potential water quality trade-offs and shows how the convergence of climate and biogeochemical drivers of wetland nutrient release can amplify background nutrient signals by mobilizing legacy nutrients, causing water quality impairment and accelerating eutrophication risk.","[Jarvie, Helen P.; Macrae, Merrin L.] Univ Waterloo, Dep Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Jarvie, Helen P.; Macrae, Merrin L.] Univ Waterloo, Water Inst, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Jarvie, Helen P.; Pallett, Denise W.; Schaefer, Stefanie M.; Bowes, Michael J.; Farrand, Philip; Warwick, Alan C.; Williams, Richard J.; Armstrong, Linda; Nicholls, David J.

It plays key roles in the well-being of society in numerous ways. However, climate variability and land use land cover (LULC) change have caused spatiotemporal water supply variation. Disentangling the effects of climate variability from LULC change on water supply is crucial for sustainable water resource management. The main purpose of this study is, therefore, to disentangle the relative contribution of LULC change and climate variability to the overall average annual water supply variation. Residual trends analysis combined with Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) annual water yield model was adopted to perform simulations and disentangle the relative impacts of climate variability and LULC change. Ground and satellite data were used in this study. The study area has experienced a significant increasing wetness trend and significant LULC dynamics between 2003 and 2017. As a result, an increasing water supply was observed due to the joint effects of climate variability and LULC change in the watershed (203 mm). The contribution of climate variability was 94%, whereas LULC contributes only 6% from 2003 to 2017. Climate variability negatively led to water supply variation while LULC change contributed positively from 2010 to 2017. Although the ongoing soil and water conservation (SWC) practices improved vegetation cover and water retention of the watershed, climate variability is the main driver of water supply variation. Therefore, SWC practices should incorporate ecosystem-based climate change adaptation strategies and scale up to community-based integrated watershed management to sustain water supply.","[Belete, Marye; Deng, Jinsong; Abubakar, Ghali A.; Wang, Ke; Zhu, Enyan; Gudo, Adam] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China; [Belete, Marye] Debre Tabor Univ, Dept Nat Resource Management, Debre Tabor, Ethiopia; [Teshome, Menberu] Debre Tabor Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Debre Tabor, Ethiopia; [Woldetsadik, Muluneh] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Comber, Alexis] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Zhejiang University; Addis Ababa University; University of Leeds,"Deng, JS (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China.",marye_belete@zju.edu.cn; jsong_deng@zju.edu.cn; ghaliaa@zju.edu.cn; menberuteshome@gmail.com; kwang@zju.edu.cn; mabshare@gmail.com; eyzhu@zju.edu.cn; a.comber@leeds.ac.uk; 11714072@zju.edu.cn,"Alemayehu, Marye Belete/ABD-3164-2020; Comber, Alexis/O-4170-2014","Alemayehu, Marye Belete/0000-0001-5094-1560; Comber, Alexis/0000-0002-3652-7846",Zhejiang University; University of Leeds; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41701171]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LY18G030006],Zhejiang University; University of Leeds; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province),"International Cooperation Regional Development Project between Zhejiang University and the University of Leeds; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41701171; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: LY18G030006",,75,14,14,7,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1085-3278,1099-145X,,LAND DEGRAD DEV,Land Degrad.

In this discourse, adaptation planning and implementation at the local level are seen as particularly important for developing robust responses to climate change. However, it is not clear whether the mantra that adaptation is local holds true given the multi-level nature of climate risk governance. Using a multi-method approach, this paper examines the extent to which adaptation should be framed as a local issue and, specifically, the role of local government in adaptation relative to other actors. In so doing, the paper first explores the extent to which the local framing of adaptation is embedded in the international adaptation literature. This is followed by a specific case study from Southeast Queensland, Australia, which focuses on the critical examination of the processes of responsibility shifting and taking among actors involved in coastal adaptation planning. Results indicate the assumption that adaptation is local remains widely held in adaptation science, although counter arguments can be readily identified. Interviews with adaptation actors revealed unclear divisions of responsibility for climate change adaptation as a significant constraint on actors' willingness to implement adaptation. Furthermore, attributing responsibility for adaptation to local actors might not necessarily be a robust strategy, due to the existence of particularly strong constraints and value conflicts at local levels of governance. Greater appreciation by researchers and practitioners for the interactions between local actors and those at higher levels of governance in shaping response capacity may contribute to more equitable and effective allocations of responsibilities for adaptation action.

Hence, fair and equitable water allocation to different water use sectors and environmental needs is important for climate change adaptation in order to reduce negative effects on human well-being and aquatic ecosystems. We applied a system of coupled sectoral metamodels of water availability and water use in the domestic, manufacturing industry, electricity generation, and agricultural sectors to simulate the effects of generic water allocation schemes (WAS) at the European level. The relative performance of WAS in balancing adverse impacts on the water use sectors and aquatic ecosystems was analysed for an ensemble of 16 scenarios for the 2050s, which were built from the combination of four socio-economic scenarios, developed in the CLIMSAVE project, and four climate projections based on IPCC A1. The results indicate that significant physical water shortages may result from climate and socio-economic change in many regions of Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean. In the energy sector, average annual water demand can largely be met even in water allocation schemes that deprioritise the sector. However, prioritisation of agricultural water demand has significant adverse impacts on the domestic and manufacturing industry sectors. Cross-sectoral impacts were found to be lowest if at least one of the domestic and manufacturing sectors is assigned higher priority than agriculture. We conclude that adapting spatial patterns of water-intensive activities to renewable water availability across Europe, such as shifting irrigated agriculture to less water-stressed basins, could be an effective demand-side adaptation measure, and thus a candidate for support through EU policy.","[Wimmer, Florian; Malsy, Marcus; Schaldach, Ruediger; Floerke, Martina] Univ Kassel, Ctr Environm Syst Res, D-34109 Kassel, Germany; [Audsley, Eric] Cranfield Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Bedford MK43 0AL, England; [Savin, Cristina] TIAMASG Fdn, Bucharest 010963, Romania; [Dunford, Robert; Harrison, Paula A.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",Universitat Kassel; University of Oxford,"Wimmer, F (corresponding author), Univ Kassel, Ctr Environm Syst Res, D-34109 Kassel, Germany.",wimmer@usf.uni-kassel.de,"Floerke, Martina/ABE-6288-2020; Harrison, Paula Ann/K-1519-2016","Harrison, Paula Ann/0000-0002-9873-3338; Floerke, Martina/0000-0003-2943-5289; Dunford, Robert/0000-0002-6559-1687; Rinciog Savin, Cristina/0000-0001-9529-271X",European Commission [244031],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme under Grant Agreement No. 244031 (The CLIMSAVE Project; Climate change integrated assessment methodology for cross-sectoral adaptation and vulnerability in Europe; www.climsave.eu).

Anthropogenic climate change is one of the consequences of an increase in the emission of greenhouse gases. Green building practice may be helpful in reducing the emissions. Focusing on the importance of green building and climate change, this study was conducted in Bangladesh to understand the potentiality of green building practice as an adaptation to climate change. To fulfill the objective, 21 key informant interviews and four in-depth interviews were conducted with experts from various government and non-government sectors in Bangladesh. From the findings, it has been revealed that design and construction efficiency, and reduction of energy use are the highest ranked indicators of green building, furthermore, environment-friendly design and construction, and long-term resource efficiency aspects should be included in the design and construction practices of Bangladesh. The consensus is that, buildings should be designed to be more energy-efficient. Besides, the efficient use of roof gardens, climate change mitigation, and long-term resiliencies are identified as the most highlighted sub-indicators from the economic and social perspectives of green building benefits in Bangladesh. Although several organizations are working on green buildings in Bangladesh, a majority of the experts (57%) said the evaluating tools are not in place yet. Besides, public perceptions toward a new change and a lack of regulatory authorities are marked as major obstacles for implementing green building practices.

With increasing surface temperature, future suitable areas for crop production will see an altitude shift. Such shift is an adaptation response of crops to climate change. However, in the study area there are a limited number of studies that have dealt with geographical shifts of crops caused by climate change. This study was conducted with the aim of assessing impacts of climate change on altitudinal migration of crops and length of growing period (LGP). The climate and crop modeling study were carried out using ArcGIS, Diva GIS and MaxEnt using 30 years of climate data for the period 1980 to 2009. Results showed that wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) would migrate upward along the altitudinal gradients in the coming 80 years. However, areas under these crops are expected to drop by 16-100%. Highly impacted areas are expected to increase, whereas low impacted and new suitable areas are expected to decline significantly. Suitable areas for sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and teff (Eragrostis tef Zucc.) production are expected to increase. While wheat and barley are projected to be highly affected by future climate change, sorghum and teff should be relatively stable. No significant difference was observed in LGP between the considered RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 climate scenarios. Therefore, this study concluded that upward movement of crops was one mechanism to adapt to climate change, and new varieties resilient to future climate change needs to be developed.","[Gebresamuel, Girmay; Haile, Mitiku] Mekelle Univ, Dept Land Resources Management & Environm Protect, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Abrha, Haftu; Hagos, Haftom] Mekelle Univ, Inst Climate & Soc, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Abrha, Haftu] Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, Cote Ivoire African Ctr Excellence Climate Change, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Hagos, Haftom] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, Enschede, Netherlands; [Elias, Eyasu] Addis Abeba Univ, Coll Nat & Computat Sci, Ctr Environm Sci, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Mekelle University; Mekelle University; University of Twente; Addis Ababa University,"Gebresamuel, G (corresponding author), Mekelle Univ, Dept Land Resources Management & Environm Protect, Mekelle, Ethiopia.",girmaygsamuel@gmail.com,"Gebremeskel, Haftom Hagos/B-7310-2019","Gebremeskel, Haftom Hagos/0000-0002-9041-712X","Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Addis Ababa (BENEFIT-CASCAPE Project), Ethiopia [pc16/CDI415]","Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Addis Ababa (BENEFIT-CASCAPE Project), Ethiopia","This work was supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Addis Ababa (BENEFIT-CASCAPE Project), Ethiopia [pc16/CDI415].",,45,1,1,2,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1542-7528,1542-7536,,J CROP IMPROV,J.

By doing so, they can help producers reduce risks due to climate variability and change. A national survey of United States Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency (FSA) field staff (n = 4621) was conducted in 2016. The survey was designed to assess FSA employees' use of climate and weather-related data and explore their perspectives on climate change, attitudes toward adaptation and concerns regarding climate- and weather-driven risks. Two structural equation models were developed to explore relationships between these factors, and to predict respondents' willingness to integrate climate and weather data into their professional services in the future. The two models were compared with assess the relative influence of respondents' current use of weather and climate information. Findings suggest that respondents' perceptions of weather-related risk in combination with their personal observations of weather variability help predict whether an individual intends to use weather and climate information in the future. Importantly, climate change belief is not a significant predictor of this intention; however, the belief that producers will have to adapt to climate change in order to remain viable is. Surprisingly, whether or not an individual currently uses weather and climate information is not a good predictor of whether they intend to in the future. This suggests that there are opportunities to increase employee exposure and proficiency with weather and climate information to meet the needs of American farmers by helping them to reduce risk.","[Schattman, Rachel E.] Univ Vermont Extens, US Forest Serv, USDA, 140 Kennedy Dr,Suite 201, S Burlington, VT 05403 USA; [Roesch-McNally, Gabrielle] US Forest Serv, USDA, 3200 SW Jefferson St, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Wiener, Sarah] US Forest Serv, USDA, Southern Res Stn, 920 Main Campus Dr,Suite 300, Raleigh, NC 27606 USA; [Niles, Meredith T.] Univ Vermont, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, Food Syst Program, 350 Carrigan Wing,Marsh Life Sci Bldg, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Hollinger, David Y.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Northern Res Stn, 271 Mast Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; University of Vermont; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Schattman, RE (corresponding author), Univ Vermont Extens, US Forest Serv, USDA, 140 Kennedy Dr,Suite 201, S Burlington, VT 05403 USA.",rschattm@uvm.edu,"Schattman, Rachel/AAX-4080-2020; Hollinger, David Y/G-7185-2012","Schattman, Rachel/0000-0001-7177-3914; ",,,,,66,10,10,1,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1742-1705,1742-1713,,RENEW AGR FOOD SYST,Renew.

Still, electricity reaches only about half of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), while about 40% live under the poverty line. Heavily reliant on the agriculture sector and increasingly affected by prolonged droughts, small-scale irrigation could be instrumental for development and climate change adaptation in SSA countries. A bottom-up understanding of the demand for irrigation and associated energy services is essential for designing viable energy supply options in an effective manner. Using Uganda as a case study, the study introduces a GIS-based methodology for the estimation of groundwater irrigation requirements through which energy demand is derived. Results are generated for two scenarios: (a) a reference scenario and (b) a drought scenario. The most critical need is observed in the northern and southern regions of the country. The total annual irrigation demand is estimated to be ca. 90 thousand m(3), with the highest demand observed in the months of December through February, with an average irrigation demand of 445 mm per month. The highest energy demand is observed in the northern part of the study area in January, reaching 48 kWh/ha. The average energy demand increases by 67% in the drought scenario. The study contributes to current gaps in the existing literature by providing a replicable methodological framework and data aimed at facilitating energy system planning through the consideration of location-specific characteristics at the nexus of energy-water-agriculture.","[Nilsson, Anna] NewClimate Inst, D-10119 Berlin, Germany; [Mentis, Dimitrios] World Resources Inst, Washington, DC 20002 USA; [Korkovelos, Alexandros] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Otwani, Joel] GIZ Promot Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency P, Kampala 256, Uganda",The World Bank,"Nilsson, A (corresponding author), NewClimate Inst, D-10119 Berlin, Germany.",a.nilsson@newclimate.org; Dimitrios.Mentis@wri.org; akorkovelos@worldbank.org; otwanijoel@gmail.com,,"Nilsson, Anna/0000-0001-8392-7036; Korkovelos, Alexandros/0000-0001-5487-1002",World Resources Institute (WRI); Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),World Resources Institute (WRI); Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),This paper was co-supervised by Dimitrios Mentis with support from the World Resources Institute (WRI) and Alexandros Korkovelos with support from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH).

While good management of nitrogen (N) is paramount to achieving this objective, the efficient strategies developed for temperate systems are often not adapted to the specificities of Mediterranean systems. In this work, we combine original data with a thorough literature review to highlight the most relevant drivers of N dynamics in these semi-arid systems. To do so, we provide an analysis at nested scales combining a bottom-up approach from the field scale, with a top-down approach considering the agro-food system where cropping systems are inserted. We analyze the structural changes in the agro-food systems affecting total N entering the territory, the contrasting response of yields to N availability under rainfed and irrigated conditions in a precipitation gradient, the interaction between N management and climate change adaptation, the main drivers affecting the release of Nr compounds (nitrate, ammonia, nitric oxide and nitrous oxide) compared with temperate systems and finally, the behavior of N once exported to highly regulated river networks. We conclude that sustainable N management in Mediterranean cropping systems requires the specific adaptation of practices to particular local agro-environmental characteristics with special emphasis on water availability for rainfed and irrigated systems. This approach should also include a systemic analysis of N input into the territory that is driven by the configuration of the agro-food system.","[Lassaletta, Luis; Sanz-Cobena, Alberto; Aguilera, Eduardo; Quemada, Miguel; Ruiz Ramos, Margarita; Vallejo, Antonio] Univ Politecn Madrid, CEIGRAM, ETSI Agron Alimentaria & Biosistemas, Madrid, Spain; [Billen, Gilles] Sorbonne Univ, UMR 7619 Metis, Paris, Ile De France, France; [Bondeau, Alberte; Cramer, Wolfgang] Avignon Univ, CNRS, IRD, IMBE,Aix Marseille Univ, Aix En Provence, France; [Cayuela, Maria Luz; Eekhout, Joris P.

Moreover, proper understanding of flood risks and their potential impacts on climate change appears to be a communication challenge. In climate change communication, the effect of framing congruency on perception of risk, efficacy and behavioural intentions towards climate change adaptation and mitigation has received limited attention. Messages have not been congruent in framing risks associated with climate change. We define congruency as the coherent alignment of several aspects of message content. Messages are considered congruent when they provide recipients with consistent contents such as giving concrete and actionable advice, or by providing more abstract and general background information. This research focuses on climate change communication in fostering mitigation behaviours among adolescents in vulnerable locations in the global South. Based on Construal Level Theory, this paper investigates how message congruency affects the link between perceptions of climate change risk and efficacy and two predictors of behavioural change: perceived responsibility and mitigation intentions. We conducted an experiment to test the effect of congruent vs. incongruent risk communication among adolescents in highly vulnerable coastal communities in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam (N = 348). Multiple regression analysis found strong effects of congruency in message framing; when messages were congruent in the content, communicative interventions changed adolescents' perceptions and attitudes toward climate change mitigation more consistently. This research contributes both theoretically and practically to risk communication among adolescents and toward climate change mitigation behaviour.","[Ngo, Chinh C.] Asian Management & Dev Inst, Res Ctr Disaster Risk Reduct & Climate Change, Hanoi 10000, Vietnam; [Ngo, Chinh C.; Poortvliet, P.

Excessive heat exposure is a particular problem for working people because of the internal heat production when muscle work is carried out. The physiological basis for severe heat stroke, other clinical effects, and heat exhaustion is well known. One feature of this health effect of excessive workplace heat exposure is reduced work capacity, and new research has started to quantify this effect in the context of climate change. Current climate conditions in tropical and subtropical parts of the world are already so hot during the hot seasons that occupational health effects occur and work capacity for many working people is affected. The Hothaps-Soft database and software and ClimateCHIP.org website make it possible to rapidly produce estimates of local heat conditions and trends. The results can be mapped to depict the spatial distribution of workplace heat stress. In South-East Asia as much as 15% to 20% of annual work hours may already be lost in heat-exposed jobs, and this may double by 2050 as global climate change progresses. By combining heat exposure data and estimates of the economic consequences, the vulnerability of many low- and middle-income countries is evident. The annual cost of reduced labor productivity at country level already in 2030 can be several percent of GDP, which means billions of US dollars even for medium-size countries. The results provide new arguments for effective climate change adaptation and mitigation policies and preventive actions in all countries.","[Kjellstrom, Tord] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden; [Kjellstrom, Tord] Health & Environm Int Trust, 168 Stafford Dr, Mapua 07005, Nelson, New Zealand; [Kjellstrom, Tord] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Kjellstrom, Tord] UCL, London, England",Lund University; Australian National University; University of London; University College London,"Kjellstrom, T (corresponding author), Health & Environm Int Trust, 168 Stafford Dr, Mapua 07005, Nelson, New Zealand.",kjellstromt@yahoo.com,,,"Australian National University; Umea University (Sweden); Tromso University (Norway); Pufendorf Institute, Lund University, Sweden","Australian National University(Australian National University); Umea University (Sweden); Tromso University (Norway); Pufendorf Institute, Lund University, Sweden","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The Hothaps work has benefitted from academic and financial support from the Australian National University, Umea University (Sweden), Tromso University (Norway), and most recently from the Pufendorf Institute, Lund University, Sweden.",,21,67,68,2,59,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1010-5395,1941-2479,,ASIA-PAC J PUBLIC HE,Asia-Pac.

Results are presented based on a stylized version of a multi-use reservoir management model adapted from Angat Dam, Philippines. Analysis focuses on October-March, during which climatological inflow declines as the dry season arrives, and reservoir management becomes critical and challenging. Inflow is assumed to be impacted by climate fluctuations representing interannual variation (white noise), decadal to multidecadal variability (MDV, here represented by a stochastic autoregressive process) and global change (GC), here represented by a systematic linear trend in seasonal inflow total over the simulation period of 2008-2047. Stochastic (Monte Carlo) simulations are undertaken to explore reservoir performance. In this way, reservoir reliability and risk of extreme persistent water deficit are assessed in the presence of different combinations and magnitudes of GC and MDV. The effectiveness of dynamic management is then explored as a possible climate change adaptation practice, focusing on reservoir performance in the presence of a 20 % downward inflow trend. In these dynamic management experiments, the October-March water allocation each year is adjusted based on seasonal forecasts and updated climate normals. The results illustrate how, in the near-term, MDV can be as significant as GC in impact for this kind of climate-related problem. The results also illustrate how dynamic management can mitigate the impacts. Overall, this type of analysis can deliver guidance on the expected benefits and risks of different management strategies and climate scenarios.","[Brown, Casey M.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Baroang, Kye M.] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Kaheil, Yasir H.] Risk Management Solut, Newark, CA 94560 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Columbia University,,mneilward@gmail.com,,"Ward, Neil/0000-0003-1385-0349",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA050AR4311004]; United States Agency for International Development [DFD-A-00-03-00005-00],National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"This work has benefited from comments by Upmanu Lall, Shiv Someshwar, Andrew Robertson, Bradfield Lyon and David Watkins.

East Boston is predominantly a residential area with some industrial and commercial activities, particularly along the coastal fringe. Everett, a city to the north of Boston, has a diversified industrial and commercial base. While these two communities have similar socioeconomic characteristics, they differ substantially in the extent to which residents would be impacted by increased coastal flooding. In East Boston, a large portion of residents would be flooded, while in Everett, it is the commercial/industrial districts that are primarily vulnerable. Through a series of workshops with residents in each community, we found that the target populations do not have an adaptation perspective or knowledge of any resources that could assist them in this challenge. Furthermore, they do not feel included in the planning processes within their communities. However, a common incentive for both communities was an intense commitment to their communities and an eagerness to learn more and become actively engaged in decisions regarding climate change adaptation. The lessons that can be applied to other studies include 1) images are powerful tools in communicating concepts, 2) understanding existing cultural knowledge and values in adaptation planning is essential to the planning process and 3) engaging local residents at the beginning of the process can create important educational opportunities and develop trust and consensus that is necessary for moving from concept to implementation.","[Douglas, Ellen M.; Wiggin, Jack] Univ Massachusetts, Urban Harbors Inst, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Kirshen, Paul H.] Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Paolisso, Michael; Enrici, Ashley] Univ Maryland, Dept Anthropol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Ruth, Matthias] Univ Maryland, Ctr Integrat Environm Res, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Douglas, EM (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Urban Harbors Inst, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",ellen.douglas@umb.edu,,,NOAA [NAO08OAR4310722],NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"This research was funded by a grant from the NOAA Sectoral Applications Research Program (SARP; NAO08OAR4310722).

When the focus of adaptation is a single geographical region, this potential for interaction between sectoral policies is heightened due to spatial, political and functional proximities. This paper analyses interactions within three suites of climate adaptation options developed for Australia's 'South-East Queensland' region relating to: (1) wetland migration, coastal infrastructure and planned retreat; (2) urban water security and energy demand; and (3) terrestrial biodiversity and agricultural viability. Using the concept of 'institutional interplay' to structure a process of dialogue amongst researchers, we identify a number of critical implementation requirements for successful regional-scale adaptation. There is a need for greater focus on neighbourhood or sub-regional scales of policy design and intervention, particularly for the coordination of adapted infrastructure and services to households. Policy-makers must also be more explicit in considering broader drivers of land-use change and economic adjustment likely to impact on proposed adaptations. In considering these issues, our paper also demonstrates a process for conducting cross-sectoral syntheses that can be employed in other regional-scale adaptation studies.","[Taylor, Bruce M.; McAllister, Ryan R.

Since surface evaporation explains most of the lake's water losses, reliable estimates are paramount to the prediction of global warming impacts on Lake Titicaca and to the region's water resource planning and adaptation to climate change. Evaporation estimates were done in the past at monthly time steps and using the four methods as follows: water balance, heat balance, and the mass transfer and Penman's equations. The obtained annual evaporation values showed significant dispersion. This study used new, daily frequency hydrometeorological measurements. Evaporation losses were calculated following the mentioned methods using both daily records and their monthly averages to assess the impact of higher temporal resolution data in the evaporation estimates. Changes in the lake heat storage needed for the heat balance method were estimated based on the morning water surface temperature, because convection during nights results in a well-mixed top layer every morning over a constant temperature depth. We found that the most reliable method for determining the annual lake evaporation was the heat balance approach, although the Penman equation allows for an easier implementation based on generally available meteorological parameters. The mean annual lake evaporation was found to be 1700 mm year(-1). This value is considered an upper limit of the annual evaporation, since the main study period was abnormally warm. The obtained upper limit lowers by 200 mm year(-1), the highest evaporation estimation obtained previously, thus reducing the uncertainty in the actual value. Regarding the evaporation estimates using daily and monthly averages, these resulted in minor differences for all methodologies.","[Pillco Zola, Ramiro; Mollericon, Luis] Univ Mayor San Andres, Inst Hidraul & Hidrol, La Paz, Bolivia; [Bengtsson, Lars; Berndtsson, Ronny] Lund Univ, Div Water Resources Engn, Lund, Sweden; [Bengtsson, Lars; Berndtsson, Ronny] Lund Univ, Ctr Middle Eastern Studies, Lund, Sweden; [Marti-Cardona, Belen] Univ Surrey, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Satge, Frederic] Univ Montpellier, CNES, UMR HydroSci, Pl E Bataillon, F-34395 Montpellier 5, France; [Timouk, Franck] Univ Paul Sabatier, Lab GET, OMP, IRD,CNRS,UMR5563, Toulouse, France; [Bonnet, Marie-Paule] IRD, UMR Espace Dev, Maison Teledetect,500 Rue JF Breton, F-34093 Montpellier 5, France; [Gamarra, Cesar; Pasapera, Jose] Inst Mar Peru, IMARPE, Puno, Peru",Universidad Mayor de San Andres; Lund University; Lund University; University of Surrey; Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Universite des Antilles; University of La Reunion; Instituto del Mar del Peru,"Zola, RP (corresponding author), Univ Mayor San Andres, Inst Hidraul & Hidrol, La Paz, Bolivia.",rpillco@umsa.edu.bo,"Berndtsson, Ronny/C-7449-2015; Bonnet, Marie-Paule/J-6888-2016","Berndtsson, Ronny/0000-0003-1473-0138; Bonnet, Marie-Paule/0000-0002-3950-4041; Marti-Cardona, Belen/0000-0001-7519-1399; SATGE, Frederic/0000-0003-3662-6876; Pillco Zola, Ramiro Simon/0000-0002-4025-6444",TOSCA-CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales),TOSCA-CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales)(Centre National D'etudes Spatiales),"We would like to express our sincere appreciation to the HASM, Research Programme - Hydrology of Altiplano from Space to Modeling at GET-IRD and IHH-UMSA (Instituto de Hidraulica e Hidrologia, UMSA, Bolivia), financed by the TOSCA-CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales).

To meet this challenge, while also adapting to climate change, agriculture will have to become more knowledge intensive and deploy smarter farming techniques. The intention of this study was to: (1) Highlight the opportunity for web--based knowledge exchange to increase farm productivity and thus contribute to achieving food and energy security, (2) Give some examples of online farming information services such as the CROPROTECT tool I am developing in the UK, the CABI Plantwise Knowledge Bank and the IRRI Rice Doctor, and (3) Consider lessons learnt so far. There are huge opportunities to facilitate knowledge exchange through online systems for farmers and people who advise farmers. CROPROTECT is interacting with users to determine priorities in terms of the pests, weeds, and diseases covered and is providing key information to assist with their management. Knowledge is a critical input for farming systems. Crop protection in particular is becoming more difficult due to evolution of pest resistance and changes in legislation. Up to date information can be made rapidly available and shared online through websites and smartphone Apps. Agricultural extension no longer relies solely on physical meetings and printed documents. The capacity to share information via the Internet is tremendous with its potential to reach a wide audience in the farming community, to provide rapid updates and to interact more with the users. However, in an era of information deluge, accessing relevant information and ensuring reliability are essential considerations. There is also a need to bring science and farming communities together to turn information into relevant farming knowledge.","[Bruce, Toby J.

In order to optimize UGI for a given city, a first step is to assess the local ES needs and the potential barriers to ES provision. However, it is not known how consistent these needs and barriers are among cities in different settings. To help address this knowledge gap, the aim of this study was to assess ES priorities and existing barriers to ES provision for three cities varying in socioeconomic, cultural and climatic setting: Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), Cincinnati (USA) and Malmo (Sweden). In case studies of each of the three cities, we carried out workshops with key stakeholders and collected their assessments of both current provision of ES from UGI and future priorities. The workshops were followed by expert stakeholder interviews aimed at highlighting existing barriers to ES provision. In spite of the different urban contexts, expressed ES priorities were similar among the cities, with the highest cross-cutting priorities being climate change adaptation, stormwater runoff management and water quality, mental and physical health, biodiversity, and provision of local food. Stakeholder-expressed barriers to ES provision were also broadly similar among cities, falling into three main categories: structural pressures, gaps in governance, and lack of ecological awareness and vision. Our results suggest that certain key ES priorities and barriers may apply broadly to cities regardless of climatic or socio-cultural context. These generic needs can help direct the focus of future studies, and imply a clear benefit to international, even cross-continental study and knowledge-exchange among practitioners and researchers working with UGI.","[Buffam, Ishi; Hagemann, Frederik Aagaard; Emilsson, Tobias; Randrup, Thomas Barfoed; Sang, Asa Ode] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Landscape Architecture Planning & Management, Alnarp, Sweden; [Gamstetter, David] Univ Cincinnati, Coll Design Art Architecture & Planning, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Gamstetter, David] Davey Resource Grp, Kent, OH USA; [Palsdottir, Anna Maria] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept People & Soc, Alnarp, Sweden; [Yeshitela, Kumelachew] Addis Ababa Univ, Ethiopian Inst Architecture Bldg Construct & City, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Addis Ababa University,"Buffam, I (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Landscape Architecture Planning & Management, Alnarp, Sweden.",ishi.buffam@slu.se,"B.

Specifically, we assessed farming practices of a coastal smallholder farming community in Kilifi County (hereinafter Kilifi), Kenya, to identify barriers to climate services' effective use. The smallholder farmers in Kilifi represent many smallholder farming communities in East Africa whose primary livelihood is rainfed agriculture. First, we carried out an analysis of historical and future rainfall patterns over Kilifi to determine the area's climate patterns. We used a set of five descriptors of rainfall in Kilifi representing seasonal mean daily precipitation and annual precipitation intensity (SDII) and rainy days (R1MM) for the analysis. We assessed March-May (MAM), June-August (JJA), and October-December (OND) seasons, corresponding to the three planting seasons in Kilifi. Here, values for the five descriptors in the historical period (1977-2005) were compared with those in the future period (2071-2099) to determine the potential changes in the rainfall patterns. Results showed high year-to-year rainfall variability, relatively low mean daily rainfall per season, high variability within seasons, and uneven distribution of rainfall within seasons. MAM, OND, and SDII showed an increase in the future period while JJA recorded a considerable reduction in rainfall. No discernible changes were recorded for R1MM. Results from a social survey showed that the smallholder farmers in Kilifi were indeed experiencing climate variability and change. While some effort had been made towards building the farmers' adaptive capacity, the interventions were reported to be too sporadic and inadequately coordinated to achieve meaningful results. Through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), Key-Informant Interviews (KIIs), and literature review, an innovative climate change adaptation model was developed. Thus, this study provides a preliminary framework for strengthening an enabling environment for climate services for agricultural productivity and sustainable development in a changing climate.","[Ogega, Obed M.; Koske, James; Kungu, James B.] Kenyatta Univ, Sch Environm Studies, Nairobi, Kenya; [Ogega, Obed M.] African Acad Sci, 8 Miotoni Lane, Nairobi, Kenya; [Gyampoh, Benjamin A.] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Fisheries & Watershed Management, Kumasi, Ghana; [Oludhe, Christopher] Univ Nairobi, Inst Climate Change & Adaptat, Nairobi, Kenya",Kenyatta University; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Nairobi,"Ogega, OM (corresponding author), African Acad Sci, 8 Miotoni Lane, Nairobi, Kenya.",o.ogega@aasciences.africa,"Ogega, Obed Matundura/AAY-5081-2021; Gyampoh, Benjamin Apraku/C-3816-2016","Ogega, Obed Matundura/0000-0003-4314-6969; Gyampoh, Benjamin Apraku/0000-0003-2069-7071","Coastal Oceans Research and Development - Indian Ocean (CORDIO) East Africa, through the Emerging Knowledge project team; Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association MASMA Programme [MASMA/OP/2013/01]","Coastal Oceans Research and Development - Indian Ocean (CORDIO) East Africa, through the Emerging Knowledge project team; Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association MASMA Programme","The lead author thanks the Coastal Oceans Research and Development - Indian Ocean (CORDIO) East Africa, through the Emerging Knowledge project team, for their generous technical, financial, and moral support for the fieldwork part of the research.

We then applied conditional logistic regression within a case-crossover design to estimate the odds of death from heat exposure by individual (age, sex) and local area factors: land-use type, natural environment (vegetation index, tree cover, domestic garden), built environment (indoor temperature, housing type, lone occupancy) and socio-economic factors (deprivation, English language, level of employment and prevalence of ill-health). Results: Temperatures were higher in neighbourhoods with lower levels of urban vegetation and with higher levels of income deprivation, social-rented housing, and non-native English speakers. Heat-related mortality increased with temperature increase (Odds Ratio (OR), 95% CI=1.039, 1.036-1.043 per 1 degrees C temperature increase). Vegetation cover showed the greatest modification effect, for example the odds of heat-related mortality in quartiles with the highest and lowest tree cover were OR, 95%CI 1.033, 1.026-1.039 and 1.043, 1.037-1.050 respectively. None of the socio-economic variables were a significant modifier of heat-related mortality. Conclusions: We demonstrate that urban vegetation can modify the mortality risk associated with heat exposure. These findings make an important contribution towards informing city-level climate change adaptation and mitigation policies.","[Murage, Peninah; Kovats, Sari; Hajat, Shakoor] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, HPRU Environm Change & Hlth, London, England; [Sarran, Christophe; McInnes, Rachel] Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; [Taylor, Jonathon] UCL, Inst Environm Design & Engn, London, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Met Office - UK; University of London; University College London,"Murage, P (corresponding author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Publ Hlth Soc & Environm PHES, 15-17 Tavistock Pl,Kings Cross, London WC1H 9SH, England.",Peninah.Murage@lshtm.ac.uk,"Taylor, Jonathon/B-1558-2018","Taylor, Jonathon/0000-0003-3485-1404; Kovats, Sari/0000-0002-4823-8099; Murage, Peninah/0000-0002-4506-0897","National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Environmental Change and Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; Public Health England (PHE); UK Met Office - Wellcome Trust for the 'Complex Urban Systems for Sustainability and Health' (CUSSH) project [205207/Z/16/Z, 209387/Z/17/Z]; EPSRC [EP/P022405/1] Funding Source: UKRI; MRC [MR/K019341/1] Funding Source: UKRI",National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Environmental Change and Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; Public Health England (PHE); UK Met Office - Wellcome Trust for the 'Complex Urban Systems for Sustainability and Health' (CUSSH) project; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"The research was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Environmental Change and Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in partnership with Public Health England (PHE), and in collaboration with the University of Exeter, University College London, and the UK Met Office.

We developed and applied an innovative approach for regional parameterization, and calibration of the CENTURY ecosystem model. We quantified spatio temporal variation of soil organic carbon stock (SOC) and above ground plant biomass production (AGB) and examined their responses to the recent climate change across a diverse range of native grassland systems in Alberta, western Canada. The simultaneous integration of SOC and AGB into calibration and analysis accounted for most of the spatio temporal variability in the SOC and AGB measurements and resulted in reduced simulation uncertainty across nine grassland regions. These findings suggest the importance of the systematic parameterization and calibration for the reliable assessment of carbon-related ES across a wide geographic area with heterogeneous ecological conditions. Simulation results showed a pronounced variation in the spatial distribution of SOC and AGB and their associated uncertainty across grassland regions. Under baseline grazing intensity regime, an overall negative effect of recent climatic changes on the SOC, and a less consistent effect on the AGO were found. While, an overall positive or slightly negative impact of recent climate change on the SOC and AGB was found under a proposed 10% lower grazing intensity regime. These heterogeneities in the magnitude and direction of climate change effects under different grazing regimes suggest needs for a range of climate change adaptation strategies to maintain carbon-related ES in Alberta's grasslands. The modeling framework developed in this study can be used to improve the spatially explicit assessment of carbon-related ES in other geographically vast grassland areas and examine the effectiveness of alternative management scenarios to ensure the long-term provision of carbon-related ES in grassland systems.

Together with long-term drought, they are the main factors contributing to wildfires. Surprisingly, the quantitative and objective analysis leading to the identification and characterization of HW in current and future climate conditions as well as its influence on the occurrence of extreme wildfires (EW) has never been performed for Portugal and are the main objectives of this study. For this reason, we assess HW in recent past and future climate based on a consistent high resolution meteorological database and have compared their occurrence with long and reliable, precise and detailed information about Portuguese fire events. Results include the characterization of HW frequency, duration, seasonality and intensity for current and different future climate conditions and their relationship with EW occurrence. We detected 130 HW between 1981 and 2010, concentrated between May and October and highest values in July and August. The highest HW number and duration is found over the Northeast corner and the south of the country while highest amplitudes are typically located in central area. HW characteristics present high inter-annual variability but are clearly associated to the temporal and spatial distribution of EW: 97% of total number of EW were active during an HW, 90% of total EW days were also HW days; 82% of the EW had duration completely contained in the duration of an HW; and, 83% of EW occurred during and in the area affected by HW. Our results also show that HW should increase in number, duration and amplitude, more significantly for RCP 8.5, and for the 30-year periods near the end of the 21st century. Findings of this study will support the definition of climate change adaptation strategies for fire danger and risk management. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Parente, J.; Pereira, M.

The currently adopted flood adaptation policy is continuing infrastructural protection (CIP), under which the infrastructure, such as levees or roads, is raised gradually in response to the rising water. Since the Devils Lake city and the adjacent communities are built within the historical confines of the lake, we introduce and estimate potential costs of two diametrical, but long-term targeted adaptation strategies involving either buyout or relocation (B/R) to contrast against the CIP. The comparison shows that B/R, while more expensive initially, would be cheaper than CIP accumulated over longer term. We further explore the reason that policymakers prefer CIP: the near-term uncertainty regarding the future lake levels has led to significant discount of long-term potential risk. With future risk significantly discounted, not only B/R, but any other alternatives that feature long-term perspective, could become less attractive than CIP. Were we able to predict the flooding more accurately or willing to discount future less, we might have chosen a different plan of action. The ultimate choice of CIP among the possible adaptation options reveals that policymakers have privileged the present and favored near-term remedies instead of long-term solutions. Although certainly not on the same scale, the lesson we have learned in dealing with Devils Lake has far-reaching implications on climate change adaptation strategies. The passive decision to wait and ignore the full potential for disaster ultimately leaves us with no other option, but to continue to wait and see and then spend more.","[Zheng, Haochi; Zhang, Xiaodong] Univ N Dakota, Dept Earth Syst Sci & Policy, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA; [Barta, David] US Dept Interior, Washington, DC 20240 USA",University of North Dakota Grand Forks; United States Department of the Interior,"Zheng, HC (corresponding author), Univ N Dakota, Dept Earth Syst Sci & Policy, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA.",hzheng@aero.und.edu,"Zheng, Haochi/E-5895-2019","Zheng, Haochi/0000-0002-9090-4729","NASA [NNX10AH20G, NNX09AQ81G, NNX09AO 06G]; NASA [104040, NNX09AQ81G] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER; EPSCoR; Office Of The Director [0814442] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); EPSCoR; Office Of The Director(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)),"Funding for this work was provided by NASA under contracts NNX10AH20G, NNX09AQ81G, and NNX09AO 06G.

Drawing on assemblage theory and social network analysis in a novel way, this study explores the influence of Oregonian small farmers' social and informational networks on their beliefs about and responses to climate change. The use of assemblage theory, which focuses on many disparate elements as they co-function in a space, allows for multiple entities within farmers' networks and the ways they interact to be examined, while the use of social network analysis highlights broader patterns in the structure and composition of farmers' networks. Theoretically, this study brings these two distinct yet similar bodies of theory and methodologies together for the first time to expand the utility of both fields and explore farmers' networks in a novel way. Results indicate that small farmers' connections to other farmers and media in their networks are influencing their beliefs about climate change, while their responses are influenced by their ties to various agricultural and climatological information sources, as well as other nearby farmers. Finally, while farmers' ties to other farmers are largely limited to those nearby, certain central individuals and entities, particularly beginning farmers, can act as bridges linking distinct groups of farmers. An understanding of these networks can be used to better disseminate critical information, such as forecasts and adaptation strategies, to help farmers adapt.","[Parks, Melissa] Oregon State Univ, Anthropol Dept, 2250 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA",Oregon State University,"Parks, M (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Anthropol Dept, 2250 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA.",parksmel@oregonstate.edu,,,National Science Foundation Cultural Anthropology Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant Program [BCS-1947512],National Science Foundation Cultural Anthropology Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant Program,"This study was funded by the National Science Foundation Cultural Anthropology Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant Program (#BCS-1947512).

The agreement no longer emphasizes the differences between countries of the North and South. It requested each country to outline and communicate their post-2020 climate actions. which were legally termed as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). However, in the process of negotiating the implementation rules and regulations, there is still a big divide between developing and developed countries. Thus it is important to evaluate countries' responsibilities, obligations and capacities for addressing climate change in the post-Pans era. By adopting the Delphi method, this paper establishes a more comprehensive index system to quantitatively evaluate countries' capacities for addressing climate change, and to further identify and determine their capacities under the Paris Agreement. According to the evaluation results, there is still a large gap between developed and developing countries in their capacities for addressing climate change. Developing countries with weak capacities fall behind mainly in terms of the industrialization process, Human Development Index (HDI) and urbanization rate. Developed countries with strong capacities lack commitments and actions in terms of helping developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change.

Following the framework established by the EU COST Action VALUE, in this experiment we test the transferability of these methods to future climate conditions with the use of regional climate models (RCMs) as pseudo observations. We evaluate the marginal aspects of the distributions of daily maximum/minimum temperatures and daily accumulated precipitation, over mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands, analysed by season. For maximum/minimum temperatures all methods display certain transferability issues, being remarkable for Support Vector Machines and Kernel Ridge Regression. For precipitation all methods appear to suffer from transferability difficulties as well, although conclusions are not as clear as for temperature, probably due to the fact that precipitation does not present such a marked signal of change. This study has revealed how an analysis over a historical period is not enough to fully evaluate ESD methods, so we propose that some type of analysis of transferability should be added in a standard procedure of a complete evaluation.","[Hernanz, Alfonso; Dominguez, Marta; Rodriguez-Camino, Ernesto] Spanish Meteorol Agcy AEMET, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Andres Garcia-Valero, Juan] AEMET, Murcia, Spain",Agencia Estatal de Meteorologia (AEMET); Agencia Estatal de Meteorologia (AEMET),"Hernanz, A (corresponding author), Spanish Meteorol Agcy AEMET, Madrid 28040, Spain.",ahernanzl@aemet.es,"GARCIA-VALERO, JUAN ANDRES/L-7357-2014","GARCIA-VALERO, JUAN ANDRES/0000-0002-3914-6328; Hernanz, Alfonso/0000-0003-1091-0422; Rodriguez-Camino, Ernesto/0000-0002-1565-2373; Dominguez, Marta/0000-0001-7840-5516",MEDSCOPE [690462],MEDSCOPE,"MEDSCOPE, Grant/Award Number: 690462",,51,2,2,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

We consider the hypothesis that ecosystem-level variations in pelagic and benthic energy flows from phytoplankton to fish, trophic transfer efficiencies, and fishing effort can quantitatively reconcile this contrast in an energetically consistent manner. To test this hypothesis, we enlist global fish catch data that include previously neglected contributions from small-scale fisheries, a synthesis of global fishing effort, and plankton food web energy flux estimates from a prototype high-resolution global earth system model (ESM). After removing a small number of lightly fished ecosystems, stark interregional differences in fish catch per unit area can be explained (r = 0.79) with an energy-based model that (i) considers dynamic interregional differences in benthic and pelagic energy pathways connecting phytoplankton and fish, (ii) depresses trophic transfer efficiencies in the tropics and, less critically, (iii) associates elevated trophic transfer efficiencies with benthic-predominant systems. Model catch estimates are generally within a factor of 2 of values spanning two orders of magnitude. Climate change projections show that the same macroecological patterns explaining dramatic regional catch differences in the contemporary ocean amplify catch trends, producing changes that may exceed 50% in some regions by the end of the 21st century under high-emissions scenarios. Models failing to resolve these trophodynamic patterns may significantly underestimate regional fisheries catch trends and hinder adaptation to climate change.","[Stock, Charles A.; John, Jasmin G.; Dunne, John P.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Rykaczewski, Ryan R.] Univ South Carolina, Sch Earth Ocean & Environm, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Rykaczewski, Ryan R.] Univ South Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Asch, Rebecca G.; Sarmiento, Jorge L.] Princeton Univ, Atmospher & Ocean Sci Program, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Cheung, William W.

In China, extreme drought events caused by climate change have posed a great threat to food safety. In this work we aimed to study the drought risk of maize in the farming-pastoral ecotone in Northern China based on physical vulnerability assessment. The physical vulnerability curve was constructed from the relationship between drought hazard intensity index and yield loss rate. The risk assessment of agricultural drought was conducted from the drought hazard intensity index and physical vulnerability curve. The probability distribution of drought hazard intensity index decreased from south-west to north-east and increased from south-east to north-west along the rainfall isoline. The physical vulnerability curve had a reduction effect in three parts of the farming-pastoral ecotone in Northern China, which helped to reduce drought hazard vulnerability on spring maize. The risk of yield loss ratio calculated based on physical vulnerability curve was lower compared with the drought hazard intensity index, which suggested that the capacity of spring maize to resist and adapt to drought is increasing. In conclusion, the farming-pastoral ecotone in Northern China is greatly sensitive to climate change and has a high probability of severe drought hazard. Risk assessment of physical vulnerability can help better understand the physical vulnerability to agricultural drought and can also promote measurements to adapt to climate change.","[Wang, Zhiqiang] Minist Civil Affairs, Satellite Applicat Ctr Disaster Reduct, Natl Disaster Reduct Center, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhiqiang; Jiang, Jingyi] Minist Civil Affairs, Key Lab Disaster Reduct & Emergency Response, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Jingyi] INRA, EMMAH, UMR 1114, F-84914 Avignon, France; [Ma, Qing] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Geog, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Ma, Qing] Chongqing 18 High Sch, Chongqing 400020, Peoples R China",INRAE; Beijing Normal University,"Jiang, JY (corresponding author), Minist Civil Affairs, Key Lab Disaster Reduct & Emergency Response, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China.;Jiang, JY (corresponding author), INRA, EMMAH, UMR 1114, F-84914 Avignon, France.",jiangjingyi1989@163.com,,,grant entitled Study on Agricultural Drought Risk Formation Mechanism of the Rain-fed Agricultural Typical Area in China from the National Science and Technology Foundation [41001059],grant entitled Study on Agricultural Drought Risk Formation Mechanism of the Rain-fed Agricultural Typical Area in China from the National Science and Technology Foundation,This work was supported by a grant entitled Study on Agricultural Drought Risk Formation Mechanism of the Rain-fed Agricultural Typical Area in China (41001059) from the National Science and Technology Foundation.

The integration of recent developments in big data analytics and climate change science with agriculture can greatly accelerate agricultural research and innovation for climate smart agriculture (CSA). CSA refers to an integrated set of technologies and practices that simultaneously improve farm productivity and incomes, increase adaptive capacity to climate change effects, and reduce green house gas emissions from farming. It is a multi-stage, multi-objective, data-driven, and knowledge based approach to agriculture, with the farm as the most fundamental unit for both strategic and tactical decisions. This paper explores how big data analytics can accelerate research and innovation for CSA. Three levels at which big data can enhance farmer field level insights and actionable knowledge for the practice of CSA are identified: (i) developing a predictive capability to factor climate change effects to scales relevant to farming practice, (ii) speeding up plant breeding for higher productivity and climate resilience, and (iii) delivery of customized and prescriptive real-time farm knowledge for higher productivity, climate change adaptation and mitigation. The state-of-art on big data based approaches at each of the three levels is assessed. The paper also identifies the research and institutional challenges, and the way forward for leveraging big data in research and innovation aimed at climate smart agriculture in India.","[Rao, N.

Globally, climate change is a consequential concern, since it is contributing to an increase in global temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, raising sea levels, and natural hazards. Locally, the effects of climate change vary, depending upon the region, with communities experiencing the impacts of climate change differently and at various degrees. This article presents research findings from a study on climate change, disasters, and sustainable development that provide insight into the diverse perspectives of community members on climate change in six communities in the Interior and Northern regions of British Columbia, Western Canada. A common denominator between these six communities is how social development is being applied to address climate change. The concept of social development encompasses social and economic well-being. The social development approach involves processes, activities, and institutions working together to develop the social and economic capacities of individuals and communities. In particular, for social workers working with individuals, families, and communities impacted by climate change, the social development approach is effective in addressing social and economic needs. This article will examine the differing perspectives and attitudes of affected community members and the role of social development with respect to climate change adaptation and response. It will also provide suggestions on how social workers can support and apply the social development approach in communities experiencing the impacts of climate change.","[Drolet, Julie Lynne] Univ Calgary, Fac Social Work, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of Calgary,"Drolet, JL (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, 444,11044-82 Ave, Edmonton, AB T6G 0T2, Canada.",jdrolet@ucalgary.ca,,"Drolet, Julie/0000-0002-1520-3439",Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada; Canadian Foundation for Innovation,Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Canadian Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for Innovation),"This research received funding from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada, and the Canadian Foundation for Innovation.",,37,13,13,3,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-8728,1461-7234,,INT SOC WORK,Int.

Results were generated for representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 under vegetation modeling scenarios with and without fire suppression for a total of 80 model runs for future projections. For analysis, results were aggregated by three subregions: the Western Northwest (WNW), from the crest of the Cascade Mountains west; Northwest Plains and Plateau (NWPP), the non-mountainous areas east of the Cascade Mountains; and Eastern Northwest Mountains (ENWM), the mountainous areas east of the Cascade Mountains. In the WNW, mean fire interval (MFI) averaged over all climate projections decreases by up to 48%, and potential vegetation shifts from conifer to mixed forest under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 with and without fire suppression. In the NWPP MFI averaged over all climate projections decreases by up to 82% without fire suppression and increases by up to 14% with fire suppression resulting in woodier vegetation cover.

It has been argued that social networks the ties connecting an origin and destination may operate as migration corridors with the potential to strongly facilitate climate change-related migration. This study investigates whether social networks at the household and community levels amplify or suppress the impact of climate change on international migration from rural Mexico. A novel set of 15 climate change indices was generated based on daily temperature and precipitation data for 214 weather stations across Mexico. Employing geostatistical interpolation techniques, the climate change values were linked to 68 rural municipalities for which sociodemographic data and detailed migration histories were available from the Mexican Migration Project. Multi-level discrete-time event-history models were used to investigate the effect of climate change on international migration between 1986 and 1999. At the household level, the effect of social networks was approximated by comparing the first to the last move, assuming that through the first move a household establishes internal social capital. At the community level, the impact of social capital was explored through interactions with a measure of the proportion of adults with migration experience. The results show that rather than amplifying, social capital may suppress the sensitivity of migration to climate triggers, suggesting that social networks could facilitate climate change adaptation in place.

The political leaderships' prioritization of sociopolitical and economic development, combined with the wish for a closer integration into the world market, shifted the countries' governance structures and agenda setting. Undertaken economic projects, including oil explorations, mining and gold extractions, flower farming and intense rice growing, put conservation areas at great risk and led to a decrease of the country's wetland and forest cover. Accordingly, the impact of climate change on the vulnerability of countries is increasing. The paper critically investigates how particularly recent economic investments by national and international companies question the coherence between the institutional framework on climate policies, especially on a sub-national level of decision-making. Based on two field visits to the area, this paper raises the question of how the institutional frameworks shape climate governance processes in Kenya and Uganda. Looking at both political and climate governance structures from a pragmatic perspective, this paper concludes that the insufficient implementation of existing governance structures hampers the better integration of climate policies. National actors do not consider climate financing as an important issue which results in the fragmentation and undermining of climate policy processes.","[Renner, Julia] Univ Koblenz Landau, Dept Polit Sci, D-76829 Landau, Germany",University of Koblenz & Landau,"Renner, J (corresponding author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Dept Polit Sci, D-76829 Landau, Germany.",rennerj@uni-landau.de,,"Renner, Julia/0000-0001-8897-1474",University of Koblenz-Landau,University of Koblenz-Landau,Open Access funding supported and provided by the University of Koblenz-Landau.,,79,2,2,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2020,12,7,,,,,,,2799,10.3390/su12072799,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12072799,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LL4WR,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000531558100224,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, in the context of climate change and an increase in associated hazards and disasters, we suggest the need to re-examine this dynamic relationship-a complex association we define here as the Affluence-Vulnerability Interface (AVI). We review research in different national contexts to show how a more nuanced understanding of the AVI can (a) problematize the notion that increasing material affluence necessarily has a mitigating influence on social vulnerability, (b) extend our analysis of social vulnerability beyond low-income regions to include affluent contexts and (c) improve our understanding of how psychosocial characteristics influence people's vulnerability. Finally, we briefly outline three methodological approaches that we believe will assist future engagement with the AVI.","[Eriksen, Christine; Roth, Florian; Maduz, Linda; Prior, Timothy] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Secur Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Eriksen, Christine; Lakhina, Shefali Juneja] Univ Wollongong, Australian Ctr Culture Environm Soc & Space ACCES, Sch Geog & Sustainable Communities, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Simon, Gregory L.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Denver, CO USA; [Roth, Florian] Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res ISI, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Wisner, Ben] UCL, Inst Risk & Disaster Reduct, London, England; [Wisner, Ben] Oberlin Coll, Environm Studies Dept, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA; [Adler, Carolina] Univ Bern, Mt Res Initiat, Bern, Switzerland; [Thomalla, Frank] Climate & Disaster Risk Res & Consulting, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Scolobig, Anna] Univ Geneva, Environm Governance & Terr Dev Inst, Geneva, Switzerland; [Brady, Kate] Australian Red Cross Soc, North Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Brady, Kate] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Bruendl, Michael] WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res SLF, Davos, Switzerland; [Neisser, Florian] Fraunhofer Inst Technol Trend Anal INT, Euskirchen, Germany; [Grenfell, Maree] Resilient Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Prior, Timothy] IT Network & Infrastruct Swisscom Schweiz AG, Control Ctr, Ittigen, Switzerland; [Lakhina, Shefali Juneja] Wonder Labs, San Jose, CA USA","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Wollongong; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; University of London; University College London; Oberlin College; University of Bern; University of Geneva; University of Melbourne; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft","Eriksen, C (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Secur Studies, Zurich, Switzerland.;Eriksen, C (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Australian Ctr Culture Environm Soc & Space ACCES, Sch Geog & Sustainable Communities, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.",christine.eriksen@sipo.gess.ethz.ch,"Eriksen, Christine/J-6912-2012; Adler, Carolina/P-6132-2019; scolobig, anna/HHZ-7574-2022","Eriksen, Christine/0000-0002-2906-9680; Adler, Carolina/0000-0002-8787-2797; Scolobig, Anna/0000-0003-3957-9745; Neisser, Florian/0000-0001-8180-0381; Simon, Gregory/0000-0003-1570-3537; Roth, Florian/0000-0002-5287-6448; Lakhina, Shefali/0000-0003-1746-5384",,,,,106,9,9,3,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

We consider a transport facility (an airport or a seaport) that is in a vertical structure with an upstream facility operator and a few downstream carriers. The exact probability of disaster damage level is privately known by the facility operator, while the government has incomplete information and has to form a probability distribution. If the government cannot accurately perceive such probability (misjudgment), ambiguity emerges. This is the first modeling work to integrate the incomplete information and ambiguity in one framework to analyze the transport investment under uncertainty. Modeling results suggest that such incomplete information and ambiguity in many cases allow the facility operator to secure information rent, and make the facility output, adaptation investment and social welfare downwardly distorted (i.e., less than the levels under complete information). The ambiguity can bring two countervailing effects under incomplete information, namely the pooling effect and the agency cost effect, which jointly determine the downward distortions on market outcomes and the welfare-maximizing subsidy policy. When its degree is low, the ambiguity causes a more dominant pooling effect that can help alleviate the distortion, improving social welfare. In presence of ambiguity, the increasing optimism of the government would deteriorate the distortion, likely to damage social welfare. Our analytical results provide support to subsidy on adaptation and policies to promote adaptation effectiveness and carrier competition in downstream market. To alleviate possible distortion, the government also needs to be cautious to reduce ambiguity through more information acquisition, and not be too optimistic on the disaster damage.","[Zheng, Shiyuan] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Sch Transportat, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Kun] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, 10 Huixindong St, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Chan, Felix T.

The need to evolve framework for adaptation to climate change impact (CCI) among flood-prone fish farmers necessitated this study. Based on availability, 60 farming active flood-experienced fish farmers were purposively selected from flood-prone (Gulu and Kibuku) regions in climate hotspot Uganda. These were assessed for CCI adaptation tendencies in their socioeconomics and farming operation/techniques (FOI) indices, CCI awareness, CCI adaptation strategies, and perceived required interventions (RIs) using structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed through descriptive and multivariate regression tools. Respondents were mostly male, adults, educated, Christian, married, medium-sized family, social group members, 1-5 years' experience, medium-sized farms, and government trained. Income was 1.0-6.0 million Ugx/year. In FOI, semi-intensive culture system, use of rainwater plus groundwater, small-sized (< 0.5 ha) ponds, ponds possession of inlets and outlets, seasonal farming and mixed culture/farming dominated. Most respondents were aware of CCI, while erratic rainfall with floods and prolonged drought mostly impacted farming. AS-Adaptation Strategy were changed stocking time and livelihood diversification. Communication technology and social group's membership enhanced adaptation, while inadequate awareness constrains adaptation. Respondents' RI(s) were tree planting, irrigation and pond perimeter trenching. Gender, government training, farm size, water sources and presence of inlet and outlets in ponds (FOI) predicted adaptation (R = 0.802, R-2 = 0.64, P < 0.05). Some socioeconomic, technical and awareness indices could assist CCI flexibility. However, the statistically significant predictors of adaptation, identified adaptive strategies, constraints to adaptation and required interventions could be integrated into a framework for effective CCI adaptation for sustainable fish farming in flood-prone scenarios.","[Oyebola, Oyediran O.; Falaye, Augustine E.] Univ Ibadan, Dept Aquaculture & Fisheries Management, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Efitre, Jackson] Makerere Univ, Dept Zool Entomol & Fisheries Sci, Kampala, Uganda; [Musinguzi, Laban] Natl Fisheries Resources Res Inst NaFIRRI, Jinja, Uganda",University of Ibadan; Makerere University,"Oyebola, OO (corresponding author), Univ Ibadan, Dept Aquaculture & Fisheries Management, Ibadan, Nigeria.",olusegun.oyebola@yahoo.com,"Musinguzi, Laban/G-2487-2016","Musinguzi, Laban/0000-0001-7915-3218; Oyediran Olusegun, Oyebola/0000-0003-3459-1745; Falaye, Augustine Eyiwunmi/0000-0001-6208-5335",UK government,UK government,"This research has been funded by UK aid from the UK government; however, the views expressed do not necessarily reflect the UK government's official policies.

The exacerbation of global warming throughout this century probably will cause an increase in droughts, so accurate studies of future projections at a local level, not done so far, are essential. Climate change scenarios of drought indexes for the region of Aragon (Spain) based on nine Earth System Models (ESMs) and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) corresponding to the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) have been generated for the first time. Meteorological Drought episodes were analysed from three main aspects: magnitude (index values), duration and spatial extent. The evolution of drought is also represented in a novel way, allowing identification, simultaneously, of the intensity of the episodes as well as their duration in different periods of accumulation and, for the first time, at the observatory level. Future meteorological drought scenarios based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) hardly show variations in water balance with respect to normal values. However, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) which, in addition to precipitation, considers evapotranspiration, shows a clear trend towards increasingly intense periods of drought, especially when considering cumulative periods and those at the end of the century. Representation of the territory of the drought indexes reflects that the most populated areas (Ebro Valley and SW of the region), will suffer the longest and most intense drought episodes. These results are key in the development of specific measures for adapting to climate change. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study was to experiment with the ECOSER protocol for the mapping of ecosystem services in a rural landscape dominated by cocoa crop to estimate its potential as a mechanism for adaptation to Climate Change. The study was carried out in Los Rios province in Mocache, Baba, Palenque, and Vinces cantons within the framework of the The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity in Ecuador project. ECOSER protocol was applied for the evaluation and mapping of ecosystem functions. The analysis integrated several disciplines around ecosystem functions, interactions between them and their vulnerability in climate changing scenarios. Ecosystem function and service maps allowed identifying different areas in the four cantons that could be useful to inform decisions regarding climate change. For example, the resulting spatial distribution of the ecosystem function soil organic carbon showed that 83.64% of the study area, which is dedicated to the production of agricultural crops, had a storage capacity of 125.5 Mg C ha(-1); followed by a storage capacity of 244 Mg C ha(-1) in the area where pastures predominate. The remaining 1.74% of the area is covered with forests and had 583 Mg C ha(-1). Conservation and protection of ecosystems require a better understanding of their ability to provide ecosystem services for long-term planning for sustainable development. Therefore, a friendly and easily replicable methodology will be useful for planning in rural landscapes, especially, in contexts where methodologies and information are usually scarce.","[Portalanza, Diego] Escuela Super Politecn Litoral, ESPOL, Fac Ingn Maritima Ciencias Biol Ocean & Recursos, Campus Gustavo Galindo Km 30-5,Via Perimetral, Guayaquil, Ecuador; [Portalanza, Diego; Ferraz, Simone] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Phys, Climate Res Grp, Av Roraima 1000, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Paula Barral, Maria] INTA, Ctr Reg Buenos Aires Sur, Estn Expt Agr Balcarce, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Villa-Cox, Gonzalo] Escuela Super Politecn Litoral, ESPOL, Fac Ciencias Sociales & Humanist, Campus Gustavo Galindo Km 30-5 Via Perimetral, Guayaquil, Ecuador; [Villa-Cox, Gonzalo] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Agr Econ, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Ferreira-Estafanous, Sheryl] New York City Dept Educ, New York, NY USA; [Herrera, Paul] Escuela Super Politecn Litoral, Fac Ciencias Vida, ESPOL, Campus Gustavo Galindo Km 30-5 Via Perimetral, Guayaquil, Ecuador; [Durigon, Angelica] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Crop Sci, Agr Meteorol Grp, Av Roraima 1000,Bldg 77, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil",Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral; Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM); Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA); Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral; Ghent University; Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral; Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM),"Portalanza, D (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Phys, Climate Res Grp, Av Roraima 1000, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.",diegoportalanza@gmail.com,"Villa Cox, Gonzalo/ABB-9070-2021; Durigon, Angelica/D-5844-2012; BITOUN, RACHEL Elisabeth/AAC-9538-2021; , Simone ET Ferraz/G-1276-2012","Durigon, Angelica/0000-0003-3830-5056; BITOUN, RACHEL Elisabeth/0000-0002-3614-9910; , Simone ET Ferraz/0000-0002-9688-7480; HERRERA, PAUL/0000-0002-4449-0326; Barral, Maria Paula/0000-0001-7834-491X; Villa-Cox, Gonzalo/0000-0002-2160-7448; Portalanza, Diego/0000-0001-5275-0741",The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB),The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB),"We would like to show appreciation to the project Evaluation of ecosystem services in the cocoa value chain at Dauvin Irrigation Project area in the Guayas River basin, Ecuador under the auspices of The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB).",,63,5,5,5,51,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

The difficulty in predicting these relationships comes from the local societal and environmental factors that affect disease burden.","[Bell, Jesse E.; Kunkel, Kenneth E.; Schreck, Carl] North Carolina State Univ, Cooperat Inst Climate & Satellites NC, 151 Patton Ave, Asheville, NC 28801 USA; [Brown, Claudia Langford] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Karna LLC, Climate & Hlth Program, Atlanta, GA USA; [Conlon, Kathryn; Luber, George] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Climate & Hlth Program, Atlanta, GA USA; [Herring, Stephanie] NOAA, Natl Ctr Environm Informat, Boulder, CO USA; [Lawrimore, Jay; Smith, Adam] NOAA, Natl Ctr Environm Informat, Asheville, NC USA; [Uejio, Christopher] Florida State Univ, Dept Geog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",North Carolina State University; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Bell, JE (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Cooperat Inst Climate & Satellites NC, 151 Patton Ave, Asheville, NC 28801 USA.",jesse@cicsnc.org,"Schreck, Carl J/B-8711-2011; Smith, Adam/AAL-3882-2021; Kunkel, Kenneth/C-7280-2015","Schreck, Carl J/0000-0001-9331-5754; Smith, Adam/0000-0003-2573-3609; Kunkel, Kenneth/0000-0001-6667-7047",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA14NES432003],National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),This work was supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NA14NES432003).,,208,96,98,12,86,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1096-2247,2162-2906,,J AIR WASTE MANAGE,J.

There has been a significant research on how perceptions influence water resource management and adaptation to climate, but conclusions are unclear or contradictory. This research aimed to clarify what shapes perceptions and how this understanding can refine meteorological data collection and to make more relevant and useful tools for farmers to adapt to changes in the water cycle. A survey of 244 small-scale maize farmers was conducted using a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews in two districts in southern and western Kenya which differed in climate type and farming systems. Farmer perceptions of and adaptation to climate uncertainty were investigated and compared with meteorological data. Most farmers perceived changes in the patterns of rainfall and dry spells, including later onset of rains than in the past. They have already adjusted their management based on these perceptions, including later planting times. Despite this, analysis of meteorological data indicated no major trends in rainfall or dry spell patterns in the two regions. This research confirms that the perception that the water cycle is changing is based on a combination of climatic, economic, or social observations, and farmers are already changing their management to adapt to the perceived changes in climate. The article explores the reasons why these perceptions were inconsistent with the available meteorological data and suggests that research may improve the usefulness of meteorological data to farmers.

This project focuses on one of the worst natural catastrophic events in Taiwan, the 88 Wind-caused Disasters, caused by the Typhoon Morakot; the case of the EMS transportation in the Xiaolin village is reviewed and analyzed. The sequential-conveyance method is designed to promote the efficiency of all the ambulance services related to transportation time and distance. Initially, a proposed mobile emergency medical center (MEMC) is constructed in a safe location near the area of the disaster. The ambulances are classified into 2 categories: the first-line ambulances, which reciprocate between the MEMC and the disaster area to save time and shorten the working distances and the second-line ambulances, which transfer patients in critical condition from the MEMC to the requested hospitals for further treatment. According to the results, the sequential-conveyance method is more efficient than the conventional method for EMS transportation in a mass-casualty incident (MCI). This method improves the time efficiency by 52.15% and the distance efficiency by 56.02%. This case study concentrates on Xiaolin, a mountain village, which was heavily destroyed by a devastating mudslide during the Typhoon Morakot. The sequential-conveyance method for the EMS transportation in this research is not only more advantageous but also more rational in adaptation to climate change. Therefore, the findings are also important to all the decision-making with respect to a promoted EMS transportation, especially in an MCI.","[Pan, Chih-Long] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Engn Sci & Technol, Touliu, Yunlin, Taiwan; [Chiu, Chun-Wen] Changhua Christian Med Ctr, Dept Emergency Med, Changhua, Taiwan; [Wen, Jet-Chau] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Soil & Water Resources & Nat Disaster Pre, Dept & Grad Sch Safety & Environm Engn, Touliu, Yunlin, Taiwan",National Yunlin University Science & Technology; National Yunlin University Science & Technology,"Wen, JC (corresponding author), Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Soil & Water Resources & Nat Disaster Pre, Dept & Grad Sch Safety & Environm Engn, Touliu, Yunlin, Taiwan.",wenjc@yuntech.edu.tw,,"Pan, Chih-Long/0000-0003-3365-9162; Wen, Jet-Chau/0000-0001-7363-1039",National Science Council [NSC 102-2221-E-224 -050],"National Science Council(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",The authors express gratitude to the National Science Council for the funding through grants (NSC 102-2221-E-224 -050).,,38,8,8,0,10,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),DEC,2014,93,27,,,,,,,e186,10.1097/MD.0000000000000186,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000000186,,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,AW6WP,25501065,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000346406500019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Migratory birds may be especially vulnerable because of the wide range of geographic areas that they depend on throughout the annual cycle. We examined the potential effects of non-breeding season climate change on the breeding biology of Kirtland's Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii, formerly Dendroica kirtlandii), an endangered songbird that breeds in the Northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan and winters in the Bahamas. Our objectives were to determine whether spring arrival dates on the breeding grounds correlate with late winter rainfall in non-breeding areas and whether this has consequences for reproductive success. We used data on spring arrival dates and number of fledglings per year, sampling many individuals across multiple years, to show that males arrive on breeding grounds later following drier winters. There was a strong male age * rainfall interaction, which indicates that first-time breeders were much more sensitive to changes in rainfall than experienced adults. Regardless of age, however, drier winters and delayed arrival and nest initiation were significantly associated with fewer offspring fledged. These results are important because the Caribbean region is currently experiencing a significant drying trend, and climate change models predict that the severity of this drought will continue to increase. Any resulting adjustments to the timing of migration could constrain spring arrival dates and limit reproductive success for the endangered Kirtland's Warbler, as well as other Neotropical migrants wintering in the Caribbean.

A common practice in some locations is to process farm products using locally fabricated machines, which diminishes the quality and quantity of production while simultaneously increasing the danger of illness. Recent studies suggest that hybrid power systems, such as those based on renewable energy sources, could support the development of a climate change adaption and low-emission economy in a post-pandemic future. According to this study, the current electrification rate and the variables that restrict electricity access speed are investigated, and some solutions to overcome these issues are proposed. According to the findings of this study, the connection of rural areas is delayed by the presence of remote and low-density villages, because the access to the utility transmission lines is both expensive and complex. For this reason, the study proposes a novel microgrid design where it suggests an installed solar PV mobile mini-grid that can provide a group of households with energy, so enabling them to obtain economical and environmentally friendly energy. Results have proven that the proposed model is an adjustable and expandable generation and distributed storage. To a greater extent, the installation of a single device at a residence can even result in the establishment of an expandable DC microgrid, which then can develop in a cost-efficient manner when additional neighbors are joined to the grid. Eventually, the microgrid will be able to alter the way in which processing equipment is utilized. The solution is also expected to contribute to the advancement of clean technology in the pursuit of universal electrification.","[Mudaheranwa, Emmanuel; Cipcigan, Liana] Cardiff Univ, Sch Engn, Cardiff, Wales; [Mudaheranwa, Emmanuel; Masengo, Gilbert] Integrated Polytech Reg Coll, Rwanda Polytech, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Karongi, Rwanda; [Ntagwirumugara, Etienne] Univ Rwanda, Coll Sci & Technol, African Ctr Excellence Energy Sustainable Dev, Kigali, Rwanda",Cardiff University; University of Rwanda,"Mudaheranwa, E (corresponding author), Integrated Polytech Reg Coll, Rwanda Polytech, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Karongi, Rwanda.",mudanwa@yahoo.com,,,DTE Network+; EPSRC [EP/S032053/1],DTE Network+; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This work was supported by DTE Network+, funded by EPSRC, grant reference EP/S032053/1.

Due to its potential for climate change adaptation through the reduction of soil erosion and improved water availability, CA is becoming more important in many regions of the world. However, increased bulk density and large amounts of crop residues may be a constraint for early plant establishment. This holds especially true under irrigated production areas with high yield potential. Genotype x tillage effects on yield are not well understood and it is unclear whether tillage should be an evaluation factor in breeding programs. Fourteen CIMMYT bread (Triticum aestivum) and thirteen durum (Triticum turgidum) wheat genotypes, created between 1964 and 2011, were tested for yield and agronomic performance at CIMMYT's experimental station near Ciudad Obregon, Mexico, during nine seasons. The genotypes were subjected to different tillage and irrigation treatments which consisted of conventional and permanent raised beds with full and reduced irrigation. The dataset includes traits collected during the growing period (days to emergence, days to flowering, maturity, plant height, NDVI, days from flower-ing to maturity, grain production rate) and at harvest (yield, harvest index, thousand grain weight, spikes/m(2), grains/m(2), test weight) and weather data (daily minimum and maxi-mum temperature, rainfall).

The future potential changes in the SASM have great importance for climate change adaption and policy setting in this populous region. To understand the SASM changes and their link with the global warming of 1.5 degrees-5 degrees C above the preindustrial level, we investigate the changes in the SASM circulation and precipitation based on a large-ensemble simulation conducted with Canadian Earth System Model version 2 (CanESM2). With the global mean surface temperature (GMST) increase, the large-ensemble mean of SASM circulation is projected to weaken almost linearly while the precipitation and precipitable water are projected to enhance quasi-linearly. A double anticyclone along the tropical Indian Ocean is a major anomalous circulation pattern for each additional degree of warming and is responsible for the weakening of the lower-level westerlies. The decreased upper-level land-sea thermal contrast (TCupper) is the main thermal driver for the weakening of the SASM circulation while the lower-level thermal contrast contributes little. The nonlinearly decreased TCupper is mainly related to the temperature response to the increased CO2 forcing and convection-induced latent heat release in the tropics. The increase in the SASM precipitation is mainly due to the quasi-linearly increased positive contribution of the thermodynamic component, while the dynamic component has a negative impact. Both horizontal moisture advection and moisture convergence contribute to the precipitation increase, and moisture convergence plays a dominant role. These results provide new insight that the SASM changes can be roughly scaled by the GMST changes.","[Li, Zhibo] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Lab Climate & Atmosphere Ocean Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhibo; Sun, Ying; Ding, Yihui] China Meteorol Adm, Lab Climate Studies, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhibo; Sun, Ying; Li, Tim] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteo D, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Li, Tim] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI USA; [Chen, Wen] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wen] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Peking University; China Meteorological Administration; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Sun, Y (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Lab Climate Studies, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Sun, Y (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteo D, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",sunying@cma.gov.cn,"Chen, Wen/G-6058-2011; Li, Zhibo/AAK-4293-2020; Li (李), Zhibo (智博)/GQI-1420-2022","Chen, Wen/0000-0001-9327-9079; Li (李), Zhibo (智博)/0000-0001-9135-1583",National Science Foundation of China [42025503]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFA0605604]; NSF [AGS-2006553]; NOAA [NA18OAR4310298],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"We thank the two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions, which helped to improve the manuscript.

Adaptation strategies need to be implemented to mitigate the effect of climate change-induced yield losses. In this paper, we used the WEAP-MABIA model, driven by six CORDEX climate change data for representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5, to quantify the effect of climate change on several key crops, namely maize, soya beans, dry beans, and sunflower, in the Olifants catchment. The study further investigated climate change adaptation such as the effects of changing planting dates with the application of full irrigation, rainwater harvesting, deficit irrigation method, and the application of efficient irrigation devices on reducing the impact of climate change on crop production. The results show that average monthly temperature is expected to increase by 1 degrees C to 5 degrees C while a reduction in precipitation ranging between 2.5% to 58.7% is projected for both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 relative to the baseline climate for 1976-2005, respectively. The results also reveal that increased temperature and decreased precipitation during planting seasons are expected to increase crop water requirements. A steady decline in crop yield ranging between 19-65%, 11-38%, 16-42%, and 5-30% for maize, soya beans, dry beans, and sunflower, respectively, is also projected under both RCPs climate change scenarios. The study concludes that adaptation measures such as the integration of changing planting dates with full irrigation application and the use of rainwater harvest will help improve current and future crop production under the impact of climate change.","[Olabanji, Mary Funke; Ndarana, Thando; Davis, Nerhene] Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, Private Bag X 20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Olabanji, MF (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, Private Bag X 20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa.",u18098267@tuks.co.za; thando.ndarana@up.ac.za; nerhene.davis@up.ac.za,"Olabanji, Mary/AAR-4017-2021; Ndarana, Thando/AAE-2516-2021","Davis, Nerhene/0000-0002-5059-5423",Nation Research foundation-The World Academy of Science (NRF-TWAS) [110823],Nation Research foundation-The World Academy of Science (NRF-TWAS),This research was supported by the Nation Research foundation-The World Academy of Science (NRF-TWAS) Grant No. 110823.,,55,6,6,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,JAN,2021,9,1,,,,,,,6,10.3390/cli9010006,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli9010006,,,19,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,PV5CK,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000610005400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adequately understanding the driving forces and the dynamics of ESs related to water quantity and quality can provide a basis for making sound management decisions on the development of basins. Here, we explored the impacts of future land use and climate changes on four ESs: nitrogen and phosphorous purification, water supply, and soil retention services in the Taihu Basin region of eastern China. Spatially explicit methods, a cellular automata-Markov (CA-Markov) model and the delta downscaling method were used to quantify the ESs, simulate land use changes, and project future climate changes, respectively. We built a business-as-usual land use scenario, representative concentration pathways (RCPs) scenarios for climate change, as well as a combined land use and climate change scenario to analyze the changes in the drivers and the responses of ESs. The results showed the following: (1) future land use changes would significantly enhance the nitrogen purification service while reducing the phosphorus purification service compared to other services; (2) climate change would have substantial effects on water supply and soil retention, but these impacts would vary with different RCPs scenarios during three future periods; and (3) the combined scenarios of both drivers would obviously influence all ESs and lead to a nitrogen purification service that was different from the other three services. Moreover, the policy implications of the results were discussed. The findings can help guide the creation of policies for land structure and patterns, climate change adaptation, and ecosystem-based management to promote the sustainable development of watersheds at the regional scale.","[Liu, Yang] Univ Jinan, Business Sch, Jinan 250002, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Bi, Jun] Nanjing Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resources Reuse, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lv, Jianshu] Shandong Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Environm, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China",University of Jinan; Nanjing University; Shandong Normal University,"Liu, Y (corresponding author), Univ Jinan, Business Sch, Jinan 250002, Shandong, Peoples R China.;Bi, J (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resources Reuse, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",sm_liuyang0531@ujn.edu.cn; jbi@nju.edu.cn; lvjianshu@sdnu.edu.cn,"Lv, Jianshu/Q-9591-2018","Lv, Jianshu/0000-0002-6843-7677","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41701604, 41601549]; Major Water Projects of the Science and Technology Ministry [2012ZX07506-001-05]; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2017BD003, ZR2016DQ11]; Social Science Planning Foundation of Shandong Province [16DKJJ01]; Doctoral Foundation of University of Jinan [16010023]; National Social Science Fund Major Project [15ZDB163]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Water Projects of the Science and Technology Ministry; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); Social Science Planning Foundation of Shandong Province; Doctoral Foundation of University of Jinan; National Social Science Fund Major Project,"This study was jointly supported and funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41701604, 41601549), the Major Water Projects of the Science and Technology Ministry (No. 2012ZX07506-001-05), the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (Nos.

This paper investigates the role of TEK in adaptation to social-ecological change at the community level. It is unique because it takes a longitudinal perspective and draws on historical and contemporary data. We focus on a case study from Hawai'i where TEK, cultural identity, and their relationships to environmental stewardship are locally seen as the basis for social resilience. We describe how coping strategies and indicators of social resilience have changed over time; the role of TEK in resilience; and the implications for climate change adaptation. Our results show the relative contributions of some strategies to cope with social-ecological change have decreased (e.g., forecasting, storage, and mobility), while others have maintained but adapted (e.g., livelihood diversification, knowledge transmission and storage, communal pooling, and cultural identity), underscoring the importance of considering multiple strategies together to promote community resilience. The article argues that understanding how people responded in the past can suggest relevant and culturally appropriate ways-through specific language, values, reference points, and indicators expressed in narratives, proverbs, and songs-of situating climate change and framing adaptation planning. This research also shows that TEK is vital for adaptation to environmental change broadly and climate change in particular, for subsistence-based, indigenous, rural communities, as well as place-based communities living in mixed economies. Thus, it is relevant for the larger Pacific Islands region and other areas that represent a continuum from rural-to-urban and traditional-to-global economies and lifeways.","[McMillen, Heather; Ticktin, Tamara] Univ Hawaii Manoa, 3190 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Springer, Hannah Kihalani] 73-3403 Mamalahoa Hwy, Kailua Kona, HI 96740 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"McMillen, H (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, 3190 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",hmcmille@hawaii.edu; ticktin@hawaii.edu; ohiwai@gmail.com,,"McMillen, Heather/0000-0002-5835-8879",Pacific Island Climate Change Cooperative,Pacific Island Climate Change Cooperative,"Thank you first to the Ka'upulehu community who generously shared insights, knowledge, and experiences that are the foundation of this work; to the 'aina that provided profound inspiration; to Lisa X.

Thus far it has proven to be difficult to provide meaningful recommendations on how to deal with these barriers. In this paper we propose a different perspective, with different epistemological assumptions about cause and effect than most existing barrier studies, to analyze why adaptation is often challenging. Using the mechanismic framework, we study how the idea for an innovative Water Plaza was realized in the city of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Mechanisms are understood as patterns of interaction between actors that bring about change in the governance process that lead to policy impasses. Our analysis reveals three mechanisms that explain the impasses in the first Water Plaza pilot project: the risk-innovation mechanism, the frame polarization mechanism, and the conflict infection mechanism. Only after several substantive changes in the project design, location choice, and process architecture was the project of Water Plaza's revitalized. We discuss how the short-sighted ideas about cause-effect relationships, reflected in the superficial identification of barriers, may prove to be counterproductive; if there is high uncertainty about the risks of an innovation, the solution of offering more certainty is not very helpful and could, as it happened in the case study, trigger other mechanisms, creating an even tighter deadlock. Our study also suggests that when adaptation is considered as something innovative, the chances will increase that the risk-innovation mechanism will occur. We conclude that unearthing mechanisms offers new opportunities and different types of strategic interventions in practice than most existing studies have offered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The pandemic, alongside climate change, is disproportionately impacting the most vulnerable and marginalized people across the globe, and particularly exposing Black, Brown, and Indigenous people to ill-health and economic hardship. However, there is a risk that economic considerations will take precedence over climate action in recovery strategies and avoid addressing climate and racial injustices. Yet, it is vital that climate and racial justice and just transition principles inform post-COVID-19 recovery strategies to avoid compounding inequalities. This paper unpacks the layers of injustice surrounding the pandemic, along with their relation to climate policy and finance. It advocates for policymakers to adopt climate justice and just transition principles as a framework for COVID-19 recovery strategies to ensure existing inequalities in society are recognized and addressed in the run-up to the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) in 2021 and beyond. Key policy insights The COVID-19 pandemic and climate change intersect to further compound inequalities between and within nations. Current vulnerabilities and historical racial injustices undermine the ability of individuals, communities and nations to cope with, and adapt to, climate change. Economic considerations have dominated climate and development policy, and this must change to include justice and equity as key criteria to ensure a green and just recovery. Policymakers should pursue climate policymaking designed with broad and diverse communities in mind, recognizing diversity and intersectionality, to empower marginalized groups. Just transition principles should be mainstreamed into investment and financing criteria for climate finance and recovery strategies to ensure funding reaches those who need it most.","[Mattar, Sennan D.; Jafry, Tahseen] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Ctr Climate Justice, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Schroder, Patrick] Chatham House, Energy Environm & Resources Programme, London, England; [Ahmad, Zarina] CEMVO Scotland, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Glasgow Caledonian University,"Mattar, SD (corresponding author), Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Ctr Climate Justice, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",Sennan.Mattar@gcu.ac.uk,,,,,,,122,6,6,8,33,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

We used a locally adapted and calibrated model describing soil organic carbon dynamics under the impact of climate change and a broad range of scenarios combining increased use of organic amendments, reduced soil tillage, and increased land area for the local market. We found that, in its current state, only 26% of agricultural area could achieve a 4 parts per thousand year(-1) increase in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in the coming 30 years, due mainly to perennial cropping systems (sugarcane, banana, orchards) occupying soils with the lowest SOC stocks. Implementing reduced tillage with increased use of locally produced composts would increase the agricultural area reaching the 4 per 1000 target to 31%. However, at territory scale, all scenarios tested showed an annual decrease in SOC stocks varying from - 0.1 to - 3.2 parts per thousand. The limited area on which the 4 per 1000 target is feasible and generalized SOC losses were mainly linked to the current high SOC stocks in volcanic and calcareous soils on the island and lack of practices capable of further increasing C inputs in current cropping systems. We concluded that C sequestration potential in the Caribbean is rather limited and that increasing SOC stocks, even lower than 4 per 1000, should be the primary target in adaptation to climate change, by increasing the resilience of cropping systems based mainly on SOC-poor soils.","[Chopin, Pierre] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Ekol Ctr, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, S-75651 Uppsala, Sweden; [Chopin, Pierre; Sierra, Jorge] INRAE, UR ASTRO, Domaine Duclos, Prise Eau 97176, F-97170 Petit Bourg, Guadeloupe, France",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; INRAE,"Chopin, P (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Ekol Ctr, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, S-75651 Uppsala, Sweden.;Chopin, P (corresponding author), INRAE, UR ASTRO, Domaine Duclos, Prise Eau 97176, F-97170 Petit Bourg, Guadeloupe, France.",pierre.chopin@slu.se; jorge.sierra@inrae.fr,,"Chopin, Pierre/0000-0001-6743-6210",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Reacctif Program of the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) [410-00159]; European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) [410-00160]; Regional Council of Guadeloupe [410-00161]; Cropping System Platform from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU),Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Reacctif Program of the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME); European Regional Development Fund (FEDER)(European Commission); Regional Council of Guadeloupe; Cropping System Platform from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU),"Open Access funding provided by Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.

The refurbishment process is a complicated method of building construction after flooding. This study assesses all building costs in parallel with environmental emissions after repairs in a flood zone, in non-flood situations and when a flood hits the building, to determine the feasibility of repairs. Five types of building materials including common brick, concrete block, steel wall panels, wood, and precast concrete framing were assessed with a full life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) assessment under non-flood, low-flood, and high-flood conditions. The result of greenhouse gas analysis showed that timber was the best choice for constructing the building, while, in case of flood occurrence, precast concrete framing shows better performance by releasing less CO2 after the repair stage. The result of cost analysis indicated that despite timber being an ideal material for use in building construction, it is the costliest option in a high-flood situation due to its high repair costs. The benchmark results show that timber and steel frame were the worst materials to use in a flood zone, while brick was the most sustainable one. The findings of this paper prove that wood as a building material in flood zones is not ideal and that alternative materials such as brick have better functionality in terms of both global warming mitigation and LCC.

Since then, it has developed two climate strategies, has passed its first climate protection act, has adopted a strategy for adaptation to climate change and has implemented many new institutions, programmes and local to provincial climate change mitigation (CCM) measures. Indeed, Austrian GHG-emissions have been decreasing since 2005, giving reasons to suspect policy success. A closer analysis, however, challenges this impression. Here, we put climate policies since 1990 into perspective with other, often short-term drivers of GHG-emissions. Employing a conceptual framework, we evaluate the level of climate policy integration, which has been found key for successful climate policies in literature. This framework also helps us to detect benefits and shortcomings of past and existing CCM policies and so to derive insights relevant for policy-makers. We find that short-term climatic and socio-economic events overruled climate policies in their proximate GHG-emission effects, even when policies were implemented due to EU regulation after 2007. Policy effects are much more difficult to uncover, because they often happen within longer time-frames and are usually accompanied by indirect CCM-effects. In the background of accelerating climate change impacts in combination with associated high uncertainties, strengthening climate policies and integrating reflexive mechanisms that allow adjusting and continuously re-evaluating policy effectiveness, will become ever more important. Eliminating inconsistencies between CCM- and other sectoral policies and drastically reforming accounting schemes to include carbon leakage effects are particularly timely, yet considering political realities, very bold but necessary next step to make climate goals attainable.","[Niedertscheider, Maria; Haas, Willi; Goerg, Christoph] Alpen Adria Univ, Inst Social Ecol Vienna, Schottenfeldgasse 29, A-1070 Vienna, Austria",University of Klagenfurt,"Niedertscheider, M (corresponding author), Alpen Adria Univ, Inst Social Ecol Vienna, Schottenfeldgasse 29, A-1070 Vienna, Austria.",maria.niedertscheider@aau.at,"Haas, Willi/M-4120-2018","Haas, Willi/0000-0001-5599-9227",Austrian Climate and Energy Fund through the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP) [ACRP8 - RefGovCC.AT - KR15AC8K12622],Austrian Climate and Energy Fund through the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP),"This work was financed by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund through the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP; project title: Reflexive Governance in a Changing Climate: How to Address Uncertainties in Transformation Strategies?; project number ACRP8 - RefGovCC.AT - KR15AC8K12622).

In recent decades, Serbia has experienced a dominant trend of rising air temperatures and reduced rainfall. Climate change increases the risk of wildfire occurrence and spread. The available statistical data point to an increasing number of wildfires and burnt areas. A study of specific climate characteristics and fire occurrences in Serbia in the period from 2005 to 2015 shows that there was a total of 2542 fires in this period, 2151 of which were more than 500 ha large. The total fire-burnt area in this period amounted to 22978.7 ha, with the average area of 9 ha. All the burnt areas over 500 ha in size covered a total of 20585.2 ha or 89.6% of the total area. The observed period had water deficits occurring during the summer, from July to September, with the highest potential evapotranspiration in July and August. The summer of 2012 was the hottest on record, with very low rainfall which mostly affected small parts of the territory of Serbia. All these factors were favourable for the fire occurrence, so the largest burnt area in Serbia (11890.83 ha) was recorded in this calendar year. The culmination of the water deficit and potential evapotranspiration coincides with the fire occurrence on the largest surface area. The fire occurrences are closely related to the size of these parameters. The integral approach to forest ecosystem protection and their timely adaptation to climate change is the basis for defining measures that need to be implemented in order to improve the state and sustainability of forest ecosystems in Serbia.","[Ratknic, Tatjana; Ratknic, Mihailo; Cirkovic-Mitrovic, Tatjana] Inst Forestry, Dept Forest Estab Siviculture & Ecol, Kneza Viseslava 3, Belgrade 11030, Serbia; [Brasanac-Bosanac, Ljiljana] Inst Forestry, Dept Environm Protect & Improvement, Kneza Viseslava 3, Belgrade 11030, Serbia",,"Ratknic, T (corresponding author), Inst Forestry, Dept Forest Estab Siviculture & Ecol, Kneza Viseslava 3, Belgrade 11030, Serbia.",tatjanaratknic@yahoo.com,"Cirkovic-Mitrovic, Tatjana/AAR-8205-2020; Brašanac-Bosanac, Ljiljana/GRF-5051-2022","Cirkovic-Mitrovic, Tatjana/0000-0003-2620-1751; Brašanac-Bosanac, Ljiljana/0000-0002-3324-674X",Ministry of Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [TR 31070],"Ministry of Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)","The research described in this paper was supported and financed by the Ministry of Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia, Project TR 31070 The development of technological procedures in forestry with a view to an optimum forest cover realisation (2011-2018).",,16,2,2,0,2,PARLAR SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS (P S P),FREISING,"ANGERSTR. 12, 85354 FREISING, GERMANY",1018-4619,1610-2304,,FRESEN ENVIRON BULL,Fresenius Environ.

One of the risks of relying on beaver to enhance ecosystem water storage is that their dams are reportedly more apt to fail during floods which can exacerbate flood severity. Missing are observations of beaver dam persistence and water storage capacity during floods, information needed to evaluate the risk of relying on beaver as a nature-based flood solution. A June rainstorm in 2013 triggered the largest recorded flood in the Canadian Rocky Mountains west of Calgary, Alberta. We opportunistically recorded hydrometric data during the rainfall event at a beaver-occupied peatland that has been studied for more than a decade. We supplemented these observations with a post-event regional analysis of beaver dam persistence. Results do not support two long-held hypotheses-that beaver ponds have limited flood attenuation capacity and commonly fail during large flood events. Instead we found that 68% of the beaver dam cascade systems across the region were intact or partially intact after the event. Pond fullness, in addition to the magnitude of the water-sediment surge, emerged as important factors in determining the structural fate of dam cascade sequences. Beaver ponds at the instrumented site quickly filled in the first few hours of the rain event and levels were dynamic during the event. Water storage offered by the beaver ponds, even ones that failed, delayed downstream floodwater transmission. Study findings have important implications for reintroducing beaver as part of nature-based restoration and climate change adaptation strategies.","[Westbrook, Cherie J.; Ronnquist, Amanda] Univ Saskatchewan, Ctr Hydrol, Dept Geog & Planning, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C8, Canada; [Bedard-Haughn, Angela] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Soil Sci, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",University of Saskatchewan; University of Saskatchewan,"Westbrook, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Ctr Hydrol, Dept Geog & Planning, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C8, Canada.",cherie.westbrook@usask.ca,,"Westbrook, Cherie/0000-0003-1666-3979; Bedard-Haughn, Angela/0000-0002-3971-8509","Canada Foundation for Innovation [13163]; Global Institute of Water Security; Global Water Futures; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [463960-2015, RGPIN-2017-05873]; ICANWISE undergraduate scholarship",Canada Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR); Global Institute of Water Security; Global Water Futures; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); ICANWISE undergraduate scholarship,"Canada Foundation for Innovation, Grant/Award Number: 13163; Global Institute of Water Security; Global Water Futures; ICANWISE undergraduate scholarship; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Grant/Award Numbers: 463960-2015, RGPIN-2017-05873",,61,27,27,4,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0885-6087,1099-1085,,HYDROL PROCESS,Hydrol.

Shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) enable a systematic exploration of the challenges to adaptation and mitigation that alternative futures entail. However, SSPs are primarily defined for the global scale. If countries are to test their adaptation and mitigation options for robustness across plausible future socio-economic conditions, then SSPs require country-relevant detail to understand climate change risks at the national and local scales. New Zealand is used to illustrate how nationally relevant socio-economic scenarios, nested within SSPs can be developed to inform national-and local-scale studies of climate change impacts and their implications. Shared policy assumptions were developed, involving a mix of climate-specific and non-climate-specific policies, to demonstrate how international links and global-scale developments are critical locally-local choices may accelerate, reduce or even negate the impact of global trends for extended periods. The typology was then 'tested' by applying it in a local context. The research challenges observed in developing credible, salient and legitimate nationalscale socio-economic scenarios include issues in developing scenarios across a multidisciplinary team. Finally, recommendations for adapting shared climate policy assumptions to produce national and local scenarios, and for assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of climate change adaptation options are presented. These include the need for: guidelines to embed national scenarios in global frameworks; a limit the number of plausible futures; inter-operability of models; an ability to work towards effective multi-disciplinary teams and integrative research; and the opportunity to involve participatory processes where feasible.","[Frame, Bob] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res New Zealand, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Lawrence, Judy] Victoria Univ Wellington, Climate Change Res Inst, Wellington, New Zealand; [Ausseil, Anne-Gaelle] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res New Zealand, 86-90 Lambton Quay, Wellington, New Zealand; [Reisinger, Andy] New Zealand Agr Greenhouse Gas Res Ctr, Private Bag 11008, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Daigneault, Adam] Univ Maine, Sch Forest Resources, Orono, ME 04469 USA",Victoria University Wellington; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Frame, B (corresponding author), Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res New Zealand, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand.",research@frameworks.nz,"Lawrence, Judy/W-9823-2019; Ausseil, Anne-Gaelle E/C-2195-2011; Reisinger, Andy R/E-1201-2016","Lawrence, Judy/0000-0001-6798-3636; Ausseil, Anne-Gaelle E/0000-0001-8923-0774; Reisinger, Andy R/0000-0002-6631-7188; Frame, Bob/0000-0003-2447-4174; Daigneault, Adam/0000-0002-8287-8727","New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) [C01X1225]; Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research Strategic Science Investment Funds; MBIE [CO1X1412]; New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE) [C01X1225] Funding Source: New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE)","New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)(New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)); Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research Strategic Science Investment Funds; MBIE(New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)); New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE)(New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE))","All authors were funded by New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) Contract C01X1225 Climatic conditions to 2100 and assessed impacts and implications for New Zealand's environment, economy and society.

The current study evaluates the changing trends and regime shifts in runoff and sediment loads at both the annual and monthly time scales. The associated spatial and temporal variations are analyzed by a sequential t-test analysis of the regime shifts (STARS) approach and the breaks for additive seasonal and trend (BFAST) model using hydrological data at eight stations from the 1950s to 2011. Both runoff and sediment loads exhibit significant declines (p < 0.05), except in the upper reaches of the river near the Tangnaihai station. The regime shifts detected by the STARS approach are not completely consistent with the results from the BFAST method. In most cases, the regime shifts occurred in 1969 and 1986, due to the construction of large reservoirs. Climate change and other human activities, such as large-scale soil and water conservation measures, can result in abrupt changes in hydrological series at some stations. The trapping effects of reservoirs not only cause regime shifts of runoff and sediment loads, but also adjust their inter-annual and seasonal distributions. Various soil and water conservation measures are responsible for the significant reduction in runoff and sediment loads in the mid-lower reaches of the Yellow River Basin. In addition, water withdrawals from both river runoff and ground water play a critical role in the changing trends in runoff and indirectly alter the sediment loads. The findings provide a good reference for the effective promotion of climate change adaptation, water resources planning and river basin management.","[Wang, Fei; Zhao, Guangju; Mu, Xingmin; Gao, Peng; Sun, Wenyi] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi Provinc, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fei; Zhao, Guangju; Mu, Xingmin; Gao, Peng; Sun, Wenyi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi Provinc, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fei; Zhao, Guangju; Mu, Xingmin; Gao, Peng; Sun, Wenyi] Minist Water Resources, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi Provinc, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Northwest A&F University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Ministry of Water Resources","Wang, F (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, 26 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi Provinc, Peoples R China.",wafe@ms.iswc.ac.cn; gjzhao@ms.iswc.ac.cn; xmmu@ms.iswc.ac.cn; gaopeng@ms.iswc.ac.cn; sunwy@lreis.ac.cn,"Fei, Wang/J-8497-2013","Fei, Wang/0000-0002-5213-4399; Zhao, Guangju/0000-0002-4233-9403; Zhao, Guangju/0000-0001-7756-4494","National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [41201266, 41271295, 41171420]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KZZD-EW-04]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [QN2013071, QN2011150]",National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work was supported by the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (Nos. 41201266, 41271295 and 41171420), the Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. KZZD-EW-04) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (QN2013071 and QN2011150).

Our objectives are to describe temporal and spatial trends in various extreme indicators and their sensitivity to climate change and to demonstrate geographic differences in indicator trends in NYS. We analyzed data from the US Historical Climatology Network for NYS from 1948 to 2008. We assessed trends in 15 temperature and 11 precipitation indicators using linear regression with bootstrapping in SAS and RClimDex software. The indicators showing the most substantial change per decade were frost days (-0.97 days per decade) and diurnal temperature (-0.11A degrees C). For precipitation indicators, the number of heavy precipitation days (+0.99 days), consecutive wet days (+ 0.42 days), the total wet day precipitation (+30.19 mm), and the simple daily intensity index (+0.18 mm/day) showed the most change per decade. The most representative indicators that showed significant trends for more than half of the stations were number of cool nights, diurnal temperature, and number of frost days and increase in total wet day precipitation and simple daily intensity index for precipitation. The most sensitive regions for changes in extreme indicators were the eastern and Great Lakes regions of NYS. In light of these consistent temporal trends of warming and increasing precipitation in NYS with large geographic variation, the indicators that have been identified should be further evaluated and assessed for their health impact. Geographical differences in climate trends may be of use in informing policy and resource allocation for climate change adaptation.","[Insaf, T.

Mitigation and adaptation measures are required to tackle the challenges of climate change. Adaptive measures - structural and behavioural strategies - are the focus of this paper. Structural strategies include flexible and adaptive structural systems; while behavioural strategies cover the spatial, personal, and psychological control measures which may influence the design and operations of buildings. The study explores the adaptive thermal comfort of occupants and examines the design strategies for adapting buildings to climate change in the tropical context, with a view to determine the effectiveness of these strategies as observed in the case study. The study was conducted during the rainy and dry seasons in Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria, located in a warm humid climate zone. The Institute of Venture Design student hostel was used as case-study to conduct the survey on a sample of 40 respondents by means of structured questionnaire. The respondents' thermal sensation and access to thermal controls were determined, and their thermal sensation and thermal adaptability in both seasons comparatively analyzed. Indoor environmental parameters including air temperature, mean radiant temperature, relative humidity and air velocity were also measured. The data were analyzed using relevant descriptive and inferential statistics. The study discussed the effectiveness of design strategies available for building adaptation in an era of climate change within the warm humid environment, concluding on the need for greater synergy between the techno-structural and socio-behavioural dimensions of building adaptation.","[Adebamowo, Mike] Univ Lagos, Dept Architecture, Lagos, Nigeria; [Ilesanmi, Adetokunbo O.] Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Dept Architecture, Ife, Nigeria",University of Lagos; Obafemi Awolowo University,"Adebamowo, M (corresponding author), Univ Lagos, Dept Architecture, Lagos, Nigeria.",adebamowomichael@yahoo.com; aoikcom@yahoo.com,,"Adebamowo, Michael Adeloye/0000-0001-9178-1321",,,,,44,2,2,0,9,OPEN HOUSE INT,GREAT BRITAIN,"URBAN INTERNATIONAL PRESS, PO BOX 74, GATESHEAD, TYNE & WEAR, GREAT BRITAIN, NE9 5UZ, ENGLAND",0168-2601,,,OPEN HOUSE INT,Open House Int.,DEC,2012,37,4,,,,,72,80,,,,,,9,Architecture; Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Architecture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,068SZ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000313387800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The analysis comprises several regime elements considered to be important in adaptive and integrated water management: agency, awareness raising and education, type of governance and cooperation structures, information management and-exchange, policy development and-implementation, risk management, and finances and cost recovery. This comparative analysis has an explorative character intended to identify general patterns in adaptive and integrated water management and to determine its role in coping with the impacts of climate change on floods and droughts. The results show that there is a strong interdependence of the elements within a water management regime, and as such this interdependence is a stabilizing factor in current management regimes. For example, this research provides evidence that a lack of joint/participative knowledge is an important obstacle for cooperation, or vice versa. We argue that there is a two-way relationship between information management and collaboration. Moreover, this research suggests that bottom-up governance is not a straightforward solution to water management problems in large-scale, complex, multiple-use systems, such as river basins. Instead, all the regimes being analyzed are in a process of finding a balance between bottom-up and top-down governance. Finally, this research shows that in a basin where one type of extreme is dominant-like droughts in the Alentejo (Portugal) and floods in Rivierenland (Netherlands)-the potential impacts of other extremes are somehow ignored or not perceived with the urgency they might deserve.","[Huntjens, Patrick; Pahl-Wostl, Claudia] Univ Osnabruck, Inst Environm Syst Res, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany; [Grin, John] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Social Sci Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University Osnabruck; University of Amsterdam,"Huntjens, P (corresponding author), Univ Osnabruck, Inst Environm Syst Res, Barbarastr 12,Geb 66, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany.",patrickhuntjens@yahoo.com,,"Grin, John/0000-0001-7933-2574",European Commission [511179 (GOCE)]; EU,European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); EU(European Commission),"Acknowledgments We would like to thank the local stakeholders and experts in the four case-studies, in the Netherlands, Portugal, Hungary, and Ukraine.

Climate change is expected to make water insecurity in rural areas more severe as weather patterns become unfavourable. The extent to which the mining sector is able to reduce its impact on water resources and adapt to climate change will have implications for host communities. This paper explores the relationship between climate change, mining development and water security and how this places rural communities in a position of risk from mining development and climate change for water security. This paper focuses on the Fuleni and Somkhele rural communities located within the uMkhanyakude District Municipality in Northern KwaZulu-Natal, a climate change-induced water scarce area. Despite drought, mining operations continue. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data from key social actors in the Fuleni community (i.e. residents opposing mining development) and with Somkhele residents (already burdening with mining operations). Additionally for Somkhele, a questionnaire was used to ascertain 424 household views on the impacts of climate variability and mining impacts on livelihoods and water. Results indicated an interplay between climate change, mining impacts and water (and food) security. Development must be implemented in an integrated and holistic manner that contributes to sustainable development and does not impact on water resources. Technological innovations related to water and energy and inter-sectoral collaborations must be prioritised between mining, the government, and civil society, to achieve water security.","[Leonard, Llewellyn] Univ South Africa, Dept Environm Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Leonard, L (corresponding author), Univ South Africa, Dept Environm Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa.",llewel@unisa.ac.za,,,,,,,49,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,MAR 4,2023,28,3,,,,,331,346,,10.1080/13549839.2022.2136644,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2022.2136644,,DEC 2022,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,9F7XU,,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000898038600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach In all, 85 journalists from five local media were identified using snowballing and purposive methods where quantitative methods were applied. Findings The results show nearly a half (49 per cent) of the journalists yet to receive training on climate change, with the majority (77 per cent) of organisations providing such training being non-local. The majority (79.8 per cent) of media houses lack editorial policies. Findings show journalists mostly cover information on climate impact and adaptation (49.3 per cent) followed by weather and climate trends (33.8 per cent), while the least covered topics are on renewable energy and climate and poverty (1.4 per cent). Practical implications - The results imply journalists lack training on climate change. This may result into low and poor quality coverage of climate change information and inadequate public awareness and understanding. The study concludes that challenges in verifying information from a source, media lack of editorial policy and little exposure and access to specific internet climate change information sources may affect public agenda setting, coverage and adaptation to climate change. It is suggested that a policy be established to foster on access to climate information through frequent short training which expose journalists to new knowledge and networking. Originality/value This study contributes to literature and knowledge on climate themes reported in developing countries and factors influencing coverage of climate change.","[Elia, Emmanuel Frank] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Dept Informat Studies, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",University of Dar es Salaam,"Elia, EF (corresponding author), Univ Dar Es Salaam, Dept Informat Studies, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.",makalafrank@gmail.com,,"Elia, Emmanuel/0000-0001-5814-4320",,,,,50,3,3,1,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2514-9342,2514-9350,,GLOB KNOWL MEM COMMU,Glob.

The country experiences yearly displacement of approximately one million people and losses of about 1% of its gross domestic product due to cyclones, floods, and riverbank erosion. This study examines how the Bangladesh government has managed climate-induced displacement with a particular focus on socioeconomic development policies. We analyzed the country's 1984 Land Reform Ordinance, the 2009 climate change strategy and action plan, the 1997 agricultural Khasland settlement policy, perspective plan for 2010-2021, poverty reduction strategy paper, and five-year plans to understand governance changes for displaced communities. We found that, overall, the central government implemented four main strategies. In the first strategy, Bangladesh resettled displaced people in cluster villages on public lands. Then, it provided life skills training (e.g., leadership, disaster preparedness, income generation) to rehabilitate the residents. The third strategy was to align resettlement efforts with local-level climate change adaptation and poverty reduction activities. Here, the central government and its seventeen departments collaborated with local councils to support resettled households under the social safety program. The fourth strategy was to diversify financial resources by obtaining more fund from donors and establishing its own financial mechanism. However, we also found that the decision-making and implementation process remained top-down without need assessment and community participation. This paper intends to offer insights on how similar challenged countries and regions may respond to climate displacement in the future.","[Kisinger, Chakma] Univ Tsukuba, Doctoral Program Sustainable Environm Studies, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan; [Matsui, Kenichi] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan",University of Tsukuba; University of Tsukuba,"Kisinger, C (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Doctoral Program Sustainable Environm Studies, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan.",kisingerchakma@yahoo.com; matsui.kenichi.gt@u.tsukuba.ac.jp,,"Chakma, Kisinger/0000-0002-0092-2203","Project for Human Resource Development Scholarship (JDS) by Japanese Grant Aid, Japan International Cooperation Center (JICE), Nishi-Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan","Project for Human Resource Development Scholarship (JDS) by Japanese Grant Aid, Japan International Cooperation Center (JICE), Nishi-Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan","This study was supported by a fellowship from the Project for Human Resource Development Scholarship (JDS) by Japanese Grant Aid, Japan International Cooperation Center (JICE), Nishi-Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan.",,42,7,7,3,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2021,13,14,,,,,,,7788,10.3390/su13147788,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13147788,,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TO7HO,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000677077900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

An increasing trend of extreme heat events has been observed over the last few decades and is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. In this study, warm periods (May to September) of 2000-2018 were examined to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the UHI and UCI characteristics for the case study of Hong Kong, China. Twenty-two weather stations in Hong Kong were classified into four categories, namely urban, urban oasis, suburban, and rural, with reference to the local climate zone (LCZ) scheme, to analyze UHI and UCI phenomena during extreme heat and non-extreme heat situations. One representative type of extreme heat events was considered in this study: three consecutive hot nights with two very hot days in between (2D3N). Results show that both the UHI and UCI effects are exacerbated during extreme heat events. Using the concept of the UHI degree hours (UHIdh) and UCI degree hours (UCIdh), their spatial patterns in Hong Kong during extreme heat and non-extreme heat situations were mapped based on multiple linear regression models. It is found that the predictor variable - windward/leeward index is a significant influential factor of both UHIdh and UCIdh during extreme heat events. The resulting UHIdh and UCIdh maps not only enhance our understanding on the spatial pattern and characteristics of the UHI and UCI during extreme heat events, but could also serve as a useful reference in climate change adaptation, heat-health risk detection, cooling-energy estimation and policy making.","[Ren, Chao] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Architecture, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Kai] UCL, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, London, England; [Shi, Yuan] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Future Cities, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kwok, Yu Ting] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Architecture, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Morakinyo, Tobi Eniolu] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Geog, Dublin, Ireland; [Lee, Tsz-cheung] Hong Kong Observ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Yuguo] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mech Engn, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; University of London; University College London; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong; University College Dublin; University of Hong Kong,"Wang, K (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, London, England.",kai.wang@ucl.ac.uk,"Lee, Tsz-cheung/AAW-2799-2021; Shi, Yuan/AAF-9427-2022; Shi, Yuan/AFK-2138-2022; REN, Chao/L-8938-2019","Lee, Tsz-cheung/0000-0003-1961-2675; Shi, Yuan/0000-0003-4011-8735; Shi, Yuan/0000-0003-4011-8735; REN, Chao/0000-0002-8494-2585; MORAKINYO, Tobi Eniolu/0000-0001-7929-2832; Li, Yuguo/0000-0002-2281-4529; Kwok, Yu Ting/0000-0002-3612-748X; Wang, Kai/0000-0001-6829-0268",Research Impact Fund [R4046-18]; General Research Fund Project Grant 2017-18 [RGC-GRF 14611517],Research Impact Fund; General Research Fund Project Grant 2017-18,"Research Impact Fund, Grant/Award Number: R4046-18; General Research Fund Project Grant 2017-18, Grant/Award Number: RGC-GRF 14611517",,71,11,11,10,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Rural communities in the developing world suffer the most from the negative effects of climate change. As such, their success in combating the effects of climate change is through establishing culture-specific methods. These methods constitute what I refer to in this article as climate governance through IKS. The impacts of climate change faced by rural communities include water shortages, drought, and floods, to mention a few. Drought is anticipated to bring about adverse consequences to water supply, which negatively affects food production and the environment in its entirety. Hence, this study investigates the methods of IKS water harvesting and other IKS-based adaptation and overall governance methods. The study employed a qualitative method in which participants took part in in-depth interviews and a focus group discussion (FGD) and data was analysed through thematic content analysis (TCA) and grounded theory. The study found that the role of spirit mediums and spirituality is essential in IKS climate governance. It also established that one of the most famous forms of climate change adaptation strategies in Mutoko district is IKS-based irrigation. The role of social networks was found to be essential in the sharing of ideas pertaining to irrigation and other adaptive methods of farming. Through the findings of the study, I developed a model that reflects and interprets indigenous-based climate governance structure in Mutoko district.","[Mugambiwa, Shingirai S.] Univ Limpopo, Dept Social Work, Sovenga, South Africa",University of Limpopo,"Mugambiwa, SS (corresponding author), Univ Limpopo, Dept Social Work, Sovenga, South Africa.",mugambiwashingirai@gmail.com,,"Mugambiwa, Shingirai Stanely/0000-0003-4137-3594",,,,,30,0,0,1,4,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1996-1421,2072-845X,,JAMBA-J DISASTER RIS,Jamba-J.

Agro-industrial projects linked to climate change goals are reshaping both social and ecological dynamics, by altering patterns of access to land and water resources as well as the nature of the resources themselves. Using a landscape perspective, we investigate these social and ecological changes occurring across space and time. Drawing on data from community researchers, field visits, interviews and secondary sources, we examine two kinds of connections between climate change responses and resource conflicts in the Greater Aural: 1) demand for biofuels as a driver of flex crop expansion; and 2) the construction of irrigation infrastructure as a climate change adaptation strategy. Findings include that some impacts of flex crop expansion and irrigation systems are local and immediate, for example when villagers lose land, plantation workers are not paid, and cassava processing pollutes local water supplies. Other impacts are transferred to different locations or deferred to the future, for example when changes in water quality and quantity affect those living downstream, or when soil degraded by cassava production becomes unproductive for future generations. We conclude that climate change strategies are now deeply entangled with resource conflicts in the Greater Aural region. Adopting a landscape perspective and working directly with community researchers opens new pathways for identifying not only site-specific, but also cumulative and shifting impacts of climate change strategies and their relationship to resource conflicts.

Given the local and context specific nature of climate impacts, the involvement of municipalities is key for effective mitigation and adaptation solutions. Due to its vulnerability and low level of adaptive capacity, Portugal offers insights into adaptation research and practice in Europe. This article hypothesizes that National and European climate change adaptation strategies are not effectively involving municipalities, and are thus losing out on the opportunity to take stock of local responses for climate change mitigation and adaptation. To address this issue, a survey by questionnaire was done to Portuguese municipalities, and data was collected regarding the following: the importance attributed to climate change; the mitigation and adaptation measures planned and implemented; the main drivers, concerns, and triggers promoting climate policy and actions; and access to information and knowledge. 109 valid responses were collected across the country from a universe of 308 municipalities. Results show climate change in planning agendas is still 'little' or 'not important'. There is also a clear difference in the drivers and concerns motivating climate policy, and action between Littoral and Inland regions. Overall, there is a greater focus on mitigation than adaptation. The discussion highlights the need for capacity building, the issue of equity, the role of European networks, and the relevance of cultural differences between Littoral and Inland regions. The conclusion distils the main lessons learned concerning these challenges and needs, the role of transnational networks, and the cultural contexts for building resilience, through adaptation, across Europe.

The majority of previous research to evaluate models has been based on the mean state, but for confidence in projections the plausibility of the mechanisms for change is just as, if not more, important. In this study we demonstrate a methodology for process-based assessment of projections, whereby circulation changes accompanying future responses are examined and then compared to atmospheric dynamics during historical years in models and reanalyses. We apply this methodology to an ensemble of five global and regional model experiments and focus on West Africa, where these models project a strong drying trend. The analysis reveals that this drying is associated with anomalous subsidence in the upper atmosphere, and large warming of the Saharan heat low region, with potential feedback effects via the African easterly jet and West African monsoon. This mode occurs during dry years in the historical period, and dominates in the future experiments. However, the same mode is not found in dry years in reanalysis data, which casts doubt on the reasons for strong drying in these models. The regional models show a very similar response to their driving global models, and are therefore no more trustworthy in this case. This result underlines the importance of assessing model credibility on a case-by-case basis and implies that process-based methodologies should be applied to other model projections before their outputs are used to inform decision making.","[James, Rachel; Washington, Richard] Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Climate Res Lab, Oxford, England; [Jones, Richard] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Jones, Richard] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England",University of Oxford; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; University of Oxford,"James, R (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Climate Res Lab, Oxford, England.",rachel.james@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"James, Rachel Anne/GQI-4427-2022","James, Rachel Anne/0000-0001-5738-1092; Jones, Richard/0000-0002-0904-3141; Washington, Richard/0000-0003-2521-4614","UK Joint Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC); Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) MOHC Climate Programme [GA01101]","UK Joint Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC); Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) MOHC Climate Programme","The GCM data used in this study were produced through work supported by the UK Joint Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) MOHC Climate Programme (GA01101).

As these models continue to become more sophisticated, it is commonly assumed that the latest generation of climate models will provide us with better estimates of climate change. Here, we quantify the uncertainty in future climate change projections using two multi-model ensembles of climate model simulations and divide it into different components: internal, scenario and model. The contributions of these sources of uncertainty changes as a function of variable, temporal and spatial scale and especially lead time in the future. In the new models, uncertainty intervals for each of the components have increased. For temperature, importance of scenario uncertainty is the largest over low latitudes and increases nonlinearly after the mid-century. It has a small importance for precipitation simulations on all time scales, which hampers estimating the effect which any mitigation efforts might have. In line with current state-of-the-art adaptation approaches, we argue that despite these uncertainties climate models can provide useful information to support adaptation decision-making. Moreover, adaptation decisions should not be postponed in the hope that future improved scientific understanding will result in more accurate predictions of future climate change. Such simulations might not become available. On the contrary, while planning adaptation initiatives, a rational framework for decision-making under uncertainty should be employed. We suggest that there is an urgent need for continued development and use of improved risk analysis methods for climate change adaptation.","[Ylhaisi, Jussi S.; Raisanen, Jouni] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, Helsinki, Finland; [Garre, Luca] De Norske Veritas, Hovik, Norway; [Daron, Joseph] Univ Cape Town, Climate Syst Anal Grp, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Helsinki; University of Cape Town,"Ylhaisi, JS (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, Helsinki, Finland.",jussi.s.ylhaisi@helsinki.fi,"Räisänen, Jouni/A-8203-2011; Daron, Joseph/I-3942-2014","Räisänen, Jouni/0000-0003-3657-1588; Daron, Joseph/0000-0003-1917-0264",Academy of Finland [140801]; Finnish Academy of Science and Letters; Academy of Finland (AKA) [140801] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Finnish Academy of Science and Letters(Academy of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Academy of FinlandFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES)),"The opinions expressed in this paper are those of the authors solely and should not be construed as reflecting the views of the affiliating institutions and companies.

The authors assessed 1,642 short and concise sentences (key facts), which were extracted from 722 relevant articles and stored in a climate change knowledge base. Key facts pertaining to temperature, precipitation, water, and food for 6 selected pathogens were scrutinized, evaluated, and compiled according to exposure pathways. These key facts (corresponding to approximately 50,000 words) were mapped to 275 terminology terms identified in the literature, which generated 6,341 connections. These relationships were plotted on semantic network maps to examine the interconnections between variables. The risk of campylobacteriosis is associated with mean weekly temperatures, although this link is shown more strongly in the literature relating to salmonellosis. Irregular and severe rain events are associated with Cryptosporidium sp. outbreaks, while noncholera Vibrio sp. displays increased growth rates in coastal waters during hot summers. In contrast, for Norovirus and Listeria sp. the association with climatic variables was relatively weak, but much stronger for food determinants. Electronic data mining to assess the impact of climate change on food- and waterborne diseases assured a methodical appraisal of the field. This climate change knowledge base can support national climate change vulnerability, impact, and adaptation assessments and facilitate the management of future threats from infectious diseases. In the light of diminishing resources for public health this approach can help balance different climate change adaptation options.","[Semenza, Jan C.; Suk, Jonathan E.] European Ctr Dis Prevent & Control ECDC, Sci Advice Unit, Future Threats & Determinants Sect, S-17183 Stockholm, Sweden; [Herbst, Susanne; Rechenburg, Andrea; Hoeser, Christoph; Schreiber, Christiane; Kistemann, Thomas] Univ Bonn, Dept Med Geog & Publ Hlth, Inst Hyg & Publ Hlth, Bonn, Germany",European Centre for Disease Prevention & Control; University of Bonn,"Semenza, JC (corresponding author), European Ctr Dis Prevent & Control ECDC, Sci Advice Unit, Future Threats & Determinants Sect, Tomtebodavagen 11A, S-17183 Stockholm, Sweden.",Jan.Semenza@ecdc.europa.eu,"Suk, Jonathan/L-2300-2017; Schreiber, Christiane/ABC-7050-2020","Suk, Jonathan/0000-0003-4689-4583; Kistemann, Thomas/0000-0002-3306-7100; Hoser, Christoph/0000-0002-8947-256X",,,,,113,90,90,4,96,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1064-3389,1547-6537,,CRIT REV ENV SCI TEC,Crit.

A short review of progress shows that effectiveness has so far been limited. Although there has been intense donor activity in relation to stating commitment to the EPI principle and developing a wide range of processes, institutions, and tools, a large part of ODA still is likely to have directly harmful impacts on the environment. The implications for EPI of the emerging governance framework for ODA, namely, the principles stipulated in the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, are then discussed. Both challenges and opportunities are presented, and these are empirically illustrated with a case study of the integration of climate change adaptation in ODA. Finally, this article proposes that at least four special conditions apply to EPI in the bilateral ODA context as compared with domestic EPI: two or more jurisdictions, electorates, and governments are involved; a negotiation context characterized by sovereign states but with a potential power asymmetry; potential conflicts of interest and equity concerns in cases where environmental objectives refer to global environmental problems primarily caused by developed countries; and a policy-making process characterized by a comparatively wide span of both strategic and operational decisions, where EPI can take on very different meanings. The initial exploration presented in this article suggests that these conditions hold, and that, as a consequence, EPI arguably involves more 'high-politics' decisions and questions than in a domestic policy context.","Stockholm Environm Inst, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm Environment Institute,"Persson, A (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Kraftriket 2B, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",asa.persson@sei.se,"Persson, Åsa/ABD-8096-2021","Persson, Asa/0000-0002-8886-5046",,,,,77,20,20,2,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

We aim to investigate livelihood adaptation strategies of herder households and the types of local institutions that shaped those adaptation strategies. We examined the barriers and opportunities for strengthening adaptive capacity of local herder communities. We designed and implemented a household survey in the herder communities of northern Tibet. The survey results showed that migratory grazing has become less feasible. Storage, diversification, and market exchange have become the dominant adaptation strategies. The adaptation strategies of local herders have been reshaped by local institutional change. Local governmental and market institutions played the dominant roles in reshaping climate adaptation strategies. Although the present livelihood adaption strategies related to sedentary grazing have improved productivity and profitability of the herding livelihood, they have led to continuous deterioration of pastures. The local grazing system has become more and more dependent on artificial feeding and inputs from outside the grazing system. Purchasing forage has become one of the dominant adaptation strategies of local herder households. Multilevel regression modeling of this adaptation behavior showed that explanatory variables related to climate variability, household capital, and local institutional arrangements had statistically significant relationships with the adoption of this adaptation strategy. The results implies that building household capital and promoting the coordination among local governmental, market, and communal institutions are critical for strengthening adaptive capacity of the Tibetan herder communities.","[Wang, Jun] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Key Lab Human & Environm Sci & Technol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yang; Qin, Dahe] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Shuangcheng] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University; University Town of Shenzhen; China Meteorological Administration; Peking University,"Wang, J (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Key Lab Human & Environm Sci & Technol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",,"Li, Shuangcheng/HKP-3019-2023",,"State Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Sciences; Cold and Arid Regions Environment and Engineering Research Institute, China [SKLCS-OP-2014-10]; Laboratory for Climate Studies Open Funds for Young Scholars, China; National Science Foundation of China [41401215]","State Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Sciences; Cold and Arid Regions Environment and Engineering Research Institute, China; Laboratory for Climate Studies Open Funds for Young Scholars, China; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was conducted with financial support from the State Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Sciences, Cold and Arid Regions Environment and Engineering Research Institute, China (SKLCS-OP-2014-10), Laboratory for Climate Studies Open Funds for Young Scholars, China (2015), and National Science Foundation of China (41401215).

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, oral histories, and archival research, I show that engineers' decision-making regarding whether or not to innovate sea defenses is a fraught process dependent upon processes of erosion and the ontological (in)stability of specific infrastructures known as groynes. To cope, engineers produce what I call innovation narratives to describe how obstacles to climate adaptation are created by combinations of neocolonial empire, shapeshifting ecologies, inconsistent maintenance programs, and fiscal debt. At the same time, their efforts signal an emerging global politics of credibility that is reinforced by desires for more inclusive forms of governance rather than brute power or capitalization.","[Vaughn, Sarah E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Anthropol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Vaughn, SE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Anthropol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,73,0,0,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0010-4175,1475-2999,,COMP STUD SOC HIST,Comp.

Knowing which aspects of this link are well researched, and where in contrast research gaps lie, can provide guidance to institutional economists interested in adaptation. We contribute to this through a systematic review of the adaptation literature, assessing the consideration adaptation scholars give to different elements of the Institutional Analysis and Development framework. Results show a strong focus on collective choice and on adaptation by public actors, with an emphasis on rules in use, social interactions and, to a lesser extent, attributes of the community.

In the present study, two field experiments were conducted during 2017-18 and 2018-19 growing seasons. Four safflower cultivars, namely, Goldasht, Faraman, Sofeh, and Parnian, were grown under normal, moderate, and severe terminal heat stress (THS) conditions. Sowing date with desired temperature was considered as control, delayed, and late sowing dates were considered as moderate and severe THS, respectively, so that the flowering and grain filling periods of cultivars were exposed to heat stress. H2O2 concentration and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were increased in response to moderate and severe THS for all cultivars except for Goldasht in 2017-2018, indicating heat stress-induced oxidative stress. The highest MDA contents (27.3 and 17 mmol g(-1)Fw(-1)) were found in Sofeh under severe THS during 2017-2018 and 2018-2019, respectively. Moreover, the scavenging activity of DPPH radicals and activity of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), ascorbate peroxidise (APX), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), and Glutathione S-transferase (GST) were increased in response to moderate and severe THS. Free amino acids accumulation including gamma-aminobutyric acid, lysine, leucine, isoleucine, taurine, and tyrosine was observed in response to THS. Further, we found that Faraman accumulated higher contents of fructose, xylose, and galactose in fraction under THS, whereas xylose content was significantly higher in Sofeh as compared to the other carbohydrates. By comparison, Faraman and Goldasht were most tolerant to heat stress due to significant increase in DPPH value, phenol and carbohydrate contents, free amino acid contents, and higher antioxidant activity compared to the other cultivars. Totally, these results underlay the enhanced tolerance to heat stress of the safflower cultivars, and changes in these traits in delayed and late sowing dates clarify that the perspective of oilseed crops cultivation in arid region is probably related to their potential adaptation to climate change.","[Salehi, Farshad; Rahnama, Afrasyab; Meskarbashee, Moosa; Khanlou, Khosro Mehdi] Shahid Chamran Univ Ahvaz, Dept Agron & Plant Breeding, Ahvaz, Iran; [Ghorbanpour, Mansour] Arak Univ, Fac Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Med Plants, Arak 3815688349, Iran",Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz; Arak University,"Rahnama, A (corresponding author), Shahid Chamran Univ Ahvaz, Dept Agron & Plant Breeding, Ahvaz, Iran.;Ghorbanpour, M (corresponding author), Arak Univ, Fac Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Med Plants, Arak 3815688349, Iran.",a.rahnama@scu.ac.ir; m-ghorbanpour@araku.ac.ir,,,,,,,58,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0721-7595,1435-8107,,J PLANT GROWTH REGUL,J.

While adaptation to climate change should be the priority for smallholder production systems, adoption of cost-effective mitigation options in agriculture not only contributes to food security but also reduces the extent of climate change and future adaptation needs. Utilizing management data from 16,413 and 12,548 crop and livestock farmers and associated soil and climatic data, we estimated GHG emissions generated from crop and livestock production using crop and livestock models, respectively. Mitigation measures in crop and livestock production, their mitigation potential and cost/benefit of adoption were then obtained from literature review, stakeholder consultations and expert opinion. We applied the identified mitigation measures to a realistic scale of adoption scenario in the short- (2030) and long-term (2050). Our results were then validated through stakeholders consultations. Here, we present identified mitigation options, their mitigation potentials and cost or benefit of adoption in the form of Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACC). Based on our analysis, total GHG emissions from agricultural sector in Bangladesh for the year 2014-15 is 76.79 million tonne (Mt) carbon-dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e). Business-as-usual GHG emissions from the agricultural sector in Bangladesh are approximately 86.87 and 100.44 Mt CO(2)e year(-1) by 2030 and 2050, respectively. Adoption of climate-smart crop and livestock management options to reduce emissions considering a realistic adoption scenario would offer GHG mitigation opportunities of 9.51 and 14.21 Mt CO(2)e year(-1) by 2030 and 2050, respectively. Of this mitigation potential, 70-75% can be achieved through cost-saving options that could benefit smallholder farmers. Realization of this potential mitigation benefit, however, largely depends on the degree to which supportive policies and measures can encourage farmers' adoption of the identified climate smart agricultural techniques. Therefore, government should focus on facilitating uptake of these options through appropriate policy interventions, incentive mechanisms and strengthening agricultural extension programs.

In northeastern Canada, peatland permafrost is predicted to be concentrated in the western interior of Labrador but is assumed to be largely absent along the Labrador Sea coastline. However, the paucity of observations of peatland permafrost in the interior, coupled with traditional and ongoing use of perennially frozen peatlands along the coast by Labrador Inuit and Innu, suggests a need for re-evaluation of the reliability of existing peatland permafrost distribution estimates for the region. In this study, we develop a multi-stage consensus-based point inventory of peatland permafrost complexes in coastal Labrador and adjacent parts of Quebec using high-resolution satellite imagery, and we validate it with extensive field visits and low-altitude aerial photography and videography. A subset of 2092 wetland complexes that potentially contained peatland permafrost were inventoried, of which 1119 were classified as likely containing peatland permafrost. Likely peatland permafrost complexes were mostly found in lowlands within 22 km of the coastline, where mean annual air temperatures often exceed +1 ?. A clear gradient in peatland permafrost distribution exists from the outer coasts, where peatland permafrost is more abundant, to inland peatlands, where permafrost is generally absent. This coastal gradient may be attributed to a combination of climatic and geomorphological influences which lead to lower insolation, thinner snowpacks, and poorly drained, frost-susceptible materials along the coast. The results of this study suggest that existing estimates of permafrost distribution for southeastern Labrador require adjustments to better reflect the abundance of peatland permafrost complexes to the south of the regional sporadic discontinuous permafrost limit. This study constitutes the first dedicated peatland permafrost inventory for Labrador and provides an important baseline for future mapping, modelling, and climate change adaptation strategy development in the region.","[Wang, Yifeng; Way, Robert G.; Beer, Jordan; Forget, Anika; Tutton, Rosamond] Northern Environm Geosci Lab, Dept Geog & Planning, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Tutton, Rosamond] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Global Water Futures, Yellowknife, NT X1A 2P8, Canada; [Purcell, Meredith C.] Torngat Wildlife Plants & Fisheries Secretariat, Happy Valley Goose Bay, NS A0P 1E0, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University,"Wang, YF (corresponding author), Northern Environm Geosci Lab, Dept Geog & Planning, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",yifeng.wang@queensu.ca,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Discovery Grant Program and Northern Research Supplement), Polar Knowledge Canada (Northern Scientific Training Program); Queen's University (Graduate Dean's Doctoral Field Travel Grant)","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Discovery Grant Program and Northern Research Supplement), Polar Knowledge Canada (Northern Scientific Training Program); Queen's University (Graduate Dean's Doctoral Field Travel Grant)","This research has been supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Discovery Grant Program and Northern Research Supplement), Polar Knowledge Canada (Northern Scientific Training Program), and Queen's University (Graduate Dean's Doctoral Field Travel Grant)",,86,0,0,4,4,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1994-0416,1994-0424,,CRYOSPHERE,Cryosphere,JAN 10,2023,17,1,,,,,63,78,,10.5194/tc-17-63-2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-63-2023,,,16,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,7T3UA,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000911368900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

One of the most climate-vulnerable nations in the eastern and central Indo-Gangetic Basin is Bangladesh. There have been numerous studies on the effects of climate change in Bangladesh; however, most of them tended to just look at a small fraction of the impact elements or were climatic projections without accounting for the effects on agriculture. Additionally, simulation studies using the CERES-Rice and CERES-Wheat models were conducted for rice and wheat to evaluate the effects of climate change on Bangladeshi agriculture. However, up to now, Bangladesh has not implemented farming system ideas by integrating cropping systems with other income-generating activities. This study was conducted as part of the Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB) regional evaluations using the protocols and integrated assessment processes of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP). It was also done to calibrate crop models (APSIM and DSSAT) using rice and wheat. To assist policymakers in creating national and regional plans for anticipated future agricultural systems, our work on the integrated evaluation of climate change impacts on agricultural systems produced realistic predictions. The outcome of this research prescribes a holistic assessment of climate change on future production systems by including all the relevant enterprises in the agriculture sector. The findings of the study suggested two major strategies to minimize the yield and increase the profitability in a rice-wheat cropping system. Using a short-term HYV (High Yielding Variety) of rice can shift the sowing time of wheat by 7 days in advance compared to the traditional sowing days of mid-November. In addition, increasing the irrigation amount by 50 mm for wheat showed a better yield by 1.5-32.2% in different scenarios. These climate change adaptation measures could increase the per capita income by as high as 3.6% on the farm level.","[Chawdhery, Md Rafique Ahasan] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Dept Agroecol & Crop Prod, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic; [Al-Mueed, Murtuza] Minist Publ Adm, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh; [Wazed, Md Abdul] Univ Auckland, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Emran, Shah-Al] Univ Illinois, Dept Crop Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Chowdhury, Md Abeed Hossain] Bangladesh Agr Res Council, Crop Zoning Project, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh; [Hussain, Sk Ghulam] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIIMMYT, Gulshan 1, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; University of Auckland; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC),"Chawdhery, MRA (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Dept Agroecol & Crop Prod, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic.",chawdhery@af.czu.cz,,"Chawdhery, Md Rafique Ahasan/0000-0002-2010-3555",research project of Technology Agency of the Czech Republic: Water systems and water management in the Czech Republic in conditions of climate change' TAC.

In this study, we investigated changes in the projected climate and simulated runoff under 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C global warming of three inland rivers in the Hexi Corridor: the Shiyang River (SYR), the Heihe River (HHR), and the Shule River (SLR). The change in climate was projected based on five global climate models (GCMs) under three representative concentration pathways (RCPs), and the change in runoff was simulated based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model. Furthermore, the uncertainties in projected climate change and simulated runoff constrained by the GCMs and RCPs were quantified. The results indicate that, compared with the baseline period (1976-2005), there is a 1.42-1.54 degrees C increase in annual air temperature and 4%-12% increase in annual mean precipitation in the three river basins under 1.5 degrees C global warming, while there is a 2.09-2.36 degrees C increase in annual air temperature and 5%-11% increase in annual mean precipitation under 2.0 degrees C global warming. The simulated annual runoff of the SYR decreases by 4% under 1.5 degrees C global warming, that of the HHR decreases by 3% and 4%, while that of the SLR increases considerably by 10% and 11% under 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C global warming, respectively. The additional 0.5 degrees C global warming results in an annual air temperature increase of 0.67-0.82 degrees C, a change of -1% to 1% in annual mean precipitation, and a change of -1% to 5% in simulated runoff. The simulated annual runoff has greater uncertainty. The simulations indicate substantial and consistent warming in autumn and winter in the three basins, relatively drier summer and autumn in the SYR and HHR basins, and a relatively drier autumn in the SLR basin. The simulated monthly runoff shows more complex changes with large uncertainties constrained mainly by the GCMs.","[Wang, Yujie] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Int Joint Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yujie] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yong] Chongqing Meteorol Serv, Chongqing Climate Ctr, Chongqing 401147, Peoples R China; [Xu, Hongmei] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; China Meteorological Administration,"Xu, HM (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",xuhm@cma.cn,"xu, hong/GSD-8903-2022",,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFA0606302, SQ2018YFE010367]; China Meteorological Administration Climate Change Project [CCSF201924]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; China Meteorological Administration Climate Change Project,Supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFA0606302 and SQ2018YFE010367) and China Meteorological Administration Climate Change Project (CCSF201924).,,60,5,5,8,22,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2095-6037,2198-0934,,J METEOROL RES-PRC,J.

For this purpose, five irrigation management strategies, ranging from no irrigation (NI) to controlled deficit irrigation (CDI) and full irrigation (FI), were evaluated concerning their impact on the inter-seasonal variability of the expected yields and improvements of the yield potential. The study was conducted on a maize crop (Zea mays L.) at a representative site in northern Togo with a hot semi-arid climate and pronounced dry and wet rainfall seasons. The OCCASION (Optimal Climate Change Adaption Strategies in Irrigation) framework was adapted and applied. It consists of: (i) a weather generator for simulating long climate time series; (ii) the AquaCrop model, which was used to simulate the irrigation system during the growing season and the yield response of maize to the considered irrigation management strategies; and (iii) a problem-specific algorithm for optimal irrigation scheduling with limited water supply. We found high variability in rainfall during the wet season which leads to considerable variability in the expected yield for rainfed conditions (NI). This variability was significantly reduced when supplemental irrigation management strategies (CDI or FI) requiring a reasonably low water demand of about 150 mm were introduced. For the dry season, it was shown that both irrigation management strategies (CDI and FI) would increase yield potential for the local variety TZEE-W up to 4.84 Mg/ha and decrease the variability of the expected yield at the same time. However, even with CDI management, more than 400 mm of water is required if irrigation would be introduced during the dry season in northern Togo. Substantial rainwater harvesting and irrigation infrastructures would be needed to achieve that.","[Gadedjisso-Tossou, Agossou; Avellan, Tamara] United Nations Univ, Inst Integrated Management Mat Fluxes & Resources, Ammonstr 74, D-01067 Dresden, Germany; [Gadedjisso-Tossou, Agossou; Schuetze, Niels] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Hydrol & Meteorol, D-01069 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Gadedjisso-Tossou, A (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Integrated Management Mat Fluxes & Resources, Ammonstr 74, D-01067 Dresden, Germany.;Gadedjisso-Tossou, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Hydrol & Meteorol, D-01069 Dresden, Germany.",Agossou.Gadedjisso-Tossou@tu-dresden.de; avellan@unu.edu; niels.schuetze@tu-dresden.de,"GADEDJISSO-TOSSOU, Agossou/W-2479-2019; Schütze, Niels/AAI-9459-2020","GADEDJISSO-TOSSOU, Agossou/0000-0002-4338-7490; Schütze, Niels/0000-0002-2376-528X; Avellan, Cecilia Tamara/0000-0003-0690-0942",Merit Scholarship Programme (MSP) 2015/2016 of the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB),Merit Scholarship Programme (MSP) 2015/2016 of the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB),This research was supported by a grant to A.G.-T.

It can be, yet not automatically, addressed by collective and individual, planned and spontaneous coping strategies, which the objectives may vary according to the interests. The anticipation of reconstruction is a major challenge to optimize the integration of a preventive ethic and, more generally, to facilitate decision-making in the post-disaster period. The study of the phases of the process through medium- and long-term feedback allows us to identify rules, and to define constraining factors and pitfalls in the one hand, and favourable conditions and means of action in the other hand, regarding the Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation to pursue Sustainable Development objectives. This method combines the social science surveys, documentary analysis and GIS, and is carried out several years after the disaster. To illustrate the reasoning and clarify the links between adaptations and resilience, we rely on the analysis of two post-disaster reconstructions in the French metropolitan area: the Aude department after the floods of 12 and 13 November 1999, and the Dracenie area (Var department) following the floods of 15 and 16 June 2010. They are also completed by an analysis of the evolution of risk and disaster management perceptions, and an analysis of long-term memory in the municipality of Cuxac-d'Aude. Examples of adaptations have been integrated into the reconstruction but opportunistically without a real overall strategy. It appears that the catastrophic event alone cannot be the trigger for an increase of resilience and a real strategy of adaptation to risk. Henceforth, the implementation of a preventive reconstruction cannot be improvised: the anticipation effort is as necessary as necessarily limited by the need for ad hoc adjustment of recovery strategies.","[Moatty, Annabelle; Vinet, Freddy; Defossez, Stephanie; Cherel, Jean-Philippe] Univ Montpellier 3, IRD, Unite Mixte Rech Gouvernance Risques Environm & D, 2 Rue Pr Henri Serres, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Grelot, Frederic] IRSTEA Inst Natl Rech Sci & Technol Environm & Ag, Usages G EAU, Acteurs, Unite Mixte Rech Gest Eau, 361 Rue JF Breton, F-34000 Montpellier, France",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Universite Paul-Valery; AgroParisTech; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); INRAE,"Moatty, A (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier 3, IRD, Unite Mixte Rech Gouvernance Risques Environm & D, 2 Rue Pr Henri Serres, F-34000 Montpellier, France.",amoatty@yahoo.fr; freddy.vinet@univ-montp3.fr; stephanie.defossez@univ-montp3.fr; jean-philippe.cherel@univ-montp3.fr; frederic.grelot@irstea.fr,"Moatty, Annabelle/AFM-5586-2022","Moatty, Annabelle/0000-0003-0175-646X",,,,,42,3,3,1,13,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",0018-6368,1958-5551,,HOUILLE BLANCHE,Houille Blanche-Rev.

The original mission of TCUs, to improve access to higher education and to sustain the cultural heritage of indigenous people, facilitates close ties between TCU faculty and staff and the indigenous communities they serve. Since 1994, the land-grant status of TCUs allows access to limited federal funds in support of research, education, and outreach to improve food security, natural resource management, and rural quality of life, while expanding public access to higher education to underserved populations in remote rural areas. This study was designed to assess the priorities for enhancing climate adaptation on reservation lands. It summarizes the results of an assessment implemented at the 2016 Annual First Americans Land-Grant Consortium Conference. Study participants included faculty, administrators, outreach educators, support staff, and students representing 25 of the 37 TCUs in the United States. Results from this national assessment suggest that in order for TCUs to effectively meet the climate adaptation needs of indigenous communities, additional fiscal and human resource investments are necessary. Specifically, this includes fiscal support to enhance climate science teaching, research, and professional development programs. Additional goals include creating or expanding food-sovereignty programs, increasing community outreach education, investigating climate change impacts on water resource quality, access, and related ecological services, and exploring renewable and alternative energy opportunities.","[Fillmore, Helen M.] Univ Nevada, Grad Program Hydrol Sci, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Singletary, Loretta] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Cooperat Extens, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Phillips, John] First Amer Land Grant Consortium, Bishop, GA USA; [Singletary, Loretta] Univ Nevada, 1664 N Virginia St,MS 0204, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Phillips, John] 1040 Creekstone Lane, Bishop, GA 30621 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Fillmore, HM (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, 1664 N Virginia St,MS 0204, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",helen@nevada.unr.edu; singletaryl@unr.edu; jphillips@aihec.org,"Fillmore, Helen/GRO-3818-2022","Fillmore, Helen/0000-0001-9521-034X","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Water for Agriculture Challenge Area Award [2015-69007-23190]","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Water for Agriculture Challenge Area Award","This research is funded by USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Water for Agriculture Challenge Area Award Number 2015-69007-23190 Enhancing climate resiliency and agriculture on American Indian Land.

Sensitivity tests are performed for nine typical settlement types in Germany. The results for minimum and maximum temperatures are analysed and plotted in a ternary diagram. The novel approach of using ternary diagrams for the aggregation and visualisation of modelling results clearly identifies thermally unfavourable ranges of urban surface partitioning that should be avoided for urban settlements. Furthermore, the diagrams are used to derive quantitative recommendations for the most effective reduction of summer heat intensity. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The results indicate a high public satisfaction with markets and free fairs, while providing evidence on the importance of designing cities that include a network of markets and free fairs in urban planning for climate adaptation and resilience, shifting the paradigm from centralised urban systems towards an urbanism of services' proximity within walking distances.","[Iniguez-Gallardo, Veronica; Lojan Cordova, Julia; Reyes-Bueno, Fabian] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Dept Ciencias Biol & Agr, Loja 110160, Ecuador; [Ordonez-Leon, Andrea] Univ Int Ecuador, Escuela Arquitectura, Grp Invest Dinam Urbanas Ciudad Intermedia, Loja 110107, Ecuador",Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja,"Iniguez-Gallardo, V (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Dept Ciencias Biol & Agr, Loja 110160, Ecuador.",mviniguezl@utpl.edu.ec; jilojan@utpl.edu.ec; anordonezle@uide.edu.ec; frreyes@utpl.edu.ec,"Iñiguez, Verónica/ADU-9823-2022","Reyes-Bueno, Fabian/0000-0002-5646-0263; Ordonez Leon, Andrea/0000-0001-6204-2052; Iniguez-Gallardo, Veronica/0000-0002-9590-1738; Lojan Cordova, Julia Isabel/0000-0003-0832-2621",Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja funds,Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja funds,Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja funds the publication of this manuscript.,,50,0,0,2,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2022,14,12,,,,,,,7214,10.3390/su14127214,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14127214,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,2L2HE,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000816840100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The analysis highlights how neoliberal economic rationalism can appropriate public value choice under the guise of technocratic expertise. Experts are often considered responsible agents for the effective administration of public infrastructure, even when ostensibly technical decisions concerning infrastructure management seem to demand normative, political input. Technocratic administration arising from economic rationalist priorities can thereby exacerbate the hazards presented by climate variability and advancing climate change. Climate risk managers in both cases over-relied on operating protocols and the expertise of engineers to administer public infrastructure in pursuit of economic priorities. When operating protocols proved insufficient in the face of climate extremes, however, blame was assigned to experts despite their making all available attempts to avert disaster. Through analysis of these cases, the paper discusses the need for normative transparency in expert-led public administration and better integration of multi-level governance for climate resilience when pursuing economic rationalist imperatives.","[Tangney, Peter] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Humanities Arts & Social Sci, Rm 223 Social Sci South,Bedford Pk Campus, Bedford Pk, SA 5042, Australia",Flinders University South Australia,"Tangney, P (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Humanities Arts & Social Sci, Rm 223 Social Sci South,Bedford Pk Campus, Bedford Pk, SA 5042, Australia.",peter.tangney@flinders.edu.au,"Tangney, Peter/O-2153-2015","Tangney, Peter/0000-0003-3878-4034",,,,,46,2,2,1,6,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",1756-932X,1756-9338,,ENVIRON POLICY GOV,Environ.

In this paper, we seek to contribute towards bridging this gap by identifying local practices connected to climate adaptation in six large Brazilian cities, and presenting a framework, based on the existing literature, for assessing constraints to adaptation across the municipal level. Although local governments are not the only actors who can take the lead through their actions, the employed framework considers that effective adaptation planning in urban areas is highly dependent on municipal efforts. Our findings indicate that six aspects have the highest levels of impact on adaptation in the Brazilian cities studied: administrative practices, political will, level of commitment, mismatch between the scale of urban issues and the extent of local government authority, pressures from private sectors, and inspection. Although these barriers are not specific only to climate issues and can be identified in other environmental arenas, when combined, they cause and worsen constraints to advancing urban adaptation at the local level. Specifically concerning the local dynamics of urban planning, the combination of pressures from private sectors and insufficient inspection negatively affects the ability of these cities to consolidate adaptation interventions. Our results are helpful in the context of large cities, particularly in Global South, where, as in Brazil, competitive urbanism and specific interest groups confront municipal efforts, and make achieving adaptation more difficult.","[Di Giulio, Gabriela Marques] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Publ Hlth, Ave Dr Arnaldo 715, BR-01246904 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Torres, Roger Rodrigues; Nogueira, Veruska; Penna, Ana Carolina] Univ Fed Itajuba, Itajuba, Brazil; [Lapola, David M.; Braga, Diego Rafael] Univ Estadual Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Bedran-Martins, Ana Maria; Vasconcellos, Maria da Penha] Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Fuck, Marcos Paulo; Juk, Yohanna] Univ Fed Parana, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Jacauna, Tiago] Univ Fed Amazonas, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Fetz, Marcelo] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Vitoria, ES, Brazil; [Pessoa, Zoraide; Pontes, Rylanneive] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Schons, Marize; Premebida, Adriano] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Federal de Itajuba; Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Federal do Parana; Universidade Federal de Amazonas; Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Di Giulio, GM (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Publ Hlth, Ave Dr Arnaldo 715, BR-01246904 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",ggiulio@usp.br; roger.torres@unifei.edu.br; dmlapola@unicamp.br; bedran.ana@gmail.com; mpvascon@usp.br; diego1987@gmail.com; marcospaulofk@gmail.com; yohannajuk91@gmail.com; veruska@cbhsapucai.org.br; acarol.penna@gmail.com; tiagojacauna@ufam.edu.br; marcelofetz@gmail.com; zoraidesp@gmail.com; pontesrylanneive@gmail.com; marizeschons426@gmail.com; premebida@hotmail.com,"Jacaúna, Tiago/AAR-7169-2020; Torres, Roger Rodrigues/G-1043-2012; Premebida, Adriano/P-7886-2017; da Penha Vasconcellos, Maria/C-4294-2012; Di Giulio, Gabriela Marques/H-3666-2016; DA SILVA JACAUNA, TIAGO/HIR-4140-2022","Jacaúna, Tiago/0000-0001-7248-2940; Torres, Roger Rodrigues/0000-0002-5684-3125; Di Giulio, Gabriela Marques/0000-0003-1396-9788; Fuck, Marcos/0000-0001-6729-9201; Braga, Diego/0000-0002-0816-9017",Brazil's National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPq [446032/2015-8],Brazil's National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),This study is part of the CiAdapta project funded by Brazil's National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPq (Proc. 446032/2015-8).,,48,12,13,3,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Having experienced multiple floods, all six communities performed relatively well in the infrastructure stability, but poorly in outdoor environment adaptability. In face-to-face interviews, interviewees reflected that the most vital sector affected by climate change is their fishing industry; however, the industry item was eliminated by experts during the implementation of the Fuzzy Delphi questionnaire.

In the 28 European countries overall there are around 374,000 premature deaths annually attributable to the chronic and acute health effects of PM2.5, 68,000 to NO2 and 14,000 to O-3. Traffic is responsible for 60-70% of human exposure to NO2 and 25-35% to PM2.5 in urban environments, so it is obvious that to improve air quality and lessen the health impact the number of circulating urban vehicles needs to be reduced. The characterisation of mobility in cities is fundamental for this, allowing us to bring together information on demography, location of services, spatial economy, geography, aspects of physics, mathematics, engineering and, in general, data science. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed not only how healthier a city can be with less traffic contamination, but has also underlined the great value of data generated by personal electronic devices for the public management of an emergency and for future urban planning. Air quality improvement plans in cities not only seek to reduce annual premature deaths, but also to improve the quality of life with healthier and more pleasant cities to live in. It is important to achieve greater collaboration between cities, administrations and citizens, as well as to integrate the needs and challenges of air quality with those of mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Integrated approaches will constitute the roadmap that will lead to a better quality of life in cities.","[Querol, Xavier; Viana, Mar; Moreno, Teresa] CSIC, Inst Diagnost Ambiental & Estudios Agua, IDAEA, C Jordi Girona 18-24, ES-08034 Barcelona, Spain; [Ramasco, Jose Javier] CSIC UIB, IFISC, Inst Fis Interdisciplinar & Sistemas Complejos, Campus UIB, Palma De Mallorca, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro de Investigacion y Desarrollo Pascual Vila (CID-CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Diagnostico Ambiental y Estudios del Agua (IDAEA); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universitat de les Illes Balears; CSIC-UIB - Instituto de Fisica Interdisciplinar y Sistemas Complejos (IFISC); University of Barcelona,"Moreno, T (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Diagnost Ambiental & Estudios Agua, IDAEA, C Jordi Girona 18-24, ES-08034 Barcelona, Spain.",teresa.moreno@idaea.csic.es,"Querol, Xavier/E-2800-2014","Querol, Xavier/0000-0002-6549-9899",,,,,11,0,0,1,5,GRUPO ESPANOL CARBON,ZARAGOZA,"INST CARBOQUIMICA, MIGUEL LESMA CASTAN 4, ZARAGOZA, 50018, SPAIN",2172-6094,,,BOL GRUPO ESP CARBON,Bol.

This paper examines the diffusion of salt tolerant rice varieties in the MRD that were promoted through Consortium for Unfavorable Rice Environments (CURE) activities. Factors associated with adoption of CURE-related varieties are estimated using a random utilty model and a dataset of 800 farm households with rice fields in salinity prone areas of the MRD. Results suggest that there has been widespread adoption of CURE-related varieties in salinity-prone areas. Further, multivariate analysis reveals that environment and location characteristics, rather than household characteristics, are the most important determinants of adoption. In particular, CURE-related varieties are more likely to be adopted in high-salinity-risk areas that are not protected by salinity barrier gates. Neighbhors' adoption decisions also strongly influence household decisions to adopt CURE-related varieties. The contracting of mechanization, particularly for land preparation and harvest, requires the coordination of village households in timing of planting, harvest and varietal duration. This coordination appears to extend to choice of CURE-related varieties. Finally, CURE-related varieties and other varieties generate similar net revenues in a year with low salinity exposure, suggesting that CURE-related varieties are a low-cost insurance policy against salinity inundation in high risk areas. Combined, these results highlight the need to address complex factors beyond current economic profits, like environment, community choices, and risk mitigation, when designing technologies and policies that support farmer adaptation to climatic change.","[Paik, SongYi] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Dung Thi Phuong Le; Lien Thi Nhu] Int Ctr Trop Agr, Reg Off Asia, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Mills, Bradford Franklin] Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Mills, BF (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",bfmills@vt.edu,,"Le, Dung Phuong/0000-0002-2147-3697",BM -1 International Fund for Agricultural Development,BM -1 International Fund for Agricultural Development,"BM -1 International Fund for Agricultural Development https://www.ifad.org/en/The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript",,72,17,17,1,11,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,MAR 16,2020,15,3,,,,,,,e0229464,10.1371/journal.pone.0229464,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229464,,,23,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,LQ9BL,32176705,"Green Accepted, Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000535291800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, the CO2 emissions and CO2 intensities in China during 2030 were forecast using three scenarios, seven indicators, and a back-propagation neural network. Under the business as usual (BAU), strategic planning (SP), and low carbon (LC) scenarios, the predicted CO2 emissions in China during 2030 are 13,908.00, 11,837.60, and 9102.50 million tonnes, respectively, and the predicted CO2 intensities are 1.8652, 1.7405, and 1.5382 when considering carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). Furthermore, China cannot fulfill its commitment under the BAU scenario, whereas China will fulfill its commitment on schedule under the SP scenario. Under the LC scenario, China will fulfill its commitment ahead of schedule to reduce the CO2 intensity by 60% in 2025, and it will even reduce the CO2 intensity by 65% in 2030. In addition, if the amounts of CCUS are not considered for measuring the CO2 intensity, China can still fulfill its commitment under the LC scenario, whereas it cannot fulfill its commitment by 2030 under the SP scenario. This study evaluated the fulfillment of China's commitment in the Paris Agreement, demonstrated that CCUS plays an important role in reducing the CO2 intensity, and provided policy suggestions for the Chinese government regarding the reductions of the CO2 intensity.","[Guo, Daoyan; Chen, Hong; Long, Ruyin] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, 1 Daxue Rd, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",China University of Mining & Technology,"Chen, H; Long, RY (corresponding author), China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, 1 Daxue Rd, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",guodaoyan@163.com; hongchenxz@163.com; longruyin@163.com,"Guo, Daoyan/B-1949-2016","Gong, Likun/0000-0001-8821-641X; Chen, Hong/0000-0002-2035-6851",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017XKZD12],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2017XKZD12).,,54,29,29,1,53,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

Specifically, the perception that climate change is low risk has been identified as a barrier to participation in climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. Therefore, understanding public attitudes towards climate change risk is an important element of reducing emissions. We applied k-means cluster analysis to explore attitudes to climate change risk in the UK population using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, a national survey running from 2009 to present. We identified three distinct attitude clusters: Sceptical, Concerned, and Paradoxical in both waves 4 (from 2012 to 2014) and 10 (from 2018 to 2020) of this survey. The Sceptical cluster tended to deny the seriousness of climate change and the urgency or even the necessity of dealing with it. The Concerned cluster displayed anxiety about climate change risks and supported action to reduce them. The Paradoxical cluster acknowledged the reality of climate change impacts but did not support actions to mitigate them. We further observed statistical associations between cluster membership and the social characteristics of the participants, including sex, age, income, education, and political affiliation.

To shoulder the challenge of climate change adaptation, informal settlement upgrading in the global south has amounted to the importance of being attuned with the growth of its city and region at large. Changing the paradigm of on-site upgrading to being community-driven and city-led with domestic funding unlocks potentials for community resilience building, especially in countries that strive for inclusive growth. This research looks into informal settlement development dynamics and its resilience stance in conjunction of the metropolitan growth in three Southeast Asian countries. Greater Manila Area, Bangkok Metropolitan Region and Hanoi Capital Region serve as the backdrop for this investigation. The research mainly addresses informal settlement upgrading roles, mechanism and approaches for resilience building in these three metropolises, meanwhile also unveiling their city-regional development needs. The methodological approach of this study is highly participatory, demonstrating a hybrid of multi-spectrum stakeholder workshops, online surveys (due to COVID), expert interviews, project interim reports and correspondence with the local expert team in the three countries, etc. The paper attempts at providing a cross-country appraisal of the central strategies of informal settlement upgrading, related institutional constellations and upgrading applications along with the three metropolises' urban development. This attempt accentuates the pressing needs of mitigating multi-facet vulnerability of informal communities, who are the most adversely affected by climate change and rampant urbanization. Further, this research will also reveal the mindset change of how decision-makers and the public contemplate upgrading objectives, e.g., recasting secure tenure instruments.","[Du, Juan; Greiving, Stefan] TU Dortmund Univ, Dept Spatial Planning, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany; [Yap, David Leonides T.] Univ Philippines, Sch Urban & Reg Planning, Quezon City 1101, Philippines",Dortmund University of Technology; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman,"Du, J; Greiving, S (corresponding author), TU Dortmund Univ, Dept Spatial Planning, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany.",juan.du@tu-dortmund.de; stefan.greiving@tu-dortmund.de; dtyap@up.edu.ph,,"Greiving, Stefan/0000-0002-6245-752X","German Federal Ministry of Education, and Research (BMBF) [01LE1906A]","German Federal Ministry of Education, and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education, and Research (BMBF) under the project Linking Disaster Risk Governance and Land use Planning: The Case of Informal Settlements in Hazard prone Areas in the Philippines (LIRLAP) with grant number 01LE1906A.

The spatial dimension of this multifunctionality remains to be formalised to increase effectiveness of nature-based solutions. Objectives We aimed to systematically analyse effects of fragmentation on multifunctionality and their interactions with land-use intensity responses. Methods We generated virtual landscapes to model interactions among six ecosystem services (ES) of different spatial sensitivities. We simulated land-use patterns on topographies from plains to mountains. Four land-use intensity treatments departed from hypothesised optimal composition for biodiversity and ES with > 30% intensive, < 30% extensive or protected and > 40% intermediate intensity use. For each composition we generated landscapes with differing fragmentation. Results Pixel- and landscape-level multifunctionality emerge from sensitivities of the six ES to landscape composition, fragmentation and their interactions. In heterogeneous landscapes of intermediate land-use intensity extensive grasslands and spatial complementarity supported multiple ES provision. Increasing land use intensity decreased multifunctionality by reducing all ES. However, greater fragmentation mitigated some of these effects because its benefits to nitrogen retention and pollination exceeded losses for recreation, especially in finer-grained landscapes. The five regulating ES were synergistic and showed trade-offs with recreation. Although interactions were most sensitive to intensity given its dominant effects on individual ES, fragmentation mediated interaction strength. Conclusions Virtual simulations allow a systematic understanding of how interactions between land-use intensity and fragmentation modulate multifunctionality. This constitutes an essential step to designing templates for climate smart-landscapes tailored to regional geographies, land-use allocation and ES priorities.","[Lavorel, Sandra; Richards, Daniel R.; Etherington, Thomas R.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand; [Lavorel, Sandra; Grigulis, Karl] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, CNRS, Lab Ecol Alpine, Grenoble, France; [Law, Richard M.; Herzig, Alexander] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Palmerston North, New Zealand",Landcare Research - New Zealand; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; Landcare Research - New Zealand,"Lavorel, S (corresponding author), Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand.",sandra.lavorel@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr,"Herzig, Alexander/AAE-9152-2022","Herzig, Alexander/0000-0001-6417-0752; Law, Richard/0000-0002-7400-2530","Strategic Science Investment Funding for Crown Research Institutes from the New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's Science and Innovation Group","Strategic Science Investment Funding for Crown Research Institutes from the New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's Science and Innovation Group(New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE))","This work was supported by the Strategic Science Investment Funding for Crown Research Institutes from the New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's Science and Innovation Group.

The aim of this paper was to rank saltwater intrusion adaptation options for farmers in two provinces in the central coastal region of Vietnam using the analytical hierarchy process method. Data for the analysis were obtained through a literature review, field observations, and face-to-face interviews and focus group discussions with key informants. We combined two ways of weighting to arrive at final scores for each of the identified adaptation options: prioritizing criteria and subcriteria by pairwise comparison and rating the different alternatives with respect to the lowest level subcriteria. In doing so, we also investigated differences in the priority sets and final rankings of the analytical hierarchy process applications in both provinces. In our study, we worked with group consensus scores on both the criteria weights and the ratings for the different adaptation options for each of the criteria. Our results revealed that sustainability and equity was the most important criteria, while coherence ranked lowest. The final ranking of adaptation options differed between both provinces due to differences in the geographical and socioeconomic characteristics of the study areas. The consistency ratios for all pairwise matrices were less than 0.1, indicating that judgments from the focus group discussions with respect to the different criteria were highly consistent. A sensitivity analysis of our results confirmed the robustness of the rankings in our research.","[Nguyen, Thi Dieu Linh] Hue Univ, Fac Business & Adm, Univ Econ, Ho Dac Di 99, Hue 52000, Vietnam; [Nguyen, Thi Dieu Linh; Bleys, Brent] Univ Ghent, Dept Econ, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Hue University; Ghent University,"Nguyen, TDL (corresponding author), Hue Univ, Fac Business & Adm, Univ Econ, Ho Dac Di 99, Hue 52000, Vietnam.;Nguyen, TDL (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Econ, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",ntdlinh.hce@hueuni.edu.vn; Brent.Bleys@Ugent.be,,"Bleys, Brent/0000-0003-4010-4149; NGUYEN, THI DIEU LINH/0000-0003-3067-3380",BOF PhD Scholarship of Ghent University [80200244130530326415],BOF PhD Scholarship of Ghent University,This research was funded by BOF PhD Scholarship of Ghent University (80200244130530326415).,,50,6,6,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2021,13,4,,,,,,,2311,10.3390/su13042311,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13042311,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QQ8VS,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000624797700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The development aid literature has not put much emphasis on understanding NGDOs' aid-related advocacy strategies, and the literature on interest groups has so far neglected to explain why groups select different advocacy strategies within the same policy area. PurposeThe article explains how NGDOs have selected advocacy strategies during the process of reformulating the European Consensus in 2016/17, in response to attempts by the European Union (EU) to divert aid from poverty reduction to three other goals: managing migration, funding climate change adaptation (CCA), and funding the private sector. Approach and methodsThe article develops a framework explaining NGDOs' strategy selection, looking at the politicization of the policy change, its impact on NGDOs' funding, and its relation to the groups' normative positions. The article uses qualitative data from NGDO documents and interviews with senior staff of NGDO networks based in Brussels. FindingsNGDOs used different strategies for the three cases of aid diversion: they contested aid diversion for managing migration; mainly choose fence-sitting in case of CCA; and gradually became more adaptive towards diverting aid to fund the private sector. The three variables of politicization, impact on funding, and relation to normative positions explain the strategies selected by NGDOs in all three cases. Policy implicationsThe findings can help NGDOs in selecting the most appropriate advocacy strategies for changes in aid policy, allowing them to become more effective in influencing the EU institutions and member state governments.","[Rozbicka, Patrycja; Szent-Ivanyi, Balazs] Aston Univ, Aston Ctr Europe, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Szent-Ivanyi, Balazs] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Inst World Econ, Budapest, Hungary",Aston University; Corvinus University Budapest; Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Centre for Economic & Regional Studies,"Szent-Ivanyi, B (corresponding author), Aston Univ, Aston Ctr Europe, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.;Szent-Ivanyi, B (corresponding author), Corvinus Univ Budapest, Inst World Econ, Budapest, Hungary.",b.szent-ivanyi@aston.ac.uk,"Rozbicka, Patrycja/ABA-7200-2021","Rozbicka, Patrycja/0000-0003-0092-955X; Szent-Ivanyi, Balazs/0000-0002-5883-4601",,,,,71,7,7,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-6764,1467-7679,,DEV POLICY REV,Dev.

First, we construct a taxonomy of six inter-related forms of invisibility (social marginalization, forced invisibility by migrants, spatial marginalization, neglected diseases, mental health, uneven climatic monitoring and forecasting) which underlie systematic biases in current understanding of these risks in Latin America, and advocate an approach to climate-health research that draws on intersectionality theory to address these inter-relations. We propose that these invisibilities should be understood as outcomes of structural imbalances in power and resources rather than as haphazard blindspots in scientific and state knowledge. Our thesis, drawing on theories of governmentality, is that context-dependent tensions condition whether or not benefits of making vulnerable populations legible to the state outweigh costs. To be seen is to be politically counted and eligible for rights, yet evidence demonstrates the perils of visibility to disempowered people. For example, flood-relief efforts in remote Amazonia expose marginalized urban river-dwellers to the traumatic prospect of forced relocation and social and economic upheaval. Finally, drawing on research on citizenship in post-colonial settings, we conceptualize climate change as an 'open moment' of political rupture, and propose strategies of social accountability, empowerment and trans-disciplinary research which encourage the marginalized to reach out for greater power. These achievements could reduce drawbacks of state legibility and facilitate socially-just governmental action on climate change adaptation that promotes health for all.","[Parry, Luke; Clark, Nigel] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Parry, Luke] Fed Univ Para, Nucleus Adv Amazonian Studies NAEA, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Radel, Claudia] Utah State Univ, Dept Environm & Soc, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Adamo, Susana B.] Columbia Univ, CIESIN, Palisades, NY USA; [Counterman, Miriam] Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Sociol, Boulder, CO USA; [Flores-Yeffal, Nadia] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Sociol Anthropol & Social Work, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Pons, Diego] Univ Denver, Dept Geog & Environm, Denver, CO 80208 USA; [Romero-Lankao, Paty] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Vargo, Jason] Univ Wisconsin, Global Hlth Inst, Madison, WI USA; [Vargo, Jason] Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Madison, WI USA",Lancaster University; Universidade Federal do Para; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Columbia University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; University of Denver; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Parry, L (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.",luke.parry@lancaster.ac,"Parry, Luke/ABD-4194-2021","Parry, Luke/0000-0003-0330-9516; Adamo, Susana Beatriz/0000-0002-9168-7172; Flores-Yeffal, Nadia Y./0000-0001-8159-5488; Clark, Nigel/0000-0002-6666-1739",ESRC Future Research Leaders Fellowship [ES/K010018/1]; Newton Fund/FAPEAM [ES/M011542/1]; Brazil's CNPq [CsF PVE 313742/2013-8]; European Commission Horizon 2020 RISE programme [691053 - ODYSSEA]; U.S. National Science Foundation [BCS-1056811]; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [5R13HD078101]; ESRC [ES/K010018/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC Future Research Leaders Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Newton Fund/FAPEAM; Brazil's CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); European Commission Horizon 2020 RISE programme; U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Parry was funded by an ESRC Future Research Leaders Fellowship (ES/K010018/1), the Newton Fund/FAPEAM (ES/M011542/1), Brazil's CNPq (CsF PVE 313742/2013-8) and the European Commission Horizon 2020 RISE programme (Project 691053 - ODYSSEA).

This constrains humanity's ability to protect our planet's climate and life-sustaining functions. The substantial body of research we review reveals that forest, water and energy interactions provide the foundations for carbon storage, for cooling terrestrial surfaces and for distributing water resources. Forests and trees must be recognized as prime regulators within the water, energy and carbon cycles. If these functions are ignored, planners will be unable to assess, adapt to or mitigate the impacts of changing land cover and climate. Our call to action targets a reversal of paradigms, from a carbon-centric model to one that treats the hydrologic and climate-cooling effects of trees and forests as the first order of priority. For reasons of sustainability, carbon storage must remain a secondary, though valuable, by-product. The effects of tree cover on climate at local, regional and continental scales offer benefits that demand wider recognition. The forest- and tree-centered research insights we review and analyze provide a knowledge-base for improving plans, policies and actions. Our understanding of how trees and forests influence water, energy and carbon cycles has important implications, both for the structure of planning, management and governance institutions, as well as for how trees and forests might be used to improve sustainability, adaptation and mitigation efforts.

By grading land quality, the resulting information is particularly relevant for planners and managers, and for land valuation. Higher-grade land is more flexible and has more options for land Use. Using Scotland as a case study, a widely-Used land capability system was adapted to investigate the influence of recent and future climate change on land-use potential. The adapted method was applied to both interpolated gridded weather station data and to future climate change scenarios derived from the HadRM3 climate model. At a national scale, differing regional patterns of land capability were recognised, with changes in these patterns occurring in recent decades and projected to occur on a more substantial scale into the future. In general, climate change is acting to enhance land-use potential in Scotland, mainly in the drier east, while the west remains constrained by its wetter climate. These results demonstrate the key control directed by soil moisture values on land-use options, in addition to temperature change. Shifts in land-use potential have implications for both strategic resource planning and for developing anticipatory climate change adaptation actions. The land capability assessment highlights not. only potential changes in agriculture and other productive land uses, but also repercussions for biodiversity and terrestrial carbon stocks. Various amendments are suggested to the land capability procedures to reflect existing or emerging climate-related issues that were not considered necessary in the original system, notably excessive soil moisture deficits.","[Brown, Iain; Towers, Willie; Rivington, Mike; Black, Helaina I.

The study focused on environmental factors that significantly affect the ripeness of the Gewurztraminer grape variety cultivated near Tramin, a village in northern Italy. In particular, the reliability of the new Solar Radiation Identity (SRI) topoclimate classification method was tested, along with its predictive capability in terms of the biosynthetic activity of the vine and the quality of its grapes. The SRI index characterises each vineyard in a precise and comparable way and helps to understand the way in which the topoclimate acts as an important abiotic stress factor for vines. A direct relationship between grape must sugar content and the SRI topoclimate index was observed. Our findings indicate an increase in sugar content of approximately 0.8 degrees KMW for every 10 points of the SRI index. Thus, a novel prediction model of grape ripening based on an SRI curve analysis is proposed. The correct application of the SRI index could be useful for discriminating and predicting geographical charactersitics of a given area strongly connected to ecological diversity and wine quality. It could support decision making in viticulture in terms of, for example, correctly matching vineyard and grape varieties, reducing wine vulnerability and production risk and predicting optimal ripeness and harvesting days. The use of the SRI prediction curve could help in adopting a more sustainable approach to agriculture and in finding new methods for adapting to climate change, such as by improving the match between the cultivars' phenological status, vineyard location and growing season average temperature.","[Ferretti, Carlo G.] GIR Geo Ident Res, Bolzano, Italy",,"Ferretti, CG (corresponding author), GIR Geo Ident Res, Bolzano, Italy.",carlo.ferretti@geoproject.it,,,,,,,62,3,3,2,8,INT VITICULTURE & ENOLOGY SOC-IVES,VILLENAVE D ORNON,"INST SCI VIGNE VIN-ISVV, 210 CHEMIN DE LEYSOTTE, VILLENAVE D ORNON, FRANCE",,2494-1271,,OENO ONE,OENE One,,2021,55,1,,,,,313,335,,10.20870/oeno-one.2021.55.1.4531,http://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2021.55.1.4531,,,23,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Food Science & Technology,RJ8GI,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000637838400016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Concerns about potential impacts and uncertainties of climate change on Eucalyptus plantations productivity are arising and studies about that are still scarce. This study assesses the effects of climate change on Eucalyptus plantations productivity across a geographic gradient in Brazil by mid- and end-century and quantifies the uncertainty of climate and productivity projections. Ten global circulation models (GCM) under intermediate (RCP4.5) and high (RCP8.5) greenhouse gas emission scenarios, for the 2040-2069 and 2070-2099 periods were used for future climate projections. The APSIM Next Generation Eucalyptus model was used to simulate the Eucalyptus mean annual increment (MAI, m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1)) at seven years for eight locations in Brazil. The response of Eucalyptus productivity is expected to be site-specific and will mostly depend on the balance between the possible negative effects of increasing temperatures and the potential productivity increments caused by higher CO2 concentration. Plantations located in South and Southeast Brazil are expected to experience increases in MAI, while those located in Center-North Brazil will experience more pronounced MAI reductions. Uncertainties in projections are higher under RCP8.5 and for the end-of-century, especially for annual rainfall and MAI. Future climate projections from GCMs coupled with a Eucalyptus simulation model provide valuable information to facilitate the exploration of potential strategies and guidance of policy decision-making for forestry adaptation to climate change on a regional or national scale. However, forest companies and foresters should be cautious when using projected information for local-scale adaptation options, as the uncertainties in climate (especially in rainfall) and productivity projections are substantially large.","[Elli, Elvis Felipe; Sentelhas, Paulo Cesar] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Biosyst Engn, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr ESALQ, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Bender, Fabiani Denise] Natl Ctr Monitoring & Early Warning Nat Disasters, Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Elli, EF; Sentelhas, PC (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Biosyst Engn, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr ESALQ, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil.",elvisfelipeelli@usp.br; pcsentel.esalq@usp.br,"Elli, Elvis Felipe/AAD-1224-2019; Bender, Fabiani Denise/D-7684-2019","Elli, Elvis Felipe/0000-0001-9247-4956; Bender, Fabiani Denise/0000-0003-3634-5265",Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP [2016/26014-6]; Brazilian Research Council - CNPq [155784/2016-1]; CNPq,Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Brazilian Research Council - CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),The first author would like to thank the Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP (Process No 2016/26014-6) and Brazilian Research Council - CNPq (Process No 155784/2016-1) for the support of this study by the PhD scholarships.

In this paper, vegetation changes during growth season from April to October were investigated through examining the trends in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) across the Hexi region. Based on the GMMIS NDVI 3g.v1 dataset, NDVI trend and its dependency on elevation and land cover were analyzed for the period 1982-2015 according to multiple statistical tests. Results showed that NDVI exhibited a significantly increasing trend in similar to 70% of the vegetated area, in contrast with a negative trend only in 2.85%. The resulting distinct groups with respect to decreasing, increasing and no trends presented significant differences in elevation and land cover composition, and the correlation between elevation, land cover and NDVI trend magnitude was subjected to precipitation and temperature change. The elevation and grassland cover were found to mainly account for variations in NDVI trend, and increase in elevation and various types of land cover excluding impervious and bare land would facilitate the trend magnitude. The dependency of NDVI trend on elevation and land cover was very vulnerable to increasing air temperature, which triggered an improvement in the vegetable activity to adapt to climate change, especially grass and forest. The contribution of crop and shrub to NDVI change was sensitive to precipitation trend change, but the crop was primarily influenced by human activities. The identified patterns of vegetation change would help to gain insights into the adapting mechanism of the fragile ecosystems in arid areas to changing environmental conditions.","[Han, Jing-Cheng; Huang, Yuefei; Wu, Xiaofeng] Tsinghua Univ, Water Res Ctr, Grad Sch Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Huang, Yuefei] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Huang, Yuefei] Qinghai Univ, State Key Lab Plateau Ecol & Agr, Xining 810016, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hua] Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Sch Engn & Comp Sci, Coll Sci & Engn, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA",Tsinghua University; University Town of Shenzhen; Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School; Tsinghua University; Qinghai University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University Corpus Christi,"Huang, YF (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",han.jingcheng@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn; yuefeihuang@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Han, Jing-Cheng/E-8433-2010; Zhang, Hua/J-4639-2013","Han, Jing-Cheng/0000-0002-4421-9683; Zhang, Hua/0000-0002-6470-933X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51809007, 91647212]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M571048]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51809007 & 91647212) and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2015M571048).

Higher temperatures may result in reduced yields while encouraging weed, pest, and disease infestation. The impacts of climate change on agriculture are projected to be negative, threatening global food security; therefore, this is an important area of empirical research. This study sought to identify the factors affecting the adoption and intensity of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) adoption among smallholder maize farmers in the uMshwathi and uKhahlamba Municipal areas of KwaZulu Natal. The study used the primary data collected from 99 respondents who were selected through simple random sampling. The descriptive results indicated that farmers had experienced severe climatic conditions such as drought, pests, diseases, hailstorms, heavy rains (floods), soil infertility, and frost in their farming system. The first hurdle of the probit model results showed that drought, on-farm income, and household size significantly influenced the adoption of CSA practices. In contrast, the main source of income and educational level had a significant negative influence. The results from the second hurdle showed that drought had a significant positive impact on the intensity of CSA adoption, while marital status had a significant negative effect. Several factors influence the adoption of an intensification of CSA practices. The study recommends that policymakers and climate change champions consider smallholder farmers' socioeconomic factors when developing climate change adaptation programs. Local climate change organizations must scale up climate change awareness and adaptation programs collaboratively. Investments in public climate and adaptation education or training are needed, as well as localized meteorological observations and early warning systems. Mass media dissemination of climate change and adaptation information in locally understood languages is urgently required.","[Mthethwa, Khethiwe Naledi; Ngidi, Mjabuliseni Simon Cloapas] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Coll Agr Engn & Sci, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Agr Extens & Rural Resource Management, Private Bag X01, ZA-3201 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Mthethwa, Khethiwe Naledi; Ngidi, Mjabuliseni Simon Cloapas; Hlatshwayo, Simphiwe Innocentia] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Coll Agr Engn & Sci, Ctr Transformat Agr & Food Syst, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3201 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Ojo, Temitope Oluwaseun] Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Ife 220101, Nigeria; [Ojo, Temitope Oluwaseun] Univ Free State, Disaster Management Training & Educ Ctr Africa, ZA-9301 Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Hlatshwayo, Simphiwe Innocentia] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Coll Agr Engn & Sci, African Ctr Food Secur, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, ZA-3201 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal; University of Kwazulu Natal; Obafemi Awolowo University; University of the Free State; University of Kwazulu Natal,"Mthethwa, KN; Ngidi, MSC (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Coll Agr Engn & Sci, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Agr Extens & Rural Resource Management, Private Bag X01, ZA-3201 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.;Mthethwa, KN; Ngidi, MSC (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Coll Agr Engn & Sci, Ctr Transformat Agr & Food Syst, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3201 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",mthethwak1@ukzn.ac.za; naledi340@gmail.com,"Ojo, Temitope Oluwaseun/HOH-6850-2023",,"Sustainable and Healthy Food Systems (SHEFS) programme - Wellcome Trust's Our Planet, Our Health programme [205200/Z/16/Z]","Sustainable and Healthy Food Systems (SHEFS) programme - Wellcome Trust's Our Planet, Our Health programme","This research was funded in whole, or in part, by the Sustainable and Healthy Food Systems (SHEFS) programme supported by the Wellcome Trust's Our Planet, Our Health programme [grant number: 205200/Z/16/Z], and SIM, ATM and TM are supported by this grant.

Hence, they require specific climate change adaptation and policy responses, informed by delta-scale analysis. However, available climate knowledge on deltas is based mainly on broad-scale analysis that masks information unique to deltas. This applies to the Volta Delta system of Ghana. This study presents annual and intra-annual climate variability and trend analysis carried out across the Volta Delta, using the coefficient of variation (CV), anomaly, Mann-Kendall and Pettit statistics. There were time and space differences in climate change and variability. Statistically significant (P<0.05) positive trends were observed for the major wet season and the mean annual rainfall for Ada and highly significant (P<0.01) positive trends for Akatsi. These contrasted with the observations in Adidome, which experienced a statistically highly significant (P<0.01) decreasing trend in rainfall. There were significant (P<0.05) increases in annual minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures over time in both coastal and inland delta stations. The annual rate of change of mean temperature ranged from 0.03 to 0.05. Ada, the more coastal location, has experienced a narrow range of temperature change, most probably due to the buffering capacity of the ocean. Point changes were observed in the climate data series in four (4) localities.

One of the main sources of uncertainty arises from the interpretation of climate model projections. Probabilistic procedures based on multimodel ensembles have been suggested in the literature to quantify this source of uncertainty. However, the interpretation of multimodel ensembles remains challenging. Several assumptions are often required in the uncertainty quantification of climate model projections. For example, most methods often assume that the climate models are independent and/or that changes in climate model biases are negligible. This study develops a Bayesian framework that accounts for model dependencies and changes in model biases and compares it to estimates calculated based on a frequentist approach. The Bayesian framework is used to investigate the effects of the two assumptions on the uncertainty quantification of extreme precipitation projections over Denmark. An ensemble of regional climate models from the Ensemble-Based Predictions of Climate Changes and their Impacts (ENSEMBLES) project is used for this purpose. The results confirm that the climate models cannot be considered independent and show that the bias depends on the value of precipitation. This has an influence on the results of the uncertainty quantification. Both the mean and spread of the change in extreme precipitation depends on both assumptions. If the models are assumed independent and the bias constant, the results will be overconfident and may be treated as more precise than they really are. This study highlights the importance of investigating the underlying assumptions in climate change impact studies, as these may have serious consequences for the design of climate change adaptation strategies.","[Sunyer, Maria Antonia; Rosbjerg, Dan; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Madsen, Henrik] DHI, Horsholm, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark; Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI),"Sunyer, MA (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, Bldg 113, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",masu@env.dtu.dk,"Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten/J-7792-2012","Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten/0000-0002-6221-9505; Rosbjerg, Dan/0000-0003-2204-8649",Danish Council for Strategic Research as part of the project RiskChange [10-093894]; EU FP6 Integrated Project ENSEMBLES [05539],Danish Council for Strategic Research as part of the project RiskChange; EU FP6 Integrated Project ENSEMBLES(European Commission),"This work was carried out with the support of the Danish Council for Strategic Research as part of the project RiskChange, Contract 10-093894 (http://riskchange.dhigroup.com).

Together with channelization, this has exacerbated flood peaks. Anthropogenic climate change is anticipated to bring more frequent flooding and reduced water quality. In assessing ongoing floodplain restoration work that commenced in 1993, this paper finds the following. (a) Along the lower Danube River, restoration of floodplains by decommissioning under-performing flood protection infrastructure has provided many benefits. The benefits of these adaptation measures include improved natural capacity to retain and release floodwaters and remove pollutants, enhanced biodiversity, and strengthened local economies through diversification of livelihoods based on natural resources. (b) The drivers for more successful adaptation measures in the Danube included EU expansion, legal mechanisms, and local desire to improve livelihoods. The support of non-governmental organizations (WWF and partner organizations) for basin- and regional-level planning for more effective water resource management has also been a powerful driver of policy change in the lower Danube countries.","[Ebert, Suzanne; Strobel, David] WWF Danube Carpathian Programme Off, A-1070 Vienna, Austria; [Hulea, Orieta] WWF Danube Carpathian Programme Romania, RO-010818 Bucharest, Romania",,"Ebert, S (corresponding author), WWF Danube Carpathian Programme Off, Mariahilferstr 88A-3-9, A-1070 Vienna, Austria.",sebert@wwfdcp.org,,,,,,,21,31,31,4,30,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

In the Netherlands, climate change is in above highly controversial. These characteristics make it difficult to realize adaptation measures that are perceived as legitimate. In this article, we analyze the main difficulties and dilemmas with regard to the issue of legitimacy in the context of climate adaptation. We conceptualize legitimacy from a legal, a planning, and a network perspective and show how the concept of legitimacy evolves within these three perspectives. From a legal perspective, the focus is on the issues of good governance. From a planning perspective, the focus is on the flexibility, learning, and governance capacity. From a network perspective, issues of dialogue, involvement, and support are important. These perspectives bring in different criteria, which are not easy compatible. We describe and illustrate these legitimacy challenges using an in-depth study of the Dutch IJsseldelta Zuid case. From our case study, we conclude that, from a legitimacy perspective, the often acclaimed necessity to be adaptive and flexible is quite problematic. The same holds true for the plea to mainstream adaptation into other policy domains.

We use an intersectionality framework to examine how the adaptive strategies of Tanzanian farmers are mediated through their gender and marital statuses. Drawing on focus group discussions and using logistic regression to analyze questionnaire data, we compare the relative adoption of the different adaptive strategies of single, married, divorced, and widowed men and women. Our study shows that, while a woman's marital status is a vital factor in determining her access to adaptive strategies, it is a less important factor in the case of men. We show that, compared with other women, widows and female divorcees are disadvantaged in the field of agricultural water management, and divorced women assume relatively more income-earning activities outside the farming sector. Finally, we find evidence of livelihood diversification at the household level through specialization by individual household members. Based on the empirical evidence, we develop a typology with which to synthesize the linkages between gender, marital status, and adaptive strategies; and we subsequently emphasize the importance of an intersectionality approach to gender and climate change policy and practice.

The extent to which residents are able to reduce their impact on food resources and adapt to climate change will have implications for their livelihoods. Although climate change research has explored adaptation strategies to mitigate the negative effects on food security, empirical work on how climate change affects rural household food security in South Africa has been limited. This paper examines not only how climate change affects food security, but also residential challenges in combating climate change and food security. This paper focused on the Somkhele rural community located in the uMkhanyakude District Municipality of Northern KwaZulu-Natal, an area affected by water scarcity induced by climate change. A questionnaire was used to ascertain the views of 424 households on the impacts of climate variability on food security and the coping mechanisms and challenges involved in secure livelihoods. The results indicate that climate change has affected agricultural productivity and the use of water in households, especially since 2015. Food security is shaped by unemployment and a lack of financial capital. The local government did not assist with the required infrastructure to obtain water.

Here, we analyze the relationship between the occurrence of a winter lowpressure weather regime - Cyprus Lows - and the seasonal Influenza in the Eastern Mediterranean. We find that the weekly occurrence of Cyprus Lows is significantly correlated with clinical seasonal Influenza in Israel in recent years (R = 0.91; p<.05). This result remains robust when considering a complementary analysis based on Google Trends data for Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan. The weekly occurrence of Cyprus Lows precedes the onset and maximum of Influenza occurrence by about one to two weeks (R = 0.88; p<.05 for the maximum occurrence), and closely follows their timing in eight out of ten years (2008-2017). Since weather regimes such as Cyprus Lows are more robustly predicted in weather and climate models than individual climate variables, we conclude that the weather regime approach can be used to develop tools for estimating the compatibility of the transmission environment for Influenza occurrence in a warming world. Furthermore, this approach may be applied to other regions and climate sensitive diseases.

Thus, it is necessary to construct scenarios that can be used for governments in response to the SSPs to reflect national and sub-national unique situations. This study presents national SSP scenarios, specifically focusing on Japan (hereafter, Japan SSPs), as well as a process for developing scenarios that qualitatively links to global SSPs.

Future warming in the Arctic could accelerate important feedbacks in permafrost degradation processes. Therefore it is important to map vulnerable areas most likely to be impacted by temperature changes and at higher risk of degradation, particularly near communities, to assist adaptation to climate change. Currently, these areas are poorly assessed, especially in Greenland. Here we quantify trends in satellite-derived land surface temperatures and modelled air temperatures, validated against observations, across the entire ice-free Greenland. Focus is on the past 30 years, to characterize significant changes and potentially vulnerable regions at a 1 km resolution. We show that recent temperature trends in Greenland vary significantly between seasons and regions and that data with resolutions down to single km(2) are critical to map temperature changes for guidance of further local studies and decision-making. Only a fraction of the ice-free Greenland seems vulnerable due to warming when analyzing year 2001-2015, but the most pronounced changes are found in the most populated parts of Greenland.

Solomon Islands has one of the highest rates of sea-level rise globally. The aim of this research was to document mental health issues related to sea-level rise for people in East Malaita, Solomon Islands. Method: A cross-sectional study was carried out in six low-lying villages in East Malaita, Solomon Islands. The researcher travelled to villages by dugout canoe. In addition to quantitative, closed-ended questions, open-ended questions with villagers explored individual and community responses to rising sea level. Results: Of 60 people asked, 57 completed the questionnaire. Of these, 90% reported having seen a change in the weather patterns. Nearly all participants reported that sea-level rise is affecting them and their family and is causing fear and worry on a personal and community level. Four themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: experience of physical impacts of climate change; worry about the future; adaptation to climate change; government response needed. Conclusion: Given predictions of ongoing sea-level rise in the Pacific it is essential that more research is conducted to further understand the human impact of climate change for small island states which will inform local, provincial and national-level mental health responses.","[Asugeni, James] Atoifi Adventist Hosp, Malaita, Solomon Islands; [MacLaren, David] James Cook Univ, McGregor Rd, Cairns, Qld 4878, Australia; [Massey, Peter D.] Hunter New England Populat Hlth, Hlth Protect, Newcastle, NSW, Australia; [Speare, Rick] Trop Hlth Solut, Townsville, Qld, Australia",James Cook University,"MacLaren, D (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, McGregor Rd, Cairns, Qld 4878, Australia.",david.maclaren@jcu.edu.au,"Massey, Peter/AAD-6176-2022; Massey, Peter/AAZ-8001-2021","Massey, Peter/0000-0001-7194-1914",,,,,12,25,25,2,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1039-8562,1440-1665,,AUSTRALAS PSYCHIATRY,Australas.

The role of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic factors in stomatal responses to CO2 was investigated in wild-type barley (Hordeum vulgare var. Graphic) and in a mutant (G132) with decreased photochemical and Rubisco capacities. The CO2 and DCMU responses of stomatal conductance (g(s)), gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence and levels of ATP, with a putative transcript for stomatal opening were analysed. G132 had greater g(s) than the wild-type, despite lower photosynthesis rates and higher intercellular CO2 concentrations (C-i). The mutant had Rubisco-limited photosynthesis at very high CO2 levels, and higher ATP contents than the wild-type. Stomatal sensitivity to CO2 under red light was lower in G132 than in the wild-type, both in photosynthesizing and DCMU-inhibited leaves. Under constant C-i and red light, stomatal sensitivity to DCMU inhibition was higher in G132. The levels of a SLAH3-like slow anion channel transcript, involved in stomatal closure, decreased sharply in G132. The results suggest that stomatal responses to CO2 depend partly on the balance of photosynthetic electron transport to carbon assimilation capacities, but are partially regulated by the CO2 signalling network. High g(s) can improve the adaptation to climate change in well-watered conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To this end, this study overviews the main stages of Doha's urban growth and influencing climatic factors during this period. A physically-based hydrological model was then built to simulate surface runoff and quantify flood risk. Finally, the Pearson correlation was used to verify the potential nexus between flood risk, climate change, and urban growth. Surveying showed that, between 1984 and 2020, urban areas grew by 777%, and bare lands decreased by 54.7%. In addition, Doha witnessed various climatic changes with a notable increase in air temperature (+ 8.7%), a decrease in surface wind speed (- 19.5%), and a decrease in potential evapotranspiration losses (- 33.5%). Growth in urban areas and the perturbation of climatic parameters caused runoff to increase by 422%, suggesting that urban growth contributed more than climatic parameters. Pearson correlation coefficient between flood risk and urban growth was strong (0.83) and significant at p < 0.05. Flood risk has a strong significant positive (negative) correlation with air temperature (wind speed) and a moderate positive (negative) correlation with precipitation (potential evapotranspiration). These results pave the way to integrate flood risk reduction measures in local urban development and climate change adaptation plans.","[Ajjur, Salah Basem; Al-Ghamdi, Sami G.] Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Qatar Fdn, Coll Sci & Engn, Div Sustainable Dev, Doha, Qatar",Qatar Foundation (QF); Hamad Bin Khalifa University-Qatar,"Ajjur, SB; Al-Ghamdi, SG (corresponding author), Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Qatar Fdn, Coll Sci & Engn, Div Sustainable Dev, Doha, Qatar.",saajjur@hbku.edu.qa; salghamdi@hbku.edu.qa,"Al-Ghamdi, Sami G./AAH-6959-2020; Al-Ghamdi, Sami G./GPS-8949-2022; Ajjur, Salah Basem/C-9969-2018","Al-Ghamdi, Sami G./0000-0002-7416-5153; Ajjur, Salah Basem/0000-0001-9099-1511",National Priorities Research Program (NPRP) from the Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF) [NPRP12S-0212-190073],National Priorities Research Program (NPRP) from the Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF),"This article was funded by a National Priorities Research Program (NPRP) grant (NPRP12S-0212-190073) from the Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF), a member of Qatar Foundation (QF).",,34,2,2,7,8,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,JUL 18,2022,12,1,,,,,,,12265,10.1038/s41598-022-16475-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-16475-x,,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,3A3JJ,35851608,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000827160000057,View Full Record in Web of Science

Agro-advisories boost informed decision-making as well as planning of farm activities. The purpose of this study was to characterize the pathways through which farmers receive usable location-specific agro-advisories as well as to evaluate the effect of the socio-economic environment in the access to such information. Data was collected from 400 randomly selected households in lower eastern Kenya in a cross-sectional survey. Multivariate probit regression was used to determine the factors influencing the choice of pathways used in accessing climate change adaptation information. Household socio-economic characteristics that were found to be significant in explaining access to disseminated agro-advisories include phone and radio ownership, level of education, marital status, and farm size among others. Based on these findings a conclusion is made that the socio-economic environment within which information is disseminated is vital in determining those who access information and probably act on it. Additionally, pathways found to be complementary or substitutable give information providers new insights on the channels to use in information dissemination. The study recommends that these factors be considered in efforts geared towards promoting agro-advisory preparation and dissemination to improve adaptation to climate variability and change in dryland areas.","[Onyango, Debrah Akeyo] Univ Embu, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, Embu, Kenya; [Mogaka, Hezron Rasugu] Univ Embu, Dept Agr Econ, Embu, Kenya; [Ndirangu, Samuel Njiri] Univ Embu, Sch Agr, Embu, Kenya; [Kwena, Kizito] Kenya Agr Res & Livestock Res Org KALRO, Machakos, Kenya",,"Onyango, DA (corresponding author), Univ Embu, Sch Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, Embu, Kenya.",1236@student.embuni.ac.ke; hezronmogaka@gmail.comF; ndirangu.samuel@embuni.ac.ke; kwenakizito@yahoo.com,,,International Development Research Centre (IDRC) through KALRO under the Climate Change Adaptation Information (CHAI) project,International Development Research Centre (IDRC) through KALRO under the Climate Change Adaptation Information (CHAI) project,Authors thank International Development Research Centre (IDRC) through KALRO for funding this research under the Climate Change Adaptation Information (CHAI) project.,,65,1,1,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0266-6669,1741-6469,,INFORM DEV,Inf.

This Communication describes the concept of Climate Resilient Trajectories and clarifies its relevance, with particular attention to the poor. It also outlines some of the necessary considerations to ensure no one is left behind. It highlights the need for the design of Climate Resilient Trajectories to be flexible enough to accommodate the specific and complex contexts in which poor and marginalized people operate; and that the involvement of all relevant stakeholders (e.g. governments, business and private organizations, policy makers, and whole communities) is necessary in order to ensure such trajectories yield the expected benefits.

Adaptive reservoir operation is one of the most effective strategies to support water resources management under non-stationarity, yet until now, adaptive strategies considering non-stationarity across multiple time scales are rarely investigated. We propose an adaptive reservoir operation framework that incorporates streamflow non-stationarity across time scales simultaneously. Specifically, we first decompose the streamflow into four frequency categories to detect non-stationarity features through reservoir operation simulations. Next, we incorporate the non-stationarity information from each frequency category into adaptive reservoir operation by using Bayesian Model Averaging. We apply this framework to reservoir operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile River and evaluate its effectiveness with streamflow simulated from 21 general circulation models (GCMs) for two greenhouse gases emission scenarios. We find that streamflow non-stationarity from all GCMs varies by future period and frequency category. The proposed Bayesian adaptive reservoir operation framework can detect streamflow non-stationarity across all frequency categories and predominantly outperforms conventional adaptive strategies, especially in terms of firm power output. In general, firm output increases under the Bayesian framework as the power generation reliability increases. The proposed framework offers a robust approach to identify adaptive strategies for reservoir operation to address streamflow non-stationarity.","[Yang, Guang; Block, Paul] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1415 Engn Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Zaitchik, Benjamin; Badr, Hamada] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Johns Hopkins University,"Block, P (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1415 Engn Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",gyang82@wisc.edu; pblock2@wisc.edu,"Yang, Guang/AGJ-3481-2022","Yang, Guang/0000-0001-7330-3502; Badr, Hamada/0000-0002-9808-2344; Zaitchik, Benjamin/0000-0002-0698-0658",NSF INFEWS award [1639214],NSF INFEWS award,This work was partially supported by NSF INFEWS award 1639214.,,87,2,2,2,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

However, there is limited recognition of how land use impacts benthic assemblages, their bioturbation potential, and OC burial in mangrove forests and tidal flats. Here we evaluated the effects of mangrove deforestation on benthic bioturbation potential (BPc), sediment accretion rates (SARs), and OC and total nitrogen (TN) burial in mangrove soils and tidal flat sediments from three estuaries in tropical Brazil. SARs based on Pb-210 dating varied significantly among undisturbed estuaries (2.1-18.6 mm yr(-1)) and the OC and TN burial rates were respectively 46% and 16% higher than global averages. The cleared mangrove sites had a twofold lower SAR, 40-fold lower OC burial, and over 100-fold lower TN burial when compared to undisturbed forests, revealing the pervasive impacts of land use. Variation in benthic assemblage structure and BPc among sites suggests that the composition and activity of macrofaunal communities may facilitate OC burial in some cases, yet the global extent and significance of bioturbation requires further study.

Ignoring such benefits could lead to suboptimal planning and decision-making. A conceptual framework, building on the ecosystem-enriched Driver, Pressure, State, Exposure, Effect, Action model (eDPSEEA), is presented to aid in clarifying the relational structure between green spaces and human health, taking climate change as the key driver. The study has the double intention of (i) summarising the literature with a special emphasis on the ecosystem and health perspectives, as well as the main theories behind these impacts, and (ii) modelling these findings into a framework that allows for multidisciplinary approaches to the underlying relations between human health and green spaces. The paper shows that while the literature based on the ecosystem perspective presents a well-documented association between climate, health and green spaces, the literature using a health-based perspective presents mixed evidence in some cases. The role of contextual factors and the exposure mechanism are rarely addressed. The proposed framework could serve as a multidisciplinary knowledge platform for multi-perspecitve analysis and discussion among experts and stakeholders, as well as to support the operationalization of quantitative assessment and modelling exercises.

RIO offers a major development on the conventional NPV approach, because it integrates expected changes in future levels of uncertainty into economic analysis. This study applies RIO analysis to the semihypothetical case study of a coastal defense system to demonstrate its applicability for decision making on climate change adaptation. In the case study, two different adaptive strategies are analyzed, consisting of a hard and soft structural alternative. Soft strategies are often inherently more flexible than hard strategies. The results of the case study show that the NPV approach increases the relative cost of soft strategies for the two alternatives compared with hard strategies, because it does not account for the value of flexibility built into adaptive strategies. It is therefore recommended that RIO analysis be used for the choice between hard and soft strategies to avoid maladaptation. This is particularly significant in cases where there is both high climate uncertainty and high decision uncertainty concerning the best strategy. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)WW.1943-5460.0000142.

At the same time, coastal natural assets, including landscape, are threatened by increasing development mainly driven by tourism. The Mediterranean coast is especially vulnerable to these processes, considering its high biological and cultural diversity. An additional challenge is represented by climate change, as it will force coastal communities to apply more or less drastic adaptation strategies. Coastal setbacks, used to protect coastal communities and infrastructure from storms and erosion, and to preserve coastal habitats and landscapes from degradation, is one of the main instruments suggested by the Protocol on Integrated Coastal Zone Management of the Barcelona Convention, entered into force on the 24 of March 2011. Its implementation has the potential to influence coastal policies in other regions, such as the neighbouring Black Sea. The CONSCIENCE project has formalized concepts and conducted specific studies to provide new tools for coastal erosion management practice. The objective of this paper is to present a synthesis of the research conducted into coastal setbacks for coastal erosion management and climate change adaptation. This is done by analysing the requirement of the Protocol, current processes and management practices in two case study areas (Costa Brava Bays in Spain and Danube Delta, in Romania) and the new challenges posed by climate change.

In recent years, the interest in adaptation and resilience'' has increased significantly in part because anthropogenic climate change appears unavoidable and mitigation agreements are difficult to achieve. This article takes a critical look at the emerging discourse over climate change adaptation and resilience. By drawing upon critiques of environmental resource management and adaptive comanagement, this paper argues that taking the concept of adaptation for granted as an appropriate bottom-up strategy for coping with anthropogenic climate change not only ignores the political and economic contexts in which this environmental strategy developed, but might also unintentionally subvert the vulnerable communities it intends to benefit. Using an ethnographic case study of the 2004 Boscastle Harbour flood in North Cornwall, England, this paper explores the paradoxical way in which adaptation and resilience work within the apparatus of the neoliberal state, which aims to shift responsibility for social and environmental problems to the individual. By better understanding the political and economic processes embedded in the concepts of adaptation and resilience, researchers will be more effective at finding equitable solutions to human ecological problems. Adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change is vital in order to reduce the impacts of climate change that are happening now and increase resilience to future impacts (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change).","Univ Wisconsin Stevens Point, Dept Philosophy Religious Studies & Anthropol, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point,"Jennings, TL (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Stevens Point, Dept Philosophy Religious Studies & Anthropol, 489 Collins Classroom Ctr, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA.",tori.jennings@uwsp.edu,,,Social Science Research Council (SSRC); Andrew W.

This paper focuses on networks of stakeholders involved in the diffusion of seasonal climate forecasts. It is argued that understanding stakeholder networks is key to determining the opportunities and barriers to the flow of forecast information, which could enable more focused forecast dissemination. Lesotho is used as a case study where Stakeholder Thematic Networks (STNs) are used as a novel method for investigating forecast dissemination. STNs enable qualitative information to be analysed through semi-quantitative mapping of relationships that enable the networks and scales of linkages to be visualised. This illustrates the types of nodes and channels of seasonal forecast information flow and so enables existing or emerging patterns of dissemination to be uncovered. Sub-networks that exist for purposes other than climate information dissemination are identified as salient sub-networks for focusing development of future forecast dissemination. These existing sub-networks enable stakeholder needs to be addressed and decrease the need for new networks to be established. By using these sub-networks, information relating to climate variability can be mainstreamed into existing development pathways. This is critical to recognise if innovations relating to climate information are to be used to improve climate change adaptation.","Stockholm Environm Inst, Oxford Off, Oxford, England; Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Climate Syst Anal Grp, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Ziervogel, G (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Oxford Off, Oxford, England.",gina@egs.uct.ac.za,"Ziervogel, Gina/AAG-2945-2019; Langholtz, Matthew/B-9416-2012","Ziervogel, Gina/0000-0003-4219-6809; Langholtz, Matthew/0000-0002-8153-7154",,,,,59,69,69,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

To increase urban resilience to extreme weather events, it is essential to combine green and blue infrastructure and link enhanced storage capacity in periods of water surplus with moments of water shortage as well as water availability with heat stress. 'Blue-green measures' is a collective term for sustainable green and blue infrastructure that utilises underlying ecosystem functions to deliver multiple benefits: for example, cooling via evapotranspiration, water storage for heavy rainfall events, discharge peak attenuation, seasonal water storage, and groundwater recharge. Measures contribute most to climate adaptation when implemented in combinations. Such packages of blue-green measures capitalize upon the synergistic interactions between ecosystem functions and hence enhance multiple vulnerability reduction capacities. Moreover, combining blue-green measures enables using their unique potential at different spatial scales and establishing hydrologic connectivity. This paper proposes a framework for a planning support system and a tool to select adaptation measures to support urban planners in collaboratively finding site-specific sets of blue-green measures for a particular urban reconstruction project. With the proposed framework users can evaluate appropriateness of specific adaptation measures for a particular location and compose effective packages of blue-green measures to handle flooding, drought and heat stress. It is concluded that the framework: 1) enables incorporating knowledge on urban climate adaptation and ecosystem services in a communicative urban planning process, 2) guides the selection of a coherent and effective package of blue-green adaptation measures.

Models that have enjoyed noticeable expansion are stochastic production frontiers for panel data. These models have proven very useful in total factor productivity (TFP) measurement and the analyses of its components. However, the related empirical literature in Latin America and the Caribbean has been limited, and a likely reason for this gap is data constraints. This article examines the setting surrounding the measurement and analysis of productivity in the Chilean agricultural sector. The specific objectives are to (1) provide a summary of key agricultural productivity measures and recent associated methodological advances; (2) present an overview of micro studies reporting technical efficiency and TFP in Chile; (3) portray the major sources of agricultural data available in the country; and (4) discuss salient features of the agricultural data systems used in Australia and the United States. The paper ends by identifying challenges and possible improvements to the prevailing data system that could strengthen the measurements and monitoring of productivity in Chile. The analysis suggests that the country needs substantial improvements in the collection and analysis of agricultural statistics to develop TFP and related research. This line of work is a critical step to enhance competitiveness and to foster adaptations to climate change, as well as to fully participate in efforts sponsored by the IFAD, FAO and the OECD to monitor progress toward the SDGs.

Realising the increasing risks from climate change on communities, government, in partnership with aid-donor partners, has invested millions of dollars in climate change projects, through mitigation and adaptation strategies. As a form of adaptation, the government invests in programmes aimed at increasing the adaptive capacity of the vulnerable communities through landscape and seascape projects across the rural communities. Focusing on the transformation concept as a long-term adaptation strategy and enlargement of climate engineering and ecological resilience concepts, the paper discusses why building resilience from transformation of rural communities, as well as from landscape and seascape projects, would benefit communities and relevant authorities. This paper describes the findings of a study on two rural villages, Keigold and Mondo, from Ranogha Islands, Western Province, in Solomon Islands, where 80% of households decided to relocate from their old village Mondo to their new home Keigold after an earthquake in 2007, as part of a self-initiative. The reallocation process can be seen as a case of pro-active community transformation that provides valuable lessons to other rural communities that may be forced to move due to impacts from natural catastrophes, including those explained by climate change risks. Lessons from this experience suggest that policy-makers and non-government organisations should consider and empower local transformation initiatives as a way to building long-term adaptation to climate change.","[Ha'apio, Michael Otoara; Wairiu, Morgan] Univ South Pacific, Pacific Ctr Environm & Sustainable Dev, Suva, Fiji; [Gonzalez, Ricardo] Univ La Frontera, Fac Agr & Forest Sci, Dept Forest Sci, Temuco, Chile; [Morrison, Keith] Res Inst, Canterbury, New Zealand",University of the South Pacific; Universidad de La Frontera,"Wairiu, M (corresponding author), Univ South Pacific, Pacific Ctr Environm & Sustainable Dev, Suva, Fiji.",morgan.wairiu@usp.ac.fj,,"Gonzalez Jimenez, Ricardo Esteban/0000-0001-6100-2059","Research office, University of the South Pacific [6 F004]","Research office, University of the South Pacific","The authors would sincerely thank the Director of Research office, University of the South Pacific (6 F004) for funding this study.",,42,8,8,8,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2018,23,3,,,,,352,365,,10.1080/13549839.2017.1420640,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2017.1420640,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,GE4IX,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000431180200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Each group of countries is represented by an economic growth model where two different types of economies, called, respectively, 'low-carbon' and 'carbon,' can co-exist, each of which having different productivities of capital and of emissions due to energy use. We assume that each group of countries participating in the negotiations has identified a damage function, which determines a loss of GDP due to warming and has also a possibility to invest in a capital permitting adaptation to climate changes. The climate agreements we consider have two main components: (1) They define a global emission budget for a commitment period and impose it as a limit on cumulative emissions during that period; (2) they distribute this global budget among the different coalitions of countries taking part in the agreement. This implies that the game has now a coupled constraint for all participants in the negotiations. The outcome of the agreement is therefore obtained as a generalized or 'Rosen' equilibrium which can be selected among a whole manifold of such solutions. We show that the family of Nash equilibria in the games obtained through a distribution of the total budget among the different parties corresponds to the manifold of normalized equilibria. We then propose an equity criterion to determine a fair division of this total emission budget or equivalently to select a proper weighting for a normalized equilibrium.","[Bahn, O.; Haurie, A.] HEC Montreal, Gerad, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bahn, O.; Haurie, A.] HEC Montreal, Dept Decis Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Haurie, A.] ORDECSYS, Geneva, Switzerland; [Haurie, A.] Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; University of Geneva,"Bahn, O (corresponding author), HEC Montreal, Gerad, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Bahn, O (corresponding author), HEC Montreal, Dept Decis Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",olivier.bahn@hec.ca,"Bahn, Olivier/R-2609-2019",,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada;  [EU-FP7-265170 ERMITAGE],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); ,O.

Globally, coastal communities are vulnerable to a diversity of marine climate change impacts, and adaptation responses will need to be tailored to suit each unique socio-ecological situation. The responsibility of adaptation planning is largely placed on municipal councils, yet much of this activity goes unreported in the peer-reviewed literature. Through a meta-analysis of municipal planning documents this study reveals that in general, progress is in the early stages. Many councils have no plans, and the presence of plans seems to be related to the magnitude of council income as well as participation in regional or international adaptation networks. Of those councils that do have plans, only half have progressed beyond the 'understanding the problem' phase. Additionally, the focus of marine adaptation planning is generally restricted to one driver - sea level rise. Changing sea surface temperatures and ocean acidification were largely ignored, despite predicted impacts on coastal ecosystems and the communities that interact and depend on them. While it is often assumed that developed countries have the capacity to adapt to climate change, this study indicates that for some important aspects of marine change in Australia, this capacity is not always translated into action by local councils. The development and refinement of progress indicators such as those used in this study will be increasingly important as tools for establishing baselines and tracking adaptation into the future.

A certain level of uncertainty has always existed in water resources planning, but the speed and intensity of changes in baseline conditions that climate change embodies might require a shift in perspective. This article draws on both the social and physical science results of the EU-FP7 ACQWA project to better understand the challenges and opportunities for adaptation to climate change impacts on the hydrology of the upper Rhone basin in the Canton Valais, Switzerland. It first presents the results of hydro-climatic change projections downscaled to more temporally and spatially-relevant frames of reference for decision makers. Then, it analyses the current policy and legislative framework within which these changes will take place, according to the policy coherence across different water-relevant frameworks as well as the integration and mainstreaming of climate change. It compares the current policy and legislative frameworks for different aspects of water resources management to the projected impacts of climate change on the hydrology of the upper Rhone basin, in order to examine the appropriateness of the current approach for responding to a changing climatic context. Significant uncertainties pose numerous challenges in the governance context. The study draws on adaptive governance principles, to propose policy actions across different scales of governance to better manage baseline variability as well as more 'unpredictable' uncertainty from climate change impacts.

These changes increase the chance of more severe and frequent natural conditions, and limit ecosystem function and human activities. Adaptation to climate change requires assessment of the potential disaster risk. The objectives of this study were to estimate the flood risk index (FRI) considering regional flood characteristics at the national level and to prioritize the factors affecting flood risk through principal component analysis. FRI was estimated based on the Delphi survey results from 50 water resources experts in South Korea. The potential risk analysis was conducted for 229 local governments in South Korea. The results showed that natural and social factors were more influential flood risk factors to South Korea than administrative and economic and facility factors. Specifically, natural, social, administrative and economic, and facility factors were, respectively, highest at Jindo-Gun in Jennam-Do, Gumi-Si in Kyongsanbuk-Do, Dong-Gu in Incheon-Si, and Suwon-Si, Kyonggi-Do. Overall, the highest FRI is shown in Anyang-Si, Kyongggi-Do. The spatial distribution of the FRI was high in the southeastern coastal region and basins of the two biggest rivers in South Korea, and normalized flood frequency followed spatial patterns similar to FRIs. This study provided information on the relative flood risk index among administrative units for investment prioritization in flood risk management. In this regard, the suggested FRI is expected to significantly contribute to methodical and economic improvements in budget allocations for flood risk management.","[Jung, Younghun; Jang, Chun Hwa; Kum, Donghyuk; Lim, Kyoung Jae] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Reg Infrastruct Engn, Chunchon, South Korea; [Shin, Yongchul] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Kim, Young Sug] Korea Inst Construct Technol, Goyang, South Korea; [Kim, Hyun Bae] POSCO E&C, R&D Ctr, Inchon, South Korea; [Park, Tae Sun] Korea Res Inst Human Settlements, Environm & Water Resources Res Div, Anyang, South Korea; [Lee, Seung Oh] Hongik Univ, Sch Urban & Civil Engn, Seoul, South Korea",Kangwon National University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Hongik University,"Lee, SO (corresponding author), Hongik Univ, Sch Urban & Civil Engn, Seoul, South Korea.",seungoh.lee@hongik.ac.kr,,,Eco-Star Project [EW32-07-10],Eco-Star Project,This research was supported by the Eco-Star Project (No.: EW32-07-10).,,33,7,7,2,18,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1611-2490,1611-2504,,PADDY WATER ENVIRON,Paddy Water Environ.,AUG,2014,12,,,1,SI,,S41,S49,,10.1007/s10333-014-0430-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-014-0430-6,,,9,Agricultural Engineering; Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,CB9RX,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000349971200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the Hindu Kush Himalayan region, and particularly in the arid and semiarid areas of northern Pakistan, pastoralism, the main livelihood, is vulnerable to climate change. Little detailed information is available about climate trends and impacts in remote mountain regions; herders' perceptions of climate change can provide the information needed by policy makers to address problems and make decisions on adaptive strategies in high pastoral areas. A survey was conducted in Gilgit-Baltistan province of Pakistan to assess herders' perceptions of, and adaptation strategies to climate change. Herders' perceptions were gathered in individual interviews and focus group discussions. The herders perceived a change in climate over the past 10-15 years with longer and more intense droughts in summer, more frequent and heavier snowfall in winter, and prolonged summers and relatively shorter winters. These perceptions were validated by published scientific evidence. The herders considered that the change in climate had directly impacted pastures and then livestock by changing vegetation composition and reducing forage yield. They had adopted some adaptive strategies in response to the change such as altering the migration pattern and diversifying livelihoods. The findings show that the herder communities have practical lessons and indigenous knowledge related to rangeland management and adaptation to climate change that should be shared with the scientific community and integrated into development planning.","[Joshi, S.; Jasra, W.

Caribbean islanders have been exposed to climatic challenges since the initial occupation of the archipelago between five to eight thousand years ago. They have been continually confronted with severe droughts, tropical cyclones, extreme wave events, sea-level changes, and the accompanying impacts. The various phenomena have stimulated island residents both to anticipate and respond to such events, adapting their lifestyles and socio-cultural and political structures and ties across the region over time. In this article, we innovatively combine archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data with longitudinal coastal-erosion data and ethnographic data to further develop and promote sustainable local strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and increasingly frequent and violent weather events on small-island settings. To find proxies, we first look into the region's pre-colonial archaeological record. Second, we delve into predictive modeling and the current and future climatic challenges for heritage sites and local coastal communities, as well as related collaborative heritage mitigation efforts. Third, we discuss the contribution of traditional knowledge practices to climate change adaptation. The results show how the long-term perspective and multidisciplinary approach adopted here may lead to realistic solutions to seemingly intractable problems.

Acknowledging this, urban climate change adaptation and mitigation plans are increasingly developed to make progress toward enhancing climate resilience. While there is consensus that focusing on both adaptation and mitigation is necessary for addressing climate change impacts, better understanding of their interactions is needed to efficiently maximize their potentials. This paper, first, provides a bibliographic analysis to map existing knowledge regarding adaptation-mitigation interactions. This is done using methods such as bibliographic coupling, co-citation analysis, and co-occurrence analysis. Then, drawing on the literature, this study explores two types of interactions between adaptation andmitigationmeasures, namely co-benefits and synergies. These interactions are explored through analyzing evidence reported in the literature on different measures related to sectors such as energy, transportation, waste, water, green infrastructure, urban planning, and governance. Results of the bibliographic analysis show that there is a lack of research in the Global South. Results of the detailed content analysis showthat manymeasures can provide co-benefits and synergies. Measures related to green infrastructure, buildings, energy systems, and, transportation are particularly capable of providing co-benefits. In addition, it was found that appropriate levels of density, promotion of public transportation, and urban greenery are measures that are more likely to provide synergistic benefits if combined with other adaptation and/or mitigation measures. This study highlights the need for more empirical research to better understand the magnitude of synergistic benefits between different measures. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Many studies have reported that a green facade can noticeably reduce the building surface temperature and cooling loads in summer. However, little is known about the extent to which large-scale facade greening cools the ambient air or the relationship between the cooling effects and urban form. This research employed the ENVI-met model to evaluate the summer cooling effects of block-scale facade greening and their relationship with urban form in Nanjing City in China. Six idealized urban blocks (IUBs) representing typical urban forms in Nanjing combined with five hypothetical facade-greening ratios generated 30 scenarios for simulation. The results revealed a distinct spatial pattern of cooling effects in each IUB. The cooling intensity decreases with increasing elevation, and it is strongest in ground spaces on the downwind side. The maximum cooling intensity is 0.96 degrees C and observed in the high-rise high-density site (HH). Among the six IUBs, the low-rise high-density block (LH) appears to be optimal for facade greening since it ranks in the top 1-3 for the four cooling-effect indicators. The threshold values were evaluated to further estimate the minimum greening ratios required to achieve corresponding energy-saving targets in each IUB.

Adaptation plans are required to help cope with landslides in order to reduce the extent of the damage. Landslide hazard analysis can help create adaptation plans. Analyzing the cost of damage of and the effect of adaptation to landslides is an effective way to support decision makers. The cost of damage is calculated using the costs of damage incurred in residential and transportation areas in the past, based on data from annual reports. Spatial distribution models are used to analyze landslide hazard areas in the present and the future. Future or potential landslide hazards are estimated by using climate change scenarios through representative concentration pathways. The effects of adaptation measures are assessed using modified variables and a cost-benefit analysis. The uncertainty of the cost of damage is considered using average, minimum, and maximum values. As a result, the methods used to estimate future costs of damage are developed, and the effects of adaptation are analyzed. The future cost of damage is calculated for every climate change scenario. The effect of adaptation are analyzed and areas with a reduced risk of landslides are identified, reducing the cost of damage and adaptation costs, as well as the costs and benefits of adaptation measures. Improving soil drainage is the most effective measure among the four measures analyzed. This study can help estimate future costs of damage and analyze the effect of adaptation in creating effective adaptation plans.","[Kim, Ho Gul] Cheongju Univ, Dept Human Environm Design, Major Landscape Urban Planning, Cheongju 28503, South Korea; [Lee, Dong Kun] Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr Life Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Lee, Dong Kun] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Rural Syst Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Park, Chan] Univ Seoul, Dept Landscape Architecture, Seoul 02504, South Korea",Cheongju University; Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); University of Seoul,"Kim, HG (corresponding author), Cheongju Univ, Dept Human Environm Design, Major Landscape Urban Planning, Cheongju 28503, South Korea.;Lee, DK (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr Life Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea.;Lee, DK (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Rural Syst Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",khgghk87@gmail.com; dklee7@snu.ac.kr; chanepark@gmail.com,,"Park, chan/0000-0002-4994-6855","Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) [2016000210004]; BK 21 Plus Project (Seoul National University Interdisciplinary Program in Landscape Architecture, Global Leadership Program toward Innovative Green Infrastructure); National Research Foundation of Korea [22A20130012463] Funding Source: Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI), National Science & Technology Information Service (NTIS)","Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE); BK 21 Plus Project (Seoul National University Interdisciplinary Program in Landscape Architecture, Global Leadership Program toward Innovative Green Infrastructure); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","This work was supported by Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE, Project No. 2016000210004) as Public Technology Program based on Environmental Policy, and the BK 21 Plus Project in 2015 (Seoul National University Interdisciplinary Program in Landscape Architecture, Global Leadership Program toward Innovative Green Infrastructure).",,30,7,7,2,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2018,10,5,,,,,,,1628,10.3390/su10051628,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10051628,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ7RP,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000435587100324,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study presents an integrated eco-efficiency approach for assessing flood prevention and avoided damage. We focused on ephemeral streams in the Maresme region (Catalonia, Spain), which is an urbanized area affected by damaging torrential events. Our goal was to determine the feasibility of post-disaster emergency actions implemented after a major event through an integrated hydrologic, environmental and economic approach. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and costing (LCC) were used to determine the eco-efficiency of these actions, and their net impact and payback were calculated by integrating avoided flood damage. Results showed that the actions effectively reduced damage generation when compared to the registered water flows and rainfall intensities. The eco-efficiency of the emergency actions resulted in 1.2 kg CO2 eq. per invested euro. When integrating the avoided damage into the initial investment, negative net impacts were obtained (e.g., -5.2E + 05 (sic)) and -2.9E + 04 kg CO2 eq. per event), which suggests that these interventions contributed with environmental and economic benefits to the society. The economic investment was recovered in two years, whereas the design could be improved to reduce their environmental footprint, which is recovered ih 25 years. Our method and results highlight the effects of integrating the environmental and economic consequences of decisions at an urban scale and might help the administration and insurance companies in the design of prevention plans and climate change adaptation.

Several factors such as social, economic, political, demographic, natural and livelihood strategies cause vulnerability in the status of household food security. This study aims to examine the vulnerability of the factors of household food accessibility and its linkage with the climatic changes in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on primary data collected in the months of July-October, 2012, through a questionnaire survey on 460 low-income households from the East Coast Economic Region (ECER) in Malaysia. The samples were selected from E-Kasih poor household database, based on the cluster random sampling technique. The questionnaire uses a five-point Likert scale, and the data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and ANOVA F statistics for chi-square two-sample test. Findings - The study finds that the vulnerability of the factors of household food accessibility has increased statistically and significantly over the past five years in Malaysia, whereas the contributions of climatic factors are low on these changes. This study suggests that the food security programs in Malaysia need to be integrated with the climatic change adaptation programs to ensure more effective and sustainable household food security in the future. Originality/value - This study is an original work based on primary data that empirically measures the vulnerability of the factors of household food accessibility, one of the important dimensions of household food security, and its linkage with climatic changes.","[Alam, Md.

The attraction of flexible strategies, incorporating upgrade options that can be exercised when and if required, has been recognized for a long time. The techniques of real options allowed the benefits of flexible strategies to be quantified for the first time. A new and simplified methodology for real options analysis has been developed and implemented in software. It performs evaluation in both cost and environmental impact terms. A case study of a real highway in Spain was evaluated using the new methodology and software. Seven alternative strategies for the roadway (subgrade, base course, and surface course) were evaluated, six with upgrade options that are exercised if the traffic demand crosses specified thresholds. The rate of traffic growth, and also the discount rate for financial evaluation, were treated as uncertain variables. The highway was designed when the Spanish economy was growing strongly and a high roadway specification performed best. Before the highway was built the economy crashed and construction was canceled. Recalculation for the posteconomic shock conditions with lower traffic growth and a higher interest rate favored a lower highway specification with upgrade options. Sensitivity analysis shows how the specification choice varies with the values taken by the uncertain variables. A novel specification was proposed to maximize flexibility when there is high uncertainty about traffic growth, and evaluation showed that it performed better in many conditions. The methodology of evaluating flexible strategies could be used in many applications, including infrastructure for climate change adaptation.","[Fawcett, William] Cambridge Architectural Res Ltd, Cambridge CB1 2LG, England; [Robles Urquijo, Ignacio] APIA XXI, Dept R&D & Transport Econ, Santander 39011, Spain; [Krieg, Hannes] Univ Stuttgart, Dept Life Cycle Engn, Dept Bldg Phys, D-70563 Stuttgart, Germany; [Hughes, Martin] Cambridge Architectural Res Ltd, Cambridge CB1 2LG, England; [Mikalsen, Lars] Holte AS, N-0212 Oslo, Norway; [Ramos Gutierrez, Oscar Ramon] Univ Cantabria, Dept Struct & Mech Engn, Santander 39011, Spain; [Ramos Gutierrez, Oscar Ramon] APIA XXI, Santander, Spain",University of Stuttgart; Universidad de Cantabria,"Fawcett, W (corresponding author), Cambridge Architectural Res Ltd, 25 Gwydir St 6, Cambridge CB1 2LG, England.",william.fawcett@carltd.com,,"Robles Urquijo, Ignacio/0000-0001-6477-2147",European Community [229061],European Community(European Commission),"The case study was carried out as part of the collaborative CILECCTA project funded by the European Community's Program FP7/2007-2013 for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration Activities, under EC Grant Agreement no. 229061.

The approach optimizes production of projections given constraints faced by decision makers as they incorporate climate change into long-term planning and policy. New York City stakeholders, who are well versed in risk management, helped to preselect the climate variables most likely to impact urban infrastructure and requested a projection range rather than a single most likely outcome. The climate projections approach is transferable to other regions and is consistent with broader efforts to provide climate services, including impact, vulnerability, and adaptation information. The approach uses 16 GCMs and three emissions scenarios to calculate monthly change factors based on 30-yr average future time slices relative to a 30-yr model baseline. Projecting these model mean changes onto observed station data for New York City yields dramatic changes in the frequency of extreme events such as coastal flooding and dangerous heat events. On the basis of these methods, the current 1-in-10-year coastal flood is projected to occur more than once every 3 years by the end of the century and heat events are projected to approximately triple in frequency. These frequency changes are of sufficient magnitude to merit consideration in long-term adaptation planning, even though the precise changes in extreme-event frequency are highly uncertain.","[Horton, Radley M.; Gornitz, Vivien; Bader, Daniel A.; Ruane, Alex C.; Goldberg, Richard; Rosenzweig, Cynthia] Columbia Univ, Ctr Climate Syst Res, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Horton, Radley M.; Ruane, Alex C.; Rosenzweig, Cynthia] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA",Columbia University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Horton, RM (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Ctr Climate Syst Res, Earth Inst, 2880 Broadway, New York, NY 10025 USA.",rh142@columbia.edu,"Ruane, Alex/ABD-5612-2021","Horton, Radley/0000-0002-5574-9962",Rockefeller Foundation; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy,Rockefeller Foundation; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"This work was supported by the Rockefeller Foundation.

Second, PYL supports an integration of information on environmental and landscape conditions into impact assessment. Third, PYL supports the integration of impacts of planning measures on ecosystem services. PYL is a modified 2-D cellular automaton with GIS features. The cells have the major attribute land-use type and can be supplemented with additional information, such as specifics regarding geology, topography and climate. The GIS features support the delineation of non-cellular infrastructural elements, such as roads or water bodies. An evaluation matrix represents the core element of the system. In this matrix, values in a relative scale from 0 (lowest value) to 100 (highest value) are assigned to the land-use types and infrastructural elements depending on their effect on ecosystem services. The option to configure rules for describing the impact of environmental attributes and proximity effects on cell values and land-use transition probabilities is of particular importance. User interface and usage of the platform are demonstrated by an application case. Constraints and limits of the recent version are discussed, including the need to consider in the evaluation, landscape-structure aspects such as patch size, fragmentation and spatial connectivity.

Plagues of this grasshopper can aggravate grassland degradation and cause huge damage to the livestock industry. Fungal biopesticides are seen as a suitable means of controlling grasshoppers and locusts. However, the efficiency of fungal biopesticides is dependent on temperature. Currently, there is limited knowledge on the thermal biology of this grasshopper in natural habitats. In this study, ground temperature measurements were made in conjunction with measurements of internal body temperatures using thermocouples and hand-held thermometers. The grasshoppers were randomly caught during the daytime in 2017 and 2018 in eight different locations in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. Our results indicated that the average internal body temperature of nymphs as well as adults of O. d. asiaticusis was higher than the ground temperature and that it increases/decreases with increases/decreases in ground temperature, respectively, during the daytime. Moreover, the adult internal body temperature is significantly higher than that of the nymphs at different times of the day, specifically around 6:00, 10:00, 13:00, and 18:00. Female internal body temperatures were significantly higher than those of the males by an average of 0.90 degrees C. Additionally, the average internal body temperature of the brown morphs was higher than that of the green morphs by approximately 1.17 degrees C. These findings demonstrate that brown morph insects might be more tolerant of fungal biopesticides and hence the biopesticides may take longer to kill them. Hence, ecophysiological adaptations to climate change may affect how fungal biopesticides could be used in the future.","[Cheng, Yumeng; Li, Hongmei; Liu, Lulu; Gu, Haojing] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, MARA CABI Joint Lab Biosafety, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Li, Hongmei] CABI East & Southeast Asia, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Guangjun] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, State Key Lab Biol Plant Dis & Insect Pests, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Gu, Haojing] Adm Off Yuanmingyuan Pk Beijing Municipal, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Luke, Belinda] CABI, Egham TW20 9TY, Surrey, England","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Plant Protection, CAAS; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Plant Protection, CAAS","Li, HM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, MARA CABI Joint Lab Biosafety, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.;Li, HM (corresponding author), CABI East & Southeast Asia, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",chengym0222@163.com; h.li@cabi.org; lululiul@163.com; wangguangjun@caas.cn; graino@163.com; b.luke@cabi.org,,"Li, Hongmei/0000-0001-6509-400X",Newton UK-China Agricentres (Innovate UK/BBSRC) [104906]; STFC [ST/V000306/1]; China's Donation to the CABI Development Fund [IVM10051],Newton UK-China Agricentres (Innovate UK/BBSRC); STFC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC)); China's Donation to the CABI Development Fund,"This research was funded by grants from Newton UK-China Agricentres (Innovate UK/BBSRC; grant no.: 104906), the STFC (grant no.: ST/V000306/1), and China's Donation to the CABI Development Fund (grant no.: IVM10051).",,54,0,0,5,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,JUN,2022,12,6,,,,,,,878,10.3390/agriculture12060878,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12060878,,,11,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,2K5VA,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000816402000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the adaptability of existing hybrids to a changing climate has not been systematically investigated. Therefore, little is known about the appropriate timing of hybrid adaptation. Here, using a novel hybrid model which coupled CERES-Maize with machine learning, we critically investigated the impacts of climate change on maize productivity with an ensemble of hybrid-specific estimations in China. We determined when and where current hybrids would become unviable and hybrid adaptation need be implemented, as well as which hybrid traits would be desirable. Climate change would have mostly negative impacts on maize productivity, and the magnitudes of yield reductions would highly depend on the growth cycle of the hybrids. Hybrid replacement could partially, but not completely, offset the yield loss caused by projected climate change. Without adaptation, approximately 53% of the cultivation areas would require hybrid renewal before 2050 under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. The medium-maturing hybrids with a long grain-filling duration and a high light use efficiency would be promising, although the ideotypic traits could be different for a specific environment. The findings highlight the necessity and urgency of breeding climate resilient hybrids, providing policy-makers and crop breeders with the early signals of when, where and what hybrids will be required, which stimulate proactive investment to facilitate breeding. The proposed crop modelling approach is scalable, largely data-driven and can be used to tackle the longstanding problem of predicting hybrids' future performance to accelerate development of new crop hybrids.","[Zhang, Liangliang; Zhang, Zhao; Luo, Yuchuan; Cao, Juan; Li, Ziyue; Xie, Ruizhi] Beijing Normal Univ, Acad Disaster Reduct & Emergency Management, Sch Natl Safety & Emergency Management, Minist Emergency Management, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Liangliang; Zhang, Zhao; Luo, Yuchuan; Cao, Juan; Li, Ziyue] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Natl Safety & Emergency Management, Minist Educ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Tao, Fulu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Tao, Fulu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Li, Shaokun] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Crop Sci, Minist Agr, Key Lab Crop Physiol & Ecol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Crop Sciences, CAAS; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs","Zhang, Z (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Acad Disaster Reduct & Emergency Management, Sch Natl Safety & Emergency Management, Minist Emergency Management, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Zhang, Z (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Natl Safety & Emergency Management, Minist Educ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Tao, FL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Tao, FL (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",zhangzhao@bnu.edu.cn; taofl@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Luo, Yuchuan/GSN-5985-2022",,"National Key Research & Development Programme of China [2017YFD0300301, 2017YFA0604700, 2016YFD 0300201, 2020YFA0608201]; National Science Foundation of China [42061144003, 41977405]",National Key Research & Development Programme of China; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was funded by the National Key Research & Development Programme of China (Nos. 2017YFD0300301, 2017YFA0604700, 2016YFD 0300201, and 2020YFA0608201), and the National Science Foundation of China (Nos. 42061144003 and 41977405).",,62,4,5,19,64,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

Removing the barriers that shore protection structures create between coastal and upland habitats can reestablish exchanges of sediment and the ecological functions of the natural ecotone. The potential for removing these structures was evaluated in 12 national parks managed by the U.S. National Park Service. Criteria for removal included condition of structures, influence of natural processes, environmental benefits, public safety, and visitor access and use. We found that 145 structures out of a total of 407 could be removed or allowed to deteriorate. We highlight three adaptation projects that are currently being conducted, two of which involve removing structures. Reasons for not taking a more pro-active approach to removing protection structures include (1) conflicting policy directives; (2) presence of key access roads and critical archaeological and historic sites; (3) lack of data; (4) lack of funds and human resources; (5) reluctance to replace known problems with an unknown set of problems; (6) consideration of visitor desires; and (7) reluctance to allow erosion to occur. Demonstration projects are needed to provide information about adaptation strategies that promote enhancement of ecosystem functions. Projects to remove protection structures are likely to be viewed as successful only if results are specified as a positive product, and the distinction between the concept of loss (erosion of existing landforms and habitats) and the concept of gain (evolution of new landforms and habitats) is made clear.

Today, these villages face a growing crisis related to conflict and climate change. While the situation in Zamfara is unparalleled in many ways, the interactions between climate change, conflict, and mining consistently overlap a global scale. The scope of this analysis extends beyond the Nigerian crisis. Objectives: Understanding the complexities of challenges faced in Zamfara provides insight into how these issues impact vulnerable communities globally, and which strategies should be considered to solve this wicked problem. Methods: Analysis of the relationships between climate change, conflict, and mining in Zamfara and globally via literature review and examination of current events in the Sahel region. Findings: Supporting healthy artisanal mining communities, as was prioritized in Zamfara, must be a focus of environmental, health, and mineral management policies. This includes the consideration of multiple environmental health challenges, the protection of vulnerable groups, government-supported formalization programs, and meaningful involvement of local leadership in developing, implementing, and sustaining intervention strategies to enshrine ASM as a poverty reduction, climate change adaptation strategy. Conclusions: Rapidly rising metal prices and demand will continue to fuel environmental health crises associated with mining. Given Africa's growing role in the global mineral economy and the massive number of subsistence communities who will continue to be impacted by climate change, strategies that support responsible artisanal mining are both a necessity for preventing future health crises and an opportunity for promoting regional stability and peace.","[Bartrem, Casey; von Lindern, Ian; von Braun, Margrit; Tirima, Simba] TerraGraph Int Fdn, 121 S Jackson St, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [von Braun, Margrit] Univ Idaho, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Tirima, Simba] Med Sans Frontieres, Abuja, Nigeria",Idaho; University of Idaho,"Bartrem, C (corresponding author), TerraGraph Int Fdn, 121 S Jackson St, Moscow, ID 83843 USA.",casey@terrafound.org,,"Bartrem, Casey/0000-0001-7534-7103; von Braun, Margrit/0000-0001-5922-3645",TerraGraphics International Foundation; The Anka Emirate Council; Anka and Bukkuyum Local Government Areas; Zamfara and Niger State Governments; Federal Government of Nigeria; UNICEF; Medecins Sans Frontieres,TerraGraphics International Foundation; The Anka Emirate Council; Anka and Bukkuyum Local Government Areas; Zamfara and Niger State Governments; Federal Government of Nigeria; UNICEF; Medecins Sans Frontieres,"Research and manuscript preparation was supported by TerraGraphics International Foundation, a nonprofit, 501 (c) (3) organization.

Alternative urban spaces should be designed considering new requirements in terms of urban microclimate and thermal comfort. Pervious pavements such as green parking lots can contribute to this goal through solar evaporative cooling. However, the cooling benefits of such systems remain under debate during dry and warm periods. The aim of this study was to compare experimentally the thermal behavior of different parking lot types (PLTs) with vegetated urban soil. Four parking lots were instrumented, with temperature probes buried at different depths. Underground temperatures were measured during summer 2019, and the hottest days of the period were analyzed. Results show that the less mineral used in the surface coating, the less it warms up. The temperature difference at the upper layer can reach 10 degrees C between mineral and non-mineral PLTs. PLTs can be grouped into three types: (i) high surface temperature during daytime and nighttime, important heat transfer toward the sublayers, and low time shift (asphalt system); (ii) high (resp. low) surface temperature during daytime (resp. nighttime), weak heat transfer toward the sublayers, and important time shift (paved stone system); and (iii) low surface temperature during daytime and nighttime, weak heat transfer toward the sublayers, and important time shift (vegetation and substrate system, wood chips system, vegetated urban soil). The results of this study underline that pervious pavements demonstrate thermal benefits under warm and dry summer conditions compared to conventional parking lot solutions. The results also indicate that the hygrothermal properties of urban materials are crucial for urban heat island mitigation.","[Bouzouidja, Ryad; Aketouane, Zakaria; Wu, Tingting Vogt; Lagiere, Philippe] Univ Bordeaux, I2M Bordeaux, CNRS UMR 5295, 351 Cours Liberat, F-33400 Talence, France; [Leconte, Francois; Colin, Baptiste; Petrissans, Anelie; Petrissans, Mathieu] Univ Lorraine, LERMaB, INRAE, F-88000 Epinal, France; [Kiss, Marton] Inst Ecol & Bot, Ctr Ecol Res, H-2163 Vacratot, Hungary; [Kiss, Marton] Univ Szeged, Dept Climatol & Landscape Ecol, 2 Egyet Str, H-6722 Szeged, Hungary; [Pierret, Margaux; Pruvot, Christelle; Detriche, Sebastien; Louvel, Brice] Univ Lille, Univ Artois, Lab Genie Civil & Geoenvironm, Junia,IMT Lille Douai,ULR 4515 LGCgE, F-59000 Lille, France; [Bertout, Julie] O2D Environm, 117 Rue Pierre Brizon, F-59810 Lesquin, France; [Goiffon, Remy] Ecole Natl Super Architecture & Paysage Bordeaux, Lab GRECCAU, 740 Cours Liberat,CS 70109, F-33405 Talence, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Engineering & Systems Sciences (INSIS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; INRAE; Universite de Lorraine; Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Centre for Ecological Research; Szeged University; IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; IMT Nord Europe; Universite d'Artois; Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille,"Leconte, F (corresponding author), Univ Lorraine, LERMaB, INRAE, F-88000 Epinal, France.",ryad.bouzouidja@gmail.com; francois.leconte@univ-lorraine.fr; kiss.marton@geo.u-szeged.hu; mpierret@jeunes-agriculteurs.fr; christelle.pruvot@junia.com; sebastien.detriche@junia.com; brice.louvel@junia.com; jbertout@o2d.fr; aketouane@gmail.com; tingting.vogt-wu@u-bordeaux.fr; remy.goiffon@bordeaux.archi.fr; baptiste.colin@univ-lorraine.fr; anelie.petrissans@univ-lorraine.fr; philippe.lagiere@u-bordeaux.fr; mathieu.petrissans@univ-lorraine.fr,"Pétrissans, Mathieu/GYJ-8037-2022; Bouzouidja, Ryad/AAS-8676-2021","Pétrissans, Mathieu/0000-0002-4749-8710; Detriche, Sebastien/0000-0001-9504-0168; Leconte, Francois/0000-0003-0167-822X; Ryad, Bouzouidja/0000-0001-8192-0308; VOGT-WU, Tingting/0000-0001-9752-9872; Louvel, Brice/0000-0001-6957-2611",ADEME under the initiative IPME [1782C0085],ADEME under the initiative IPME,"This research was funded by ADEME under the initiative IPME 2016 Eau & Milieux Aquatiques, grant number 1782C0085.",,56,5,5,3,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,AUG,2021,12,8,,,,,,,994,10.3390/atmos12080994,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos12080994,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,UF7WY,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000688782200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is often considered as a delta mostly exposed to sea-level rise and exacerbated by land subsidence, even if the local vertical land movement rates remain uncertain. Here, we reconstruct the water-level (WL) changes over 1968 to 2012, using an unprecedented set of 101 water-level gauges across the delta. Over the last 45 y, WL in the delta increased slightly faster (similar to 3 mm/y), than global mean sea level (similar to 2 mm/y). However, from 2005 onward, we observe an acceleration in the WL rise in the west of the delta. The interannual WL fluctuations are strongly modulated by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) variability, with WL lower than average by 30 to 60 cm during co-occurrent El Nino and positive IOD events and higher-than-average WL, by 16 to 35 cm, during La Nina years. Using satellite altimetry and WL reconstructions, we estimate that the maximum expected rates of delta subsidence during 1993 to 2012 range from 1 to 7 mm/y. By 2100, even under a greenhouse gas emission mitigation scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 4.5), the subsidence could double the projected sea-level rise, making it reach 85 to 140 cm across the delta. This study provides a robust regional estimate of contemporary relative WL changes in the delta induced by continental freshwater dynamics, vertical land motion, and sea-level rise, giving a basis for developing climate mitigation strategies.","[Becker, Melanie; Karpytchev, Mikhail; Ballu, Valerie] Univ La Rochelle, CNRS, Littoral Environm & Soc, F-17000 La Rochelle, France; [Papa, Fabrice; Delebecque, Caroline; Khan, Jamal Uddin; Durand, Fabien; Calmant, Stephane] Univ Toulouse Paul Sabatier, Lab Etud Geophys & Oceanog Spatiales, CNRS, Inst Rech Dev,Ctr Natl Etud Spatiales, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Papa, Fabrice] Indian Inst Sci, Int Joint Lab Inst Rech Dev & Indian Inst Sci, Indo French Cell Water Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; [Krien, Yann] Univ Antilles, Lab Rech Geosci & Energies, F-97159 Pointe A Pitre, France; [Khan, Jamal Uddin; Islam, A.

The success of the Ifugao Rice Terraces largely depends on the attunement of local farmers to their environment and their ability to adapt to perceived changes, as manifested in their complex body of traditional ecological and climatic knowledge. This paper examines the local perceptions on climate change and other challenges to sustainability through focus group discussions with farmers and traditional knowledge holders. Our main findings can be summarized as follows: (i) Ifugao farmers were able to observe climatic changes in recent years, and these changes were intimately linked with broader environmental and socio-cultural changes in the Ifugao social-ecological system; (ii) The climatic changes qualitatively observed by the farmers were in agreement with trends in datasets commonly used in scientific assessments, although this agreement depends on the spatial and temporal resolution of the dataset, and the type of statistical analysis performed, and; (iii) The Ifugaos stressed the importance of traditional knowledge and culture in climate change adaptation, and preferred measures which could increase internal adaptive capacity while addressing broader sources of community vulnerability. Our results support calls to recognize Indigenous and Western science as equally valid ways of knowing. Discussions with the farmers revealed that in the Ifugao context, climate change may be better framed in the context of multiple stressors on rural livelihoods, with adaptation integrated into broader development objectives. Our findings also emphasize the need for greater engagement of indigenous Ifugao people in planning processes in order to identify adaptation strategies that are culturally appropriate, equitable, and effective in responding to local needs.","[Soriano, Mario A., Jr.; Diwa, Johanna; Herath, Srikantha] United Nations Univ, Inst Adv Study Sustainabil, Shibuya Ku, 5-53-70 Jingumae, Tokyo 1508925, Japan; [Soriano, Mario A., Jr.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",United Nations University; Yale University,"Soriano, MA (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Adv Study Sustainabil, Shibuya Ku, 5-53-70 Jingumae, Tokyo 1508925, Japan.;Soriano, MA (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",mariojr.soriano@yale.edu; diwa@unu.edu; herath@unu.edu,,"Soriano, Mario/0000-0003-0499-9352; Diwa, Johanna/0000-0001-5042-1952",Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research [ARCP2011-13NMY-Herath],Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research,The authors extend their thanks to Engr.

These trends, which show a consistent pattern of a warming climate in Vermont during the past 50 yr, provide useful information for climate change adaptation planning for the state. The freeze period has become shorter and the growing season for frost-sensitive plants has become longer by about 3.7 (61.1) days decade 21, the date of the last spring freeze has come earlier by 2.3 (60.7) days decade 21, and the first autumn freeze has come later by 1.5 (60.8) days decade 21. The frozen period for small lakes, which depends on mean temperatures over longer periods, has decreased faster by 6.9 (61.5) days decade 21. Lake freeze-up has occurred later by 3.9 (61.1) days decade 21, while ice-out has come earlier by 2.9 (61.0) days decade 21. Lilac first leaf has also been coming earlier by 2.9 (60.8) days decade 21, while lilac first bloom has advanced more slowly, by 1.6 (60.6) days decade 21. The first leaf of Vermont lilacs, an indicator of early spring, is closely correlated with the ice-out of the small reference lake, Stile's Pond, because both are related to temperatures in February-April.

Unintended outcomes of climate adaptation strategies have been widely discussed, however, empirical exploration has been neglected. Grounded in scholarship on climate adaptation, environmental governance, social-ecological systems, and land-use change, this paper studies whether farmers' climate adaptation contributes to deforestation or forest conservation. The paper draws on interviews with 353 farmers from 46 communities in Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in Mexico and Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala. Farmers in the area of study have implemented adaptation strategies that people around the world have used for centuries, including migration, diversification, savings, and pooling. The findings show that climate adaptation can increase deforestation or support forest conservation depending on the type of adaptation strategy farmers implement. Saving, based on cattle ranching, is a deforestation-driving strategy. The choice of this strategy is influenced by distance to the commercial and administrative center and cash benefits from the forest. Deforestation can have a negative impact on farmers' welfare, as well as harm biodiversity and contribute to increased climate change. Thus, deforestation-driving adaptation strategies may be ineffective. However, diversification, based on off-farm jobs and operating provision shops, is a conservation-driving strategy influenced by distance as well as by family size. Farmers who choose diversification to adapt may contribute to a virtuous circle in which livelihood improvement in the short term leads to enhanced social-ecological resilience in the longer term. The need for farmers to implement adaptation strategies thus represents great risk but also opportunities.","[Rodriguez-Solorzano, Claudia] Dartmouth Coll, Environm Studies Program, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Rodriguez-Solorzano, Claudia] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Dartmouth College; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Rodriguez-Solorzano, C (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Environm Studies Program, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",,"Solorzano, Claudia Rodriguez/G-8817-2011",,"Mexican National Council of Science and Technology (CONACyt); National Science Foundation, University of Michigan; Ostrom Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University; Center for US-Mexican Studies at University of California San Diego","Mexican National Council of Science and Technology (CONACyt)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); National Science Foundation, University of Michigan; Ostrom Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University; Center for US-Mexican Studies at University of California San Diego","Funding for this research was provided by Mexican National Council of Science and Technology (CONACyt), the National Science Foundation, University of Michigan, the Ostrom Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University, and the Center for US-Mexican Studies at University of California San Diego.

Most of the studies investigating land use changes in the U.S. have not considered potential spatial effects explicitly. We used a two-step linearized multinomial logit to examine the impacts of various factors on conterminous U.S. land use changes including spatial lag coefficients. The estimation results show that the spatial dependences have existed for cropland, pastureland, and grasslands with a negative dependence on forests but weakened in most of the land uses except for croplands. Temperature and precipitation were found to have nonlinear impacts on the land use shares in the succeeding years by exerting opposite effects on crop versus pasture/grass shares. We also predicted land use changes under different climate change scenarios. The simulation results imply that the southern regions of the U.S. would lose cropland shares with further severity under the business-as-usual climate scenarios, while the land use shares for pasture/grass and forest would increase in those regions. As land use plays an important role in the climate system and vice versa, the results from this study may help policymakers tackle climate-driven land use changes and farmers adapt to climate change.","[Cho, Sung Ju] Jeju Natl Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Jeju Si 63243, South Korea; [McCarl, Bruce] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Jeju National University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Cho, SJ (corresponding author), Jeju Natl Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Jeju Si 63243, South Korea.",sjcho@jejunu.ac.kr; mccarl@tamu.edu,"McCarl, Bruce A/E-9445-2011","Cho, Sung Ju/0000-0003-3059-392X",,,,,49,4,4,7,22,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,MAY,2021,10,5,,,,,,,546,10.3390/land10050546,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land10050546,,,16,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,SH5TN,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000654198700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Achieving sustainability and resilience through nature-based solutions is an important means for cities and communities across the globe to take climate action and experiment with new forms governance, infrastructure, and planning and design. In this paper, I map the academic research structure of nature-based solutions and find that issues of social and environmental justice remain peripheral. To center justice in research and practice, I argue for a re-orientation towards just nature-based solutions-approaches that utilize the power of nature and people to transform the social, political, and economic drivers of socio-spatial inequality and environmental degradation into opportunities to create progressive, cohesive, antiracist, and social-ecologically sustainable communities. Based on the findings of the literature review and bibliometric analysis, I propose three pathways for just nature-based solutions: (1) race and class; (2) transformative co-production; and (3) value articulations. These starting points link to current principles in nature-based solutions and help bring clarity for scholars, activists, and planners on how to critically engage with the politics of environmental governance and decision-making.","[Cousins, Joshua J.] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm Studies, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry,"Cousins, JJ (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm Studies, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",jcousins@esf.edu,,,,,,,144,38,39,23,127,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Digital information technologies, such as the Internet, mobile phones and social media, provide vast amounts of data for decision-making and resource management. The Data Poverty Index (DPI) provides an open-source means of annually evaluating global access to data and information. The DPI can be used to monitor aspects of data and information availability at global and national levels, with potential application at local (district) levels. Access to data and information is a major factor in disaster risk reduction, increased resilience to disaster and improved adaptation to climate change. In that context, the DPI could be a useful tool for monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030). The effects of severe data poverty, particularly limited access to geoinformatic data, free software and online training materials, are discussed in the context of sustainable development and disaster risk reduction.

In the context of local scale coastal management in north-western Europe, challenges to problem detection and identification are exacerbated by the diffuse nature of administrative, sectoral, and legal rights and other professional governance obligations. Yet, if adaptation is to progress in a manner that is both locally legitimate and in accord with national policies, climate signals must be detected and climate impact problems framed in similar ways by two key groups; local scale 'bottom-up' experts and decision makers, and national scale 'top-down' scientists and policy makers. With reference to case study sites in Ireland and Scotland, we employ participatory modelling with coastal stakeholders using Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) to trial its potential in measuring and assessing stakeholder perceptions of climate vulnerability both individually and collectively. We found that FCM not only offers insight into the existing detection and framing of climate signals in coastal decision making but also provides a structured communication platform from which climate problems might be coherently integrated into future coastal management deliberations as the adaptation process matures.

In this small Inuvialuit community, we interviewed all of the 16 community members and elders considered to be local experts on sea ice to ask about their observations. We organized their comments under the headings multiyear ice, first-year ice, fractures and pressure ridges, breakup and freeze-up seasons, and other climate-related variables that influence sea ice (such as changes in winter, spring and summer temperatures, wind, rain, and thunderstorms). Observations were remarkably consistent in providing evidence of local change in such variables as multiyear ice distribution, first-year ice thickness, and ice breakup dates. The changes observed in the 1990s were said to be without precedent and outside the normal range of variation. In assessing the relevance of Inuvialuit knowledge to scientific research on climate change, we note some of the areas in which sharing of information between the two systems of knowledge may be mutually beneficial.

Another regional trend is the feminization of agriculture or an increase in women's work and decision-making in agriculture. Scholars have recently linked these two phenomena, demonstrating that agrarian distress results in the movement of men out of agriculture, driving women into the sector. Yet what remains underexplored is the relationship between climate change, a contributor to agrarian distress, and the feminization of agriculture. To examine this, we link socioeconomic and demographic data from India, Bangladesh, and Nepal to high-resolution gridded climate data. We then estimate a set of multivariate regression models to explore linkages between recent temperature and precipitation variability from historical norms and the likelihood that a woman works in agriculture. Results suggest that hotter-than-normal conditions in the year prior to the survey are associated with an increased likelihood of working in agriculture among women. This relationship is particularly strong among married women and women with less than primary education. While more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms between climate change and the feminization of agriculture, our findings suggest a need for gender-sensitive climate change adaptation strategies.","[Southard, Emily M.

A continental assessment of exposure of 284 African heritage sites shows that 20% of sites are currently at risk, which more than triples under moderate and high emission scenarios. The African coast contains heritage sites of 'Outstanding Universal Value' that face increasing risk from anthropogenic climate change. Here, we generated a database of 213 natural and 71 cultural African heritage sites to assess exposure to coastal flooding and erosion under moderate (RCP 4.5) and high (RCP 8.5) greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Currently, 56 sites (20%) are at risk from a 1-in-100-year coastal extreme event, including the iconic ruins of Tipasa (Algeria) and the North Sinai Archaeological Sites Zone (Egypt). By 2050, the number of exposed sites is projected to more than triple, reaching almost 200 sites under high emissions. Emissions mitigation from RCP 8.5 to RCP 4.5 reduces the number of very highly exposed sites by 25%. These findings highlight the urgent need for increased climate change adaptation for heritage sites in Africa, including governance and management approaches, site-specific vulnerability assessments, exposure monitoring, and protection strategies.","[Vousdoukas, Michalis, I] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Seville, Spain; [Clarke, Joanne] Univ East Anglia, Sch Art Media & Amer Studies, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Ranasinghe, Roshanka; Duong, Trang Minh] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Dept Coastal & Urban Risk & Resilience, Delft, Netherlands; [Ranasinghe, Roshanka; Duong, Trang Minh] Univ Twente, Water Engn & Management, Enschede, Netherlands; [Ranasinghe, Roshanka; Duong, Trang Minh] Deltares, Harbour Coastal & Offshore Engn, Delft, Netherlands; [Reimann, Lena] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Khalaf, Nadia] Univ Exeter, Inst Arab & Islamic Studies, Exeter, Devon, England; [Ouweneel, Birgitt; Trisos, Christopher H.; Simpson, Nicholas P.] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa; [Sabour, Salma] Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Phys Sci, Southampton, Hants, England; [Iles, Carley E.] Ctr Int Climate Res, Oslo, Norway; [Iles, Carley E.] Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, LSCE IPSL, CEA CNRS UVSQ, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Trisos, Christopher H.] Univ Cape Town, Ctr Stat Ecol Environm & Conservat, Cape Town, South Africa; [Feyen, Luc] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Ispra, Italy; [Mentaschi, Lorenzo] Univ Bologna, Dept Phys & Astron Augusto Righi DIFA, Bologna, Italy",University of East Anglia; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; University of Twente; Deltares; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Exeter; University of Cape Town; University of Southampton; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Cape Town; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of Bologna,"Vousdoukas, MI (corresponding author), European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Seville, Spain.;Simpson, NP (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa.",Michail.VOUSDOUKAS@ec.europa.eu; nick.simpson@uct.ac.za,"Simpson, Nick/AAC-4578-2022; Ranasinghe, Roshanka/C-6711-2009; Vousdoukas, Michalis/C-6743-2012","Simpson, Nick/0000-0002-9041-982X; Ranasinghe, Roshanka/0000-0001-6234-2063; Clarke, Joanne/0000-0002-7954-6561; Sabour, Salma/0000-0003-2697-2994; Khalaf, Nadia/0000-0001-6344-6307; Trisos, Christopher/0000-0002-5854-1489; Vousdoukas, Michalis/0000-0003-2655-6181; Reimann, Lena/0000-0002-9405-9147","AXA Research Fund; UK government's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada [109419 - 001]; African Academy of Sciences; Royal Society - UK government's Global Challenges Research Fund; Mapping Africa's Endangered Archaeological Sites and Monuments project - Arcadia Fund, UK; Leverhulme Trust Doctoral Training Scheme, UK","AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund); UK government's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada(CGIAR); African Academy of Sciences; Royal Society - UK government's Global Challenges Research Fund; Mapping Africa's Endangered Archaeological Sites and Monuments project - Arcadia Fund, UK; Leverhulme Trust Doctoral Training Scheme, UK","R.R. is partially supported by the AXA Research Fund.

Here, we identified possible interventions (termed adaptation options) from published literature, aimed at supporting social or ecological resilience and/or aiding adaptation to changes induced by environmental or social stressors. Our searches centered on nations/regions across North America, Europe, and the South Pacific, encompassing fisheries literature with and without a climate change focus, to compare how, when, and by whom interventions are currently or potentially implemented. We expected that adaptation options within a climate change context would have a greater focus on enhancing social resilience due to a connection with climate change adaptation assessment methodology. Instead, we found a greater focus on ecological resilience, likely indicating a focus on management adaptation. This pattern, along with the more extensive use of social adaptation options responsively and outside the context of climate change, along with an importance in bottom-up influences in implementing them, suggests a general lack of centralized planning and organization with regards to adaptation of stakeholders. Determining how adaptation options are created, chosen, and implemented is a crucial step within or external to ecosystem-based management, especially if planned stakeholder adaption is the goal.","[Woods, P.

Using survey data collected in Guinea in 2012, the paper investigates the factors affecting households' strategies to face adverse climate change impacts. A three-step methodology is applied: (1) assessment of the magnitude of real climatic trends in the study area together with farmers' perception of climate change; (2) identification of physical and socioeconomic variables influencing farmers' adaptation propensity; and (3) analysis of factors affecting adaptation choices, including climate change perception. The climatic data analysis confirms increase in minimum and maximum temperature trends, increase in annual average millimeters of rain, and decrease in average number of storms per year. Farmers' perception of climate change turned out to be aligned with historical climatic trends and represents an important determinant for the adoption of adaptation strategies. The regression model results suggest that the propensity to adapt is positively influenced by the level of education and a limited access to water resources and agricultural inputs, forcing households to adopt new cropping calendars. Effective policy action should consider different areas, including climate change awareness, education, access to natural and physical assets, and availability of economic resources to local communities.","[Ceci, Paolo] RBG Kew, Nat Capital & Plant Hlth Dept NCPH, Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond, W Sussex, England; [Monforte, Lavinia] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Off Evaluat OED, Rome, Italy; [Perelli, Chiara; Branca, Giacomo; Franco, Silvio] Univ Tuscia, Dept Econ Engn Soc & Business Org DEIM, Via Paradiso 47, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [Cicatiello, Clara; Blasi, Emanuele; Mugnozza, Giuseppe Scarascia] Univ Tuscia, Dept Innovat Biol Agrofood & Forest Syst DIBAF, Viterbo, Italy; [Diallo, Fatoumata Binta Sombily] Univ Gamal Abdel Nasser Conakry UGANC, Ctr Etud & Rech Environm CERE, Conakry, Guinea","Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); Tuscia University; Tuscia University","Perelli, C (corresponding author), Univ Tuscia, Dept Econ Engn Soc & Business Org DEIM, Via Paradiso 47, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy.",chiara.perelli@unitus.it,,,"Fouta Djallon Highlands Integrated Natural Resources Management Project [EP/INT/503/GEF]; Water and Mountains Team, Forestry Department","Fouta Djallon Highlands Integrated Natural Resources Management Project; Water and Mountains Team, Forestry Department","Fouta Djallon Highlands Integrated Natural Resources Management Project, Grant/Award Number: (EP/INT/503/GEF); Water and Mountains Team, Forestry Department",,48,2,2,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The BRI has grown from its basis as a vision of interregional connectivity into a truly global system, encompassing places-including many island states, territories, and cities-from the South Pacific to the Arctic, from East Africa to the Caribbean, from the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean. Islands and archipelagos are particularly prominent in the BRI's constituent 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road (MSR) and Polar Silk Road or Ice Silk Road projects, but little scholarly attention has been paid to how the BRI relates to islands per se. This special section of Island Studies Journal includes nine papers on islands and the BRI, concerning such diverse topics as geopolitics, international law and territorial disputes, sustainability and climate change adaptation, international relations of autonomous island territories, development of outer island communities, tourism and trade, and relational understandings of archipelagic networks.

We suggest that the PARA framework, first developed for climate change adaptation planning in communities facing sea level rise, is also a useful framework for flood risk reduction and flood resilience. The paper reviews four case studies of Canadian flood disaster risk reduction, with each case chosen to represent one of the four PARA risk reduction options. The extensive network of dikes and pumping stations employed in British Columbia's Lower Mainland (Fraser River) is used in the paper as an example of a protect approach to flood risk reduction; Winnipeg, Manitoba's Basement Flood Relief Program is used to highlight the accommodate approach; zoning changes and land expropriation following Toronto, Ontario's 1954 Hurricane Hazel flood disaster are used to showcase the retreat approach; and, modern floodplain development planning approaches in Calgary, Alberta are used to highlight the avoid approach. Overall, this paper contends that the PARA framework can be an effective approach for comprehensive flood disaster risk reduction and flood resilience; however, contextual factors, including equity considerations, should guide its application in situ.","[Doberstein, Brent; Mitchell, Carrie] Univ Waterloo, Fac Environm, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Fitzgibbons, Joanne; Mitchell, Carrie] Univ Waterloo, Fac Environm, Sch Planning, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo,"Doberstein, B (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Fac Environm, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",bdoberst@uwaterloo.ca,,"Fitzgibbons, Joanne/0000-0002-8926-7945; Doberstein, Brent/0000-0001-8891-7400",,,,,101,26,26,6,51,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

Especially heat waves occur accumulatively and the mortality rates have rapidly increased in recent years. Therefore, the government established climate change adaptation plans (CCAPs) to strengthen adaptability. However, there are various barriers that hamper implementing CCAPs and are a lack of study about reducing the barriers. Therefore, this study researched about cooling centers which is one of facilities that improving adaptability in Jung-gu, Seoul. This study evaluated the suitability of cooling centers with the adequacy of cooling centers' location and the capacity of cooling centers by comparing with the elderly population in service area. First of all, field survey was conducted. Service area and accessibility of elderly were deduced from the survey. Secondly, network analysis was done to analyze geographic suitability of cooling centers. Lastly, capacity suitability was investigated by using population in service area and compared with the capacities of each cooling centers. As a result, the service area is average 15 min and 20% of elderly people are living in unsuitable area for using cooling centers in Jung-gu area. Exact guideline should be suggested and more cooling center should be established to improve use of cooling center and increase adaptability.","[Ahn, Yoonjung] Florida State Univ, Dept Geog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Chae, Yeora] Korea Environm Inst, Sejong, South Korea",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Korea Environment Institute (KEI),"Ahn, Y (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Geog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",yoonjungaa@gmail.com; yrchae@kei.re.kr,,,Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program [KMI2018-01410],Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program(Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)),This work was funded by the Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program under Grant KMI(KMI2018-01410).,,28,4,4,0,3,SPRINGER SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"#04-01 CENCON I, 1 TANNERY RD, SINGAPORE 347719, SINGAPORE",2366-3286,2366-3294,,SPAT INF RES,Spat.

The analysis takes into account national end-use data from the residential and tertiary sector that had not been exploited up to now. Four final energy demand scenarios with diverging assumptions were defined in this study, offering a wide range of possible outcomes up to 2040; in addition, four alternative scenarios were applied for sensitivity analysis. Two of these scenarios can be regarded as those continuing the trends of the recent past in Cyprus (prior to the economic and financial downturn of years 2011-2014). However, a more rigorous implementation of energy efficiency measures in buildings and transport, as defined in the fourth scenario of this study, is also realistic; despite its potential costs, it might allow Cyprus both to decrease its carbon emissions in line with the long-term EU decarbonisation targets, and to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, thereby promoting energy efficiency as an important climate change adaptation measure.

As one of the important emission sources of greenhouse gases (GHG), the industrial sector should be prioritized in the development of low-carbon economy. In this study, the carbon emission from industrial energy use of Chongqing is accounted. On basis of industrial carbon emission ( ICE) accounting, main factors responsible for industrial CO2 emission are identified and quantitatively analyzed using the Log-Mean Divisia Index method. The factors influencing ICE include energy mix, energy intensity, industrial structure and industrial output. It is found that the industrial output is the main driving force of ICE. The energy structure performs as a negative factor in carbon emission growth. By means of decomposing the influencing factors, several policy proposals were suggested for policy makers to build a low carbon city.","[Yang, Jin; Chen, Bin] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Sch Environm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Chen, B (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Sch Environm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",Chenb@bnu.edu.cn,"Chen, Bin/A-6951-2012; Yang, Jin/G-3184-2017","Chen, Bin/0000-0002-5488-6850; ","Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University [NCET-09-0226]; National High Technology Research and Development Program of China [2009AA06A419]; Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation [50939001]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [40701023, 40901269]",Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)); National High Technology Research and Development Program of China(National High Technology Research and Development Program of China); Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET-09-0226), the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (No. 2009AA06A419), Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation (No. 50939001), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 40701023 and 40901269).",,22,31,31,1,61,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2095-0195,,,FRONT EARTH SCI-PRC,Front.

Recently, researchers have applied the idea to contemporary landscapes to identify climate change refugia, here defined as areas relatively buffered from contemporary climate change over time that enable persistence of valued physical, ecological, and socio-cultural resources. We differentiate historical and contemporary views, and characterize physical and ecological processes that create and maintain climate change refugia. We then delineate how refugia can fit into existing decision support frameworks for climate adaptation and describe seven steps for managing them. Finally, we identify challenges and opportunities for operationalizing the concept of climate change refugia. Managing climate change refugia can be an important option for conservation in the face of ongoing climate change.","[Morelli, Toni Lyn] US Geol Survey, DOI Northeast Climate Sci Ctr, Amherst, MA 01002 USA; [Morelli, Toni Lyn; Maher, Sean P.; Beissinger, Steven R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Morelli, Toni Lyn; Maher, Sean P.; Beissinger, Steven R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Vertebrate Zool, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Daly, Christopher] Oregon State Univ, Coll Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Dobrowski, Solomon Z.] Univ Montana, Coll Forestry & Conservat, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Dulen, Deanna M.] Natl Pk Serv, Devils Postpile Natl Monument, Mammoth Lakes, CA 93546 USA; [Ebersole, Joseph L.] US EPA, Western Ecol Div, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA; [Jackson, Stephen T.] US Geol Survey, DOI Southwest Climate Sci Ctr, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Jackson, Stephen T.] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Jackson, Stephen T.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Lundquist, Jessica D.] Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Millar, Constance I.] USDA Forest Serv, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, Albany, CA 94710 USA; [Maher, Sean P.] Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, Springfield, MO 65897 USA; [Monahan, William B.] USDA Forest Serv, Forest Hlth Technol Enterprise Team, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Nydick, Koren R.] Natl Pk Serv, Sequoia & Kings Canyon Natl Pk, Three Rivers, CA USA; [Redmond, Kelly T.] Desert Res Inst, Western Reg Climate Ctr, Reno, NV 89506 USA; [Sawyer, Sarah C.] USDA Forest Serv, Pacific Southwest Reg, Vallejo, CA 94592 USA; [Stock, Sarah] Natl Pk Serv, Yosemite Natl Pk, El Portal, CA 95318 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Oregon State University; University of Montana System; University of Montana; United States Department of the Interior; United States Environmental Protection Agency; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Missouri State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of the Interior; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); Desert Research Institute NSHE; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of the Interior,"Morelli, TL (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, DOI Northeast Climate Sci Ctr, Amherst, MA 01002 USA.;Morelli, TL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Morelli, TL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Vertebrate Zool, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",tmorelli@usgs.gov,"Dobrowski, Solomon Z/Q-7132-2019; Ebersole, Joseph/AAT-5862-2020; Maher, Sean/V-7553-2017","Dobrowski, Solomon Z/0000-0003-2561-3850; Ebersole, Joseph/0000-0003-1050-1995; Jackson, Stephen/0000-0002-1487-4652; Maher, Sean/0000-0002-3430-0410; Morelli, Toni Lyn/0000-0001-5865-5294",California Landscape Conservation Cooperative; Department of Interior Northeast Climate Science Center,California Landscape Conservation Cooperative; Department of Interior Northeast Climate Science Center,"This work was supported by funding from the California Landscape Conservation Cooperative (www.californialcc.org) and the Department of Interior Northeast Climate Science Center (necsc.umass.edu).

Managed retreat, or planned relocation, is a proactive response prior to catastrophic necessity. Managed retreat has disruptive health, sociocultural, and economic impacts on communities that relocate. Health impacts include mental health, social capital, food security, water supply, sanitation, infectious diseases, injury, and health care access. We searched peer-reviewed and gray literature for reports on small island or coastal communities at various stages of relocation primarily due to sea level rise. We reviewed these reports to identify public health impacts and barriers to relocation. We identified eight relevant small communities in the USA (Alaska, Louisiana, and Washington), Panama, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. Affected populations range from 60 to 2700 persons and are predominantly indigenous people who rely on subsistence fishing and agriculture. Few reports directly addressed public health issues. While some relocations were successful, barriers to relocation in other communities include place attachment, potential loss of livelihoods, and lack of funding, suitable land, community consensus, and governance procedures. Further research is needed on the health impacts of managed retreat and how to facilitate population resilience. Studies could include surveillance of health indicators before and after communities relocate due to sea level rise, drought, or other environmental hazards. Lessons learned may inform relocation of both small and large communities affected by climate change.","[Dannenberg, Andrew L.; Frumkin, Howard; Hess, Jeremy J.; Ebi, Kristie L.] Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Hlth & Global Environm, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Frumkin, Howard] Wellcome Trust Res Labs, London, England",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Dannenberg, AL (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Hlth & Global Environm, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",adannenberg2@gmail.com; h.frumkin@wellcome.ac.uk; jjhess@uw.edu; krisebi@uw.edu,"Frumkin, Howard/G-5640-2016","Frumkin, Howard/0000-0001-7079-3534; Dannenberg, Andrew L./0000-0001-8250-4509",,,,,55,65,65,3,81,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Substantial winter warming over the TP will likely lead, directly or indirectly, to a series of geological disasters such as snow and glacial avalanches. Hence, for better adaptation to climate change, it is vital to project the future change in winter temperature over the TP. However, the current state-of-the-art climate models involved in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) still produce strong cold biases over most parts of the TP in their historical simulations. On the basis of selecting the optimal models, here we use the statistical downscaling method to constrain the projected winter temperature in CMIP6 models. The results show that the regions with the strongest winter warming over the TP will be near the Himalayas and the densely populated eastern regions. The constrained warming magnitude is much greater than that in the ensemble mean of the original 32 CMIP6 models or six best models over these regions. Therefore, early warning and forecasting services should be strengthened for the future temperature over these regions. Moreover, the long-term spatial warming varies greatly under four different future emission scenarios. Under the most severe scenario, the increase in winter temperature near the Himalayas exceeds 10 degrees C, which will greatly destabilize glaciers in the region, while the increase is only 4 degrees C-6 degrees C under the weakest scenario. Therefore, it is urgent to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to control the future temperature increase at hotspots of climate vulnerability such as the TP.","[Peng, Yuzhuo; Duan, Anmin; Hu, Wenting; Tang, Bin; Li, Xinyu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Peng, Yuzhuo; Duan, Anmin; Hu, Wenting; Tang, Bin; Li, Xinyu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Duan, Anmin] Xiamen Univ, Coll Ocean & Earth Sci, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xianyi] Inst Atmospher Composit, State Key Lab Severe Weather LASW, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xianyi] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Xiamen University; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS)","Duan, AM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Duan, AM (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Duan, AM (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Coll Ocean & Earth Sci, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",amduan@lasg.iap.ac.cn,,"Peng, Yuzhuo/0000-0002-2606-6986","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19070404]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41725018, 91937302]",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA19070404) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41725018 and 91937302).,,70,5,5,25,59,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

Using the dynamical downscaling performed by the regional climate model RegCM4 from four global climate models, this study firstly evaluated the fidelity of the RegCM4 simulations on the mean and extreme aspects of autumn rainfall in West China, and then projected their changes during the middle and the end of the 21st century under the RCP4.5 scenario. The evaluations indicate a good performance of the RegCM4 downscaling simulations in reproducing the observed spatial distribution of autumn rainfall amount, wet days, maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation (RX5day), total extremely wet-day precipitation (R95p), and consecutive dry days (CDD). Under the RCP4.5 scenario, relative to 1986-2005, the amount of autumn rainfall and the frequency of wet days are projected to increase in the northwestern part of West China and to decrease in its southeastern flank, concurrent with greater changes by the end of the 21st century than by the middle of the 21st century. Such an increase is closely associated with the enhancement of zonal water vapour transport and atmospheric unstable stratification, while the projected decrease is largely related to the reduction of moisture supply. Similar changes are also projected for the precipitation extremes Rx5day and R95p. Corresponding to the changing pattern of autumn rainfall, the CDD is projected to decrease in the northwestern part and to increase in the southeastern part of West China.","[Zhou, Botao] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Collaborat Innovat Ctr, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Botao; Wu, Jia; Xu, Ying; Han, Zhenyu; Shi, Ying] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; China Meteorological Administration,"Wu, J (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wujia@cma.gov.cn,"HAN, Zhenyu/AAD-6731-2019; Wu, Jia/C-8393-2013","HAN, Zhenyu/0000-0002-2452-527X; zhou, Botao/0000-0002-5995-2378","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41675069]; National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFA0606301, 2017YFA0605004, 2016YFA0600701]; Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals; National Key Research and Development Program of China; Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41675069; National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals; Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST; National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 2018YFA0606301, 2017YFA0605004, 2016YFA0600701; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41675069",,45,12,14,5,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Socioeconomic, demographic, health, land cover, and temperature determinants contribute to heat vulnerability; however, nationwide patterns of residential and race/ethnicity disparities in heat vulnerability in the United States are poorly understood. This study aimed to develop a Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) for the United States; to assess differences in heat vulnerability across geographies that have experienced historical and/or contemporary forms of marginalization; and to quantify HVI by race/ethnicity. Principal component analysis was used to calculate census tract level HVI scores based on the 2019 population characteristics of the United States. Differences in HVI scores were analyzed across the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) redlining grades, the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) disadvantaged versus non-disadvantaged communities, and race/ethnicity groups. HVI scores were calculated for 55,267 U.S. census tracts. Mean HVI scores were 17.56, 18.61, 19.45, and 19.93 for HOLC grades A-D, respectively. CEJST-defined disadvantaged census tracts had a significantly higher mean HVI score (19.13) than non-disadvantaged tracts (16.68). The non-Hispanic African American or Black race/ethnicity group had the highest HVI score (18.51), followed by Hispanic or Latino (18.19). Historically redlined and contemporary CEJST disadvantaged census tracts and communities of color were found to be associated with increased vulnerability to heat. These findings can help promote equitable climate change adaptation policies by informing policymakers about the national distribution of place- and race/ethnicity-based disparities in heat vulnerability.","[Manware, Mitchell] Yale Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Social & Behav Sci, New Haven, CT USA; [Manware, Mitchell; Dubrow, Robert; Carrion, Daniel; Ma, Yiqun; Chen, Kai] Yale Sch Publ Hlth, Yale Ctr Climate Change & Hlth, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Dubrow, Robert; Carrion, Daniel; Ma, Yiqun; Chen, Kai] Yale Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, New Haven, CT 06510 USA",Yale University; Yale University; Yale University,"Chen, K (corresponding author), Yale Sch Publ Hlth, Yale Ctr Climate Change & Hlth, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.;Chen, K (corresponding author), Yale Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.",kai.chen@yale.edu,"chen, kai/Y-2226-2018","chen, kai/0000-0002-0164-1112",Yale Planetary Solutions Project seed grant; High Tide Foundation,Yale Planetary Solutions Project seed grant; High Tide Foundation,We gratefully acknowledge support from the Yale Planetary Solutions Project seed grant and the High Tide Foundation.,,91,0,0,0,0,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2471-1403,,,GEOHEALTH,GeoHealth,DEC,2022,6,12,,,,,,,e2022GH000695,10.1029/2022GH000695,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022GH000695,,,14,"Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",8O5RL,,"Green Accepted, gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000925892700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate change projections for the near future (2017-2044), medium (2045-2072), and long-term (2073-2100) using a multi-model set average of fifteen regional climate models under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. Water availability, allocation, and demand for irrigation and hydropower generation were pre-dicted using the coupled Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) hydrological models. New hydrological insights for the region: The projected annual average temperature increase range is 2.10-3.6 C under RCP 4.5 emission scenarios while 2.7-4.8 C under RCP 8.5. Under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 emissions scenarios, projected annual average precipitation declines ranged from 10.7-13.6 % and 11.1-13.8 %, respectively. Projected annual average declines in streamflow ranged from 7.0 % to 10.9 % under PCR 4.5 emissions scenarios, while 10.9-2.8 % under PCR 8.5. As a consequence, water shortages for irrigation may decrease by 15.5-25.4 % and hydroelec-tricity by 10.5-20.2 % during study periods. Due to the combined effect of climate change and rising water demand, the increase in water scarcity ranges from 7.9-30.6 %. The projected results showed that future water availability for irrigation and hydropower generation will decline in the future. Climate change adaptation options are needed to ensure future water availability for hydropower generation and irrigation.","[Orkodjo, Tamiru Paulos] Arba Minch Univ, Inst Arba Minch Water Technol, Fac Hydraul & Water Resource Engn, Arba Minch, Ethiopia; [Kranjac-Berisavijevic, Gordana] UDS, Fac Agr & Consumer Sci, Dept Agr Mechanisat & Irrigat Technol, POB 1882, Nyankpala, Ghana; [Abagale, Felix K.] Univ Dev Studies, Sch Engn, Dept Environm Water & Waste Engn, Tamale, Ghana",Arba Minch University; University for Development Studies,"Orkodjo, TP (corresponding author), Arba Minch Univ, Inst Arba Minch Water Technol, Fac Hydraul & Water Resource Engn, Arba Minch, Ethiopia.",tamirupaulos@gmail.com; novagordanak@gmail.com; fabagale@uds.edu.gh,,,,,,,163,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2214-5818,,J HYDROL-REG STUD,J.

Therefore, this study assessed the impact of climate change on wheat-maize rotation areas in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain (3H Plain). The projections generated suggest an increase in precipitation during the wheat growth period (WGP) by 1.33-4.16% (2.6-8.3 mm) and 3.13-8.16% (6.2-18.0 mm) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, relative to the base period (1981-2016). Across the 3H Plain, the mean temperature during the WGP is projected to increase between 1.17-1.21 and 1.17-1.28 degrees C under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. The projections during the maize growth period (MGP) indicate an increase in the temperature between 1.29-1.92 and 1.84-2.08 degrees C under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. During the MGP, precipitation is also projected to increase by 7.41-9.73% (33.6-45.1 mm) and 6.63-14.78% (29.8-72.7 mm) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. For each 1% change in climatic factors, the comprehensive effect on yield was projected to be 0.65 and 0.58% for wheat and -1.08 and -1.11% for maize, under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, when other factors were kept constant. The change in water resources will be insignificant during the WGP and more pronounced during the MGP.

Of particular need for decision makers is the availability of spatial and temporal variability of runoff projections. Here, with the aid of a spatially explicit hydrological model forced with precipitation and temperature projections from 25 global climate models (GCMs) under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios, we explore the variability in modeled runoff in the near future (2016-2035) and mid-century (2046-2065). We find that total runoff from the CRB is projected to increase by 5% [-9 %; 20 %] (mean - min and max - across model ensembles) over the next two decades and by 7% [-12 %; 24 %] by mid-century. Projected changes in runoff from subwatersheds distributed within the CRB vary in magnitude and sign. Over the equatorial region and in parts of northern and southwestern CRB, most models project an overall increase in precipitation and, subsequently, runoff. A simulated decrease in precipitation leads to a decline in runoff from headwater regions located in the northeastern and southeastern CRB. Climate model selection plays an important role in future projections for both magnitude and direction of change. The multimodel ensemble approach reveals that precipitation and runoff changes under business-as-usual and avoided greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP8.5 vs. RCP4.5) are relatively similar in the near term but deviate in the midterm, which underscores the need for rapid action on climate change adaptation. Our assessment demonstrates the need to include uncertainties in climate model and emission scenario selection during decision-making processes related to climate change mitigation and adaptation.","[Aloysius, Noel; Saiers, James] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Aloysius, Noel] Ohio State Univ, Dept Food Agr & Biol Engn, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Aloysius, Noel] Ohio State Univ, Aquat Ecol Lab, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Yale University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Aloysius, N (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.;Aloysius, N (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Food Agr & Biol Engn, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;Aloysius, N (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Aquat Ecol Lab, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",aloysius.1@osu.edu,"Aloysius, Noel/AAK-2438-2020","Aloysius, Noel/0000-0002-9094-427X",National Science Foundation [CNS 08-21132],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We would like to thank Nadine Laporte, Innocent Liengola, Peter Umunay, Greg Fiske and Melanie Burr for help with data and literature search.

Yet, the lack of reliable data on past events renders the implementation of appropriate adaptation policies a difficult task, and therefore also hampers the mitigation of future disasters. In an attempt to overcome these shortcomings, we combine reconstructed paleoflood events based on tree-ring analyses with existing systematic records, so as to derive a regional flood frequency. Analysis was realized with tree-ring records and through the dating of growth disturbances in riparian trees of major rivers in Kullu district (Himachal Pradesh, Indian Himalayas). To this end, we combined field-based observations, tree-ring analyses, hydraulic modelling and statistical approaches. Results suggest that the occurrence of floods in Kullu district is recurrent, with a marked seasonality and a cyclic natural variability in flood frequency at multidecadal scales, as well as distinct spatial representativeness. The inclusion of peak discharge data of past, previously ungauged, flood events derived from tree-ring records has a significant and positive impact on the flood frequency assessment. Flood hazards and associated risks have been clearly underestimated in the region and based on the systematic records alone. We also demonstrate that a regional flood frequency approach is suitable to optimize the information gathered from tree rings and that flood frequency can thus be analyzed for larger regions. The approach used in this paper can be implemented in the other, poorly gauged region and thus contribute to climate change adaptation policies in undocumented environments such as the Indian Himalayan Region.

This study examines the association between heavy rainfall and hospital admissions for IID in Ho Chi Minh City, the most populous city in Vietnam. An interrupted time-series method was used to examine the effect of each individual heavy rainfall event (HRE) on IID. The percentage changes in post-HRE level and trends of IID were estimated for 30 days following each HRE. Then a random-effect meta-analysis was used to quantify the pooled estimate of effect sizes of all HREs on IID. The pooled estimates were calculated over a 21 day lag period. The effects of a HRE on IID varied across individual HREs. The pooled estimates indicate that the levels of IID following a HRE increased from 73% to 13.5% for lags from 0 to 21 days, however statistically Significant increases were only observed for lags from 4 to 6 days (13.5%, 95%CI: 1.4-25.4; 133%, 95%Cl; 1.5-25.0; and 12.9%, 95%Cl: 1.6-24.1 respectively). An average decrease of 0.11% (95%CI: 0.55-033) per day was observed for the post-HRE trend. This finding has important implications for the projected impacts on residents living in this city which is highly vulnerable to increased heavy rainfall associated with climate change.

However, recent evidence suggests that the relationships between climate and tree growth are generally non-stationary (i.e. non-time stable), and it remains uncertain whether the relationships between climate, forest structure, demography and productivity are stationary or are being altered by recent climatic and structural changes. Here we analysed three surveys from the Spanish Forest Inventory coveringc. 30 years of information and we applied mixed and structural equation models to assess temporal trends in forest structure (stand density, basal area, tree size and tree size inequality), forest demography (ingrowth, growth and mortality) and above-ground forest productivity. We also quantified whether the interactive effects of climate and forest structure on forest demography and above-ground forest productivity were stationary over two consecutive time periods. Since the 1980s, density, basal area and tree size increased in Iberian forests, and tree size inequality decreased. In addition, we observed reductions in ingrowth and growth, and increases in mortality. Initial forest structure and water availability mainly modulated the temporal trends in forest structure and demography. The magnitude and direction of the interactive effects of climate and forest structure on forest demography changed over the two time periods analysed indicating non-stationary relationships between climate, forest structure and demography. Above-ground forest productivity increased due to a positive balance between ingrowth, growth and mortality. Despite increasing productivity over time, we observed an aggravation of the negative effects of climate change and increased competition on forest demography, reducing ingrowth and growth, and increasing mortality. Interestingly, our results suggest that the negative effects of climate change on forest demography could be ameliorated through forest management, which has profound implications for forest adaptation to climate change.","[Astigarraga, Julen; Zavala, Miguel A.; Cruz-Alonso, Veronica; Ruiz-Benito, Paloma] Univ Alcala, Dept Life Sci, Forest Ecol & Restorat Grp, Alcala De Henares, Spain; [Andivia, Enrique] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Biodivers Ecol & Evolut, Madrid, Spain; [Zavala, Miguel A.] Univ Alcala, Franklin Inst, Alcala De Henares, Spain; [Gazol, Antonio; Vicente-Serrano, Sergio M.] CSIC, Inst Pirena Ecol IPE, Zaragoza, Spain; [Cruz-Alonso, Veronica] Ctr Recerca Ecol & Aplicac Forestals, CREAF, Cerdanyola De Valles, Spain; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma] Univ Alcala, Dept Geol Geog & Environm, Environm Remote Sensing Grp, Alcala De Henares, Spain",Universidad de Alcala; Complutense University of Madrid; Universidad de Alcala; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Universidad de Alcala,"Astigarraga, J (corresponding author), Univ Alcala, Dept Life Sci, Forest Ecol & Restorat Grp, Alcala De Henares, Spain.",julenastigarraga@gmail.com,"Cruz, Veronica/AAA-9465-2021; Gazol, Antonio/B-7322-2015; Andivia, Enrique/B-3088-2017; Vicente-Serrano, Sergio M.

This report describes the results of a study to determine whether a community-based sentinel surveillance system can be developed and implemented to assess the health effects of climate change, and to contribute to local discussions to mitigate these health effects. The purpose of this report is to describe the process and outcomes of this innovative approach to identifying priority areas for adaptation investment. This report can be used to assist local, state and federal governments in determining how to develop actions and policies to promote adaptation to climate change. Objective. To evaluate the health effects of climate change in rural Alaska. Design. We conducted an iterative and participatory process to develop metrics, an instrument and a protocol to collect sentinel surveillance data on the health effects of climate change in 3 ecologically distinct regions of the state. Results. We collected surveillance data from 91 study participants over the course of 12 months. These data were analyzed and categorized by frequency and association between specific health outcomes or health-related factors (such as food security) and reported exposure to environmental effects of climate change. We found significant associations between several health outcomes and health outcome mediators and reported exposures. We presented these data to study participants in community settings and moderated discussions of likely causal factors for these measured associations, and helped community residents to identify specific adaption measures to mitigate those health effects. Conclusion. We conclude that community-based sentinel surveillance is an effective method for assessing health outcomes from exposure to environmental effects of climate change, and informing climate change health adaptation planning in Alaskan communities. We contend that it would be effective in other regions of the nation as well.","[Driscoll, David L.; Sunbury, Tenaya; Johnston, Janet] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Inst Circumpolar Hlth Studies, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Renes, Sue] Univ Alaska, Sch Educ, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Driscoll, DL (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Anchorage, 3211 Providence Dr,DPL 404, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",DDriscoll@uaa.alaska.edu,"Johnston, Janet/HGB-9980-2022","Johnston, Janet/0000-0001-8738-9677",NCHM CDC HHS [5U38HM000549-04] Funding Source: Medline,NCHM CDC HHS,,,13,7,7,0,5,CO-ACTION PUBLISHING,JARFALLA,"RIPVAGEN 7, JARFALLA, SE-175 64, SWEDEN",1239-9736,2242-3982,,INT J CIRCUMPOL HEAL,Int.

Less than 15% of the terrestrial precipitation takes the form of productive 'green' transpiration. Hence, rainwater harvesting and management (RWHM) technologies hold a significant potential for improving rainwater-use efficiency and sustaining rainfed agriculture in the region. This paper outlines the various RWHM techniques being practiced in SSA, and reviews recent research results on the performance of selected practices. So far, micro-catchment and in situ rainwater harvesting techniques are more common than rainwater irrigation techniques from macro-catchment systems. Depending on rainfall patterns and local soil characteristics, appropriate application of in situ and micro-catchment techniques could improve the soil water content of the rooting zone by up to 30%. Up to sixfold crop yields have been obtained through combinations of rainwater harvesting and fertiliser use, as compared to traditional practices. Supplemental irrigation of rainfed agriculture through rainwater harvesting not only reduces the risk of total crop failure due to dry spells, but also substantially improves water and crop productivity. Depending on the type of crop and the seasonal rainfall pattern, the application of RWHM techniques makes net profits more possible, compared to the meagre profit or net loss of existing systems. Implementation of rainwater harvesting may allow cereal-based smallholder farmers to shift to diversified crops, hence improving household food security, dietary status, and economic return. The much needed green revolution and adaptations to climate change in SSA should blend rainwater harvesting ideals with agronomic principles. More efforts are needed to improve the indigenous practices, and to disseminate best practices on a wider scale. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

General circulation model (GCM)-informed climate is commonly applied to assess the impact of climate change on hydropower. However, the effect of GCM credibility on hydropower robustness has been rarely explored. One objective of this study is to seek valuable and robust policies, and the other is to evaluate the effects of GCM credibility on hy-dropower robustness based on the pre-optimized operating policies. A multi-objective robust optimization approach is first proposed to design operating policies by coupling stochastic simulation, heuristic parameterized policy search, and robust optimization. The GCM credibility is then evaluated based on multi-criteria ranking scores, and the hydropower robustness is illustrated by stepwise culling the lowest credible GCMs. The climate -induced impacts on hydropower robustness rely on an ensemble of 18 GCMs under three representative con-centration pathways in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) and 17 GCMs under three shared socioeconomic pathways in CMIP6. The Longyangxia and Liujiaxia reservoirs in Upper Yellow River Basin are selected as a case study. The results show that (1) the proposed stochastic approach outperforms the deter-ministic approach regarding hydropower generation and firm output where the mean annual hydropower generation of stochastic operation is improved by -0.50-19.53% compared to deterministic operation, indicating that the operating rules derived using historical stochastic inflows can adapt flexibly to future inflow changes than that using deterministic inflow. (2) CMIP6 maintains a more robust performance than CMIP5 with higher satisficing measures and lower regret measures. (3) Hydropower robustness tends to be higher when considering credibility and will be lower with time due to increasing uncertainty. Ignorance of GCM credibility may lead to biased climate change adaptation decisions.","[Guo, Yuxue; Xu, Yue-Ping; Yu, Xinting; Xie, Jingkai] Zhejiang Univ, Inst Water Sci & Engn, Civil Engn, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China; [Chen, Hao] Zhejiang Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Coll Hydraul & Environm Engn, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Si, Yuan] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University of Water Resources and Electric Power; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research,"Xu, YP (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Inst Water Sci & Engn, Civil Engn, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China.",yuepingxu@zju.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [52009121, 52109037]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2021YFC3201100]; Basic Scientific Research Expense Project of IWHR [WE110145B0072021]; Yellow River Conservancy Commission of The Ministry of Water Resources",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Basic Scientific Research Expense Project of IWHR; Yellow River Conservancy Commission of The Ministry of Water Resources,"This research is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52009121, 52109037) the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC3201100) , and the Basic Scientific Research Expense Project of IWHR (WE110145B0072021) .

This study explores the precursory signals of summer SATs over the TP in oceanic and land boundary conditions. The results show that the summer eastern TP SAT is significantly correlated with three precursors in April: the high-latitude North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST), the northern Indian Ocean SST, and the Indian soil moisture (SM). The April SST anomalies (SSTAs) in the high-latitude North Atlantic can exert a cross-season impact on the summer SAT over the TP through two processes. The SSTAs in the high-latitude North Atlantic maintain from April to summer and modulate atmospheric circulation over the eastern TP through exciting a downstream wave train during summer, and finally modulate the summer SAT over the eastern TP. In addition to the above process, the April SSTAs in the high-latitude North Atlantic may remotely regulate simultaneous SM in the Indian subcontinent through stimulating a downstream wave train pattern. Through a persistent SM-precipitation interaction, the April Indian SM anomaly can affect the local precipitation and associated condensation heating anomalies during the ensuing summer, which forces an anomalous cyclone-anticyclone pattern around the TP and accordingly affects the summer SAT over the eastern TP. Additionally, the SSTAs in the northern Indian Ocean can persist from April to summer and adjust the intensity and location of the western North Pacific subtropical high through the Kelvin-wave-induced Ekman divergence during summer, eventually affecting the summer eastern TP SAT. The three precursory signals, which synergistically contribute to the variability of the summer eastern TP SAT, can be applied in predicting the summer SAT over the eastern TP.","[Wang, Huimei; Liu, Ge; He, Kejun] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Huimei; Liu, Ge] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Wang, Sai] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau & Polar Meteorol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS),"Liu, G (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Liu, G (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",hui_meiw@163.com; liuge@cma.gov.cn; wangs@cma.gov.cn; hekejn@163.com,,"Wang, Huimei/0000-0003-2486-9571",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1505706]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20100300]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program [2019QZKK0105]; Science and Technology Development Fund of CAMS [2019KJ022]; Basic Research Fund of CAMS [2019Z008],National Key Research and Development Program of China; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program; Science and Technology Development Fund of CAMS; Basic Research Fund of CAMS,"This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant 2018YFC1505706), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant XDA20100300), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program (Grant 2019QZKK0105), the Science and Technology Development Fund of CAMS (Grant 2019KJ022) and the Basic Research Fund of CAMS (Grant 2019Z008).",,54,4,4,3,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,FEB,2021,12,2,,,,,,,146,10.3390/atmos12020146,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos12020146,,,17,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,QN0CH,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000622138700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While the public health workforce is concerned about climate change, local health department (LHD) administrators have reported insufficient knowledge and resources to address climate change. Minigrants from state to LHDs have been used to promote a variety of local public health initiatives. Objective: To describe the minigrant approach used by state health departments implementing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) framework, to highlight successes of this approach in promoting climate change preparedness at LHDs, and to describe challenges encountered. Design: Cross-sectional survey and discussion. Intervention: State-level recipients of CDC funding issued minigrants to local public health entities to promote climate change preparedness, adaptation, and resilience. Main Outcome Measures: The amount of funding, number of LHDs funded per state, goals, selection process, evaluation process, outcomes, successes, and challenges of the minigrant programs. Results: Six state-level recipients of CDC funding for BRACE framework implementation awarded minigrants ranging from $7700 to $28 500 per year to 44 unique local jurisdictions. Common goals of the minigrants included capacity building, forging partnerships with entities outside of health departments, incorporating climate change information into existing programs, and developing adaptation plans. Recipients of minigrants reported increases in knowledge, engagement with diverse stakeholders, and the incorporation of climate change content into existing programs. Challenges included addressing climate change in regions where the topic is politically sensitive, as well as the uncertainty about the long-term sustainability of local projects beyond the term of minigrant support. Conclusions: Minigrants can increase local public health capacity to address climate change. Jurisdictions that wish to utilize minigrant mechanisms to promote climate change adaptation and preparedness at the local level may benefit from the experience of the 6 states and 44 local health programs described.","[Grossman, Elena; Hathaway, Michelle; Dorevitch, Samuel] Univ Illinois, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Environm & Occupat Hlth Sci, 2121 W Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Bush, Kathleen F.; Cahillane, Matthew] New Hampshire Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Div Publ Hlth Serv, Concord, NH 03301 USA; [English, Dorette Q.] Calif Dept Publ Hlth, Off Hlth Equ, Richmond, CA USA; [Holmes, Tisha] Florida State Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Uejio, Christopher K.] Florida State Univ, Dept Geog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Moran, Colleen E.] Wisconsin Dept Hlth Serv, Madison, WI USA; [York, Emily A.] Oregon Hlth Author, Portland, OR USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; California Department of Public Health; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Dorevitch, S (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Environm & Occupat Hlth Sci, 2121 W Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.",sdorevit@uic.edu,,"York, Emily/0000-0003-4857-724X",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC UE1 EH001045]; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA); Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA),"The authors were funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC UE1 EH001045) Climate-Ready States and Cities Initiative grant to implement the Building Resilience Against Climate Effects framework.; Since 2012, Samuel Dorevitch, MD, MPH, has directed Building Resilience Against Climate Effects in Illinois (BRACE-Illinois).

There is, however, a lack of empirical research on the value that regional organisations add to national health-related adaptation. This qualitative research compares regional project and governance-based models of adaptation and health support in Southeast Asia, providing an analysis of strengths and weaknesses of each, as well as possibilities for improvement. Methods: An existing adaptation assessment framework was modified for this research, and used as a guide to gather and analyse data from academic and grey literature, policy documents and interviews in order to qualitatively assess two organisations and their different models of adaptation and health support. Results: This research found differing strengths in the approaches to climate change and health used by the Asian Development Bank and by the Asia-Pacific Regional Forum on Health and Environment. The regional forum has vision, high levels of perceived legitimacy, and access to 'in-house' expertise in public health and climate change. Conversely, the Asian Development Bank has strengths in project management and access to significant financial resources to support work in climate change and health. Conclusion: When regional organisations, such as the Asian Development Bank and the Asia-Pacific Regional Forum on Health and Environment, have membership and mandate overlaps, their work will likely benefit from well designed, institutionalised and incentivised coordination mechanisms. Coordination can reduce redundancies as well as the administrative workload on partner government agencies. In the case-study examined, the Asian Development Bank's project management expertise complements the vision and high levels of perceived legitimacy of the Asia-Pacific Regional Forum on Health and Environment, thus a coordinated approach could deliver improved adaptation and health outcomes.","[Gilfillan, Daniel] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, 48 Linnaeus Way, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"Gilfillan, D (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, 48 Linnaeus Way, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",daniel.gilfillan@anu.edu.au,,,"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; Fenner School of Environment and Society (at the Australian National University); Rotary Club of Hall (ACT, Australia)","Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); Fenner School of Environment and Society (at the Australian National University); Rotary Club of Hall (ACT, Australia)","The author acknowledges financial support through an Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship as well as financial and material support from the Fenner School of Environment and Society (at the Australian National University) and the Rotary Club of Hall (ACT, Australia) to undertake fieldwork for this research.

There is widespread consensus that the sustainable establishment of such strategies requires transdisciplinary approaches, that is, the involvement of internal and external stakeholders (state, civil society and market actors) to become part of the change and find innovative ways to unite their efforts and capacities. However, there is little research and hardly any empirical evidence on the process of stakeholder involvement and co-production in the development of municipal adaptation strategies. Against this background, this paper examines the factors that influence how and why different stakeholders are involved (or excluded) during the processes of developing adaptation strategies, and how this gets reflected in process outcomes. Based on applied participatory analysis of two pioneering municipalities in Germany and Sweden, the paper identifies and contrasts existing patterns to feed back into both theory and practice. Synergies, mismatches, barriers and driving forces for adaptation co-production are identified and contrasted with current adaptation discourses. The results highlight how the level of internal and external stakeholder involvement is conditional on (changes in) the broader governance context, and the associated power constellations in which stakeholders act (e.g., standing of departments, proximity to the decision making body, changes in [or constellations of) political parties, contractual arrangements for staff, individual champions, progress in mainstreaming). On this basis, conclusions are drawn regarding how to foster sustainable and transformative adaptation through increased stakeholder involvement. The results and conclusions are crucial to advance theory on adaptation co-production, providing a basis for further analyses, research and action. They inform how existing theory, policies and/or guidelines for strategic adaptation planning need to be revisited to support change across current risk governance.","[Wamsler, Christine] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Biskopsgatan 5, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Wamsler, Christine] Uppsala Univ, CNDS, Uppsala, Sweden; [Wamsler, Christine] Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst GDI, Global Urbanism Res Grp, Manchester, Lancs, England",Lund University; Centre of Natural Hazards & Disaster Science (CNDS); Uppsala University; University of Manchester,"Wamsler, C (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Biskopsgatan 5, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",christine.wamsler@lucsus.lu.se,,,,,,,95,84,86,4,55,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Among them, integrated water resource management has a large potential for reducing water disagreement in water scarcity regions. Many of the strategies are based on well tested choices and technical know-how, with proven benefits for users and environment. This paper considers water management practices that may contribute to reduce disagreement in water scarcity areas, evaluating the management alternatives in the Mediterranean basins of Europe, a region that exemplifies other water scarcity regions in the world. First, we use a model to compute water availability taking into account water management, temporal heterogeneity, spatial heterogeneity and policy options, and then apply this model across 396 river basins. Second, we use a wedge approach to illustrate policy choices for selected river basins: Thrace (Greece), Guadalquivir, Ebro, Tagus and Duero (Spain), Po (Italy) and Rhone (France). At the wide geographical level, the results show the multideterminant complexities of climate change impacts and adaptation measures and the geographic nature of water resources and vulnerability metrics. At the local level, the results show that optimisation of water management is the dominating strategy for defining adaptation pathways. Results also show great sensitivity to ecological flow provision, suggesting that better attention should be paid to defining methods to estimate minimum ecological flows in water scarcity regions. For all scales, average water resource vulnerability computed by traditional vulnerability indicators may not be the most appropriate measure to inform climate change adaptation policy. This has large implications to applied water resource studies aiming to derive policy choices, and it is especially interesting in basins facing water scarcity. Our research aims to contribute to shape realistic water management options at the regional level and therefore provide information to climate change, agricultural and water policies.

J,"Roy, M",,,,"Roy, Manoj",,,"Planning for sustainable urbanisation in fast growing cities: Mitigation and adaptation issues addressed in Dhaka, Bangladesh",HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Adaptation; Climate change; Fast growing cities; Mitigation; Planning Support Systems; Sustainable urbanisation,CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACTS; VULNERABILITY,"Issues related to sustainable urbanisation are best addressed when coordinated within a strategic framework and facilitated by a system of policy formulation that combines local opinions with scientific insights. This implies that planning for sustainable urbanisation has the potential to minimise climate change threats. While there is a pressing need for this potential to be realised globally, the current level of success in fast growing cities of the developing world is very limited. An approach to overcome this limitation has recently been successful in Dhaka, one of the fastest growing global megacities. It involved the identification of a strategic framework for the city. This framework was then combined with a locally-informed model of sustainable urbanisation to produce the Dhaka Metropolitan Development Planning Support System (DMDPSS). This paper discusses the climate change adaptation and mitigation issues that can be addressed through such a method in Dhaka, using a scenario-based approach. Two alternative development options (constrained and unconstrained) are constructed and analysed. A common set of indicators are used: first to evaluate which alternative is more sustainable: and then the mitigation and adaptation issues addressed. Results show that the 'constrained' scenario, which includes a series of development limitations, is both more sustainable and can address more mitigation and adaptation issues than the other alternative. The scenario analysis, however, is only a part of the strategic framework needed for Dhaka. Indeed other factors, such as dissemination of facts and issues, and the ease and equity of communication in the community, are critical both for progress towards sustainability and to enhance community resilience to climate change. The paper concludes that the optimum combination of adaptation and mitigation measures can be identified in fast growing cities by using systems, such as the DMDPSS, based on the core principles of sustainable development.

However, empirical data on the actual economic appreciation of local mitigation and adaptation measures expressed as citizen willingness-to-pay (WTP) are scarce. In this paper, we report results of a preference survey using a choice experiment (CE) that quantifies economic preferences for biodiversity-based climate change mitigation and adaptation in the region surrounding Hainich National Park (Thuringia, Germany). A representative sample of 302 respondents-the majority of them frequent Hainich forest visitors-was interviewed in autumn 2006. Nested logit analysis showed that respondents state a substantially positive WTP for climate change mitigation by afforestation (p < 0.001). If converted to WTP for an additional sequestration of carbon that average German citizens emit as CO2, a monetary value of 7.34 (sic) yr(-1) t C-1 is obtained. For increasing forest resistance and resilience against insect pests and storms (climate change adaptation) a WTP of 27.54 (sic) yr(-1) (p < 0.001) is obtained, and 16.83 (sic) yr(-1) (p < 0.001) is obtained for increasing the general resilience and resistance of forest ecosystems to environmental stressors. Respondents support moderate programs to eradicate invasive plants when compared to more aggressive eradication measures. Due to the lack of comparable studies, it can only be conservatively assumed that WTP would be lower if mitigation and adaptation measures were to be implemented in forests not, or only rarely, used by respondents. As all proposed means for climate change mitigation and adaptation contribute to local forest ecosystem biodiversity, the results of the study advocate the realization of measures that potentially benefit both climate policy and regional conservation concerns,","[Rajmis, Sandra; Barkmann, Jan; Marggraf, Rainer] Univ Gottingen, Inst Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-57073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Rajmis, S (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Inst Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-57073 Gottingen, Germany.",srajmis@uni-goettingen.de,"Barkmann, Jan/B-7928-2014","Barkmann, Jan/0000-0001-7751-3435",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG Graduiertenkolleg) [1086],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG Graduiertenkolleg)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG Graduiertenkolleg 1086) for funding, our research assistants, the survey participants, Hainich area respondents for collaboration-especially M.

In developing countries, SMEs tend to exhibit low adaptive capacities, influenced by their enabling environments. A holistic understanding of how their capacity to adapt is influenced by both the qualities of their enabling environments and their inherent characteristics is needed. This study contributes to this understanding by reviewing the current knowledge of adaptive capacity in SMEs and providing an analysis of the environment for enabling SMEs to adapt to flood risk in Sri Lanka. Data originates from the Building Businesses' Climate Resilience project, implemented in Sri Lanka between 2018 and 2021. The study finds that deficiencies in Sri Lanka's enabling environment mean SMEs are unable to attain the information and competencies that would allow them to adopt suitable adaptation strategies for managing flood risk. Simultaneously, the results show that their capacity to cope with the impacts of flood events is not adequately enhanced by the financial services and support available prior to, and in the aftermath of, extreme weather events. Accordingly, it is suggested that the national government play a greater role in enhancing the enabling environment for adaptation. With the support of other prominent actors in Sri Lanka's enabling environment, they should seek to enhance access to post-disaster finance, the availability of affordable insurance products for uninsured SMEs, and the availability of interventions and resources that fill the information and capacity gaps that SMEs possess.","[Dale, Thomas William; Charlery, Lindy; Gao, Jingjing] UNEP Copenhagen Climate Ctr, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Dale, Thomas William; Charlery, Lindy; Gao, Jingjing] Tech Univ Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Schaer, Caroline] Care Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Dale, TW (corresponding author), UNEP Copenhagen Climate Ctr, Copenhagen, Denmark.;Dale, TW (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark.",thomas.dale@un.org; lindy.charlery@un.org; jingjing.gao@un.org; cschaer@care.dk,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Gao, Jingjing/J-9117-2016","Gao, Jingjing/0000-0001-6044-3928; Schaer, Caroline/0000-0002-5270-1293",Nordic Climate Facility (NCF),Nordic Climate Facility (NCF),The funding to conduct this research and write this study was covered using internal funding at UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre (formerly UNEP DTU Partnership).

However, significant number of trees harvested in miombo woodland of mainland Tanzania are not cut at the specified stump height, i.e., 15 cm from the ground. Leaving extra stump height (ESH) would escalate wood volume removals and hence carbon emissions. Better insights on the extent of wood volume and carbon emissions of ESH in miombo woodlands are apparently needed. This study intended to estimate volume and carbon of ESH in miombo woodland of mainland Tanzania. Based on a sample of 5 264 stumps collected in miombo woodlands of Mainland Tanzania, total annual volume and annual carbon per hectare of ESH were estimated by using equation applicable to cylinder in R software. Result revealed that total annual volume, annual volume and carbon per hectare lost through ESH were 3 800 000 m(-3) year(-1), 0.098 +/- 0.034m(3)ha(-1) year(-1) and 0.028 +/- 0.009 tCha(-1) year(-1), respectively. The volume and carbon loss from ESH per hectare per year escalate 6% and 5% of more volume and carbon removals, respectively, in the entire miombo woodlands and its categories in mainland Tanzania. Since annual volume loss of ESH is almost 1/4 of annual volume deficit of 19.5 million m(3)year(-1), the deficit and further removals could be lowered through adhering to appropriate harvesting regulations.","[Manyanda, Bernardol John; Mugasha, Wilson Ancelm; Nzunda, Emmanuel F.; Malimbwi, Rogers Ernest] Sokoine Univ Agr, Coll Forestry Wildlife & Tourism, Dept Forest Resources Assessment & Management, POB 3013, Morogoro, Tanzania",Sokoine University of Agriculture,"Manyanda, BJ (corresponding author), Sokoine Univ Agr, Coll Forestry Wildlife & Tourism, Dept Forest Resources Assessment & Management, POB 3013, Morogoro, Tanzania.",bernardoljohnm@gmail.com,,"Manyanda, Bernardol/0000-0001-8796-2752",,,,,38,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Meltwater volumes are traditionally estimated using the degree-day concept considering only air temperature, which cannot consider the influence from downward solar and longwave radiation, humidity, wind and resultant turbulent heat fluxes. Here, we used a physically based energy budget approach considering the full energy balance in seven large river basins in the eastern and southern TP. For 1982-2011, the estimated average glacier melt was 0.32 +/- 0.007 m water equivalent/yr with large spatial variability. Air temperature, downward longwave radiation, humidity, and wind speed influenced the overall glacier melt trend, and glacier melt accelerated with a rate of 0.42 mm/yr. Yet, downward shortwave radiation played an additional role in influencing the glacier melt rate fluctuation. On average, snow and glacier melt contributed 17.6% of annual river discharge during 1982-2011, including 10.0% from snow and 7.6% from glaciers. The highest and lowest relative melt contributions were in the Yarlung Tsangpo and Yalong Rivers, respectively. Mainly due to decreasing snow melt, glacier and snow melt contributions to discharge would decrease to 11.9% during 2021-2050 under the extreme climate scenario (RCP8.5), and the greatest change in the relative contributions would occur in the Upper Nu River (-9.2%). These findings indicate the divergent and changing importance of glaciers and snow as natural water reservoirs, potentially affecting socioeconomic development and adaptation to climate change in South, Southeast, and East Asia.","[Qi, Wei; Feng, Lian; Kuang, Xingxing; Zheng, Chunmiao; Liu, Junguo; Tian, Yong] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Chen, Deliang] Univ Gothenburg, Reg Climate Grp, Dept Earth Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Yao, Yingying] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Sch Human Settlements & Civil Engn, Xian, Peoples R China",Southern University of Science & Technology; University of Gothenburg; Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Feng, L (corresponding author), Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",fengl@sustech.edu.cn,"Liu, Junguo/B-3021-2012; Zheng, Chunmiao/I-5257-2014; Kuang, Xingxing/F-6080-2019; Chen, Deliang/A-5107-2013","Liu, Junguo/0000-0002-5745-6311; Zheng, Chunmiao/0000-0001-5839-1305; Chen, Deliang/0000-0003-0288-5618","National Natural Science Foundation of China [92047202, 51809136, 41971304, 41890852]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20060402]; Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee [JCYJ20190809155205559]; Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme 2018; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Soil and Groundwater Pollution Control [2017B030301012]; State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Integrated Surface Water-Groundwater Pollution Control",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee; Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme 2018; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Soil and Groundwater Pollution Control; State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Integrated Surface Water-Groundwater Pollution Control,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (92047202, 51809136, 41971304, and 41890852), Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA20060402), Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee (JCYJ20190809155205559), and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme 2018.

Drawing on accumulated evidence showing that, compared to air temperature (Ta), crop canopy temperature (Tc) better explains observed yield reductions caused by heat stress, we evaluated the usefulness of Tc versus Ta in designing high-temperature indicators for agrometeorological services, including crop monitoring and forecasting. The hot and dry environment of Sudan provides an ideal testbed. Tc was derived from the combined simulation of a crop model and a land surface model. Based on regressions linking the high-temperature indicators with irrigated wheat yield variations in 3 regions of Sudan over the last half-century, we found that using phenological periods rather than months for the wheat season (November to February), and using Tc rather than Ta, more effectively tracks the adverse effects of high temperature on yield during the key periods. The Tc-based indicators calculated for the key phenological periods have more robust multi-region applicability than the Ta-based indicators calculated for months and season, although they do not necessarily outperform the region-specific indicators in terms of explanatory power. We determined that the key periods were the vegetative growth period for the relatively cool region, and the reproductive growth period for the relatively hot regions. These findings suggest that agrometeorological services at the national and global levels should adopt Tc-based indicators, which will ultimately help players in global food systems adapt to climate change by preparing for wheat supply disruptions due to high-temperature extremes.","[Iizumi, Toshichika; Maruyama, Atsushi] Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Inst Agro Environm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan; [Iizumi, Toshichika; Tsubo, Mitsuru; Kurosaki, Yasunori; Tsujimoto, Hisashi] Tottori Univ, Arid Land Res Ctr, Tottori 6800001, Japan; [Tahir, Izzat S.

If these decisions are made incorrectly, irreversible changes can take place that threaten environmental, social and economic sustainability of agriculture. This study applies a land use change model to guide regional agricultural land use planning, with a focus on the case of the south basin of the Urmia Lake, NW Iran, using data from Landsat images, statistics, questionnaire and checklist. The findings indicate the significant changes in the five factors, namely rainfall, humidity, minimum temperature, average temperature and maximum temperature. For example, the rainfall decreased more than 10 mm and the average temperature has increased by 3.5 degrees C in the last 30 years. The results of factor analysis showed that the studied variables were grouped into eight factors. These factors explained 57.4% of the variance of the determinant factors of farmers' behavior on climate change in the study area. The results obtained from supervised classification showed that all land uses have undergone many changes. The irrigated agriculture and rainfed agriculture have increased 79.43% and 82.5%, respectively, while water bodies, dense grass and woodlands, and sparse grass have declined sharply in the south basin of Urmia Lake. The forecasted results for the year 2027 show that if the existing situation continues, more crises will be faced in terms of land use change, since irrigated agriculture and rainfed agriculture are expected to grow by nearly 9000 ha and more than 1000 ha, respectively.","[Mohammadzadeh, Latif] Agr Sci & Nat Resources Univ Khuzestan, Fac Agr Engn & Rural Dev, Mollasani, Khuzestan, Iran; [Ghanian, Mansour] Agr Sci & Nat Resources Univ Khuzestan, Fac Agr Engn & Rural Dev, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Mollasani, Khuzestan, Iran; [Shadkam, Somayeh] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Phys Geog Goethe, Frankfurt, Germany; [Ozerol, Gul] Univ Twente, Fac Behav Management & Social Sci BMS, Dept Governance & Technol Sustainabil CSTM, Enschede, Netherlands; [Marzban, Afshin] Agr Sci & Nat Resources Univ Khuzestan, Fac Agr Engn & Rural Dev, Dept Agr Machinery, Mollasani, Khuzestan, Iran",Goethe University Frankfurt; University of Twente,"Ghanian, M (corresponding author), Agr Sci & Nat Resources Univ Khuzestan, Fac Agr Engn & Rural Dev, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Mollasani, Khuzestan, Iran.",m_ghanian@asnrukh.ac.ir,"Ghanian, Mansour/AAA-6106-2022; Ghanian, Mansour/AAZ-2881-2020; Ghanian, Mansour/V-1072-2018","Ghanian, Mansour/0000-0002-8428-1107","Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) [97011489]; Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University of Khuzestan, Iran","Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)(Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)); Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University of Khuzestan, Iran","The authors would like to thank the financial support of the Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) (Proposal No: 97011489) and Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University of Khuzestan, Iran.",,62,0,0,2,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1866-6280,1866-6299,,ENVIRON EARTH SCI,Environ.

The knowledge generated serves as a scientific basis for climate services that are provided with the aim of tailoring information for decision-makers and policy-makers. Climate models and climate services are crucial elements for supporting policy and other societal actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change, and for making society better prepared and more resilient to climate-related risks. We present recommendations for future research topics for climate modeling and for climate services. These recommendations were produced by a group of experts in climate modeling and climate services, selected based on their individual leadership roles or participation in international activities. The recommendations were reached through extensive analysis, consideration and discussion of current and desired research capabilities, and wider engagement and refinement of the recommendations was achieved through a targeted workshop of initial recommendations and an open meeting at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly. The findings emphasize how research and innovation activities in the fields of climate modeling and climate services can contribute to improving climate knowledge and information with saliency for users in order to enhance capacity to transition to a sustainable and resilient society. The findings are relevant worldwide but are deliberately intended to influence the European Commission's next major multi-annual framework program of research and innovation over the period 2021-27.","[Hewitt, C.

A participant-driven research method to reveal barriers to crop rotation in Ukraine,CLIMATIC CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CLIMATE-CHANGE; MITIGATION; ADAPTATION; INSIGHTS; POLICY,"The agri-food sector must adapt to changes in climate variability, while also helping to mitigate climate change. Measures termed 'triple-win' mitigate and adapt to climate change, while also improving soil health, thereby increasing yields. These measures might appear to be the easiest to implement, but in practice, barriers prevent full realisation. This study aims to move beyond previous research efforts that identify and categorise barriers by (i) revealing hidden barriers, (ii) understanding the interactions between barriers and (iii) exploring ways to address barriers. A case study focusing on crop rotation as a triple-win strategy in Ukraine demonstrates how a participant-driven iterative research approach can achieve these objectives. During semi-structured interviews with farmers and stakeholders, crop rotation emerged as an area of considerable dissensus with stakeholders commonly citing the greedy behaviour of producers as the problem. Further discussion indicated that the political economy of Ukraine caused financial constraints for producers and Q methodology allowed for additional clarity on the opposing views of crop rotation. Three factors emerged: producer insecurity, national insecurity and business insecurity. These three perspectives reveal contrasting priorities with producer insecurity and business insecurity concerned with the conditions under which producers must operate, while national insecurity has a focus on improving agricultural production to benefit the nation. Consensus statements across all factors could provide first steps to addressing barriers and an opportunity to open discussions amongst stakeholders. Finally, barriers arising from political processes demonstrate that climate policy needs to be integrated with other sector-specific policy decisions.","[Kopytko, Natalie] Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Pruneddu, Alessio] UCL, London, England",University of Leeds; University of London; University College London,"Kopytko, N (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",n_kopytko@hotmail.com,,"Kopytko, Natalie/0000-0002-5164-1233",,,,,51,1,1,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

To date, most of the studies examining farmer's vulnerability and adaption to climate change have been agriculture-focused with little attention to the impacts on other livelihood systems. Based on a case study approach our study presents: i) how local people perceive climate change and whether it corresponds to meteorological records, ii) what climate change impacts people consider significant, and iii) what strategies the shrimp farmers employ to ameliorate perceived risks. This study was conducted using local climate data, focus groups and household survey in Mongla sub-district. This study shows that local people are aware of the changes in hydro-climatic parameters. Their accounts of climate change mostly diverge from the scientific evidence when long-term climate trends are considered, but on short-term variability, the correlation between scientific evidence and local perceptions is high. Repeated adverse impacts caused by climate stressors on livelihood activities shape people's climate risk perceptions. In relation to perceived risks, farmers have made adjustments in their aquaculture practices. Yet, the level of responses clearly lags behind the extent to which concerns about climate disturbances are expressed. This is partly due to farmers' efforts for managing transformation from agricultural livelihood system to aquaculture-based livelihood systems and partly associated with other social factors. This case study recommends governmental support for the shrimp aquaculture sector to facilitate the process of adaptation to changes in the hydro-climatic environment.","[Shameem, Masud Iqbal Md; Momtaz, Salim; Kiem, Anthony S.] Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Ourimbah, NSW 2258, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Momtaz, S (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Brush Rd, Ourimbah, NSW 2258, Australia.",salim.momtaz@newcastle.edu.au,"Kiem, Anthony/D-9307-2013","Kiem, Anthony/0000-0002-3994-6958; Momtaz, Salim/0000-0002-3730-3510","Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, Australian Government","Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, Australian Government(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science)","The research work on which this article is based was conducted as part of the first author's PhD programme at the University of Newcastle, Australia under Endeavour Postgraduate Award, funded by Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, Australian Government.",,33,59,62,2,61,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

During the same period, major changes are expected in world climate. Food security remains one of the highest priority issues in developing Latin American countries, a region where livestock production plays a fundamental role. Agricultural activities seriously threaten natural resources; therefore, it is necessary to ensure that livestock production contributes to satisfy the demand for animal products in a sustainable manner. Intensive silvopastoral systems (ISS) are becoming the technology of choice for Colombian and regional livestock sectors because it can help reduce the seasonality of plants and animal production, and therefore contribute to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change. We have recently gained knowledge on the nutritional and productive attributes of these systems. However, in recent years, the low carbon approach acquired importance in animal agriculture, which seeks to primarily promote the adoption of programs running parallel activities aimed at adapting to and mitigating climate change. This review outlines projections on the effects of climate change on the livestock industry, presents concepts on Greenhouse Gas flow and highlights evidence in support of the conclusion that ISS is an interesting option to allow the livestock sector in the region to adapt to climate change and to mitigate some of its effects. The adoption of ISS may help to remove up to 26.6 tons of CO2 eq/Ha/yr from the atmosphere.","[Morales, Ariel M.

Several southern areas of the UK experienced water stress during 20042006 because of low water availability and high water demand. Climate change scenarios suggest that drought frequency could increase here in the future. This will increase the competition for water across all sectors. Understanding people's perceptions of drought and climate change is likely to be an important factor for sustainable water management by pointing to barriers to behavioural change. A mixed methodology study using questionnaires and focus groups was conducted in the Anglian and southern regions of the UK to explore public perceptions of drought and climate change. Respondents attributed the 2004-2006 regional drought to lower than average rainfall. Water-intensive lifestyles, a growth in population, increasing housing developments, leaking pipes and the privatization of water companies were also implicated. The majority of respondents claimed to change their behaviour to conserve water during 2006. Regarding the future, and under a number of different scenarios, people were more inclined to accept restrictions than agree to pay more to ensure the supply of water. They were concerned about climate change and recognized that more frequent water shortages may be one of the impacts, but this concern did not necessarily translate into action. Barriers to engagement with climate change and water-efficient behaviour included a lack of accessible information, a lack of knowledge regarding the integration of environmental spheres, a lack of resources, and a perceived lack of institutional engagement. The barriers identified appear to pose a major challenge to successful adaptation to climate change.","[Dessai, Suraje] Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England; [Dessai, Suraje; Sims, Catherine] Univ E Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Dessai, Suraje] Univ Lisbon, Climate Change Impacts Adaptat & Mitigat Res Grp, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal",University of Exeter; University of East Anglia; Universidade de Lisboa,"Dessai, S (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England.",s.dessai@exeter.ac.uk,"Dessai, Suraje/D-4219-2009","Dessai, Suraje/0000-0002-7879-9364",,,,,59,80,81,1,73,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1747-7891,1878-0059,,ENVIRON HAZARDS-UK,Environ.

This study investigated factors associated with farmers' use of SFs and indigenous forecasts (IFs) for agricultural use in the Rwenzori region, western Uganda. Household survey gathered data on demographic characteristics, climate information use and livelihood choices from 580 farmers. Data was analysed using the probit model. Results showed that significant factors associated with using both IFs and SFs were farm size, education, age, reception of scientific forecasts in local languages, agricultural extension access, short-mature crop access, farmer-to-farmer network and accessing forecasts through radio. This study shows that IFs were used complementarily with SFs. On the other hand, significant factors associated with using IFs only were livelihood choices such as tuber and goat production, access to government interventions on climate change adaptations, agro-ecological zone and social capital. Climate risks and climate risk perceptions negatively influenced the use of scientific forecasts. Co-production of climate information, capacity-building and active engagement of stakeholders in dissemination mechanisms can improve climate forecast use. Investments in more weather stations in various districts will therefore be a key factor in obtaining more accurate scientific forecasts and could lead to increased use of scientific climate forecasts. Governments in developing countries, the private sector, global and regional development partners should support investments in weather stations and capacity building of national meteorological systems.","[Nkuba, Michael Robert; Chanda, Raban; Mmopelwa, Gagoitseope; Lesolle, David] Univ Botswana, Dept Environm Sci, 4775 Notwane Rd, Private Bag 00704, Gaborone, Botswana; [Kato, Edward] Int Food Policy & Res Inst, Washington, DC USA; [Mangheni, Margaret Najjingo] Makerere Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Dept Extens & Innovat Studies, Kampala, Uganda; [Adedoyin, Akintayo] Univ Botswana, Dept Phys, Gaborone, Botswana; [Mujuni, Godfrey] Uganda Natl Meteorol Author, Kampala, Uganda",University of Botswana; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Makerere University; University of Botswana,"Nkuba, MR (corresponding author), Univ Botswana, Dept Environm Sci, 4775 Notwane Rd, Private Bag 00704, Gaborone, Botswana.",mnkuba@gmail.com,"Nkuba, Michael/GWZ-8252-2022","Nkuba, Michael/0000-0002-6434-9100",,,,,74,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Considering the importance of agriculture in the pursuit of the India's development objectives, including the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, understanding possible impacts of climate change on productivity of major food crops in the country assumes importance in developing appropriate policies and programmes for agricultural technology development and transfer in general and for climate change adaptation in particular. Such an understanding at a scale where most of the development planning is done will be more useful in policy planning. This paper analysed climate change impacts at district level for major food crops using the district level climate projections for two time periods viz., mid-century (2021-2050) and end-century (2071-2098). Yields of most crops are projected to decrease in a majority of districts during mid-century period. The yield impacts are deeper and wider during end-century period. The yield impacts are relatively smaller and even positive in case of rapeseed & mustard and soybean. Some of the policy implications emerging from this study are: (i) Efforts are to be targeted and prioritized in the districts where the yields are likely to suffer more (ii) Concerns related to abiotic stress, especially those related to heat/temperature stress, need more attention in crop improvement and natural resource management programmes and (iii) Considering the dimension of climate change along with other bottlenecks to sustainable agriculture in the research and development process is a desirable way of mainstreaming climate change in to economic development programmes.","[Rao, C.

Therefore, the livelihoods of vulnerable ethnic minority populations in these areas could be improved through climate change adaptation measures. This study pursues an enhancement of three different aggregate indices such as Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI), Livelihood Vulnerability Index framed within the IPCC vulnerability framework (LVI-IPCC), and Livelihood Effect Index (LEI) to find out components contributing to the livelihood vulnerability of major ethnic minority populations in a case study of Mo Vang mountain (Yen Bai, Vietnam). A total of 120 Dzao and Hmong respondents from 11 villages are surveyed based on a combination of informal interviews, a questionnaire survey, and Focused Group Discussions (FGD). Twenty-nine sub-components belonging to 10 major components (socio-demographic profile, livelihood strategies, social networks, revenue, health, food, water, housing, land, and natural hazards and climate variability) are conducted to calculate LVI, LVI-IPCC, and LEI. The results show that the livelihood of Hmong populations is more vulnerable to climate change for natural conditions such as natural hazards and climate variability, housing, land, water, food, and health. However, the livelihood of Dzao populations is more vulnerable because of socio-economic conditions such as socio-demographic profile, livelihood strategies, revenue, and social networks. The results provide a scientific basis for both residents, local officials, and policy-makers prioritizing solutions to enhance livelihood capitals as well as to improve adaptive capacity to climate change in the mountains of Northern Vietnam.","[Nguyen, Thinh An; Hoang, Huong Thi] Vietnam Natl Univ, VNU Univ Econ & Business, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Nguyen, Bich Thi] Vietnam Natl Univ Forestry VNUF, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Van Ta, Hanh] Vietnam Acad Sci & Technol VAST, Inst Mat Sci, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Van Ta, Hanh] Vietnam Acad Sci & Technol VAST, Grad Univ Sci & Technol, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Nguyen, Nhung Thi Phuong] Vietnam Natl Prod Inst, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Nguyen, Quan Phung] Comm Ethn Minor Affairs, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Hens, Luc] Vlaamse Instelling Technol Onderzoek VITO, Mol, Belgium",Vietnam National University Hanoi; Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology (VAST); Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology (VAST); VITO,"Nguyen, TA (corresponding author), Vietnam Natl Univ, VNU Univ Econ & Business, Hanoi, Vietnam.",anthinhhus@gmail.com,,"NGUYEN, An Thinh/0000-0002-9738-2142","VNU University of Economics and Business, Hanoi","VNU University of Economics and Business, Hanoi","The authors would like to thank VNU University of Economics and Business, Hanoi support for this study.

The aim of this study is to investigate current and projected future heat risk, expressed as a heat stress exposure index using high-resolution climate change projections, and a social vulnerability index, to identify areas of potential future heat stress risk in the Durban (eThekwini) metropolitan area, South Africa. Additionally, this is the first study to use high-resolution downscaled climate change projections under Representative Concentration (RCP) 8.5, to construct the heat exposure index using apparent temperature and increases in minimum temperature and a social vulnerability index, using demographic and socio-economic census and land use data to, derived from principal component analysis (PCA) to spatially characterize heat stress within a South African city. Results show that while heat stress is not a current concern, it is projected to increase and become a future concern, mainly as a function of social vulnerability due to household demographic and infrastructural characteristics, and will be experienced in both the rural and inner-city areas of the metro. This study contributes a heat risk framework to identify locations for specific research and adaptation activities on heat stress risk and for urban planning in sub-Saharan African cities, which are characterized by both rural and urban contexts, to address climate change adaptation targeting and priority setting.","[Jagarnath, Meryl; Thambiran, Tirusha; Gebreslasie, Michael] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Westville Campus,Private Bag X 54001, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa; [Thambiran, Tirusha] CSIR Smart Pl, POB 17001, ZA-4013 Congella, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Jagarnath, M (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Westville Campus,Private Bag X 54001, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa.",mjagarnath@gmail.com,"Gebreslasie, Michael/AAI-2387-2021; Gebreslasie, Michael T/F-8885-2012; Jagarnath, Meryl/AAZ-2808-2021","Gebreslasie, Michael/0000-0002-4784-576X; Jagarnath, Meryl/0000-0003-1668-1675",eThekwini Municipality,eThekwini Municipality,"The authors are grateful to Robert Maisha, Francois Engelbrecht and Yerdashin Padayachi of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) for their assistance and provision of the climate change data used in this study.

This was the challenge that a project faced concerning the climate change perceptions of smallholder farmers from four Brazilian biomes (Amazonia, Cerrado, Pantanal, and Semiarid region), coordinated by the Brazilian Research Network on Climate Change (Rede CLIMA). Interdisciplinary clashes among scientists went well beyond semantics and reached the core of concepts such as perception, resilience, vulnerability, adaptive capacity and even climate change. Challenges included thinking collectively about a problem with so much ambiguous and contradictory knowledge, conflicting interests, and diverging epistemologies. This case study - which focused on the internal debate about climatic change apparent misperceptions by family farmers - confirmed that there is no blueprint for interdisciplinary climate change research projects, as well as the clear need for project-specific and context-sensitive research strategies. Critical factors going into successful interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary integration included early involvement of different groups (such as researchers, decision-makers, and local actors and stakeholders) as essential for finding common objectives and priorities. The experience of Rede CLIMA confirmed that the barriers to successful climate change adaptation (such as the mutual incomprehension or distrust between scientists themselves, and between scientist and end-users) could be overcome by creating collaborative enterprises. The co-creation of science, which included switching roles between knowledge producers and end-users, facilitated horizontal work and the identification of climate-related risks among family farmers.","[Litre, Gabriela; Bursztyn, Marcel; Rodrigues Filho, Saulo; Mesquita, Patricia] Univ Brasilia UnB, CDS, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Litre, Gabriela] INPE, Rede Brasileira Pesquisa Mudancas Climat Rede CLI, Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia; Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE),"Litre, G (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia UnB, CDS, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.;Litre, G (corresponding author), INPE, Rede Brasileira Pesquisa Mudancas Climat Rede CLI, Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil.",gabrielalitre@yahoo.com,"Bursztyn, Marcel/F-9921-2012","Litre, Gabriela/0000-0001-7789-0580",,,,,34,1,1,1,12,"UNIV FEDERAL PARANA, EDITORA",PARANA,"RUA JOAO NEGRAO 280, CURITIBA, PARANA, 80060-200, BRAZIL",1518-952X,2176-9109,,DESENVOLV MEIO AMBIE,Desenvolv.

In this study, we investigate an extreme snowstorm over the southwestern Tibetan Plateau (SWTP) that occurred on 18-21 September 2008. We explore sources and transport pathways of moisture to this storm using multiple data sets and a series of regional model simulations. The results show that this snowstorm results from dynamical coupling between an upper-level trough and a concurrent low-pressure system over northern India. This tropical-extratropical interaction provides the dynamical mechanism for the snowstorm to occur: the upper level trough favors southward cold advection upstream of the SWTP while the low-pressure system over northern India provides an abundant supply of moisture. Model-based sensitivity tests indicate that large amounts of moisture are transported over the SWTP via both the up-and-over and upslope transport pathways. Our findings corroborate that low-pressure systems over northern India can deliver abundant moisture into the SWTP. The coupling of this abundant supply of moisture with an upper-level trough further leads to the occurrence of an early snow disaster in this case, aggravating already harsh conditions and causing severe damage. Improved understanding of the interactions between these two types of synoptic systems and the climatic conditions that influence their occurrence would aid the development of effective strategies for climate change adaptation and sustainable husbandry, as well as the mitigation and relief of future snow disasters in this region.","[Dong, Wenhao; Lin, Yanluan; Wright, Jonathon S.; Xie, Yuanyu; Xu, Fanghua; Yang, Kun; Zhao, Xi; Cao, Dianbin] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Dong, Wenhao; Lin, Yanluan; Wright, Jonathon S.; Xie, Yuanyu; Xu, Fanghua; Yang, Kun; Zhao, Xi; Cao, Dianbin] Tsinghua Univ, JCGCS, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Xin; Tian, Lide] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Xin; Tian, Lide] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS","Dong, WH (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Dong, WH (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, JCGCS, Beijing, Peoples R China.",dongwh15@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn,"Li, Xin/F-7473-2011; li, xin/HHS-9461-2022; lin, yanluan/A-6333-2015; Xu, Fanghua/H-2398-2015; Yang, Wei/GWV-4107-2022; Yang, Kun/G-8390-2011; Yang, Wei/HIA-0360-2022; Zhao, Xi/AAN-9269-2020; Dong, Wenhao/B-7515-2019","Li, Xin/0000-0003-2999-9818; Xu, Fanghua/0000-0003-4057-8387; Yang, Kun/0000-0002-0809-2371; Zhao, Xi/0000-0002-4824-2231; lin, yanluan/0000-0002-0865-0580; Wright, Jonathon/0000-0001-6551-7017; xie, yuanyu/0000-0001-5966-0482; Dong, Wenhao/0000-0002-5662-5435",National Key Research Project of China [2017YFC1501902]; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China [2017YFA0603902]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [91537210],"National Key Research Project of China; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","We gratefully acknowledge the WET project (Variability and Trends in Water Balance Components of Benchmark Drainage Basins on the Tibetan Plateau) group for providing public access to the HAR data set (http://www.klima-ds.tu-berlin.de/har/).

Here, we develop and test a conceptual model for how predictability of fire refugia varies according to topographic complexity and fire weather conditions. Refugia were quantified as areas unburned or burned at comparatively low severity based on remotely sensed burn severity data. We assessed the relationship between refugia and a suite of terrain-related explanatory metrics by fitting a collection of boosted regression tree models. The models were developed for seven study fires that burned in conifer-dominated forested landscapes of the Western Cordillera of Canada between 2001 and 2014. We fit nine models, each for distinct levels of fire weather and terrain ruggedness. Our framework revealed that the predictability and abundance of fire refugia varied among these environmental settings. We observed highest predictability under moderate fire weather conditions and moderate terrain ruggedness (ROC-AUC = 0.77), and lowest predictability in flatter landscapes and under high fire weather conditions (ROC-AUC = 0.63-0.68). Catchment slope, local aspect, relative position, topographic wetness, topographic convergence, and local slope all contributed to discriminating where refugia occur but the relative importance of these topographic controls differed among environments. Our framework allows us to characterize the predictability of contemporary fire refugia across multiple environmental settings and provides important insights for ecosystem resilience, wildfire management, conservation planning, and climate change adaptation.","[Krawchuk, Meg A.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Haire, Sandra L.] Haire Lab Landscape Ecol, Rockport, MA 01966 USA; [Coop, Jonathan] Western State Colorado Univ, Ctr Environm & Sustainabil, Gunnison, CO 81231 USA; [Parisien, Marc-Andre] Nat Resources Canada, Northern Forestry Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, Edmonton, AB T6H 3S5, Canada; [Whitman, Ellen] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Chong, Geneva] US Geol Survey, Northern Rocky Mt Sci Ctr, Jackson, WY 83001 USA; [Miller, Carol] US Forest Serv, Aldo Leopold Wilderness Res Inst, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, Missoula, MT 59801 USA",Oregon State University; Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service; University of Alberta; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Krawchuk, MA (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",meg.krawchuk@oregonstate.edu,"Haire, Sandra/HHY-7328-2022","Haire, Sandra/0000-0002-5356-7567; Miller, Carol/0000-0002-3091-5602",Great Northern Landscape Conservation Cooperative; U.S. Geological Survey Gap Analysis Program under USFS Interagency Agreement [13-IA-11221639122]; Canadian Forest Service; Oregon State University; NSERC [418376-2012]; NASA/HQ,Great Northern Landscape Conservation Cooperative; U.S. Geological Survey Gap Analysis Program under USFS Interagency Agreement(United States Geological Survey); Canadian Forest Service(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service); Oregon State University; NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); NASA/HQ,"A special thanks to author Sandra Haire for her contributions to analyses included in this work.

The impact of heatwaves is often felt strongest in towns and cities where populations are concentrated and where the climate is often unintentionally modified to produce an urban heat island effect; where urban areas can be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. The purpose of this interdisciplinary study is to integrate remotely sensed urban heat island data alongside commercial social segmentation data via a spatial risk assessment methodology in order to highlight potential heat health risk areas and build the foundations for a climate change risk assessment. This paper uses the city of Birmingham, UK as a case study area. Results: When looking at vulnerable sections of the population, the analysis identifies a concentration of very high risk areas within the city centre, and a number of pockets of high risk areas scattered throughout the conurbation. Further analysis looks at household level data which yields a complicated picture with a considerable range of vulnerabilities at a neighbourhood scale. Conclusions: The results illustrate that a concentration of very high risk people live within the urban heat island, and this should be taken into account by urban planners and city centre environmental managers when considering climate change adaptation strategies or heatwave alert schemes. The methodology has been designed to be transparent and to make use of powerful and readily available datasets so that it can be easily replicated in other urban areas.","[Tomlinson, Charlie J.; Baker, Christopher J.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Civil Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Chapman, Lee; Thornes, John E.] Univ Birmingham, School Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham,"Tomlinson, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Civil Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",cjt512@bham.ac.uk,"chapman, lee/AAE-8287-2020; Chapman, Lee/F-4674-2014","chapman, lee/0000-0002-2837-8334; Chapman, Lee/0000-0002-2837-8334; Baker, Christopher/0000-0001-7572-1871",,,,,95,191,201,7,140,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1476-072X,,,INT J HEALTH GEOGR,Int.

The policy and legal setting for natural hazards planning provides a solid foundation for good practice. But there are many examples of 'bad practice' that result in unnecessary risks and, in some cases, exposure to repeat events and potentially devastating impacts. Much, therefore, remains to be done to improve hazards planning policy and practice in New Zealand. This article explores the questions: What role does land-use planning play in managing hazard risks in New Zealand; and what needs to be done to reduce hazard risks and build community resilience? The article starts by describing the milieu within which natural hazards planning takes place. It goes onto outline the stakeholders and institutional and legal setting for natural hazards planning in New Zealand, including barriers to realising the potential of natural hazards planning. This synthesis reveals a number of 'burning issues', including the need to: (a) Improve understanding about the nature of hazards; (b) Prioritise risk avoidance (reduction) measures; (c) Provide national guidance for communities exposed to repeat events and address the relocation issue and (d) Mainstream climate change adaptation. Each 'burning issue' is discussed, and priority actions are recommended to realise the potential of land-use planning to reduce natural hazard risks and build community resilience in New Zealand. Ultimately, the challenge is to develop a cooperative hazards governance approach that is founded on coordinated policies, laws and institutions, cooperative professional practice and collaborative communities.","[Glavovic, B.

Set of energy retrofitting solutions is evaluated against performance-based criteria (energy consumption, weight and carbon footprint), and considering the preservation of the cultural value of the building, its architectural and spatial configuration. Design/methodology/approach This research addresses the building energy performance analysis before and after the design of retrofitting solutions in extreme climate environments (2030-2100). The proposed model integrates data obtained from an advanced parametric tool (Grasshopper) and a multi-criteria decision analysis (M-MACBETH) to score different energy retrofitting solutions against energy consumption, weight, carbon footprint and impact on architectural configuration. The proposed model is tested for predicting the performance of a traditional timber-framed dwelling in a historic parish in Lisbon. The performance of distinct solutions is compared in digitally simulated climate conditions (design scenarios) considering different criteria weights. Findings This study shows the importance of conducting building energy simulation linking physical and digital environments and then, identifying a set of evaluation criteria in the analysed context. Architects, environmental engineers and urban planners should use computational environment in the development design phase to identify design solutions and compare their expected impact on the building configuration and performance-based behaviour. Research limitations/implications The unavailability of local weather data (EnergyPlus Weather File (EPW) file), the high time-resource effort, and the number/type of the energy retrofit measures tested in this research limit the scope of this study. In energy simulation procedures, the baseline generally covers a period of thirty, ten or five years. In this research, due to the fact that weather data is unavailable in the format required in the simulation process (.EPW file), the input data in the baseline is the average climatic data from EnergyPlus (2022). Additionally, this workflow is time-consuming due to the low interoperability of the software. Grasshopper requires a high-skilled analyst to obtain accurate results. To calculate the values for the energy consumption, i.e. the values of energy per day of simulation, all the values given per hour are manually summed. The values of weight are obtained by calculating the amount of material required (whose dimensions are provided by Grasshopper), while the amount of carbon footprint is calculated per kg of material. Then this set of data is introduced into M-MACBETH. Another relevant limitation is related to the techniques proposed for retrofitting this case study, all based on wood-fibre boards. Practical implications The proposed method for energy simulation and climate change adaptation can be applied to other historic buildings considering different evaluation criteria and context-based priorities. Social implications Context-based adaptation measures of the built environment are necessary for the coming years due to the projected extreme temperature changes following the 2015 Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda. Built environments include historical sites that represent irreplaceable cultural legacies and factors of the community's identity to be preserved over time. Originality/value This study shows the importance of conducting building energy simulation using physical and digital environments. Computational environment should be used during the development design phase by architects, engineers and urban planners to rank design solutions against a set of performance criteria and compare the expected impact on the building configuration and performance-based behaviour.

Although these strategies are repeatedly advanced as win-win solutions for all, recent literature has drawn attention to numerous negative effects, especially the displacement and exclusion of vulnerable social groups, pointing at yet another layer of climate injustice. In this article, we focus our analysis on the experienced and/or perceived negative social effects of greening interventions for climate adaptation on historically marginalized groups through a cross-case qualitative com-parison of four neighborhoods in North American and European cities (Boston, Philadelphia, Amsterdam and Barcelona). Interviews conducted among a diverse sample of civic groups related to each neighborhood reveal that most respondents highly value green resilient infrastructures for their socio-environmental benefits. However, unless these green interventions are implemented alongside policies that guarantee equitable outcomes for all, then civic respondents mostly identify negative social impacts on marginalized residents, making those benefits short-lived. Most promi-nent negative impacts include physical displacement and the related threat of more displacement together with risks that new (green) real estate developments and resilient greening will remain exclusionary for marginalized groups. Such similar findings across different socio-political contexts point to the need for bolder policies that guarantee that investments in green climate adaptation interventions secure both environmental and social benefits in underinvested and environmentally neglected neighborhoods and mitigate the negative impacts of such interventions, namely socio-cultural and physical displacement and overall exclusionary climate protection.","[Anguelovski, Isabelle] UAB Univ Autonoma Barcelona, BCNUEJ Barcelona Lab Urban Environm Justice & Sust, ICTA Inst Environm Sci & Technol, ICREA Institucio Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avanca, Barcelona, Spain; [Planas-Carbonell, Aina; Oscilowicz, Emilia; Shokry, Galia] UAB Univ Autonoma Barcelona, BCNUEJ Barcelona Lab Urban Environm Justice & Sust, ICTA Inst Environm Sci & Technol, Barcelona, Spain; [Perez-del-Pulgar, Carmen] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Environm Polit, Leipzig, Germany; [Perez-del-Pulgar, Carmen] Friedrich Schiller Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Jena, Germany; [Shokry, Galia] Kean Univ, Dept Environm & Sustainabil Sci, Barcelona, Spain",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Anguelovski, I (corresponding author), UAB Univ Autonoma Barcelona, BCNUEJ Barcelona Lab Urban Environm Justice & Sust, ICTA Inst Environm Sci & Technol, ICREA Institucio Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avanca, Barcelona, Spain.",Isabelle.Anguelovski@uab.cat,,,"European Research Council [678034, CEX2019-000940-M]; Spanish Ministry of Science","European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Spanish Ministry of Science(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government)","The study was funded by the European Research Council under grant agreement [No 678034] and CEX2019-000940-M for the Maria de Maetzu from the Spanish Ministry of Science.

The approaches set out in city adaptation plans are analysed and compared to provide insight into the uptake of mitigation co benefits in terms of the extent to which they are strategically planned for and the types of measures utilised. The research also identifies common barriers cities face that prevent the implementation of co-benefit approaches. Finally, drawing on approaches taken by the cities that comprehensively plan for adaptation-mitigation co benefits, three actions are outlined to serve as recommendations for cities to help catalyse the uptake of co benefits and avoid trade-offs in adaptation planning. Delivering mitigation co-benefits of adaptation actions was a strategic aim of five of eight cities. Four of these cities comprehensively identified mitigation co-benefits of planned adaptation measures. Certain types of co benefits were more commonly utilised by cities, such as ecosystem-based strategies and building design measures. The alignment of adaptation and development goals is a more common aim than the alignment of adaptation and mitigation. Incentives to meet multiple policy priorities, reduce costs, and increase resource efficiency can deliver co-benefit approaches that cover adaptation, mitigation, and development goals.","[Boyd, Danielle; van Diemen, Renee; Skea, Jim] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London, England; [Pathak, Minal] Ahmedabad Univ, Global Ctr Environm & Energy, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India",Imperial College London; Ahmedabad University,"van Diemen, R (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London, England.",renee.van-diemen14@imperial.ac.uk,,"Pathak, Minal/0000-0002-9474-0485",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/P022820/1],Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),The authors acknowledge the financial support of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) through Award number EP/P022820/1.,,63,10,10,10,29,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

This study sought to identify the CSA technologies used by farmers and assess adoption levels and factors that influence them. A cross-sectional survey was carried out gather information from 384 smallholder farmers in the Great Rift Valley (GRV) of Ethiopia. Data were analyzed using percentage, chi-square test, t test, and the multivariate probit model. Results showed that crop diversification, agroforestry, and integrated soil fertility management were the most widely practiced technologies. The results of the chi-square and t tests showed that there are differences and significant and positive connections between adopters and non-adopters based on various attributes. The chi-square and t test results confirmed that households who were older and who had higher incomes, greater credit access, climate information access, better training, better education, larger farms, higher incomes, and more frequent interactions with extension specialists had positive and significant associations with CSA technology adopters. The model result showed that age, sex, and education of the head; farmland size; livestock ownership; income; access to credit; access to climate information; training; and extension contact influenced the adoption of CSA technologies. Therefore, considering barriers to the adoption of CSA technologies, in policy and action is anticipated to support smallholder farmers in adapting to climate change while lowering GHG emissions.","[Sisay, Theodrose] Haramaya Univ, Afr Ctr Excellence Climate Smart Agr & Biodivers C, POB 138, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia; [Sisay, Theodrose; Getnet, Mezegebu] Ethiopian Inst Agr Res EIAR, POB 2003, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Tesfaye, Kindie] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Ketema, Mengistu] Haramaya Univ, Sch Agr & Agribusiness, POB 138, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia; [Dechassa, Nigussie] Haramaya Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Sch Plant Sci, POB 138, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia",,"Sisay, T (corresponding author), Haramaya Univ, Afr Ctr Excellence Climate Smart Agr & Biodivers C, POB 138, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia.;Sisay, T (corresponding author), Ethiopian Inst Agr Res EIAR, POB 2003, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",tedy.sisay@gmail.com,,,International Development Association (IDA); Haramaya University; Ethiopia Institute of Agricultural Research,International Development Association (IDA); Haramaya University; Ethiopia Institute of Agricultural Research,"The support from the agricultural office field staff of the study area districts is greatly appreciated.

In this regard, bioenergy coupled with carbon capture and storage or utilisation (BECCS/U) is an attractive solution for meeting both the population demand, and offsetting CO2 emissions. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of BECCS/U pathways utilising CO2 for agricultural enrichment in enhancing food systems and reducing GHG emissions within the energy, water and food nexus concept. The study bridges negative emissions with CO2 fertilisation within an integrated system. It consists of a source of CO2 represented by a biomass-based integrated gasification combined cycle with carbon capture, a CO2 network for a sustainable CO2 supply, and a CO2 sink characterised by agricultural greenhouses. A techno-economic and environmental analysis of each of these subsystems is conducted, feeding to an overall performance analysis of the integrated BECCS/U pathway. Results reveal synergetic opportunities between the energy, water and food subsectors, whereby CO2 is captured from an energy sub-system and is efficiently utilised to enhance food subsystems by improving productivity and reducing crop water requirements. Thus, the proposed integrated BECCS/ U system is able to improve food availability by enhancing the food system, increasing the yield by 13.8%, whilst reducing crop water requirements by 28%. System outputs resulted in a levelised cost of 0.35 $/kg of agricultural produce when the system is scaled-up, and an abatement of the related environmental burdens throughout the supply chain by achieving negative CO2 emissions of 24.6 kg/m(2).year of cultivated land.","[Ghiat, Ikhlas; Mahmood, Farhat; Al-Ansari, Tareq] Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Qatar Fdn, Coll Sci & Engn, Div Sustainable Dev, Doha, Qatar; [Govindan, Rajesh; Al-Ansari, Tareq] Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Qatar Fdn, Coll Sci & Engn, Div Engn Management & Decis Sci, Doha, Qatar",Qatar Foundation (QF); Hamad Bin Khalifa University-Qatar; Qatar Foundation (QF); Hamad Bin Khalifa University-Qatar,"Al-Ansari, T (corresponding author), Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Qatar Fdn, Coll Sci & Engn, Div Sustainable Dev, Doha, Qatar.",talansari@hbku.edu.qa,"Mahmood, Farhat/ABC-6607-2021","Mahmood, Farhat/0000-0002-8110-5343; Al-Ansari, Tareq/0000-0002-2932-8240; Ghiat, Ikhlas/0000-0002-4421-9413",Qatar National Research Fund [NPRP11S-0107-180216]; Qatar National Library,Qatar National Research Fund(Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF)); Qatar National Library(Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF)),This research is supported by the Qatar National Research Fund proposal (NPRP11S-0107-180216).

This study focused on Tunisian dairy farmers' perceptions of the risks and the actions taken to cope with changes attributable to climate change. Using a bottom-up approach, 566 surveys were carried out randomly among dairy farmers throughout Tunisia. A total of 70 diagnostic variables relating to farm characteristics, resources, management, performances and profit, in addition to climate change risk perception and adaptation strategies, were identified and analyzed. Using multivariate statistical analysis, four dairy farming groups were identified. The largest proportions of farmers belonged to the two above-ground dairy systems: without utilized agricultural areas; and with non-dairy utilized agricultural areas (Clusters 1 and 2). A minority of farmers belonged to medium-sized and large farms that specialized in milk production (Clusters 3 and 4) and has access to sufficient land, water and capital resources. In all the clusters, almost all the farmers perceived that the greatest impact of climate change would be on cow performance and forage production. The attitudes of the farmers towards adaptation to climate change are associated with farm typology. They focused mainly on increasing water capacity for livestock and crop production and improving livestock and housing conditions. The knowledge obtained from this study could be helpful for decision-makers and stakeholders in efforts to develop policies for farm management practices that address climate change and can be adapted to the country's diverse farming systems.","[Amamou, Hajer; Beckers, Yves; Hammami, Hedi] Univ Liege, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Agr Bioengn & Chem Dept, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; [Ben Sassi, Mohsen] Off Livestock & Pasture, Tunis 1002, Tunisia; [Aouadi, Hatem] State Lands Off, Tunis 1003, Tunisia; [Khemiri, Hichem] Western North Sylvopastoral Dev Off, Beja 9000, Tunisia; [Mahouachi, Mokhtar] Univ Jendouba, High Sch Agr Kef, Le Kef 7119, Tunisia",University of Liege; Universite de Jendouba,"Hammami, H (corresponding author), Univ Liege, Anim Sci Unit, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Passage Deportes 2, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium.",hedi.hammami@uliege.be,,"Beckers, Yves/0000-0002-1649-1161; HAMMAMI, HEDI/0000-0003-4751-6699","Office of Livestock and Pasture (Office de l'Elevage et des Paturages); Western North Sylvo-Pastoral Development Office (Office de Developpement Sylvo-pastoral du Nord Ouest); State Lands Office (Offices des Terres Domaniales); Tunisia Ministry of Agriculture; Tunisia Ministry of Research and Higher Education of Tunisia; Directorate of Genetic Improvement (Sidi Thabet, Tunisia)","Office of Livestock and Pasture (Office de l'Elevage et des Paturages); Western North Sylvo-Pastoral Development Office (Office de Developpement Sylvo-pastoral du Nord Ouest); State Lands Office (Offices des Terres Domaniales); Tunisia Ministry of Agriculture; Tunisia Ministry of Research and Higher Education of Tunisia; Directorate of Genetic Improvement (Sidi Thabet, Tunisia)","The authors thank the Office of Livestock and Pasture (Office de l'Elevage et des Paturages), the Western North Sylvo-Pastoral Development Office (Office de Developpement Sylvo-pastoral du Nord Ouest) and the State Lands Office (Offices des Terres Domaniales) for their support and assistance during the survey.

Originally they have been designed to inform mitigation policy but some of them are now applied in the context of adaptation policy as well. This article reviews the modeling of climate impacts and adaptation in global IAMs, including both models with an economic focus and models with a science focus. Key advances in the representation of climate impacts in IAMs during the last decade include improved consideration of differences in impacts across regions, the development of nonmonetary reduced-form climate impact models, and coupling of global IAMs with regional and sectoral impact models to assess climate change together with other sustainability issues. Further advances include a stronger focus on probabilistic analysis and attempt at considering large-scale climate instabilities. Adaptation has received only limited attention in global IAMs so far, mostly due to the mismatch in spatial scales at which mitigation and adaptation decisions are generally made. Some recent IAMs attempt to identify optimal levels of adaptation in climate-sensitive sectors or do include adaptation to climate change explicitly as a decision variable. The main reason for the consideration of adaptation in global welfare-maximizing IAMs is to assess the sensitivity of mitigation targets to different assumptions about the magnitude and effectiveness of adaptation. IAMs with geographically explicit impact models may also provide information that is useful for adaptation planning. (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Recent decades have witnessed profound changes that have advanced ethical and community-driven research, yet much work remains. Inuit have called for research reform in Inuit Nunangat, most recently creating the National Inuit Strategy on Research (NISR) as a framework to support this work. The present study details the process undertaken to create a research program guided by the NISR to address food security, nutrition, and climate change in Inuit Nunangat. Four main elements were identified as critical to supporting the development of a meaningful and authentic community-led program of research: developing Inuit-identified research questions that are relevant and important to Inuit communities; identifying Inuit expertise to answer these questions; re-envisioning and innovating research methodologies that are meaningful to Inuit and reflect Inuit knowledge and societal values; and identifying approaches to mobilizing knowledge that can be applied to support food security and climate change adaptation. We also identify considerations for funding agencies to support the meaningful development of Inuit-led research proposals, including aligning funding with community priorities, reconsidering who the researchers are, and investing in community infrastructure. Our critical reflection on the research program development process provides insight into community-led research that can support Inuit self-determination in research, enhance local ethical conduct of research, privilege Inuit knowledge systems, and align Inuit-identified research priorities with research funding opportunities in health research. While we focus on Inuit-led research in Nunavut, Canada, these insights may be of interest more broadly to Indigenous health research.","[Caughey, Amy; Sargeant, Jan M.; Harper, Sherilee L.] Univ Guelph, Dept Populat Med, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Caughey, Amy; Kilabuk, Pitsiula; Sanguya, Igah; Doucette, Michelle; Jaw, Martha; Koonoo, Theresa; Joy, Wanda] Govt Nunavut, Dept Hlth, Pangnirtung, NU X0A 0H0, Canada; [Sanguya, Igah] Ilisaqsivik, Clyde River, NU X0A 0E0, Canada; [Allen, Jean] Nunavut Tunngav Inc, Iqaluit, NU X0A 0H0, Canada; [Maniapik, Lily] Ilitasiniq Nunavut Literacy Council, Iqaluit, NU X0A 0H0, Canada; [Shirley, Jamal] Nunavut Res Inst, Iqaluit, NU X0A 0H0, Canada; [Moller, Helle] Lakehead Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Harper, Sherilee L.] Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada",University of Guelph; Lakehead University; University of Alberta,"Caughey, A (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Populat Med, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.;Caughey, A (corresponding author), Govt Nunavut, Dept Hlth, Pangnirtung, NU X0A 0H0, Canada.",acaughey@uoguelph.ca,"Harper, Sherilee/L-4996-2013","Harper, Sherilee/0000-0001-7298-8765",Canadian Institutes of Health Research,Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),This research was funded by Canadian Institutes of Health Research.,,64,0,0,2,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-6643,,NUTRIENTS,Nutrients,APR,2022,14,8,,,,,,,1572,10.3390/nu14081572,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu14081572,,,12,Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Nutrition & Dietetics,0S4RI,35458135,"Green Accepted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000786262300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To better understand this climate change and sustainable development goals (SDGs) funding dilemma, there needs to be greater clarity around four climate change investment and finance-related questions that are frequently absent or inadequately addressed in the academic and policy literature. Firstly, what are or should be the boundaries of climate change investment and finance when the problem of climate change becomes impossible to separate from biodiversity, land use management, and other dilemmas related to the broader SDGs? Secondly, how we should define and what constitutes adequate financial resources to address the climate change and SDGs dilemmas on the global level? Thirdly, why is it important to close the gap between climate change adaptation and mitigation funding levels? Finally, what role should the private sector and business actors play in terms of climate change investment and finance issues? In addition to achieving greater clarity around these four issue areas, I argue in this article that three questions are likely to shape the future success (or failure) of the global climate change investment and finance architecture.

Specifically, the review focused on identifying the nature and extent of biophysical impacts in semi-arid zones, mega-deltas and glacial-fed river basins. In total 139, peer-reviewed articles were reviewed, with a steady increase in relevant articles reported since 2006. Publications on the South Asian glacial-fed river basins were the most numerous followed by semi-arid areas and then deltas, with Central Asia and some African countries being the most under represented. The nature and extent of impacts varied for each hotspot area and were largely determined by the geographical context and intrinsic characteristics of each region. River basin publications were dominated by impacts concerning hydrology, highlighting the importance of glacial-fed water resources to downstream populations. Semi-arid regions were dominated by impacts to climate processes and impacts to livestock and vegetation highlighting the importance of rainfall to the ecosystems and the livelihoods of communities in these regions. In contrast, delta studies were dominated by a focus on hazards, predominantly coastal inundation, reflecting the concentration of populations and assets in these areas. Uncertainties associated with the biophysical impacts on these regions under a changing climate are documented and represent key knowledge gaps. Common information gaps for all hotspot regions were the need for improved hydro-meteorological monitoring systems. The development of climate change adaptation strategies and policies should be supported by a sound knowledge and understanding of the full range of biophysical impacts, which are characteristic to each geographical location.","Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Geol, Dublin 2, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Kilroy, G (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Geol, Dublin 2, Ireland.",garrettkilroy@gmail.com,,,United Kingdom's Department for International Development; Canada's International Development Research Centre under their initiative Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia,United Kingdom's Department for International Development; Canada's International Development Research Centre under their initiative Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia,This research was supported by the United Kingdom's Department for International Development and Canada's International Development Research Centre under their initiative Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia.,,109,39,39,1,63,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

CA, comprising minimum mechanical soil disturbance and no-tillage seeding, organic mulch cover, and crop diversification is now practised on some 125 million ha, corresponding to about 9% of the global arable cropped land. The area under CA is spread across all continents and many agro-ecologies, including the dry Mediterranean climate. Empirical and scientific evidence is presented to show that significant productivity, economic, social and environmental benefits exist that can be harnessed through the adoption of CA in the dry Mediterranean climates, including those in the CWANA region. The benefits include: higher productivity and income; climate change adaptation and reduced vulnerability to the erratic rainfall distribution; and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. CA is now spread across several Mediterranean climate countries outside the Mediterranean basin particularly in South America, South Africa and Australia. In the CWANA region, CA is perceived to be a powerful tool of sustainable land management but it has not yet taken off in a serious manner except in Kazakhstan. Research on CA in the CWANA region has shown that there are opportunities for CA adoption in rainfed and irrigated farming systems involving arable and perennial crops as well as livestock.

Four storage alternatives were evaluated during a storage period of eight weeks: climate-adapted sprinkling and dry-stored storage of debarked and undebarked spruce pulpwood. The quality of the pulps made from logs stored under sprinkled conditions were generally comparable to pulp made from fresh pulpwood with one important exception, they provided lower brightness. The majority of the brightness losses occurred during the last four weeks of storage while brightness changes during the First four weeks were relatively small.

Thus, it is not surprising that reintroducing beaver to watersheds from which they have been extirpated is an often-used restoration and climate-adaptation strategy. Identifying sites for reintroduction, however, requires detailed information about habitat factors-information that is not often available at broad spatial scales. Here we explore the potential for beaver relocation throughout the Snohomish River Basin in Washington, USA with a model that identifies some of the basic building blocks of beaver habitat suitability and does so by relying solely on remotely sensed data. More specifically, we developed a generalized intrinsic potential model that draws on remotely sensed measures of stream gradient, stream width, and valley width to identify where beaver could become established if suitable vegetation were to be present. Thus, the model serves as a preliminary screening tool that can be applied over relatively large extents. We applied the model to 5,019 stream km and assessed the ability of the model to correctly predict beaver habitat by surveying for beavers in 352 stream reaches. To further assess the potential for relocation, we assessed land ownership, use, and land cover in the landscape surrounding stream reaches with varying levels of intrinsic potential. Model results showed that 33% of streams had moderate or high intrinsic potential for beaver habitat. We found that no site that was classified as having low intrinsic potential had any sign of beavers and that beaver were absent from nearly three quarters of potentially suitable sites, indicating that there are factors preventing the local population from occupying these areas. Of the riparian areas around streams with high intrinsic potential for beaver, 38% are on public lands and 17% are on large tracts of privately-owned timber land. Thus, although there are a large number of areas that could be suitable for relocation and restoration using beavers, current land use patterns may substantially limit feasibility in these areas.","[Dittbrenner, Benjamin J.; Lawler, Joshua J.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Pollock, Michael M.] NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA; [Schilling, Jason W.] Tulalip Tribes Nat Resources, Tulalip, WA USA; [Olden, Julian D.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Torgersen, Christian E.] Univ Washington, US Geol Survey, Forest & Rangeland Ecosyst Sci Ctr, Cascadia Field Stn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Dittbrenner, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",castor@uw.edu,"Olden, Julian D/A-8535-2010","Olden, Julian/0000-0003-2143-1187; Dittbrenner, Benjamin/0000-0001-7980-5597","U.S Environmental Protection Agency's FY Noncompetitive Tribal Projects for Restoration and Protection of Puget Sound, Federal [PA-00J322-01]; Conservation, Research and Education Opportunities International's CREOi award","U.S Environmental Protection Agency's FY Noncompetitive Tribal Projects for Restoration and Protection of Puget Sound, Federal; Conservation, Research and Education Opportunities International's CREOi award","This research was funded by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency's FY 2011 Noncompetitive Tribal Projects for Restoration and Protection of Puget Sound, Federal Grant Number PA-00J322-01, to JWS & BJD; and Conservation, Research and Education Opportunities Internationals 2015 CREOi award to BJD. http://blogs.nwifc.org/psp/2015/02/final-progress-report-deliverables-22/ http://creoi.org/the-skykomish-beaver-project-building-educational-opportunities-for-aspiring-ecologists-2/ The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",,49,32,32,0,37,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,FEB 28,2018,13,2,,,,,,,e0192538,10.1371/journal.pone.0192538,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0192538,,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,FX7ND,29489853,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000426276000030,View Full Record in Web of Science

This often requires changes in institutions, which can be difficult to realize. Explicitly process-oriented approaches explaining how and why institutional change occurs are lacking. Overcoming this gap is vital to move beyond either input-oriented (e.g., capacity) or output-oriented (e.g., assessment) approaches, to understand how changes actually occur for addressing complex and contested governance issues. This paper analyses causal conditions and mechanisms by which institutions develop in climate adaptation governance. It focuses on urban climate governance through an in-depth case study of Santiago, Chile, over a 12-year period (2005-2017), drawing on primary and secondary data, including 26 semistructured interviews with policy, academic, and civil society actors. It identifies and explains a variety of institutional developments across multiple levels (i.e., programmatic, legislative, and constitutional), through a theory-centric process tracing methodology. This reveals a multiple-response pattern, involving several causal mechanisms and coexisting institutional logics. Findings suggest that although adaptation may be inherently protracted, institutions can nevertheless develop in both related and novel directions. Overall, the paper argues for a new research agenda on process-oriented theorizing and analysis in climate and environmental governance.","[Patterson, James] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Fac Geosci, Environm Governance, Vening Meineszgebouw A,Princetonlaan 8A, NL-3585 CB Utrecht, Netherlands; [de Voogt, Douwe L.] Open Univ Netherlands, Fac Management Sci & Technol, Dept Sci, Heerlen, Netherlands; [Sapiains, Rodolfo] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Dept Psicol, Santiago, Chile; [Sapiains, Rodolfo] Ctr Ciencia Clima & Resiliencia, CR 2 Ctr Climate Change & Resilience, Santiago, Chile",Utrecht University; Open University Netherlands; Universidad de Chile,"Patterson, J (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Fac Geosci, Environm Governance, Vening Meineszgebouw A,Princetonlaan 8A, NL-3585 CB Utrecht, Netherlands.",j.j.patterson@uu.nl,,"Patterson, James/0000-0002-4849-7613",H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions [659065]; European Union; CR(2) Centre for Climate Change and Resilience (Centro de Ciencia del Clima y la Resiliencia); Universidad de Chile; Marie Sklodowska-Curi [659065],H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions; European Union(European Commission); CR(2) Centre for Climate Change and Resilience (Centro de Ciencia del Clima y la Resiliencia); Universidad de Chile; Marie Sklodowska-Curi,"H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions, Grant/Award Number: 659065; Marie Sklodowska-Curi, Grant/Award Number: 659065; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; CR(2) Centre for Climate Change and Resilience (Centro de Ciencia del Clima y la Resiliencia); Universidad de Chile",,92,11,11,3,24,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",1756-932X,1756-9338,,ENVIRON POLICY GOV,Environ.

Despite the limited adaptation options often used and the largely subsistence agriculture practiced, studies have shown that smallholders have accumulated local knowledge about changes in climatic conditions. Farmers with field experience and an extensive stay in three sites in Palapye, eastern Botswana, were interviewed. This study related farmers' perceptions of changes in climate with results from analysis of climate data. Major changes perceived are a reduction in rainfall amount, rising temperature, and increasing frequency of drought conditions. Perceived reduction in rainfall amount is confirmed by analysis results as variability in rainfall amount is high throughout the series. Rainfall was poorly distributed and below average at the beginning of the cropping seasons for four years between 2013 and 2017. For 1990, 2003, and 2012, the standardized precipitation index (SPI) was -1.77 (severe drought), -1.37 (moderate drought), and -2.32 (extreme drought), respectively. To minimize impacts on crop production, farmers simultaneously planted different crops based on the perception that climatic impacts on different crops vary and favored crops perceived as drought resistant. Livestock farmers supplemented with livestock feeds, reduced herd size, and moved livestock to areas with better forage. Off-farm incomes from selling products harvested from the wild are important to farmers as a coping strategy, particularly when rain fails. Some female farmers brewed and sold alcohol made locally from sorghum. That local knowledge and perceptions exist and are used by smallholder farmers to adapt to climate change and variability is suggested. Engaging with local knowledge systems is an imperative for climate change policy making.","[Akinyemi, Felicia O.] Botswana Int Univ Sci & Technol, Earth & Environm Sci Dept, Coll Sci, Palapye, Botswana",,"Akinyemi, FO (corresponding author), Botswana Int Univ Sci & Technol, Earth & Environm Sci Dept, Coll Sci, Palapye, Botswana.",felicia.akinyemi@gmail.com,"Akinyemi, Felicia Olufunmilayo/L-8764-2017","Akinyemi, Felicia Olufunmilayo/0000-0001-6248-7430",Land Degradation Index Mapping (LDIMapping) project; U.

To date, the consequences of climate change have mostly been investigated at high levels of aggregation in space and time, such as countries and years. Detailed analyses are essential, however, because different regions are affected to varying degrees. Within a complex model incorporating feedback between various system components, such as hydrological and climatic processes as well as demography and economy, possible developments of various sectors are simulated in the Upper Danube watershed in central Europe. Using a multiagent approach, we rise to the challenge to take both socioeconomic and natural aspects into account and enable the simulation of human system reaction and adaptation to climate change. The presented approach is an adequate way to consider the fact that within human-environment systems, environmental changes influence human living conditions and vice versa. We use a multiagent system, in combination with different climate and societal scenarios, to investigate the supply-side operating ability of tourism facilities and the demand-side reactions. Thus, we can calculate the tourism water demand, which is not recorded in official statistics. We present and discuss selected results for ski areas, such as the regionally differentiated development of tourism water consumption and overnight stays' trends. With their high level of individualization, the tourism model simulation results foster the finding of economically reasonable investment strategies. In addition, the tourism model results give rise to future research, such as tourism demand-side examinations concerning the perception of climate change, and resulting behavioral shifts.","[Soboll, Anja; Schmude, Juergen] Univ Munich, Dept Geog, D-80333 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Soboll, A (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",anja.soboll@lmu.de; juergen.schmude@geographie.uni-muenchen.de,"Schmude, Juergen/K-1692-2013",,,,,,43,20,21,1,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-5608,1467-8306,,ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR,Ann.

A multi-city study covering different climatic zones is necessary to better understand regional differences in temperature risk on mortality in China. Methods: Sixty-six communities from 7 regions across China were included in this study. We first used a Distributed Lag Non-linear Model (DLNM) to estimate community-specific effects of temperature on non-accidental mortality during 2006-2011. A multivariate meta-analysis was then applied to pool the estimates of community-specific effects. Results: A U-shaped curve was observed between temperature and mortality at the national level in China, indicating both low and high temperatures were associated with increased mortality risk. The overall threshold was at about the 75th percentile of the pooled temperature distribution. The relative risk was 1.61 (95% CI: 1.48-1.74) for extremely cold temperature (1st percentile of temperature), and 1.21 (95% CI: 1.10-1.34) for extreme hot temperature (99th percentile of temperature) at lag 0-21 days. The temperature-mortality relationship is different for different regions. Compared with north China, south China had a higher minimum mortality temperature (MMT), and there was a larger cold effect in the more southern parts of China and a more pronounced hot effect in more northern parts. Conclusions: Both cold and hot temperatures increase mortality risk in China, and the relationship varies geographically. Our findings suggest that public health policies for climate change adaptation should be tailored to the local climate conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Under the inter-temporal household consumption smoothing model, this paper considers crop diversification as an ex ante measure to tackle permanent income shock from climate change. This paper examines empirically whether crop diversity is affected by climate change and how this diversity will respond to different climate scenarios. Negative binomial regression models are estimated from a nationally representative sample of 11,389 farmers across Bangladesh and 30-year average of seasonal climatic variables to find the effects of climatic variables on crop diversity. This paper finds that crop diversity is climate-sensitive and this diversity in different locations varies with climatic conditions. This research unveils structural instability between different single crosssectional models to simulate the effects of climatic variables on crop diversity. It also finds that increases in mean annual temperature by 1 degrees C by 2030 and 2.4 degrees C by 2100 have resulted in 26.40% and 149.83% increases in crop diversity compared to its baseline of 2010, respectively.

Empirical data on the design and performance of masonry buildings in Norway are presented, based on a comprehensive analysis of 302 process induced masonry defect assignments over a 20-year period from 1983 to 2002. Analyses of building defects are necessary in order to further develop tools, solutions and preventive measures ensuring high-performance building envelopes. The results illuminate the vulnerability of masonry under varying climatic exposure. The amount of masonry defects in Norway illustrates that it is not only the extreme weather events that need to be studied as a foundation for geographically dependent design guidelines. Driving rain and frost action are the principal climatic challenges to be considered in the pursuit of high-performance masonry structures. Shrinkage and thermal movement, the most frequent defect category, dominate independent of the climatic impact. Merely small errors or mistakes can bring about major and often irreparable defects or damage to masonry structuresA large part of the cases could have been avoided through more detailed engineering and applied knowledge on existing design guidelines.

Along with an increasing number of adaptation studies, there has been an increasing complexity of adaptation studies as practitioners attempt to plan the adaptation of whole communities, cities and in some cases nations. These studies are commonly underpinned by increasingly complex climate change vulnerability studies that also attempt to encompass concepts such as resilience and adaptive capacity. Owners and operators of infrastructure assets and networks also need to consider climate change. This need has been met by an increasing number of climate change risk and adaptation studies of major infrastructure. The approaches used for these assessments are commonly derived from assessments of whole communities and policy development studies, and apply terminology that is often inconsistent with established engineering asset management methods and approaches. As a result the uptake of these studies has been less than desirable in many cases. To this end, the work presented here proposes a set of principles for undertaking the assessment of climate changes impacts on assets and infrastructure.","[Gibbs, Mark T.] AECOM, 540 Wickham St, Fortitude Valley, Qld 4007, Australia",,"Gibbs, MT (corresponding author), AECOM, 540 Wickham St, Fortitude Valley, Qld 4007, Australia.",mark.gibbs@aecom.com,,,,,,,7,5,6,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1028-6608,1029-0249,,CIV ENG ENVIRON SYST,Civ.

In the face of dynamic and deep uncertainty about the future, flexible strategies which can be adapted in response to how the uncertainty is resolving are attractive. Traditional cost-benefit analysis cannot account for the value created through optionality. ROA sets out to amend this. There are however several profound problems with how ROA tries to do this. It is typically not clear what is the baseline plan, without options, against which value is to be estimated. Different baselines significantly change option value. Even if option value can unequivocally be established for a given scenario, ROA relies on expected values over a set of scenarios. First, this requires assigning weights, or probabilities, to scenarios. Given the long-time horizon involved in climate adaptation, these probabilities are meaningless. Second, the expected value over a set of scenarios need not obtain in any single scenario and is thus not a meaningful summary of option value.

This research aims to identify the best resilient cooling solutions that should be promoted in the built environment of extremely hot countries to increase their heat resilience capacity. The impact of climate change on climate zones, cooling thermal demand (kWh/m2), and indoor heat discomfort hours (DHh, hours) in buildings is evaluated in different extremely hot dry climates of southern Asia through a parametric analysis for 2020, 2050 and 2080 under the A2 (medium-high) emission scenario. Then, cooling alternatives with higher synergies and trade-offs between energy efficiency (energy consumption) and resiliency to extreme heat (passive survivability) are highlighted. TRNSYS simulation software and ASHRAE criteria were used to characterise climate zones and calculate buildings' cooling needs and discomfort hours. Pakistan, in southern Asia, was selected as a hot reference region characterised by various climatic regions. The simulated scenario shows how Pakistan's extremely hot dry climate surface may increase from 36.9 % to 78.1 % by 2080, increasing annual cooling needs ranging from 20.56 to 66.96 kWh/m2 and indoor discomfort hours ranging from 423 to 1267 h. The results demonstrate how the passive solutions with higher synergies between energy savings and indoor comfort hours are, in decreasing order, ventilative cooling, reflective and ventilated roofs, shading in windows, and roof insulation. They can provide energy savings ranging from 13.1 to 7.1 kWh/m2 while reducing indoor discomfort by 320 to 131 h for extremely hot climates. Moreover, the sufficiency action related to higher thermostat settings, from 24 to 25. C to 25-26.5.C, was the most effective strategy to decrease energy demand. Additionally, there are trade-offs between energy-saving and heat resilience with highly insulated alternatives when ventilation is not adequately addressed. Despite increasing energy savings by 14.4 kWh/m2, discomfort hours are increased by 256 hours when air conditioning is unavailable, increasing building overheating by 5.1 %.","[Mehmood, Sajid; Maximov, Serguey A.; Friedrich, Daniel] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Energy Syst, Sch Engn, Edinburgh EH9 3DW, Midlothian, Scotland; [Mehmood, Sajid] Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Mech Mechatron & Mfg Engn, New Campus, Lahore, Pakistan; [Lizana, Jesus] Univ Oxford, Dept Engn Sci, Oxford OX1 3PJ, England; [Lizana, Jesus] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Future Cooling Programme, Oxford OX1 3BD, England; [Nunez-Peiro, Miguel] Univ Politecn Madrid, Escuela Tecn Super Arquitectura, Avda Juan de Herrera 4, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",University of Edinburgh; University of Engineering & Technology Lahore; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; ETS de Arquitectura,"Friedrich, D (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Energy Syst, Sch Engn, Edinburgh EH9 3DW, Midlothian, Scotland.",D.Friedrich@ed.ac.uk,"Lizana, Jesus/N-2272-2018","Lizana, Jesus/0000-0002-1802-5017; Mehmood, Sajid/0000-0002-8849-699X; Maximov Gajardo, Serguey/0000-0003-0665-6740; Nunez Peiro, Miguel/0000-0002-3895-6791",Higher Education Commission (HEC),Higher Education Commission (HEC)(Higher Education Commission of Pakistan),"Sajid Mehmood acknowledges the financial support from the Higher Education Commission (HEC) , Pakistan, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore (New Campus) , Pakistan, and the UK ESRC Cool infrastructure project (ES/T008091/1) .

We selected the territory of the Mont-Emilius and Mont-Cervin Mountain Communities (northern Italy) as the study area. To define summary variables related to landslide predisposing and triggering processes, we investigated the relationships between landslide occurrences and intense rainfall and snowmelt events (period 1991-2020). For landslide susceptibility mapping, we set up a Generalized Additive Model. We defined a reference model through variable penalization (relief, NDVI, land cover and geology predictors). Similarly, we optimized a model including the climate variables, checking their smooth functions to ensure physical plausibility. Finally, we validated the optimized model through a k-fold cross-validation and performed an evaluation based on contingency tables, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and variable importance (decrease in explained variance). The climate variables that resulted as being statistically and physically significant are the effective annual number of rainfall events with intensity-duration characteristics above a defined threshold (EAT(ean)) and the average number of melting events occurring in a hydrological year (MEn). In the optimized model, EAT(ean) and MEn accounted for 5% of the explained deviance. Compared to the reference model, their introduction led to an increase in true positive rate and AUROC of 2.4% and 0.8%, respectively. Also, their inclusion caused a transition of the vulnerability class in 11.0% of the study area. The k-fold validation confirmed the statistical significance and physical plausibility of the meteorological variables in 74% (EAT(ean)) and 93% (MEn) of the fitted models. Our results demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach to introduce process-related, non-stationary, physically-plausible climate variables within a shallow landslide susceptibility analysis. Not only do the variables improve the model performance, but they make it adaptable to map the future evolution of landslide susceptibility including climate changes. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Accordingly, it is expected that water scarcity in the region will be higher with drastic shifts of hydrological and erosive watershed responses. In Tunisia, wheat yields have been variable over the years and arc lower than the potential yields. In response, the adoption of conservation agriculture (CA), introduced into Tunisia in 1999 to help adaptation to climate change, has resulted in a substantial reduction in agricultural productivity. CA areas increased from 52 ha in 1999 to 14,000 ha in 2015. Using a modelling approach, the present paper evaluates the potential of CA to adapt wheat-based-systems to climate change in Tunisia. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model was used to predict the effect of tillage (conventional tillage [CT] vs. zero-tillage [ZT] and soil residue retention [ZT-RR]) on wheat productivity and soil fertility. Two contrasting locations in Tunisia were studied; one semi-arid (Kef) and one sub-humid (Bizerte). Results showed that the sustainable production of durum wheat under climate change conditions in Tunisia is possible through the adoption of CA practices (ZT and ZT-RR) in both sub-humid and semi-arid areas. In fact, mulching (residue retention) is more effective than CT (under semi-arid and sub-humid conditions) in enhancing wheat yield (15%), water use efficiency (18% and 13%) and soil organic carbon accumulation (0.13 t ha(-1) year(-1) and 0.18 t ha(-1) year(-1)). It is also more effective for soil resilience - preventing water erosion (1.7 t ha(-1) year(-1) and 4.6 t ha(-1) year(-1) of soil loss). The present study allowed identification of 260,000 ha as priority areas for CA adoption; this represent one-third of the total cereal area in Tunisia. Appropriate evaluation of the benefits of CA on sustainable agricultural intensification would provide more arguments for effectively supporting CA adoption in Tunisia. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the Midi-Pyrenees (south-western France), maize is the main irrigated crop, and increasing pressure on water resources challenges the appropriateness of this crop in the region. In this study we evaluated the impact of temperature and precipitation changes on the sowing and harvesting period of maize and, consequently, on the suitability of cultivar earliness to this sowing-harvest window in the future. Next, we quantified the yield and irrigation requirements of three earliness choices (early, medium and late) for the appropriate sowing-harvest window. We ran three simulation models with climate-change scenarios. The first (a sowing model) predicts the days suitable for sowing maize, the second (MODERATO) predicts yield and irrigation requirements for all suitable sowing days, and the third (a harvest model) predicts the days suitable for harvesting. We ran these models with a simulated weather data series covering the reference period (1971-2000) and two future periods (2021-2050 and 2071-2100) for the study area. We also calculated climatic and agronomic indices to understand changes in maize sowing days, the maize growing period and suitable earliness choice due to climate change for the two future periods compared to the reference period. The results showed an increase in thermal time and decrease in rainfall in the future that will influence maize earliness choice, growing period, yield and irrigation requirements. The trade-off between farmers' maize earliness choices and suitable maize growing periods will increase in the future. Late-earliness maize cultivars can be cultivated in the future; however, the associated irrigation requirements also will be higher. Farmers need to cope with climate-induced water scarcity in the future by selecting a suitable sowing date, maize earliness and soil type to cultivate maize. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It defines the length and quality of the tourist season and plays a major role in destination choices and revenues. The Mediterranean is coincidentally one of the most visited tourist destinations and sensitive areas to climate change worldwide. Social, economic and environmental adaptation to climate change in this region should necessarily evaluate the Mediterranean and European climate resource for beach-based tourism as well as its projected changes. To this end, the second-generation climate index for tourism (CIT) has been adopted. ERA-Interim reanalysis have been used as the regional observed baseline, thus providing daily atmospheric data to derive CIT. For projections, meteorological variables have been obtained from a set of regional climate models (RCMs) within the ENSEMBLES European project. A quantile-quantile adjustment has been applied to the CIT cumulative distribution functions based on each individual RCM output to properly correct biases at regional and local scales. Furthermore, an ensemble strategy is adopted to further cope with uncertainties arising from RCM errors and boundary conditions. The spatial distribution of present climate potential confirms the Mediterranean coast as the most suitable region in Europe for carrying out beach leisure activities. Excellent climatic conditions prevail in most of this coastal region during summer. However, the optimal climate asset is projected to noticeably deteriorate in summer across the Mediterranean, whereas only slightly improving in northwestern Europe by 2075-2094. On the other hand, a general enhancement of ideal climate potential is expected for the shoulder seasons in the former region. That is, optimal climatic conditions may shift from the present peak demand season to spring and autumn. These potential impacts might lead to important drawbacks for the current strongly seasonal-adjusted beach-based tourism industry in the Mediterranean. Therefore, main tourism stakeholders will likely need to face these challenges through adaptation and mitigation strategies.","[Amengual, A.; Homar, V.; Romero, R.; Ramis, C.; Alonso, S.] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Fis, Grp Meteorol, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Mallorca, Spain; [Alonso, S.] Inst Mediterrani Estudis Avancats, Dept Recerca Canvi Global, Palma De Mallorca, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); ATTITUS Educacao,"Amengual, A (corresponding author), Univ Illes Balears, Dept Fis, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Mallorca, Spain.",arnau.amengual@uib.es,"Amengual, Arnau/L-2783-2014; Homar Santaner, Victor/K-2678-2014","Homar Santaner, Victor/0000-0003-1459-2003; Amengual, Arnau/0000-0002-6108-2850; Romero, Romualdo/0000-0002-9091-8688; Ramis, Climent/0000-0001-6492-1309","Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Inovacion [CGL2008-01271/CLI, CGL2011-24458]; ESTCENA project [200800050084078]; Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Medio Rural y Marino; European Commission [GOCE-CT-2003-505539]","Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Inovacion(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); ESTCENA project; Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Medio Rural y Marino(Spanish Government); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre)","The authors thank the two anonymous reviewers whose valuable comments helped to considerably improve the content and presentation of this manuscript.

It was instituted for the purpose of intensifying the alliance between the Manchus and the Mongols and improving riding and shooting skills of the Bannermen. Along with another activity, Chengde Bishu (escaping the summer heat in Chengde), Mulan Qiuxian was frequently held during the early and mid Qing dynasty (1683-1820). Many factors have been discussed to explain the decline of Mulan Qiuxian at the turn of the 19th century, but not the impact of climate. In this study, historical documents were used to reconstruct annual time series for the duration of Qiuxian and Bishu from 1683 to 1820 to quantitatively describe their rise and decline and analyse the correlation with climate change. It was found that Qiuxian and Bishu were originally instituted by the Kangxi emperor in 1683-1722 and flourished in the reign of the Qianlong emperor in 1741-1787, both included in a relatively warm period of the Little Ice Age in North China. Qiuxian and Bishu declined from 1788 to 1820 when the climate turned sharply colder and wetter. The impacts of long-term climate change and abrupt bad weather on Qiuxian and Bishu were analysed respectively, and it was concluded that although climate was not the decisive factor, compared with the political intentions of the decision makers, the economic and financial situation of the empire, and the personal devotion of the emperors, climate change did play an important role as an accelerator in the rise and decline of Qiuxian and Bishu. To some extent, some of the behaviours and decisions of the Qing court during this historical period could also be regarded as human adaptations to climate change. Thus, this study not only adds detail to a well-known historical event, but it also adds benefit to the scientific understanding of the interactive mechanisms between climate and humans in the past.

On the other hand, its productivity is adversely affected by climatic changes mainly due to the absence or non-adoption of effective and modern mitigation and adaptation strategies. The geographical locations and socio-economic conditions of developing countries make livestock herders, especially the smaller ones, more vulnerable while their capabilities to mitigate the adverse effects with limited resources will exacerbate the situation in the future. Most of the efforts to face climatic changes are directed at crop sector while only a few studies document such actions to safeguard livestock sector with similar focus notwithstanding the huge impact of these stimuli on this sub-sector of agriculture. This study uses propensity score matching (PSM) to assess the causal impact of climate change adaptation strategies on livestock losses and poverty by using the primary data set of 405 small livestock herders of Punjab, Pakistan. The PSM analysis points towards a massive potential for reducing these losses. The livestock losses and poverty index are shown to decline respectively by 30-48% and 4-22% for the farmers adopting a mix of mitigation strategies. Such outcome is believed to sustain environment and livestock herders' well-being. Results indicate that livestock herders easily adopt those strategies that have greater linkages with accessibility and resource availability. Study reveals the significance of improving infrastructure for speedy access to information, resources and uninterrupted flow of veterinary services. The vet personnel also need to be equipped with precise statistics of disease existence, impacts, dispersal, and costs for control by restructuring and advancing data collection efforts that would entail coherent policy formulation amidst evidence-based outcomes. The results do imply allocation of huge investment in the information delivery system; competitive institutional services and particular safeguarding of the resource-poor farmers to sustain livelihoods, food security and rural development.","[Faisal, Muhammad; Xia, Chunping] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Abbas, Azhar] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Faisalabad 38040, Pakistan; [Akhtar, Shoaib] Barani Agr Res Inst BARI, Ctr Excellence Olive Res & Training CEFORT, Chakwal, Pakistan; [Ajmal, Muhammad Arslan] Govt Coll Univ, Dept Econ, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan; [Mushtaq, Zulqarnain] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Cai, Yi] South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Digital Countryside Res Inst, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China; [Raza, Muhammad Haseeb] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Business Management Sci, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan",Huazhong Agricultural University; University of Agriculture Faisalabad; Government College University Faisalabad; Xi'an Jiaotong University; South China Agricultural University; University of Agriculture Faisalabad,"Xia, CP (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Cai, Y (corresponding author), South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Digital Countryside Res Inst, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China.",faisalgurmani@gmail.com; Azhar.Abbas@uaf.edu.pk; xcp@mail.hzau.edu.cn; haseebrizvi00@yahoo.com; shoaibakhtar1799@gmail.com; arslan.gogo7@gmail.com; Zulqarnain@stu.xjtu.edu.cn; caiyi@scau.edu.cn,"Raza, Muhammad Haseeb/AEP-9693-2022; Akhtar, Shoaib/AAC-9327-2022; Abbas, Azhar/H-9311-2019; Mushtaq, Zulqarnain/ABF-4541-2020","Raza, Muhammad Haseeb/0000-0002-3555-1377; Abbas, Azhar/0000-0003-4922-5959; Mushtaq, Zulqarnain/0000-0002-9317-8224","Youth Project of Guangdong Provincial Department of Education [2020WQNCX006, 4700-220140]",Youth Project of Guangdong Provincial Department of Education,This research was supported by The Youth Project of Guangdong Provincial Department of Education (2020WQNCX006) and the special funds for the development of high level universities (4700-220140) .,,68,8,8,5,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

Conservation agriculture represents a set of three crop management principles that has received strong international support to help address this challenge(5,6), with recent conservation agriculture efforts focusing on smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia(7). However, conservation agriculture is highly debated, with respect to both its effects on crop yields(8-10) and its applicability in different farming contexts(7,11-13). Here we conduct a global meta-analysis using 5,463 paired yield observations from 610 studies to compare no-till, the original and central concept of conservation agriculture, with conventional tillage practices across 48 crops and 63 countries. Overall, our results show that no-till reduces yields, yet this response is variable and under certain conditions no-till can produce equivalent or greater yields than conventional tillage. Importantly, when no-till is combined with the other two conservation agriculture principles of residue retention and crop rotation, its negative impacts are minimized. Moreover, no-till in combination with the other two principles significantly increases rainfed crop productivity in dry climates, suggesting that it may become an important climate-change adaptation strategy for ever-drier regions of the world. However, any expansion of conservation agriculture should be done with caution in these areas, as implementation of the other two principles is often challenging in resource-poor and vulnerable smallholder farming systems, thereby increasing the likelihood of yield losses rather than gains. Although farming systems are multifunctional, and environmental and socio-economic factors need to be considered(14-16), our analysis indicates that the potential contribution of no-till to the sustainable intensification of agriculture is more limited than often assumed.","[Pittelkow, Cameron M.; Linquist, Bruce A.; Lundy, Mark E.; van Kessel, Chris] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Liang, Xinqiang] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [van Groenigen, Kees Jan; van Gestel, Natasja] No Arizona Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Soc, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Lee, Juhwan; Six, Johan] ETH, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Venterea, Rodney T.] ARS, USDA, Soil & Water Management Unit, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Venterea, Rodney T.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Soil Water & Climate, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; Zhejiang University; Northern Arizona University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Pittelkow, CM (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Crop Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",cmpitt@illinois.edu,"van Groenigen, Kees Jan/Q-7081-2018; six, johan/J-5228-2015; Venterea, Rodney T/A-3930-2009","van Groenigen, Kees Jan/0000-0002-9165-3925; six, johan/0000-0001-9336-4185; Lee, Juhwan/0000-0002-7967-2955; Lundy, Mark/0000-0003-4043-0841; Pittelkow, Cameron/0000-0001-8654-9552",National Key Science and Technology Project of China [2014ZX07101-012],National Key Science and Technology Project of China,We are grateful to the National Key Science and Technology Project of China for supporting X.Q.L. with grant number 2014ZX07101-012.,,31,763,797,71,1086,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,JAN 15,2015,517,7534,,,,,365,U482,,10.1038/nature13809,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature13809,,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,AY8NK,25337882,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000347810300045,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore management approaches are required that can better deal with its complexity and uncertainty, which are further exacerbated by developments such as climate change. Adaptive comanagement (ACM) has emerged as a relatively novel governance approach and potential solution to the challenges arising. Adaptive comanagement hinges on certain institutional prescriptions intended to enhance the adaptability of management by improving the comprehension of and response to the complex context and surprises of social-ecological systems. The ACM literature describes that for enhanced adaptability, institutional arrangements should be polycentric, aligned with the scale of ecosystems (the bioregional approach), feature open and participatory governance, and involve much experimentation. The case of flood management in the German part of the Rhine basin is used to provide an assessment of these ideas. We analyze whether and to what degree the prescriptions have been implemented and whether or not certain fundamental changes seen in German flood management can be traced back to the application of the prescriptions. Our study demonstrates a transition from the traditional engineering and flood control approach to a more holistic management concept based on a risk perspective. In this process, the four ACM prescriptions have made an important contribution in preparing or facilitating policy changes. The findings suggest that the application of the prescriptions requires the right supporting context before they can be applied to the fullest extent possible, such as a high problem pressure, new discourses, or leading actors. A major constraint arises in the misalignment of political power and of the different interests of the actors, which contribute to reactive management and inadequate interplay. To address this, we recommend further analysis of the role of coordinated and long term planning. This might reveal evidence to overcome institutional coordination failures, improve knowledge transfer and communication, and increase adoption of the ACM prescriptions, with the aim to enhance adaptability of the system.","[Becker, Gert; Huitema, Dave; Aerts, Jeroen C.

Positive actions are underway at multiple, smaller scales to start the process of climate change mitigation.

Managed retreat is one potential adaptation strategy to proactively plan for large-scale climate-related displacements. There is, however, evidence that in many cases managed retreat has had problematic social impacts and that it has frequently been implemented through top-down models of planning. In response, this article reviews the literature on managed retreat to identify the limitations of current practices and the challenges for a more environmentally just approach. Based on this review, the article argues that a coproduction approach would provide a means to help address key planning challenges in this field. This involves collecting local knowledge of the risks posed by climate hazards and/or retreat, creating a connection between local knowledge and institutional mechanisms for supported relocation and facilitating community-led processes of retreat and redevelopment.

Agroforestry ecosystem services, such as micro-climate buffering, have received growing attention from the academic and policy communities for alleviating the negative impacts of climate change on smallholders. These benefits imply that agroforestry could offer a suitable measure for adaptation to climate change. However, whether agroforestry systems themselves succumb to the adverse effects of climate change is often less studied in the agroforestry literature. Consequently, less is known about how climate change will impact agroforests. We conducted a systematic review, which included an evidence quality assessment, to examine the impacts of climate change on tropical agroforestry systems (TAFS). Based primarily on studies undertaking biophysical approaches, we found that climate change negatively impacts TAFS by reducing tree growth, intensifying tree-crop resource competition and reducing crop yields. However, the impacts on smallholder farmers are less clear due to limited evidence in the relevant literature. We found that the evidence supporting our findings is mostly robust , although least robust  strength evidence was also commonly found. We conclude that to improve understanding of how climate change could affect the performance of TAFS as a social ecological system, more interdisciplinary studies are required. Furthermore, to improve the quality of evidence in the research field, studies should explore using mountain elevation gradients for climate analog analysis to perform the most robust study designs. We provide an interdisciplinary conceptual model, which considers the interactions and feedbacks between TAFS components noted from our review to predict the response of ecosystem services provisioning and farmers' wellbeing to climate change, to guide interdisciplinary studies using climate analog analysis.","[Watts, Martin; Hutton, Craig; Suckall, Natalie] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Southampton, England; [Guel, Erik O.

One of the solutions to these problems could be the use of biostimulant products that are rich in amino acids (AAs), which substitute and/or complement conventional fertilizers and help plants adapt to climate change. To formulate these products, it is first necessary to understand the role of the application of AAs (individually or as a mixture) in the physiological and metabolic processes of crops. For this, research was conducted to assess the effects of the application of different amino acids (Aspartic acid (Asp), Glutamic acid (Glu), L-Alanine (Ala) and their mixtures Asp + Glu and Asp + Glu + Ala on tomato seedlings (Solanum lycopersicum L.). To understand the effect of these treatments, morphological, physiological, ionomic and metabolomic studies were performed. The results showed that the application of Asp + Glu increased the growth of the plants, while those plants that received Ala had a decreased dry biomass of the shoots. The greatest increase in the growth of the plants with Asp + Glu was related with the increase in the net CO2 assimilation, the increase of proline, isoleucine and glucose with respect to the rest of the treatments. These data allow us to conclude that there is a synergistic effect between Aspartic acid and Glutamic acid, and the amino acid Alanine produces phytotoxicity when applied at 15 mM. The application of this amino acid altered the synthesis of proline and the pentose-phosphate route, and increased GABA and trigonelline.","[Alfosea-Simon, Marina; Simon-Grao, Silvia; Maria Camara-Zapata, Jose; Simon, Inmaculada; Jose Martinez-Nicolas, Juan; Lidon, Vicente] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Escuela Politecn Super Orihuela, Orihuela, Spain; [Simon-Grao, Silvia; Garcia-Sanchez, Francisco] CSIC, Ctr Edafol & Biol Aplicada Segura, Murcia, Spain; [Alejandro Zavala-Gonzalez, Ernesto] Dept I D Atlantica Agr, Villena, Spain",Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro de Edafologia y Biologia Aplicada del Segura (CEBAS),"Garcia-Sanchez, F (corresponding author), CSIC, Ctr Edafol & Biol Aplicada Segura, Murcia, Spain.",fgs@cebas.csic.es,"Cámara-Zapata, José-María/L-5923-2014; Lidon, Vicente/L-1269-2014; Garcia-Sanchez, Francisco/C-5966-2009","Cámara-Zapata, José-María/0000-0003-1118-9526; Garcia-Sanchez, Francisco/0000-0002-5884-4818; Alfosea Simon, Marina/0000-0002-9589-0848","State R&D Program Oriented to the Challenges of the Society, Innovation and Science Ministerial (Spain Government) [RTC-2016-4568-2]","State R&D Program Oriented to the Challenges of the Society, Innovation and Science Ministerial (Spain Government)","This research was funded by State R&D Program Oriented to the Challenges of the Society, Innovation and Science Ministerial (Spain Government), grant number RTC-2016-4568-2.",,52,18,18,8,28,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

To tackle malnutrition, fast-growing lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, environmental concerns like climate change, land and water scarcity, and poverty, we need to incorporate dietary and on-farm diversity. These issues should be treated in unison, but also with more holistic solutions. Mainstreaming traditional Smart Foods back as staples across Africa and Asia is part of the Smart Food approach. Smart Foods are food items that fulfill the criteria of being good for you, the planet, and the farmer. Sorghum and millet were selected as the first Smart Foods and a participatory fun-filled approach was adopted to create awareness, to develop culturally acceptable products, and to bring about behavior change to improve adoption, dietary diversity, and nutritional status. Smart Food piloted these activities in Myanmar to understand its potential on the consumer market. Smart Food was promoted in different countries through social media competitions in Mali, cooking shows in Kenya and India, recipe development by popular chefs in Paris and London, as well as school feeding programs in Tanzania and India, and an international millet festival in Niger. As a case study in Myanmar, we compared two approaches to introduce Smart Food - one which directly introduces new products and one which takes a culturally sensitive participatory and inclusive approach. The later approach resulted in the development of 27 recipes, in contrast with the former approach, which accepted only 3 of the 13 products tested. The 27 products developed locally exhibited superior nutrient values compared to usual rice porridge. The Smart Food initiative is demonstrating the potential to make a difference in society and for the environment, thus contributing to a major impact on leading global issues such as dietary diversity, improved nutritional status, and adapting to climate change.

MAR has been used in Spain in combination with other measures of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) to mitigate and adapt to Climate Change (CC) challenges. The main effects of CC are that the rising of the average atmospheric temperature together with the decreasing average annual precipitation rate cause extreme weather and induce sea level rise. These pattern results in a series of negative impacts reflected in an increase of certain events or parameters, such as evaporation, evapotranspiration, water demand, fire risk, run-off, floods, droughts, and saltwater intrusion; and a decrease of others such as availability of water resources, the wetland area, and the hydro-electrical power production. Solutions include underground storage, lowering the temperature, increasing soil humidity, reclaimed water infiltration, punctual and directed infiltration, self-purification and naturalization, off-river storage, wetland restoration and/or establishment, flow water distribution by gravity, power saving, eventual recharge of extreme flows, multi-annual management and positive barrier wells against saline water intrusion. The main advantages and disadvantages for each MAR solution have been addressed. As success must be measured, some indicators have been designed or adopted and calculated to quantify the actual effect of these solutions and their evolution. They have been expressed in the form of volumes, lengths, areas, percentages, grades, euros, CO2 emissions, and years. Therefore, MAR in Spain demonstrably supports its usefulness in battling CC adverse impacts in a broad variety of environments and circumstances. This situation is comparable to other countries where MAR improvements have also been assessed.","[Fernandez Escalante, Enrique; Calero Gil, Rodrigo] Tragsa, Innovat Subdirectorate, Maldonado 58, Madrid 28006, Spain; [Sebastian Sauto, Jon San] Tragsatec, Architecture & Enginering Area, Julian Camarillo 6b, Madrid 28037, Spain",,"Escalante, EF (corresponding author), Tragsa, Innovat Subdirectorate, Maldonado 58, Madrid 28006, Spain.",efernan6@tragsa.es; jsss@tragsa.es; rcalero@tragsa.es,,"Fernandez-Escalante, Enrique/0000-0001-9278-7151; San Sebastian Sauto, Jon/0000-0002-5312-9583","H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions [CA 814,066]",H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions,"This research was funded by H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions, CA 814,066.",,23,8,8,1,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2019,11,9,,,,,,,1943,10.3390/w11091943,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11091943,,,18,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,JB8PJ,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000488834400206,View Full Record in Web of Science

Guiding human activities based on the optimization of ecosystem services can help humans adapt to climate change effectively, which is vital for regional sustainability. We evaluated the distribution of five ecosystem services: net primary productivity (NPP), soil conservation (SC), water yield (WY), water retention (WR), and livestock supply in the grassland and agro-pastoral transitional zone of China (GAPTZ) under the future climate scenarios of representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 in 2050. We designed the four grazing-intensity scenarios of ungrazed (UG), lightly grazed (LG), moderately grazed (MG), and heavily grazed (HG) and analyzed the impacts of climate change and grazing on the ecosystem services. Finally, we presented the optimization schemes of grazing intensity in the GAPTZ under the objectives of strong sustainability and weak sustainability. Strong sustainability objective means that the total change rate of ecosystem services compared to the ungrazed scenario is maximal and should not be less than 0. Weak sustainability objective means that the livestock supply is preferential and the total change rate of ecosystem services compared to the ungrazed scenario is maximal but could be less than 0. The results showed that both climate change and grazing exert great influence on the supply and interrelation of ecosystem services. In the northeast of the GAPTZ, LG and MG can stimulate grassland to tiller and enlarge ecosystem services integrally. HG has the severest negative effect on ecosystem services overall. Under the weak sustainability objective, LG can be widely adopted in the GAPTZ. Under the strong sustainability objective, grazing should be limited in the northwestern and north central GAPTZ. Reasonable planning of grazing intensity and its spatial patterns can promote effective utilization of grassland resource and realization of regional sustainability.","[Hao, Ruifang; Yu, Deyong] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Coll Resources Sci & Technol,CHESS, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Hao, Ruifang] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Forestry University,"Yu, DY (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, CHESS, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",hrf@mail.bnu.edu.cn; dyyucas@163.com,,,Programs of National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571170]; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2014CB954301]; Fund for Creative Research Groups of National Natural Science Foundation of China [41621061]; Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities [B08008]; Project of State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resources Ecology,Programs of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(National Basic Research Program of China); Fund for Creative Research Groups of National Natural Science Foundation of China; Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities; Project of State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resources Ecology,"This research was supported by the Programs of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.41571170), National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (No. 2014CB954301), the Fund for Creative Research Groups of National Natural Science Foundation of China(No. 41621061), Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities (Grant No. B08008), and the Project of State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resources Ecology.

Information of this kind for the future is only readily available for a few developed country regions of the world. For many less-developed regions, it is often difficult to find series of observed daily weather data to assist in planning decisions. This study applies a previously developed single-site weather generator (WG) to the Caribbean, using examples from Belize in the west to Barbados in the east. The purpose of this development is to provide users in the region with generated sequences of possible future daily weather that they can use in a number of impact sectors. The WG is first calibrated for a number of sites across the region and the goodness of fit of the WG against the daily station observations assessed. Particular attention is focussed on the ability of the precipitation component of the WG to generate realistic extreme values for the calibration or control period. The WG is then modified using change factors (CFs) derived from regional climate model projections (control and future) to simulate future 30-year scenarios centred on the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. Changes between the control period and the three futures are illustrated not just by changes in average temperatures and precipitation amounts but also by a number of well-used measures of extremes (very warm days/nights, the heaviest 5-day precipitation total in a month, counts of the number of precipitation events above specific thresholds and the number of consecutive dry days).","[Jones, P.

However, few studies paid attention to GW saving behaviours. To address this, we surveyed GW users (N = 338) to investigate factors influencing current GW saving attitudes and how GW saving behaviour is shaped in the community through the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Participants were asked about the perception of their GW saving and water saving intentional behaviour. The probit regression use deployed explore factors influencing water users' perception of GW saving. Structural Equation Model (SEM) was also used to construct the TPB variables to investigate psychological factors influencing GW saving intention behaviour. The findings show water users in the agricultural sector (8 =-0.98, p = 0.01) are negative with GW saving bahavior. Changing to the users in the agricultural sector, the self-perception of GW saving tends to decrease in z-score by 0.98 at a statistical significance level. Awareness of GW extraction impacts (8 = 0.89, p = 0.002), GW adequate knowledge and information (8 = 1.16, p = 0.015) and GW tariff (8 = 0.78, p = 0.02) have strongly influenced GW saving behaviour. The GW saving intentional behaviour has been influenced by sub-jective norms (8 = 0.52, p < 0.001) and perceived behavioral control (8 = 0.21, p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that GW policy options should pay attention to GW tariff application, awareness raising about GW impacts, GW knowledge dissemination to control GW abstraction in the community and enhance GW water saving attitude and behaviour in the community. The study also appeals to the engagement of local community in water governance to increase the social pressures on water-saving changing behaviors.","[Muenratch, Preeyaporn; Nguyen, Thi Phuoc Lai] Asian Inst Technol, Sch Environm Resources & Dev, Dept Dev & Sustainabil, Pathum Thani, Thailand",Asian Institute of Technology,"Nguyen, TPL (corresponding author), Asian Inst Technol, Sch Environm Resources & Dev, Dept Dev & Sustainabil, Pathum Thani, Thailand.",phuoclai@ait.asia,,"Nguyen, Thi Phuoc Lai/0000-0003-2827-5762",Royal Thai Government (RTG) scholarship; Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) under the SUMERNET 4 All - Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA); Department of Groundwater Resources and Land Development Department in Thailand,Royal Thai Government (RTG) scholarship; Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) under the SUMERNET 4 All - Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA); Department of Groundwater Resources and Land Development Department in Thailand,This research was funded by the Royal Thai Government (RTG) scholarship and carried out within the project Strengthening Ground-water Governance in Rapidly Urbanizing Areas of the Lower Mekong Region (GIRA) funded by Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) under the SUMERNET 4 All funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA).

In the context of global climate change, the understanding and quantification of the impact of weather factors on human health are particularly critical to the development and implementation of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. The aim of this study was to quantify the attributable burden of a combined bioclimatic indicator (apparent temperature) on HFMD and to identify temperature-specific sensitive populations. A total of 123,622 HFMD cases were included in the study. The non-linear relationship between apparent temperature and the incidence of HFMD was approximately M-shaped, with hot weather being more likely to be attributable than cold conditions, of which moderately hot accounting for the majority of cases (21,441, 17.34%). Taking the median apparent temperature (19.2 degrees C) as reference, the cold effect showed a short acute effect with the highest risk on the day of lag 0 (RR = 1.086, 95% CI: 1.024 similar to 1.152), whereas the hot effect lasted longer with the greatest risk at a lag of 7 days (RR= 1.081, 95% CI: 1.059 similar to 1.104). Subgroup analysis revealed that males, children under 3 years old, and scattered children tended to be more vulnerable to HFMD in hot weather, while females, those aged 3 similar to 5 years, and nursery children were sensitive to cold conditions. This study suggests that high temperatures have a greater impact on HFMD than low temperatures as well as lasting longer, of particular concern being moderately high temperatures rather than extreme temperatures. Early intervention takes on greater importance during cold days, while the duration of HFMD intervention must be longer during hot days.","[Meng, Lijun; Zhou, Cui; Yao, Meng; Li, Xingli] Cent South Univ, Xiang Ya Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Hlth Stat, Changsha 410078, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Chunliang; Xu, Yiqing; Liu, Fuqiang] Hunan Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Changsha 410005, Hunan, Peoples R China",Central South University,"Li, XL (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Xiang Ya Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Hlth Stat, Changsha 410078, Hunan, Peoples R China.",lixingli@csu.edu.cn,"meng, li/GVT-2063-2022",,Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2020JJ4388]; Major Scientific and Technological Projects for Collaborative Prevention and Control of Birth Defects in Hunan Province [2019SK1012],Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); Major Scientific and Technological Projects for Collaborative Prevention and Control of Birth Defects in Hunan Province,This research was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (2020JJ4388) and Major Scientific and Technological Projects for Collaborative Prevention and Control of Birth Defects in Hunan Province (2019SK1012).,,43,0,0,8,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

This article investigates how South Africa has aligned the climate action SDG (SDG 13) with its national development agenda, with an emphasis on adaptation policies and institutional framework. This comes against a background where the country has been accused of bias towards mitigation policies that were trigged by the Long-Term Mitigation Scenarios in 2007, which could have quickened mitigation responses to SDG 13. The data were generated through the use of three key methods, namely key informant interviews (n = 21), an online survey uploaded on an online platform called QuestionPro and a realised sample of 103 completed surveys. Furthermore, relevant policy documents were analysed from a critical discourse perspective. It emerged that South Africa has policies and strategies in place to respond to climate change adaptation within the context of SDG 13. However, while policies are in place, they have not translated to real change on the ground and therefore have not enabled the country to have adequate climate change resilience. The policies have not been translated into concrete actions; there are knowledge gaps in adaptation, poor leadership and lack of clear vision for adaptation and poor coordination. institutions are scattered, with uneven capacity across sectors and different spheres of government; and weakest at the local government level. It also emerged that mitigation was prioritised for a while over adaptation, with a lack of funding and general awareness. The study recommends that adaptation measures should not be undertaken in isolation, instead, it should be addressed within the context of other programmes such as disaster risk management and sustainable development.","[Mthembu, Dumisani E.] Univ South Africa, Dept Environm Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Nhamo, Godwell] Univ South Africa, Inst Corp Citizenship, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa; University of South Africa,"Mthembu, DE (corresponding author), Univ South Africa, Dept Environm Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa.",dumisani.mthembu22@gmail.com,,,University of South Africa; Department of Science and Technology,University of South Africa; Department of Science and Technology(Department of Science & Technology (India)),Funding was received from the University of South Africa and the Department of Science and Technology as part of pursuing the PhD studies.,,25,1,1,0,1,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1996-1421,2072-845X,,JAMBA-J DISASTER RIS,Jamba-J.

Single-layer UCMs interact with the lowest atmospheric model level and are suited for low- to mid-rise cities, whereas multi-layer UCMs interact with multiple levels and can also be employed for high-rise cities. The present study describes the multi-layer coupling between the Town Energy Balance (FEB) UCM included in the Surface Externalisee (SURFEX) land surface model and the Meso-NH mesoscale atmospheric model. This is a step towards better high-resolution weather prediction for urban areas in the future and studies quantifying the impact of climate change adaptation measures in high-rise cities. The effect of the buildings on the wind is considered using a drag force and a production term in the prognostic equation for turbulent kinetic energy. The heat and moisture fluxes from the walls and the roofs to the atmosphere are released at the model levels intersecting these urban facets. No variety of building height at grid-point scale is considered to remain the consistency between the modification of the Meso-NH equations and the geometric assumptions of FEB. The multi-layer coupling is evaluated for the heterogeneous high-rise, high-density city of Hong Kong. It leads to a strong improvement of model results for near-surface air temperature and relative humidity, which is due to better consideration of the process of horizontal advection in the urban canopy layer. For wind speed, model results are improved on average by the multi-layer coupling but not for all stations. Future developments of the multi-layer SURFEX-TEB will focus on improving the calculation of radiative exchanges, which will allow a variety of building heights at grid-point scale to be taken into account.","[Schoetter, Robert; de Munck, Cecile; Masson, Valery] Univ Toulouse, Meteo France, CNRS, CNRM, 42 Ave Gaspard Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse 1, France; [Kwok, Yu Ting] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Architecture, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lau, Kevin Ka Lun] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Future Cities, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wong, Wai Kin] Hong Kong Observ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Schoetter, R (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, Meteo France, CNRS, CNRM, 42 Ave Gaspard Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse 1, France.",robert.schoetter@meteo.fr,"Lau, Kevin Ka-Lun/Q-9139-2016","Lau, Kevin Ka-Lun/0000-0003-3438-1182","Partenariat Hubert Curien [42552SL/F-CUHK403/18]; Research Grant Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China [CUR4046-18F]; Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council","Partenariat Hubert Curien; Research Grant Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council","This research has been supported by the Partenariat Hubert Curien PROCORE-2019 (grant no. 42552SL/F-CUHK403/18) for the project The effects of urban development strategies on the urban climate of Hong Kong: An analysis based on numerical modelling and the Research Grant Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (grant no.

Policies have been enacted, but no attempt has been made to synthesise the effects on disaster resilience. This review analyses the characteristics, quality, and comprehensiveness of drought-resilience policies in Eswatini and Lesotho. We have systematically reviewed public policies that shape responses to disaster resilience published between 1 January 1980 and 30 June 2019. A combination of keywords was used to search electronic bibliographic databases, multidisciplinary databases, key organisational websites, and the first 20 pages of Google for policies that addressed disaster and/or drought resilience. Identified documents were downloaded into an EndNote database and screened for eligibility using predetermined criteria. The logic of events framework was used for quality assessment, and a metaethnographic approach was applied for data synthesis. Three broad categories of characteristics, thematic outcomes and quality, and comprehensiveness of policy documents emerged and are presented. Policy responses contributing to disaster resilience were found in n = 32 out of 13,700 documents. Three (n = 3/32) policies were statutory, and the rest were nonstatutory. Eleven (n = 11/32) were assessed to be of high quality. Policy responses relating to drought resilience focused on reducing vulnerability to recurrent disasters; promoting drought and climate change adaptation; improving agriculture and food security; safeguarding cultural heritage; and preventing gender inequality and gender-based violence as well as improving disaster governance. However, the construct of drought resilience was not strongly articulated as a major policy goal across policy documents. There is an urgent need to promote better understanding of drought resilience in order to motivate policymakers to steer away from reactive interventions and position resilience as a major national policy goal in both countries to expedite inclusive growth and safeguard development gains and the health and wellbeing of the majority of their populations who are rural-based populations.","[Kamara, Joseph K.; Sahle, Berhe W.; Renzaho, Andre M.

We used the Mann-Kendall's test to detect trends and the Sen's slope estimator to calculate trend magnitudes. The findings show that more than 70% out of 513 test cases have shown increasing signals, and 32% of the tests were globally field significant at 0.05 level. Increasing change in low-flow magnitudes and decreasing change in low-flow frequency that exceeded 80 percentile (Qmin80p) were more prevalent than the others. Global field significant increasing changes were observed for 40% out of 228 test cases for low-flow amounts, while Qmin80p has shown decreasing trend at 46 out of 57 stations, and 26 of these were statistically significant. The general tendency is towards upward change, but there were some stations that showed field significant decreasing trends for high-flow indicators. General trend signals (upward or downward) and stations with significant changes did not show any spatial pattern. There were even adjacent gauging stations within the same river basin or adjacent river basins that showed statistically significant opposite trends for some test cases. The complex spatial pattern of trend signals is partly attributable to the very complex topographic, climatic, and land cover variations in the country that are well documented in previous studies. Also, the observed trends are difficult to fully explain in terms of climate change or land cover conversion. Generally, the results of this study contradict with previous studies that reported no significant trends in streamflow variables over Ethiopia. The study has important implications for climate change adaptation planning, water-related disaster risk management, and water sector development activities in the country.","[Degefu, Mekonnen Adnew; Alamirew, Tena; Zeleke, Gete] Addis Ababa Univ Ethiopia, Water & Land Resource Ctr Ethiopia, Rahem Bldg,Diaspora Sq,POB 3880, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Degefu, Mekonnen Adnew] Debre Markos Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, POB 269, Debre Markos, Ethiopia; [Bewket, Woldeamlak] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Degefu, MA (corresponding author), Addis Ababa Univ Ethiopia, Water & Land Resource Ctr Ethiopia, Rahem Bldg,Diaspora Sq,POB 3880, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.;Degefu, MA (corresponding author), Debre Markos Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, POB 269, Debre Markos, Ethiopia.",mekonnenadnew@yahoo.com; tena.a@wlrc-eth.org; gete.z@wlrc-eth.org; wbewket@yahoo.com,"Alamirew, Tena/GOP-0486-2022; Alamirew, Tena/AAL-3707-2021; Degefu, Mekonnen Adnew/GRR-6199-2022","Alamirew, Tena/0000-0001-7491-4401; Degefu, Mekonnen Adnew/0000-0001-6316-7543",International Foundation for Science (IFS) [W/5103-2]; African Climate Change Fellowship Program (ACCFP),International Foundation for Science (IFS)(International Foundation for Science); African Climate Change Fellowship Program (ACCFP),"The first author received financial assistance provided by the International Foundation for Science (IFS, agreement no.

The impact assessment is usually accomplished by implementing projections from general circulation models (GCMs). Unfortunately, these projections cannot capture the dynamicity of the monsoon and require either statistical (SD) or dynamical (DD) downscaling of the GCM projections to a finer resolution. Both downscaling techniques can capture the spatio-temporal variation in climatic variables but are marred by uncertainty in the projections resulting from the choice of the GCM and downscaling method, which affects climate change adaptations. Here, we assessed uncertainties in the projections of hydro-climatic variables over India by considering multiple downscaling techniques, multiple GCMs, and their combined effects (referred as the total uncertainty). Multiple hydrological variables were simulated by implementing the variable infiltration capacity model that considered outputs from DD (derived by the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment, CORDEX) and SD forced with multiple GCM simulations. Our results showed that the SD projections captured the observed spatio-temporal variability of hydro-climatic variables more efficiently than the DD projections. Importantly, contribution from the downscaled projections to the total uncertainty was significantly smaller compared to the inter-GCM uncertainty. We believe uncertainty analysis is an important component of good scientific practice; however, several researchers appear to be rather reluctant to embrace the concept of uncertainty in making projections, predictions, and forecasting. It remains a common practice to show climate change exercises to decision-makers/stakeholders, without uncertainty bounds. Here, a successful attempt was made to identify the key sources of uncertainty and adequately bracket the uncertainty, indicating a requirement of the code of practice to provide formal guidance, particularly for climate-change impact assessments. This consequently emphasized the importance of follow-up research to understand the inter-GCM uncertainty, which has a significant impact on sustainable agriculture and water resources management in India.","[Sharma, Tarul; Ghosh, Subimal; Karmakar, Subhankar] Indian Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Programme Climate Studies, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Vittal, H.; Chhabra, Surbhi; Karmakar, Subhankar] Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Bombay, Maharashtra, India; [Vittal, H.] Manipal Inst Technol, Civil Engn Dept, Manipal, Karnataka, India; [Salvi, Kaustubh] Univ Iowa, IIHR Hydrosci & Engn, Iowa City, IA USA; [Salvi, Kaustubh] Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Ghosh, Subimal] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Bombay, Maharashtra, India; [Ghosh, Subimal; Karmakar, Subhankar] Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Urban Sci & Engn, Bombay, Maharashtra, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE); University of Iowa; College of Engineering Pune; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Karmakar, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Programme Climate Studies, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India.",skarmakar@iitb.ac.in,"Hari, Vittal/AAS-4759-2020","Hari, Vittal/0000-0001-8754-0488; Sharma, Tarul/0000-0002-9574-4170; Karmakar, Subhankar/0000-0002-1132-1403","Climate Change Programme, Department of Science and Technology, Government of India","Climate Change Programme, Department of Science and Technology, Government of India","The Climate Change Programme, Department of Science and Technology, Government of India supports the Centre for Excellence in Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.

There is a pressing need for wide-scale innovation leading to development that improves the livelihoods and food security of the world's population while at the same time addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation. A variety of promising climate-smart interventions have been identified. However, what remains is the prioritization of interventions for investment and broad dissemination. The suitability and adoption of interventions depends on a variety of bio-physical and socio-economic factors. Also their impacts, when adopted and out-scaled, are likely to be highly heterogeneous. This heterogeneity expresses itself not only spatially and temporally but also in terms of the stakeholders affected, some might win and some might lose. A mechanism that can facilitate a systematic, hot's& assessment of the likely spread and consequential impact of potential interventions is one way of improving the selection and targeting of such options. In this paper we provide climate smart agriculture (CSA) planners and implementers at all levels with a generic framework for evaluating and prioritising potential interventions. This entails an iterative process of mapping out recommendation domains, assessing adoption potential and estimating impacts. Through examples, related to livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa, we demonstrate each of the steps and how they are interlinked. The framework is applicable in many different forms, scales and settings.

We estimated the impacts of the deviation in our study year's (2012) temperature and precipitation patterns from medium-term (1980-2011) climatic patterns on farmland values in Pakistan. This was accomplished by employing a modified form of a Ricardian regression model. We also examined farmers' perceptions of climate change during this period, as well as their perceptions of climate change impacts on farm productivity, in addition to past and anticipated farm adaptation strategies. Our results indicate that positive temperature deviation from the medium-term mean - indicative of climatic change - affects farmland values in Pakistan. Deviation in annual cumulative precipitation conversely appears to have no significant impact. Estimates of the marginal impact of temperature deviation suggested a slight but negative linear relationship with farmland values. The location of farms in areas where farmers can avail financial or extension services conversely had a positive impact on farmland values, as did the availability of irrigation facilities. Our analysis of farmers' perceptions of climate change and their consequent adaptation behavior indicated a relatively high degree of awareness of climatic variability that influenced a number of proactive and future anticipated farm adaptation strategies. Examples included increased use of irrigation and farm enterprise diversification, as well as land-use change, including shifting from agriculture into alternative land uses. National policy in Pakistan underscores the importance of maintaining a productive rural agricultural sector. Our findings consequently highlight the importance of appropriate adaptation strategies to maintain both farm productivity and farmland values in much of Pakistan. The implications of increased extension and financial services to enhance farmers' potential for climate change adaptation are discussed.","[Arshad, Muhammad; Kaechele, Harald; Amjath-Babu, T.

With its food security depending almost entirely on irrigated agriculture, Central Asia is one of the arid regions highly vulnerable to water scarcity. Previous research of land and water use in the region has focused on improving water-use efficiency, soil management and identifying technical, institutional and agricultural innovations. However, vulnerability to climate change has rarely been considered, in spite of the imminent risks due to a higher-than-average warming perspective and the predicted melting of glaciers, which will greatly affect the availability of irrigation water. Using the Khorezm region in the irrigated lowlands of northwest Uzbekistan as an example, we identify the local patterns of vulnerability to climate variability and extremes. We look at on-going environmental degradation, water-use inefficiency, and barriers to climate change adaptation and mitigation, and based on an extensive review of research evidence from the region, we present concrete examples of initiatives for building resilience and improving climate risk management. These include improving water use efficiency and changing the cropping patterns that have a high potential to decrease the exposure and sensitivity of rural communities to climate risks. In addition, changes in land use such as the afforestation of degraded croplands, and introducing resource-smart cultivation practices such as conservation agriculture, may strengthen the capacity of farmers and institutions to respond to climate challenges. As these can be out-scaled to similar environments, i.e. the irrigated cotton and wheat growing lowland regions in Central Asia and the Caucasus, these findings may be relevant for regions beyond the immediate geographic area from which it draws its examples.

Adaptation to future climate change by breeding climate resilient cultivars is essential. However the precise information as to where, when, and what cultivar traits should be applied to adapt to climate change in the coming decades has not been available. In this study, we developed novel hybrid assessment models by incor-porating a process-based crop model and machine learning algorithms based on a large number of cultivars field experiments data. The models were applied to assess the impact of climate change on wheat productivity and to identify the timescale of wheat cultivar adaptation in the major wheat cultivation regions across China. Wheat yield was projected to decrease on average by 6.3% (9.4%) in the 2050 s under RCP 4.5 (8.5), relative to the baseline period (1986-2005), without the CO2 effect. By contrast, it was projected to increase on average by 5.7% (8.1%) in the 2050 s with the CO2 effect, across the regions and cultivar-maturing traits in China. Solar radiation, precipitation, temperature, cultivar-maturing traits, and CO2 are critical factors affecting wheat pro-ductivity in the major wheat cultivation regions. About 44% (39%) and 68% (57%) of wheat planting grids would require cultivar renewal before 2050 (2040) under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 emission scenario, respectively, at a medium risk level without the CO2 effect. The cultivars with a long reproductive growth duration, high photosynthetic efficiency and large harvest index would be generally promising although there are specific traits desirable for certain regions. This study developed a novel framework to identify the precise information on where, when, and what cultivar traits should be applied for wheat to adapt to future climate change, helping the stakeholders to cope with climate change timely and precisely.","[Tao, Fulu; Chen, Yi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Liangliang; Zhang, Zhao] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Tao, Fulu; Chen, Yi] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Tao, Fulu] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Beijing Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke)","Tao, FL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",taofl@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Founda-tion of China [31761143006, 41977405, 41571493]; Academy of Finland [316172]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [316172] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)",National Natural Science Founda-tion of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Academy of FinlandFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES)),"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Founda-tion of China (Project Nos. 31761143006, 41977405, 41571493) .

Therefore, it is necessary to foster the implementation of participatory projects to help communities deal with new difficulties. Sustainable soil management can reduce and even reverse land degradation, helping farmers to adapt to climate change effects. Progress toward sustainability cannot be implemented in small rural communities regardless of local knowledge, which can be addressed using participatory techniques. To this purpose the choice and use of indicators is essential to carry out correct assessments of soil vulnerability integrating local and technical knowledge. The purpose of this review was to study how the problem of building a set of integrated indicators to assess soil quality has been addressed so far and which participatory techniques have been more successfully employed, analyzing studies carried out in rural communities of developing countries. We found out that there is a lack of participated studies dealing with environmental issues. Those that do so address them only indirectly, being centered on present agricultural problems. The studies rarely feature a collaboration with social science experts, consequently the use of participatory techniques lacks protocols and a standardized nomenclature to help in the transfer and generalization of experiences. Women are rarely involved and nearly exclusively in African countries: this could be related to social and cultural conditions, but needs more attention. Different aspects need to be improved to help the implementation of a successful approach in future projects. This review provides a tool to facilitate future interdisciplinary research on integration of local and scientific knowledge and will help to devise more successful strategies to tackle the challenges posed by climate change to smallholders in developing countries.","[Braidotti, Greta; De Nobili, Maria; Piani, Lucia] Univ Udine, Agr Food Environm & Anim Care Dept, I-33100 Udine, Italy",University of Udine,"Piani, L (corresponding author), Univ Udine, Agr Food Environm & Anim Care Dept, I-33100 Udine, Italy.",greta.braidotti@uniud.it; maria.denobili@uniud.it; lucia.piani@uniud.it,,"De Nobili, Maria/0000-0002-4633-4394",Agenzia Italiana per la Cooperazione allo Sviluppo (AICS) of the Italian Agency for Cooperation and Development [AID 011.483 CUP G56C18000510001],Agenzia Italiana per la Cooperazione allo Sviluppo (AICS) of the Italian Agency for Cooperation and Development,This research was funded by Agenzia Italiana per la Cooperazione allo Sviluppo (AICS) codex AID 011.483 CUP G56C18000510001 2017 Call of the Italian Agency for Cooperation and Development for the granting of contributions to initiatives proposed by organizations of civil society and non-profit entities. 2017 financial endowment.,,63,0,0,3,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2021,13,1,,,,,,,87,10.3390/su13010087,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13010087,,,28,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PQ2EX,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000606363900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

With limited knowledge about how climate change affects mental health and resilience, robust local assessments are required to better understand long-term impact, particularly in communities prone to extreme weather events. Methods: Six months post-flood, a cross-sectional survey of adults living in the region during the flood was conducted to quantify associations between flood impact and psychological morbidity (post-traumatic stress (PTSD), anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation) for different exposure scenarios, and respondent groups. We adopted a community-academic partnership approach and purposive recruitment to increase participation from marginalized groups. Results: Of 2,180 respondents, almost all (91%) were affected by some degree of flood-related exposure at an individual and community level (ranging from suburb damage to home or business inundated). Socio-economically marginalized respondents were more likely to have their homes inundated and to be displaced. Mental health risk was significantly elevated for respondents: whose home/business/farm was inundated [e.g., home inundation: PTSD adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 13.72 (99% CI 4.53-41.56)]; who reported multiple exposures [e.g., three exposures: PTSD AOR 6.43 (99% CI 2.11-19.60)]; and who were still displaced after 6 months [e.g., PTSD AOR 24.43 (99% CI 7.05-84.69)]. Conclusion: The 2017 flood had profound impact, particularly for respondents still displaced and for socio-economically marginalized groups. Our community-academic partnership approach builds community cohesion, informs targeted mental health disaster preparedness and response policies for different sectors of the community and longer-term interventions aimed at improving community adaptability to climate change.","[Matthews, Veronica; Longman, Jo; Passey, Megan; Bennett-Levy, James; Morgan, Geoffrey G.; Pit, Sabrina; Rolfe, Margaret; Bailie, Ross S.] Univ Sydney, Univ Ctr Rural Hlth, Lismore, NSW, Australia; [Berry, Helen L.] Macquarie Univ, Ctr Hlth Syst & Safety Res, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney; Macquarie University,"Matthews, V (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Univ Ctr Rural Hlth, Lismore, NSW, Australia.",veronica.matthews@sydney.edu.au,"Matthews, Veronica/AAS-5160-2021","Passey, Megan/0000-0001-5766-0235; Morgan, Geoffrey/0000-0003-4046-2405",University of Sydney; Western Sydney University; University of Wollongong; NSW Office of Environment and Heritage; Northern NSW Local Health District,University of Sydney(University of Sydney); Western Sydney University; University of Wollongong; NSW Office of Environment and Heritage; Northern NSW Local Health District,"This project was funded by the University of Sydney, Western Sydney University, University of Wollongong, the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage and the Northern NSW Local Health District.",,34,12,12,3,15,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-2565,,FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH,Front.

It also allows for the effectiveness of resilience-building interventions to be tracked over time. To date, the majority of measurement tools use objective methods of evaluation. Broadly speaking, these relate to approaches that solicit little, if any, judgment on behalf of the subject in question. More recently, subjective methods of evaluation have been proposed. These take a contrasting epistemological view, relying on people's self-assessments of their own capacity to deal with climate risk. Subjective methods offer some promise in complementing objective methods, including: factoring in people's own knowledge of resilience and what contributes to it; more nuanced contextualization; and the potential to reduce survey length and fatigue. Yet, considerable confusion exists in understanding subjectivity and objectivity. Little is also known about the merits and limitations of different approaches to measurement. Here, I clarify the conceptual and practical relationships between objective and subjective forms of measuring resilience, aiming to provide practical guidance in distinguishing between them. In reviewing existing toolkits, I propose a subjectivity-objectivity continuum that groups measurement approaches according to two core tenets: (a) how resilience is defined and (b) how resilience is evaluated. I then use the continuum to explore the strengths and weaknesses of different types of toolkits, allowing comparison across each. I also emphasize that there is no one-size fits all approach to resilience measurement. As such, evaluators should carefully consider: their epistemology of resilience; core objectives for measurement; as well as resource and data constraints, before choosing which methods to adopt.

The impacts of global climate change are felt locally, and thus local governance structures will increasingly be responsible for preparedness and local responses. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) options are gaining prominence as relevant climate change solutions. Local government officials seldom have an appropriate understanding of the role of ecosystem functioning in sustainable development goals, or access to relevant climate information. Thus the use of ecosystems in helping people adapt to climate change is limited partially by the lack of information on where ecosystems have the highest potential to do so. To begin overcoming this barrier, Conservation South Africa in partnership with local government developed a socio-ecological approach for identifying spatial EbA priorities at the sub-national level. Using GIS-based multi-criteria analysis and vegetation distribution models, the authors have spatially integrated relevant ecological and social information at a scale appropriate to inform local level political, administrative, and operational decision makers. This is the first systematic approach of which we are aware that highlights spatial priority areas for EbA implementation. Nodes of socio-ecological vulnerability are identified, and the inclusion of areas that provide ecosystem services and ecological resilience to future climate change is innovative. The purpose of this paper is to present and demonstrate a methodology for combining complex information into user-friendly spatial products for local level decision making on EbA. The authors focus on illustrating the kinds of products that can be generated from combining information in the suggested ways, and do not discuss the nuance of climate models nor present specific technical details of the model outputs here. Two representative case studies from rural South Africa demonstrate the replicability of this approach in rural and peri-urban areas of other developing and least developed countries around the world.","[Bourne, Amanda] Conservat South Africa, Springbok, South Africa; [Holness, Stephen] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Zool, Ctr African Conservat Ecol, Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Holden, Petra; Scorgie, Sarshen] Conservat South Africa, Cape Town, South Africa; [Holden, Petra] Univ Cape Town, Plant Conservat Unit, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; [Donatti, Camila I.] Conservat Int, Gordon & Betty Moore Ctr Sci, Arlington, VA USA; [Midgley, Guy] Univ Stellenbosch, Global Change Biol Unit, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",Nelson Mandela University; University of Cape Town; Conservation International; Stellenbosch University,"Bourne, A (corresponding author), Conservat South Africa, Springbok, South Africa.",abourne@conservation.org,"Holden, Petra/AAQ-3951-2021; Bourne, Amanda/AAO-6825-2020; Donatti, Camila I./AAV-2324-2020; Donatti, Camila/AAF-3605-2020","Holden, Petra/0000-0002-3047-1407; Bourne, Amanda/0000-0001-6078-0676; ","International Climate Initiative, an initiative of the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety by the German Bundestag [11_II_084_Global_A_EbA solutions]; International Climate Initiative; Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund [61486]","International Climate Initiative, an initiative of the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety by the German Bundestag; International Climate Initiative; Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund","The methodology for defining spatial ecosystem-based adaptation priorities was developed in the Namakwa District with funding from the International Climate Initiative, an initiative of the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety adopted on the basis of a decision by the German Bundestag, grant number 11_II_084_Global_A_EbA solutions.

For this return period, levels lie between 1 and 2 m above mean sea level along much of the coastline. Future climate 1-in-100-year storm tide heights were estimated by adding high-end estimates of future sea-level rise from recent literature. The effect of climate change through consistent wind-speed increases was also examined and it was found that, for the late 21st Century, the contribution of wind-speed increase to the increases in extreme storm surge heights is considerably smaller, by a factor of more than 2, than the contribution of sea-level rise. A computationally inexpensive approach to assessing current and future vulnerability to coastal inundation due to sea-level extremes is then demonstrated for the Victorian coast. A simple inundation algorithm was used with high-resolution terrestrial elevation data from a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) survey of the Victorian coast to evaluate the potential vulnerability of nine coastal regions to inundation by current and future climate 1-in-100-year storm tides. The response of different regions varied from exhibiting proportional increases in inundation to sea-level rise to nonlinear responses, where the exceedance of critical sea-level thresholds led to large stepwise increases in land area or number of land parcels affected by inundation. These responses were a function of both coastal topography and the spatial density of land parcels. The low computational cost of the methodology permits different time horizons and uncertainties in future climate change to be considered using a scenario-based approach and is therefore useful in assessing options for adaptation to climate change.

Most previous studies assess the potential impacts of agricultural adaptation to climate change on crop yields. This study attempts to evaluate the potential impacts of crop producers' adaptation to future climate change on crop yield, crop enterprise net returns, and net farm income in Flathead Valley, Montana, USA. Crop enterprises refer to the combinations of inputs (e.g., land, labor, and capital) and field operations used to produce a crop. Two crop enterprise adaptations are evaluated: flexible scheduling of field operations; and crop irrigation. All crop yields are simulated using the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model. Net farm income is assessed for small and large representative farms and two soils in the study area. Results show that average crop yields in the future period (2006-2050) without adaptation are between 7% and 48% lower than in the historical period (1960-2005). Flexible scheduling of the operations used in crop enterprises does not appear to be an economically efficient form of crop enterprise adaptation because it does not improve crop yields and crop enterprise net returns in the future period. With irrigation, crop yields are generally higher for all crop enterprises and crop enterprise net returns increase for the canola and alfalfa enterprises but decrease for all other assessed crop enterprises relative to no adaptation. Overall, average crop enterprise net return in the future period is 45% lower with than without irrigation. Net farm income decreases for both the large and small representative farms with both flexible scheduling and irrigation. Results indicate that flexible scheduling and irrigation adaptation are unlikely to reduce the potential adverse economic impacts of climate change on crop producers in Montana's Flathead Valley.","[Qiu, Zeyuan] New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Environm Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Prato, Tony] Univ Missouri, Ctr Appl Res & Environm Syst, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO USA",New Jersey Institute of Technology; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Qiu, ZY (corresponding author), New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Environm Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",zeyuan.qiu@njit.edu,,"Qiu, Zeyuan/0000-0003-1639-2398","National Research Initiative of United States Department of Agriculture Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service [2006-55101-17129]","National Research Initiative of United States Department of Agriculture Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service","The research reported here was supported in part by the National Research Initiative of the United States Department of Agriculture Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, grant number 2006-55101-17129.

In this study, remote sensing data, decomposition and leaching experiments, and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) were used to quantify the release, export, and transport characteristics of diffuse nutrients from forest litter under two climate scenarios (the current climate condition [S1] and the future warming and drying climate condition [S2]), and the impacts on aquatic environment were identified. The annual litter decomposition was 27.80 x 10(6) t in S2, which was 1.39 times that of S1. Additionally, the annual litter nutrient release in S2 (C, N, and P was 8.65 x 10(6), 3.31 x 10(5), and 1.57 x 10(4) t, respectively) also increased by 31.16%-45.62% compared with that of S1. The spatial patterns of nutrient export showed that the annual exports of C, N, and Pin S1 were 109.77, 46.85, and 0.43 kg/ha, respectively. The annual nutrient export in S2 increased by 1.44 times, and S2 also had higher values of nutrient transport. In addition, variation trends of temperature and precipitation increased significantly with increasing altitude, which promoted differences in nutrient transport between S1 and S2 in the high-altitude areas. The response analysis of the diffuse nutrient in surface water also indicated that forest nutrient discharge load were critical factors affecting the aquatic environmental quality. This study indicated that climate warming accelerated litter decomposition and made litter a potential source of diffuse forest pollution, and watershed discharge load varied intensively with the terrestrial conditions. The combination of experiments and modeling can improve the accuracy of diffuse forest pollution simulation and provide valuable information for formulating watershed climate change adaptation strategies.","[Hao, Xin; Ouyang, Wei; Zhang, Kehao; Wan, Xinyue; Cui, Xintong] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Ouyang, Wei] Beijing Normal Univ, Adv interdisciplinary Inst Environm & Ecol, Zhuhai 519087, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Weihong] Yanbian Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Key Lab Wetland Ecol Funct & Ecol Secur, Jilin 133000, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Yanbian University,"Ouyang, W (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",wei@itc.nl,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41830643]; Yangtze River Scholars,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Yangtze River Scholars,This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41830643) and the funds of Yangtze River Scholars.,,70,0,0,23,39,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

In the context of this paper, EFTs can be defined as solutions for the use of land resources aiming the increasing of goods for meeting the changing human needs and with neutral or positive environmental impact. Changes in the political regime have always had a visible impact on the EFTs issue in Romania. EFTs has gone through several major phases. The political impact on EFTs implementation mainly affected sustainable land management (SLM) and to a small extent, at the end of the communist era and partly during the capitalist period, dimate change mitigation. Throughout history, the political factor has dominated and influenced the capacity of the EFTs implementation process in responding to socio-economic stimuli. In addition, quality of life, rural-urban and urban-rural migrations, poverty, education level, and climate change adaptation have had impacts on the status of EFTs according to governance and political reflections. The agrarian reforms from the last two centuries, based on socioeconomic demands, have strongly influenced the capacity to implement EFTs both positively and negatively. However, the cultural factor was least affected by political and socio-economic changes as a stability factor in ensuring continued implementation of the EFTs. Currently, there is a strong need to reconsider EFTs as sustainability tools for Romanian agriculture that can cope with climate change and sustainable land management (SLM) demands. This paper presents a brief history of EFTs in Romania and their benefits in achieving SLM equilibrium, describing the impacts of political decisions, socio-economic measures, and cultural features on implementing ETEs policies.

Despite broad appreciation by stream ecologists of negative effects of stormwater runoff, stormwater management objectives still typically center on flood and pollution mitigation without an explicit focus on altered hydrology. Resulting management approaches are unlikely to protect the ecological structure and function of streams adequately. We present critical elements of stormwater management necessary for protecting stream ecosystems through 5 principles intended to be broadly applicable to all urban landscapes that drain to a receiving stream: 1) the ecosystems to be protected and a target ecological state should be explicitly identified; 2) the postdevelopment balance of evapotranspiration, stream flow, and infiltration should mimic the predevelopment balance, which typically requires keeping significant runoff volume from reaching the stream; 3) stormwater control measures (SCMs) should deliver flow regimes that mimic the predevelopment regime in quality and quantity; 4) SCMs should have capacity to store rain events for all storms that would not have produced widespread surface runoff in a predevelopment state, thereby avoiding increased frequency of disturbance to biota; and 5) SCMs should be applied to all impervious surfaces in the catchment of the target stream. These principles present a range of technical and social challenges. Existing infrastructural, institutional, or governance contexts often prevent application of the principles to the degree necessary to achieve effective protection or restoration, but significant potential exists for multiple co-benefits from SCM technologies (e.g., water supply and climate-change adaptation) that may remove barriers to implementation. Our set of ideal principles for stream protection is intended as a guide for innovators who seek to develop new approaches to stormwater management rather than accept seemingly insurmountable historical constraints, which guarantee future, ongoing degradation.","[Walsh, Christopher J.; Burns, Matthew J.; Fletcher, Tim D.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, 500 Yarra Blvd, Burnley, Vic 3121, Australia; [Booth, Derek B.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Hale, Rebecca L.] Univ Utah, Global Change & Sustainabil Ctr, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Hoang, Lan N.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England; [Livingston, Grant] Water Resources Engn, 233 Owens Hall, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA; [Rippy, Megan A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Henry Samueli Sch Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Roy, Allison H.] Univ Massachusetts, US Geol Survey, Massachusetts Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Scoggins, Mateo] City Austin, Watershed Protect Dept, 505 Barton Springs Rd, Austin, TX 78704 USA; [Wallace, Angela] Toronto & Reg Conservat Author, 5 Shoreham Dr, Toronto, ON M3N 1S4, Canada",University of Melbourne; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; University of Cambridge; University of California System; University of California Irvine; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Walsh, CJ; Burns, MJ; Fletcher, TD (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, 500 Yarra Blvd, Burnley, Vic 3121, Australia.;Booth, DB (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.;Hale, RL (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Global Change & Sustainabil Ctr, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.;Hoang, LN (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England.;Livingston, G (corresponding author), Water Resources Engn, 233 Owens Hall, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA.;Rippy, MA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Henry Samueli Sch Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.;Roy, AH (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, US Geol Survey, Massachusetts Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Scoggins, M (corresponding author), City Austin, Watershed Protect Dept, 505 Barton Springs Rd, Austin, TX 78704 USA.;Wallace, A (corresponding author), Toronto & Reg Conservat Author, 5 Shoreham Dr, Toronto, ON M3N 1S4, Canada.",cwalsh@unimelb.edu.au; dbooth@bren.ucsb.edu; matthew.burns@unimelb.edu.au; timf@unimelb.edu.au; rebecca.l.hale@utah.edu; lnh04@cam.ac.uk; glivings@gmail.com; mrippy@uci.edu; aroy@eco.umass.edu; mateo.scoggins@austintexas.gov; awallace@trca.on.ca,"Scoggins, Mateo/HFZ-9090-2022; Walsh, Christopher/B-2552-2009; Fletcher, Tim/AAB-8356-2019; Booth, Derek/B-6379-2014","Walsh, Christopher/0000-0002-4181-6722; Fletcher, Tim/0000-0001-8819-5567; Rippy, Megan/0000-0002-0575-8342; Booth, Derek/0000-0002-5242-4089","US National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1427007]; NSF Partnerships for International Research and Education [OISE-1243543]; NSF [EPSCoR IIA 1208732]; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K013661/1]; Melbourne Water, through the Melbourne Waterway Research Practice Partnership; Australian Research Council Future Fellowship [FT10010044]; Office of Integrative Activities; Office Of The Director [1208732] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Office Of Internatl Science &Engineering; Office Of The Director [1243543] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","US National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF Partnerships for International Research and Education; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Melbourne Water, through the Melbourne Waterway Research Practice Partnership; Australian Research Council Future Fellowship(Australian Research Council); Office of Integrative Activities; Office Of The Director(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Office Of Internatl Science &Engineering; Office Of The Director(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD))","This paper arose from a discussion session at the 3rd Symposium on Urbanization and Stream Ecology in Portland, Oregon, in May 2014, which was funded in part by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) award DEB 1427007.

In low-income countries, farmers have typically received little, if any locally relevant weather or climate information. Although climate services have contributed to increased availability and accessibility of climate information, this has rarely achieved the desired impacts for farmers' decision-making, adaptation and resilience to climate variability and change. This has been attributed to a lack of engagement with intended users of climate information and a top-down approach to development and delivery of climate services that fails to adequately consider and account for farmers' context-specific requirements. Participatory Integrated Climate Services for Agriculture (PICSA) is an approach that was developed to support and empower farmers in their decision-making processes. More than 200,000 farmers have been trained in 23 countries and this paper presents evidence from evaluations in 7 countries including that most (87%; n = 4,299) have made beneficial changes in their crops, livestock and/or livelihood enterprises. The approach has strengthened key institutions that support farmers through deliberative scoping, tailoring, and capacity-building activities with extension and meteorological services.

In this perspective, this study assessed different agroforestry systems and the components there in, as well as the factors affecting farmers' choice of agroforestry systems as adaptation measures to climate change in Cameroon. Mainly primary data were collected through household and field surveys. The factors affecting smallholder farmers' choice of agroforestry systems faced with climate change were analysed using the multinomial logistic regression model. Findings revealed that the agroforestry systems practiced by farmers as adaptation measures to climate change were agrosilvicultural system (43.71%), silvipastoral agroforestry system (11.43%) and agrosilvipastoral system (24.28%). Three main components, namely crops, trees/shrubs and livestock, were integrated in these agroforestry systems by small-scale farmers to enhance adaptation when confronted with climate change adversities. The multinomial logistic regression model revealed the existence of a cause-effect relationship (p < 0.05) between farmers' agroforestry systems and independent variables like household income, access to land and access to information. This shows that access to land, household income and access to information contribute significantly towards influencing farmers' choice of agroforestry systems as adaptation measures to climate change. It is recommended that, when formulating policies, policy makers seeking to enhance farmers' adaptation to climate change through sustainable farming systems like agroforestry should take a keen look at different agroforestry systems and their components, and factor in the determinants of farmers' preference for particular agroforestry systems as an adaptation option.","[Awazi, Nyong Princely; Tchamba, Martin Ngankam; Temgoua, Lucie Felicite; Tientcheu-Avana, Marie-Louise] Univ Dschang, Fac Agron & Agr Sci, Dept Forestry, POB 222, Dschang, Cameroon",,"Awazi, NP (corresponding author), Univ Dschang, Fac Agron & Agr Sci, Dept Forestry, POB 222, Dschang, Cameroon.",nyongprincely@gmail.com,"Awazi, Nyong Princely/AAO-1853-2020","Awazi, Nyong Princely/0000-0002-0801-0719",,,,,60,1,1,5,11,SPRINGER INDIA,NEW DELHI,"7TH FLOOR, VIJAYA BUILDING, 17, BARAKHAMBA ROAD, NEW DELHI, 110 001, INDIA",2249-720X,2249-7218,,AGR RES,Agric.

Many of these actions result in changes that influence real estate, mostly by improving the conditions of public services. However, implementation of such urban policies is connected with significant costs that have to be covered by public funds. Therefore, the question arises how we can analyze the assumed benefits from the increase of real estate value? Which tool could allow stakeholders to search for potential added value? The aim of this paper is to present the methodological approach to improving the communication between stakeholders for the visualization of relations between public actions and potential benefits. The analyses cover benefits that can occur both in public and private budgets. The focal point of this paper is the presentation of causal loop diagrams as a tool that could be incorporated for public value identification on specific investments. The application of the suggested approach is visualized on two examples of urban redevelopment activities. Causal loop diagrams are prepared for the construction of a metro system and implementation of a water retention facility. The results show that both types of urban redevelopment actions have an impact on the creation of value, which can be observed both in public and private benefits. However, not all kinds of activities impact an increase in the market value of real estate and can be measured as incomes in budgets.","[Kazak, Jan K.] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Wroclaw, Poland; [Simeunovic, Natasa] Sinergija Univ, Bijeljina, Bosnia & Herceg; [Hendricks, Andreas] Univ Fed Armed Forces, Munich, Germany",Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences; Bundeswehr University Munich,"Kazak, JK (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Wroclaw, Poland.",jan.kazak@upwr.edu.pl; nsimeunovic@sinergija.edu.ba; andreas.hendricks@unibw.de,"Kazak, Jan/S-7783-2016","Kazak, Jan/0000-0002-1864-9954",COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology),COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology)(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),"This publication is based upon work from COST Action Public Value Capture of Increasing Property Values, supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology).r COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) is a funding agency for research and innovation networks.

Decision makers and the public alike are struggling to reconcile the lack of fit between a rapidly changing environment and relatively rigid governance structures. In efforts to bridge this environment-governance gap in Tillamook County, Oregon, stakeholders formed a knowledge-to-action network (KTAN). The KTAN examined alternative future coastal policy and climate scenarios through extensive stakeholder engagement and the spatially explicit agent-based modeling framework Envision. The KTAN's results were further evaluated through a two-step mixed methods approach. First, KTAN-identified metrics were quantitatively assessed and compared under present-day vs. alternative policy scenarios. Second, the feasibility of implementing these policy scenarios was qualitatively evaluated through a review of governmental regulations and semistructured interviews. The findings show that alternative policy scenarios ranged from significantly beneficial to extremely harmful to coastal buildings and beach accessibility in comparison to present-day policies, and they were relatively feasible to almost impossible to implement. Beneficial policies that lower impacts of flooding and erosion clearly diverge from the existing regulatory environment, which inhibits their implementation. In response, leadership and cross-sector cooperation and coordination can help to overcome mixed interests and motivations, and increase information exchange between and within the public and government organizations. The combination of stakeholder engagement, an alternative futures modeling framework, and the robust quantitative and qualitative evaluation of policy scenarios provides a powerful model for coastal communities hoping to adapt to climate change along any coastline.","[Lipiec, Eva; Ruggiero, Peter; Serafin, Katherine A.; Corcoran, Patrick; Stevenson, John] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Mills, Alexis; Bolte, John] Oregon State Univ, Biol & Ecol Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Zanocco, Chad; Lach, Denise] Oregon State Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University; Oregon State University; Oregon State University,"Lipiec, E (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",eva.lipiec@gmail.com,"Serafin, Katherine/ABG-3495-2020","Bolte, John/0000-0003-0059-4219; Serafin, Katherine/0000-0002-4127-9787","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Coastal and Ocean Climate Applications (COCA) program under NOAA grants [NA12OAR4310109, NA12OAR4310195, NA15OAR4310243]; NOAA's Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments Program (RISA) under NOAA grants [NA10OAR4310218, NA15OAR4310145]",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Coastal and Ocean Climate Applications (COCA) program under NOAA grants; NOAA's Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments Program (RISA) under NOAA grants,"This study was funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Coastal and Ocean Climate Applications (COCA) program under NOAA grants NA12OAR4310109, NA12OAR4310195, and NA15OAR4310243 and NOAA's Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments Program (RISA) under NOAA grants NA10OAR4310218 and NA15OAR4310145.

However, upcoming generations will be affected in a way probably more related to the moving trend in precipitation patterns, i.e. to the rate and the persistence of regional precipitation changes from one generation to the next, than to changes relative to a fixed current baseline. In this perspective, we propose an alternative characterization of the future precipitation changes predicted by general circulation models, focusing on the precipitation difference between two subsequent 20-year periods. We show that in a business-as-usual emission pathway, the moistening and drying rates increase by 30-40 %, both over land and ocean. As we move further over the twenty-first century, more regions exhibit a significant rate of precipitation change, while the patterns become geographically stationary and the trends persistent. The stabilization of the geographical rate patterns that occurs despite the acceleration of global warming can be physically explained: it results from the increasing contribution of thermodynamic processes compared to dynamic processes in the control of precipitation change. We show that such an evolution is already noticeable over the last decades, and that it could be reversed if strong mitigation policies were quickly implemented. The combination of intensification and increasing persistence of precipitation rate patterns may affect the way human societies and natural ecosystems adapt to climate change, especially in the Mediterranean basin, in Central America, in South Asia and in the Arctic.","[Chavaillaz, Yann; Joussaume, Sylvie; Braconnot, Pascale] UVSQ, CEA, CNRS, Lab Sci Climat & Environm LSCE IPSL, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Bony, Sandrine] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Lab Meteorol Dynam LMD IPSL, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite,"Chavaillaz, Y (corresponding author), UVSQ, CEA, CNRS, Lab Sci Climat & Environm LSCE IPSL, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",yann.chavaillaz@lsce.ipsl.fr,"Bony, Sandrine/AAG-5804-2019","Bony, Sandrine/0000-0002-4791-4438",ANR [ANR-10-LABX-0018]; European FP7 IS-ENES2 project [312979]; French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA); French Ministry of Defense (DGA),ANR(French National Research Agency (ANR)); European FP7 IS-ENES2 project; French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA); French Ministry of Defense (DGA),"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which is in charge of the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, and we thank the climate modelling groups for producing and making available their model output.

Understanding individual-scale responses to a changing climate will be an important component of designing well-targeted, broad-scale strategies and policies. Because of the interdependencies between people and ecosystems, understanding and supporting resilience of resource-dependent people may be as important an aspect of effective resource management as managing the resilience of ecological components. We refer to the northern Australian rangelands as an example of a system that is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and look for ways to enhance the resilience of the system. Vulnerability of the social system comprises elements of adaptive capacity and sensitivity to change (resource dependency) as well as exposure, which is not examined here. We assessed the adaptive capacity of 240 cattle producers, using four established dimensions, and investigated the association between adaptive capacity and climate sensitivity (or resource dependency) as measured through 14 established dimensions. We found that occupational identity, employability, networks, strategic approach, environmental awareness, dynamic resource use, and use of technology were all positively correlated with at least one dimension of adaptive capacity and that place attachment was negatively correlated with adaptive capacity. These results suggest that adaptation processes could be influenced by focusing on adaptive capacity and these aspects of climate sensitivity. Managing the resilience of individuals is critical to processes of adaptation at higher levels and needs greater attention if adaptation processes are to be shaped and influenced.","[Marshall, Nadine A.; Stokes, Chris J.] CSIRO, Ecosyst Sci & Climate Adaptat Flagship, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Marshall, Nadine A.] James Cook Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); James Cook University,"Marshall, NA (corresponding author), CSIRO, Ecosyst Sci & Climate Adaptat Flagship, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,"Stokes, Chris J/G-5199-2010; Marshall, Nadine/D-9339-2011","Stokes, Chris J/0000-0003-1576-2457; Marshall, Nadine/0000-0003-4463-3558","Federal Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF); Climate Adaptation Flagship, CSIRO","Federal Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF); Climate Adaptation Flagship, CSIRO","The funding for this study was obtained from the Federal Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) and the Climate Adaptation Flagship, CSIRO.

As a function of this situation, in many ter-ritorial contexts, productivity and profitability decrease due to uncontrollable events. In light of this situation, the entrepreneur should adopt strategies to decrease the risks of climate change and sustain agricultural productivity and farm profitability. The research used case studies of several wine-growing facilities of companies located in the Mediterranean area. The study estimated the losses of productivity and thus income due to climate change, which is occurring with increasing in-tensity. Subsequently, through the insurance model offered by the public operator with the European Agricultural Policy (CAP), it was analyzed that the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies, such as access to the insurance market, can reduce the risk of climate change and thus favor constancy of farm profitability. The empirical results revealed that the production of quality wines, the age of the entrepreneur, and the level of education are variables that favor access to the insurance market by wine-growing enterprises. On the other hand business income, especially of small enterprises, can be boosted by the adoption of these risk mitigation strategies. However, despite the positive benefits of adopting insurance policies, there is currently low adherence by enterprises. To improve farmers' ability to adapt to increasing climate change, insurance contracts should be promoted and competition between insurance companies should be fostered, which would guarantee a decrease in the cost of policies. This seems important for the overall sustainability of the wine sector and agriculture in general.","[Sgroi, Filippo] Univ Palermo, Dept Agr Food & Forestry Sci, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Sciancalepore, Vito Domenico] Confcooperat Fedagripesca, I-00184 Rome, Italy",University of Palermo,"Sgroi, F (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Agr Food & Forestry Sci, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",filippo.sgroi@unipa.it,,,,,,,32,1,1,6,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2666-1543,,,J AGR FOOD RES,J.

Drought is one of the highest natural disasters in Ethiopia having major impacts on the environment, economic, and social capital. This study aimed to assess the frequency and intensity of meteorological drought occurrences under the current climate change in North-Eastern Ethiopia. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is used to compute the frequency and intensity of drought at 3- and 12-month scales based on 39 years (1982-2020) rainfall data. Mann-Kendall test has been used to analyse the trends of meteorological drought events to determine the magnitude of changes. The results of the study revealed that the highest frequencies of extreme meteorological droughts were recorded in between 2003 and 2012 with SPI values from - 3.0 to - 2.1. On the other hand, severe meteorological drought incidences were recorded from 1982 to 2012 with annual SPI values of - 1.97 to - 1.53 and moderate drought were noted in between 2000 and 2012 with SPI values ranging from - 1.62 to - 0.99 in all-timescales. The results indicated that drought events were more severe in the summer season than in the spring season. The study concluded that the years 2003, 2005, 2009, 2010, and 2012 were the most drastic and distinct-wide drought episode that experienced extreme magnitude drought at all-timescales and the rural livelihoods were affected.

These changes are exacerbating socioeconomic difficulties faced by many mountain communities, and are already intensifying vulnerabilities across mountain areas globally. The situation is indicative of pervasive and consequential deficits in adaptation, and calls attention to the need for a better understanding of existing adaptation efforts, as well as the prospects for increasing the quantity and quality of adaptation action in mountain regions. In response, this MountainAgenda article introduces a conceptual framework for adaptation gaps. It then uses data from 2 major global-scale adaptation reviews to shed light on the nature and true magnitude of the adaptation gap in mountains. It reveals shortcomings in available adaptation options, deficits in the uptake of existing adaptation support, and a general lack of coherence between existing adaptations and keystone global agreements relevant to climate change adaptation. These shortcomings are largely related to soft limits to adaptation that constrain responses across mountain areas. In this article, we provide recommendations for closing the adaptation gap in mountains and suggest that this will require deeply collaborative efforts that are rooted in local needs, aspirations, and ways of knowing, but that are also supported by external capacity building and implementation resources. In many instances, this will resemble a transformative approach to adaptation. The conceptual framework presented here is broadly applicable and can also be utilized to identify and close adaptation gaps in social-ecological contexts beyond mountains.","[McDowell, Graham; Huggel, Christian] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [McDowell, Graham] Univ Calgary, Dept Geog, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Stevens, Madison] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, 429-2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Lesnikowski, Alexandra] Concordia Univ, Dept Geog Planning & Environm, 1445 Maisonneuve Blvd W, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada; [Harden, Alexandra] Univ Connecticut, Dept Geog, 215 Glenbrook Rd,U-4148, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [DiBella, Jose] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, 200 Univ Ave, Waterloo, ON N2J 3G1, Canada; [Morecroft, Michael] Nat England, Mail Hub, Cty Hall, Worcester WR5 2NP, England; [Kumar, Praveen] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Environm Sci, New Delhi 110067, India; [Kumar, Praveen] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Sustainable Landscape Dev, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Joe, Elphin Tom] World Resources Inst, Econ Ctr, Lower Ground Floor AADI 2,Balbir Saxena Marg, New Delhi 110016, India; [Bhatt, Indra D.] GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm, Ctr Biodivers Conservat & Management, Almora 263643, Uttarakhand, India","University of Zurich; University of Calgary; University of British Columbia; Concordia University - Canada; University of Connecticut; University of Waterloo; Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; G.B.

A practice-based design process for crystallizing local shared values, called WeValue InSitu, is already reported to regularly produce transformative learning (TL), but its lack of discipline-or theory-based origins means there are currently no ways to formalise its mechanisms. There is thus a need to conceptualize the sub-processes within it in order to provide a theoretical underpinning, and to extract key contributions to the production of transformative learning (TL). Here, Polanyi's fine-toothed micro-processes are used to analyse discourses from transcripts of a WeValue InSitu event to reveal patterns of meaning-making and meaning-checking cycles. Also identified are key facilitator actions of: redirecting, challenging, refocusing, reflecting back, and disentangling concepts. These findings allow a self-consistent conceptualization of the WeValue InSitu sub-processes and thus a formal methodology. Furthermore, these will lead to more widespread transferability and scaling-up of WeValue InSitu in the field, to meet demand for its known uses e.g. in climate change adaptation planning, sustainability assessments, and education. The reconceptualized sub-processes also contribute to wider TL research, since it will enable reliable TL production to replace fortuitous case studies. With that, there can now be a new TL research agenda for systematic studies e.g. of TL learning mechanisms and contextual influences on TL. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The research used the Steadman apparent temperature method to analyse the health impact of physical factors and investigated student morbidity in three Kaliningrad universities that had different percentage responses to the local climate change. Apparent temperatures (T) with different combinations of meteorological parameters significantly deviated from monthly average temperatures. For the average temperature and maximum wind speed, apparent temperatures were found to be negative from September to March. In January and February, they were 7.8-16.8 times lower than the average T. With humidity (e.g., RH) unchanged, different combinations of physical factor posed no danger to a person dressed for the weather conditions. In January, at the minimum T and maximum wind speed (Uh), frostbite was possible after 20-30 of exposure. Apparent T close to the threshold value was observed in December and February. The climate of the Kaliningrad enclave is not the best for human health conditions. In the winter, there are serious risks of frostbite in uncovered parts of the body when threshold conditions were not met. Results suggested that disease susceptibility in non-local students representing all the universities was 1.2-1.7 times higher than these of locals students. Also, a relationship between morbidity and percentage of non-local students is obtained, suggesting that the weather and climate conditions will likely adversely affect human health during climate change adaptation that can likely increase the morbidity rate, particularly among the students.","[Tarasov, Andrei V.] Immanuel Kant Balt Fed Univ, Kaliningrad, Russia; [Rakhmanov, Rofail S.; Bogomolova, Elena S.; Piskarev, Yuri G.] Privolzhsky Res Med Univ Russian Federat, Nizhnii Novgorod, Russia",Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University,"Tarasov, AV (corresponding author), Immanuel Kant Balt Fed Univ, Kaliningrad, Russia.",drup1@yandex.ru,"Тарасов, Андрей/AAK-1385-2021","Тарасов, Андрей/0000-0001-5749-1216; Rakhmanov, Rofail/0000-0003-1531-5518",,,,,40,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER BASEL AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",0033-4553,1420-9136,,PURE APPL GEOPHYS,Pure Appl.

Evidence from an experiment of crop advisors in the Midwestern United States,CLIMATIC CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; Framing; Conservation; Crop advisor; Cover crops,RISK PERCEPTIONS; COVER CROPS; CONSERVATION PRACTICES; AGRICULTURAL ADVISERS; UNDERSTANDING FARMER; CHANGE ADAPTATION; CHANGE BELIEFS; INFORMATION; PERSPECTIVES; DECISIONS,"Climate change is predicted to have increasingly negative consequences for the agricultural sector. Thus, it is important that crop advisors encourage farmers to adopt management practices that help mitigate or adapt to these changes. However, widespread skepticism persists regarding the existence of anthropogenic climate change and the need for conservation practices. Previous research indicates that individuals who are skeptical of the existence of climate change may be resistant to adopting conservation behaviors when they are described as addressing climate change impacts. Framing such practices as instead addressing weather extremes may be one method to encourage recommendations of such conservation practices. In the current study, we examined whether framing cover crops-a climate change-adaptive practice that enhances soil health-as a way to address that weather extremes rather than climate change would enhance crop advisors' reported likelihood of recommending cover crops to their farmers, particularly among advisors who are skeptical of the existence of climate change. Support for cover crops among crop advisors in our sample was quite high overall, but as predicted, those who were more skeptical of climate change were less likely to recommend cover crops. However, framing condition (whether cover crops were described as addressing weather variability vs. climate change vs. no frame) had no main or moderating effects. These findings suggest that the use of climate change messaging in the framing of farm management practices may not negatively influence crop advisors' recommendations as much as previously thought, but more research using other conservation practices is needed.","[Singh, Ajay S.] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Environm Studies, 6001 J St, Sacramento, CA 95818 USA; [Church, Sarah P.] Montana State Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Fraphagen Hall, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Dang, Layla; Hennes, Erin P.] Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, 703 Third St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Prokopy, Linda S.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, 195 Marsteller St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",California State University System; California State University Sacramento; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Singh, AS (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Environm Studies, 6001 J St, Sacramento, CA 95818 USA.",Singh@csus.edu; Saiah.church@montana.edu; dang24@purdue.edu; Ehennes@purdue.edu; Lprokopy@purdue.edu,"Church, Sarah P./AAQ-1104-2020","Church, Sarah P./0000-0003-0739-1967; Singh, Ajay/0000-0002-5576-8178",Purdue Climate Change Research Center Seed Grant; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) [2011-68002-30220],Purdue Climate Change Research Center Seed Grant; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA),"This work was supported by a Purdue Climate Change Research Center Seed Grant and by USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Award Number 2011-68002-30220, project titled Useful to Usable (U2U): Transforming Climate Variability and Change Information for Cereal Crop Producers..",,48,3,3,7,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

This exploratory study relies on the theory of planned behavior and certain constructs from the health belief model to identify the factors leading municipal authorities to implement preventive interventions for Lyme disease (PILD). Data were obtained from an online survey sent, during the summer of 2018, to municipal officers in 820 municipalities in Quebec, in all health regions where the population is at risk of contracting Lyme disease (response rate = 36%). The questionnaire was used to measure the implementation of PILD, the intention to implement these interventions, attitudes, perceived social pressure, perceived control (levers and barriers) over interventions, perceived effectiveness of preventive measures, risk, and perceived vulnerability. Results of structural equation analyses showed that attitudes were significantly associated with municipal authorities' intention to implement PILD, while the intention to implement PILD was a significant predictor of the implementation of PILD. Additional analyses showed that perceived barriers added a moderating effect in the intention-implementation relationship. The prediction of behaviors or practices that municipal authorities could implement to prevent Lyme disease will enable the evaluation over time of the evolution of Quebec municipalities' adaptation to Lyme disease. Moreover, the examination of the associations of specific psychosocial factors revealed important implications for the design of effective behavior-change interventions, which would allow health officials doing awareness work to create personalized interventions better suited to municipal officers and their specific contexts.","[Jacob, Johann; Valois, Pierre; Tessier, Maxime] Univ Laval, OQACC, Fac Sci Educ, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Aenishaenslin, Cecile; Bouchard, Catherine] Univ Montreal, Grp Rech Epidemiol Zoonoses & Sante Publ GREZOSP, FMV, St Hyacinthe, PQ J2S 2M1, Canada; [Bouchard, Catherine] Publ Hlth Agcy Canada, Natl Microbiol Lab, Publ Hlth Risk Sci Div, St Hyacinthe, PQ J2S 2M1, Canada; [Briand, Sandie] Natl Publ Hlth Inst Quebec INSPQ, Montreal, PQ H2P 1E2, Canada; [Talbot, Denis] Univ Laval, Fac Med, Dept Med Sociale & Prevent, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Talbot, Denis] Univ Laval, CHU Quebec, Ctr Rech, Unite Sante Populat & Prat Optimales Sante, Quebec City, PQ G1S 4L8, Canada",Laval University; Universite de Montreal; Public Health Agency of Canada; Laval University; Laval University,"Valois, P (corresponding author), Univ Laval, OQACC, Fac Sci Educ, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",johann.jacob@fse.ulaval.ca; pierre.valois@fse.ulaval.ca; cecile.aenishaenslin@umontreal.ca; catherine.bouchard@canada.ca; sandie.briand@inspq.qc.ca; denis.talbot@fmed.ulaval.ca; maxime.tessier@fse.ulaval.ca,,"Talbot, Denis/0000-0003-0431-3314; Tessier, Maxime/0000-0003-2337-3822; Valois, Pierre/0000-0002-9565-0895; Aenishaenslin, Cecile/0000-0002-8594-4945; Jacob, Johann/0000-0002-7354-950X","Green Fund of the Quebec government (QC, Canada)","Green Fund of the Quebec government (QC, Canada)","This research was funded by the Green Fund of the Quebec government (QC, Canada) as part of the 2013-2020 Climate Change Action Plan (http://www.mddelcc.gouv.qc.ca/cgfv/programmes.htm).",,72,6,6,3,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Nonetheless, transportation authorities have no assurances that their choices will best deal with the challenges and therefore substantially contribute to the minimization of negative climate change impacts.

The review is concluded in the form of a measure and policy database, which is then evaluated through a series of performance indicators. These indicators include the extent to which each measure contributes to the enhancement of transport system resilience as well as the temporal and financial resources required for its implementation. The evaluation is conducted by using an expert group survey covering multiple sectors and disciplines (academia, research, industry, and government).

China and Japan are the countries with high incidences of extreme weather/disaster, both facing with the urgent task of addressing climate change. This study seeks to quantitatively compare the impacts of extreme climatic events on socioeconomic systems (defined as vulnerability) of the two countries by simulating the consequences of hypothetical same degree of electricity disruption along with extreme events. To do that, two computable general equilibrium models are constructed, by using which three-stage scenarios are simulated for China and Japan, respectively. The results reveal that China and Japan have unequal socioeconomic vulnerabilities to extreme events. (1) Negative impact of the same degree of power outages is bigger on China's socioeconomic system than on that of Japan, and this difference is more obvious in the very short-run scenario.

Specifically, we distinguish three dimensions of public adaptation: extent, structure (form and timing) and organisation (coordination across territorial authorities and policy fields). Within each of these dimensions, we investigate how the self-interest of voters, pressure groups, bureaucrats and politicians may bias adaptation decisions. Thus, we indicate specific barriers to efficient public adaptation. Based on this framework, we illustrate how Germany's response to major flood disasters reflects the incentive structure of concerned stakeholders and their political interaction. The ad hoc character of some public adaptation measures implies a clear bias from the efficient benchmark. In conclusion, we argue that the propositions of Public Choice theory shed some light on how empirical public adaptation processes unfold.","[Gawel, Erik; Lehmann, Paul; Strunz, Sebastian; Heuson, Clemens] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Econ, Leipzig, Germany; [Gawel, Erik] Univ Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany; [Lehmann, Paul] Univ Oxford, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Leipzig University; University of Oxford,"Gawel, E (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Econ, Leipzig, Germany.;Gawel, E (corresponding author), Univ Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.",erik.gawel@ufz.de; paul.lehmann@ufz.de; sebastian.strunz@ufz.de; c.heuson@gmx.de,"Lehmann, Paul/F-8207-2013; Strunz, Sebastian/N-3555-2015","Lehmann, Paul/0000-0001-7999-9125",,,,,85,3,3,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

These mandates target possible adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, the degree to which climate change is actively being considered in agency planning and management decisions is largely unknown. We explored the usefulness of climate change science for federal resource managers, focusing on the efficacy of potential adaptation strategies and barriers limiting the use of climate change science in adaptation efforts. Our study was conducted in the northern Rocky Mountains region of the western United States, where we interacted with 77 U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management personnel through surveys, semistructured interviews, and four collaborative workshops at locations across Idaho and Montana. We used a mixed-methods approach to evaluate managers' perceptions about adapting to and mitigating for climate change. Although resource managers incorporate general language about climate change in regional and landscape-level planning documents, they are currently not planning on-the-ground adaptation or mitigation projects. However, managers felt that their organizations were most likely to adapt to climate change through use of existing management strategies that are already widely implemented for other non climate-related management goals. These existing strategies, (e.g., thinning and prescribed burning) are perceived as more feasible than new climate-specific methods (e.g., assisted migration) because they already have public and agency support, accomplish multiple goals, and require less anticipation of the future timing and probability of climate change impacts. Participants reported that the most common barriers to using climate change information included a lack of management-relevant climate change science, inconsistent agency guidance, and insufficient time and resources to access, interpret, and apply current climate science information to management plans.","[Klos, P.

Frequent droughts and poor performance of rain-fed crops in upland fields have resulted in mounting pressure to cultivate dambos where both organic and inorganic amendments are used to sustain crop yields. Dambo cultivation potentially increases greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The objective of the study was to quantify the effects of applying different rates of inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilisers (60, 120, 240 kg N ha(-1)) as NH4NO3, organic manures (5,000, 10,000 and 15,000 kg ha(-1)) and a combination of both sources (integrated management) on GHG emissions in cultivated dambos planted to rape (Brassica napus). Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in plots with organic manures ranged from 218 to 894 A mu g m(-2) h(-1), while for inorganic N and integrated nutrient management, emissions ranged from 555 to 5,186 A mu g m(-2) h(-1) and 356-2,702 A mu g m(-2) h(-1) respectively. Cropped and fertilised dambos were weak sources of methane (CH4), with emissions ranging from -0.02 to 0.9 mg m(-2) h(-1,) while manures and integrated management increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, crop yields were better under integrated nutrient management. The use of inorganic fertilisers resulted in higher N2O emission per kg yield obtained (6-14 g N2O kg(-1) yield), compared to 0.7-4.5 g N2O kg(-1) yield and 1.6-4.6 g N2O kg(-1) yield for organic manures and integrated nutrient management respectively. This suggests that the use of organic and integrated nutrient management has the potential to increase yield and reduce yield scaled N2O emissions.","[Nyamadzawo, G.; Wuta, M.] Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Soil Sci & Agr Engn, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Nyamadzawo, G.] Bindura Univ Sci Educ, Dept Environm Sci, Bindura, Zimbabwe; [Nyamangara, J.] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Matopos Res Stn, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe; [Smith, J.

Part II: The Future",WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SLOPING LAND; CROP YIELD; VULNERABILITY; VARIABILITY; ANDALUSIA; TRENDS,"The adaptability of olive-growing systems to climate change is studied in the Sierra Magina region (Andalusia) using an interdisciplinary approach that evaluates and makes associations across climate, water resources, and socioeconomic strategies. First, the evolution of rainfall and temperature during the twenty-first century is assessed at the local scale using 17 regional climate model (RCM) simulations. A 15%-30% rainfall reduction is expected in the fall combined with a 7%-9% annual reduction by 2030-50. Based on a regression model relating yields to rainfall, residual yields (independent of the increasing trend in the present period and from the biennial fruit bearing of the olive tree) are projected to decrease by 7% and 3.5% by 2030-50 for rainfed and irrigated olive groves, respectively. Substantial uncertainties in these results are discussed. A GIS analysis shows a reduction of ground and surface water resources, which are the basis of the present adaptation to rainfall variability, and an uneven potential for adaptation to climate change in the Sierra Magina region. Despite the important challenges faced by this rural region, there is no consensus among the local key actors regarding adaptation strategies. This is due in part to the diversity among farmers, but also to the different levels of awareness about climate change among all the stakeholders and farmers. Since the projected decline in medium-range future yields is not very high, there might be time and possibilities, especially in the northern part of the Sierra Magina, to build a local adaptability strategy within the next 20 years that would take into account improved methods of water management and a better economic valorization of olive oil. But at longer time scales, the adaptability of the olive-growing system to yield and water resource declines seems to be threatened.","[Ronchail, Josyane] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Univ Paris 04, UMR Locean,UPMC,CNRS,IRD,MNHN, F-75205 Paris 13, France; [Cohen, Marianne; Angles, Stephane] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR Ladyss, F-75205 Paris 13, France; [Alonso-Roldan, Maria] Pasos, Participac & Sostenibilidad, Granada, Spain; [Garcin, Helene] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, F-75205 Paris 13, France; [Sultan, Benjamin] UP6, CNRS, IRD, LOCEAN,UMR 7159,MNHN, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite,"Cohen, M (corresponding author), Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR Ladyss, 5 Rue Thomas Mann,Case Courrier 7001, F-75205 Paris 13, France.",cohen@univ-paris-diderot.fr,"Sultan, Benjamin/C-8957-2012; Marianne, Cohen/GPX-5979-2022","Sultan, Benjamin/0000-0003-0416-0338; Marianne, Cohen/0000-0002-3411-2647","French Scientific Interest Group (GIS) Climate, Environment and Society; CNRS; CEA; UVSQ; UPMC; Ecole Polytechnique; ADEME; UMR Ladyss; University Paris Diderot (Erasmus Program)","French Scientific Interest Group (GIS) Climate, Environment and Society; CNRS(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); CEA(French Atomic Energy Commission); UVSQ; UPMC; Ecole Polytechnique; ADEME; UMR Ladyss; University Paris Diderot (Erasmus Program)","We thank the French Scientific Interest Group (GIS) Climate, Environment and Society (CNRS, CEA, UVSQ, UPMC, Ecole Polytechnique, and ADEME) for the financial support it brought to the Regyna (Regionalisation of rainfall and hydrological and agronomical impacts) program, coordinated by Benjamin Sultan (French Institute for Research and Development IRD and Laboratory of Oceanography and Climate Locean) who encouraged our participation to the program.

Examination of the response of crop water consumption to climate change may provide a guide for adapting local agricultural production and ecological construction to new realities. The water consumption of three local crops (wheat, naked oats, and potatoes) is examined for Wuchuan County in the northern agro-pastoral transitional zone of China using meteorological data from 1960 to 2007 and soil moisture data from 1983 to 2007. The relationships between climate change and the crop water consumption are discussed. The results show that Wuchuan experienced both a warming trend and a reduction of precipitation between 1960 and 2007. The annual mean surface air temperature increased at a rate of 0.04A degrees C yr(-1) and the annual precipitation decreased at a rate of 0.7 mm yr(-1). Both trends are particularly pronounced between 1983 and 2007, with an increase in annual mean temperature of 0.09A degrees C yr(-1) and a decrease in annual mean precipitation of 2.1 mm yr(-1). Crop water consumption decreased between 1983 and 2007 for wheat (1.65 mm yr(-1)), naked oats (2.04 mm yr(-1)), and potatoes (3.85 mm yr(-1)). Potatoes and naked oats consume more water than wheat. Climate change has significantly impacted crop water consumption. Water consumption and rainfall during the growing season are positively correlated, while water consumption and active accumulated temperature are negatively correlated. Compared to precipitation, accumulated temperature has little impact on crop water consumption. Recent climate change has been detrimental for crop production in Wuchuan County. Adaptation to climate change should include efforts to breed drought-resistant crops and to develop drought-resistant cultivation techniques.","[Zhao Lingyu; Pan Zhihua; An Pingli; Pan Xuebiao] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Zhao Lingyu] Huafeng Meteorol Media Grp, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhao Lingyu; Pan Zhihua; Pan Xuebiao; Zhao Peiyi] Minist Agr, Key Ecol & Environm Field Stn Sci Observat Huhhot, Wuchuan 011705, Peoples R China; [Liu Yaling] Purdue Univ, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",China Agricultural University; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Pan, ZH (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",panzhihua@cau.edu.cn,"Liu, Yaling/J-8461-2017",,National Basic Research and Development (973) Program of China [2012CB956200]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41271110]; National Science and Technology Support Program of China [2012BAD09B00],National Basic Research and Development (973) Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science and Technology Support Program of China,"Supported by the National Basic Research and Development (973) Program of China (2012CB956200), National Natural Science Foundation of China (41271110), and National Science and Technology Support Program of China (2012BAD09B00).",,17,3,5,0,30,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0894-0525,2191-4788,,ACTA METEOROL SIN,Acta Meteorol.

Africa also has insufficient hydrological information owing to the allocation of few resources to research efforts. Unreliable runoff datasets and large uncertainties in runoff trends due to climate change patterns and human activities are major challenges to water resource management in Africa. Therefore, this study aimed to improve runoff estimates and to assess runoff trend responses to climate change and human activities in Africa during 1981-2016. Using statistical methods, monthly gridded runoff datasets were generated for the period of 1981-2016 from a modified runoff curve number method calibrated with river discharge data from 535 gauging stations. According to the cross-validation results, the constructed runoff datasets comprised the Nash and Sutcliffe coefficients ranging from 0.5 to 1, coefficients of determination ranging from 0.5 to 1, and percent biases between +/- 25% for a large number of stations up to 73%, 80%, and 91% of the 535 gauged catchments used as references. Analysis of runoff trend responses to climate change and human activities revealed that land cover change contributed more (72%) to the observed net runoff change (0.30% a(-1)) than continental climate changes (28%). These contributions were results of cropland expansion rate of 0.46% a(-1) and a precipitation increase of 0.07% a(-1). The performance and simplicity of the statistical methods used in this study could be useful for improving runoff estimations in other regions with limited streamflow data. The results of the current study could be important to natural resource managers and decision-makers in terms of raising awareness of climate change adaptation strategies and agricultural land-use policies in Africa.","[Karamage, Fidele; Liu, Yuanbo; Liu, Yongwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Karamage, Fidele] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Liu, YB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",ybliu@niglas.ac.cn,,,National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFE0105900]; Chinese Academy of Sciences and the World Academy of Sciences (CAS-TWAS) President's PhD Fellowship Program,National Key R&D Program of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences and the World Academy of Sciences (CAS-TWAS) President's PhD Fellowship Program,"This study was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China, No.2018YFE0105900, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the World Academy of Sciences (CAS-TWAS) President's PhD Fellowship Program.

Achieving clear, coherent, and ambitious urban greening strategies, embedded in urban planning and developed in a co-creative, participatory and inclusive manner, is highly challenging within the EU enlargement context. In this article, such challenges are studied through two recent urban development initiatives in Belgrade, the Capital of Serbia: the first initiative focuses on planning the new Linear Park, within the framework of the CLEVER Cities Horizon 2020 project; the second initiative envisages the transformation of the privatised Avala Film Complex in the Kosutnjak Urban Forest, primarily led by private interests but supported by the local authorities. The multiple-case study research method is applied, with an exploratory purpose and as a basis for potential future research on evaluation of co-creation processes for NBS implementation. The theoretical basis of this article is founded in the research on sustainability transitions, focusing on multi-level perspective (MLP) framework. The urban planning system in Belgrade and Serbia is observed as a socio-technical regime of the MLP. In such framework, we recognize co-creative planning of the Linear Park as a niche innovation. We interpret opposition towards planning of the Avala Film Complex as escalation, or an extreme element of the socio-technical landscape, comprised of civic unrests and political tensions on one side, combined with the climate crisis and excessive pollution on the other side. Moreover, the article examines informal urban planning instruments that can be implemented by the practitioners of niche innovations, that could support urban planners and NBS advocates in the Serbian and EU enlargement contexts to face the challenges of motivating all stakeholders to proactively, constructively and appropriately engage in co-creation.","[Mitic-Radulovic, Ana] Ctr Expt Urban Studies CEUS, Dalmatinska 70, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Lalovic, Ksenija] Univ Belgrade, Fac Architecture, Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra 73, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Mitic-Radulovic, A (corresponding author), Ctr Expt Urban Studies CEUS, Dalmatinska 70, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",ana.mitic-radulovic@ceus.rs; ksenija.lalovic@arh.bg.ac.rs,"Lalovic, Ksenija/HHZ-9274-2022","Lalovic, Ksenija/0000-0001-7261-7921",European Union's Horizon 2020 innovation action program [776604],European Union's Horizon 2020 innovation action program,This research was funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 innovation action program under grant agreement number 776604.,,49,7,7,11,26,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2021,13,14,,,,,,,7576,10.3390/su13147576,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13147576,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TO5LP,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000676953200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the capacity to detect and measure those impacts are still limited, with effects largely unstudied. In June 2016, a hailstorm with wind gusts of over 100 km.h(-1) caused an unprecedented mangrove dieback on Eastern Brazil. To quantify the scale of impact and short-term recovery of mangroves (15-mo), we used satellite imagery and field sampling to evaluate changes in forest structure in control and impacted areas after the hailstorm. Satellite imagery revealed mangrove dieback in over 500 ha, corresponding to 293% of the total forest area suddenly impacted after the hailstorm. Fifteen months after the hailstorm, some impacted areas show an initial recovery, while others continued to degrade. The El Nino years of 2014-2016 created mild drought conditions in Eastern Brazil. As observed in wetlands of semi-arid regions during the same period, mangrove recovery may have been impaired by continued physiological stress and climate change effects. Economic losses in the study site from typical mangrove ecosystem services including food provision, climate regulation, raw materials and nurseries are estimated to at least USS 792,624 yr(-1) . This is the first evidence of an extreme weather impact on mangroves in Brazil that typically provide unique ecological and economic subsistence to coastal populations. Our results reveal that there is a pressing need for long-term monitoring and climate change adaptation actions for coastal wetlands in Brazil, and to provide broad estimates of ecosystem values associated with these ecosystems given many areas are already experiencing chronic stress from local impacts, drought and high temperatures.

WIBCI is a new type of risk-transfer-mechanism (RTM) being tested in the Philippines that operates on the principle of having pre-agreed indices set per weather variable between the insurer and insured. Claims happen when these indices are considered breached or are not met in the case of low rainfall cover for a particular period. Operation-wise, the WIBCI product is revolutionary and could be a potentially quick-responsive climate change adaptation measure. However, new as it is, questions on the applicability of the product, particularly the indices, have to be evaluated and scrutinized. Validation points used in this study were breach assessments via the WIBCI product's procedure and its consistency with actual drought incident reports. Average yields of the community relative to WIBCI farmers' individual yields were also used to validate consistency of breaches or no breaches among enrolees. Results of yield analysis relative to each community's average yields showed 95.7% of enrolees have low yields. When matched with the breaches assessed using the existing indices, only 52 enrolees breached the indices. Overall validity of the existing index via consistency of breached indices with low yields was only 70% but the 30% mismatch was still significant from an insurance business standpoint hence, a postulated set of indices specific to the location were developed for comparison. With the postulated indices, only 20 enrolees breached the indices which were much lower in number arid more acceptable considering the absence of PAGASA's official drought incident reports. However, consistency analysis revealed that a much higher basis risk was incurred when using the postulated index which was mostly due to the mismatch of no breaches and low actual grain yields.","[Capistrano, Ailon Oliver V.; Quilang, Eduardo Jimmy P.] Philippine Rice Res Inst, Cent Expt Stn, Sci City Of Munoz 3119, Nueva Ecija, Philippines",Philippine Rice Research Institute,"Capistrano, AOV (corresponding author), Philippine Rice Res Inst, Cent Expt Stn, Sci City Of Munoz 3119, Nueva Ecija, Philippines.",ailon.capistrano@gmail.com,,,Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation (PCIC) via the Philippines Climate Change Adaptation Project (PhiICCAP),Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation (PCIC) via the Philippines Climate Change Adaptation Project (PhiICCAP),"The authors would like to acknowledge the technical assistance of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) particularly Ms. Rosalina G. de Guzman, Chief of the Climate Data Section, for her generous technical assistance towards this evaluation.

The paper examines the nature of accountability in climate change governance using the Caribbean region as a case study. In doing so, the paper makes two original contributions. First, using insights from the environmental governance literature, it presents a conceptual framework that categorises the types (levels, relationships and mechanisms) of accountability in governance that can be used to test accountability. The accountability framework comprises two levels (internal/external accountability); four relationships (normative, relational, decision and behavioural); and four mechanisms or processes through which accountability can be exercised (certification, monitoring, participation by stakeholders in the overseeing of projects and self-reporting). Second, through an analysis of survey and interview responses from Caribbean climate change experts, it reports on the nature of accountability in climate change governance in the context of Caribbean Small Island Developing States. To do this, first it identifies the actors involved in Caribbean climate governance at the regional and national scales. Then, using the framework, it examines which levels, relationships and processes exist within and between climate governance regional institutions, international partners, government agencies, non-governmental organisations and the private sector for climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. The paper draws two main conclusions: first, generally actors valued accountability as a good governance norm. Secondly, limited resources and the perception that using the accountability mechanisms will retard policy implementation led to low levels of accountability in practice. Finally, the study examined how accountability can be enhanced in the climate change sector by ensuring that each of the elements of the framework is operationalised for both state and non-state climate change projects.","[Scobie, Michelle] Univ West Indies, Sir Arthur Lewis Inst Social & Econ Studies, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago; [Scobie, Michelle] Univ West Indies, Inst Int Relat, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago",University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Saint Augustine; University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Saint Augustine,"Scobie, M (corresponding author), Univ West Indies, Sir Arthur Lewis Inst Social & Econ Studies, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago.;Scobie, M (corresponding author), Univ West Indies, Inst Int Relat, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago.",Michelle.Scobie@sta.uwi.edu,,"Scobie, Michelle/0000-0002-8928-047X",,,,,49,16,16,8,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Voluntary adoption of flood insurance has been seen as a function of risk perception that is shaped by social norms. This paper attempts to clarify the relationship between these factors. It is based on a household survey conducted in the eastern cities of Australia and involving a total of 501 randomly selected residents. Results of a path analysis show that the likelihood of having flood insurance cover was associated with perceived social norms, but not perceived flood risk. In addition, perceived norms and risk were statistically related to each other. It is concluded that social norms played a mediating role between insuring decision and risk perception. Risk perception might influence the insuring decision indirectly through shaping perception of social norms. This implies that adaptive behaviour is not necessarily a function of risk perception, but an outcome of its impacts upon the ways in which the individuals situate themselves in their social circles or the society. There is a feedback process in which individual perceptions of risk manifest as both a cause and effect, shaping and being shaped by the socio-cultural context. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To study attitudes and perceptions towards environmental measures, we apply several items of New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) and Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) theories to cross-examine the public perceptions of climate change in the urban city-state of Singapore through analysis of quantitative questionnaires and qualitative semi-structured interviews. The perceptions were explored about ecological orientation (two dimensions of NEP: level of concern, self-reported knowledge) and environmental behavior (two dimensions of VBN: acceptance and support of national adaptation measures, confidence in adaptation). There is a moderate to high concern for climate change, in general, and sea level rise and flooding, in particular, and the concern is expected to increase in the future. Individuals who indicated a higher level of concern are likely to be more accepting and supportive of climate change measures. Also, while the majority of the populace are amenable to legislative measures from the government, such as enacting pro-environmental laws and more are agreeable to accepting cuts on living standards, as opposed to paying more in prices and taxes. Ecological orientation does not translate directly into environmental behavior, highlighting the gulf between perception and behavior in Singapore.","[Yousefpour, Rasoul; Ng, Claire] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-7016 Freiburg, Germany; [Prinz, Anja] Univ Freiburg, Dept Educ Sci, Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg; University of Freiburg,"Yousefpour, R (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-7016 Freiburg, Germany.",rasoul.yousefpour@ife.uni-freiburg.de,,,,,,,67,5,6,8,21,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1080-7039,1549-7860,,HUM ECOL RISK ASSESS,Hum.

We found (1) land surface temperature (LST) is negatively correlated with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) in all seasons; (2) Tree-covered greenspace with a compact shape would be a priority for climate adaption in high-latitude cities. While when the area of blue-green space is large to a certain extent ( > 1 ha), the complex shape also has a strong cooling-effect. Further, the area and cooling extent and intensity conform a logarithm function with significant correlations except for winter. (3) Compared with other seasons, blue-green space provides a higher cooling-effect in summer, and the mean cooling extent and intensity are 150 m and 2.47 degrees C; (4) Background temperature can significantly affect the threshold value of efficiency (TVoE).

This paper reviews contemporary econometric approaches that assess the impacts of climate change on agriculture and consider farmer adaptation, complementing previous methodological reviews with this distinctive adaptation perspective. The value of adaptation can be measured by comparing the differences between the long-term climate change effect and the short-term weather shock effect. However, this theoretical model has not yet been well supported by empirical evidence, as it is difficult to identify true adaptation, incorporating adaptation cost, and estimated adaptation rate. Quasi-natural experiments, cost-benefit analysis, and Bayesian models are effective tools to address these methodological drawbacks. Two methods dominate in the estimation of climate effects, but each has its own advantages. A good estimate provides a trade-off between the incorporation of farmers' adaptive behavior and the reduction in omitted variables bias. Cross-sectional data models based on climate variability can capture farmers' long-term adaptations but are prone to bias due to omitted variables. Panel data models are more effective at mitigating omitted variable bias by applying fixed effects, but do not consider farmers' adaptative behavior to long-term climate change. To address this dilemma, several cutting-edge approaches have been developed, including integration with the weather and climate model, the long differences approach, and the long- and short-term hybrid approach. We found three key challenges, namely: (1) exploring adaptation mechanisms, (2) the CO2 fertilization effect, and (3) estimating the distributional effects of climate impacts. We also recommend future empirical studies to incorporate satellite remote sensing data, examine the relationship between different adaptation measures, model farmers' future climate expectations, and include adaptation costs.","[Su, Xun; Chen, Minpeng] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Chen, MP (corresponding author), Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",minpeng.chen@ruc.edu.cn,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [2019030019],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Funds of Renmin University of China,"This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, and the Research Funds of Renmin University of China (2019030019).",,76,0,0,11,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2022,14,21,,,,,,,13700,10.3390/su142113700,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142113700,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6B6HZ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000881433100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A majority (>50%) of farmers perceived an increase in temperature, decrease in rainfall, shortening of growing season, early cessation of rainfall, and increase in the frequency of dry spells at the beginning of the growing season. In line with farmers' perception, analysis of climate data indicated (i) an increase in mean annual temperature and minimum growing season temperature and (ii) a decrease in total rainfall. Farmers' perception of early cessation of rainfall and more-frequent drought periods were not detected by climate data analysis. To cope with the decrease in rainfall and late start of the growing season, farmers used drought-tolerant cultivars and implemented water-saving technologies. Despite a perceived warming, no specific adaptation to heat stress was mentioned by farmers. We found evidence of a link between farmers' perception of climate change and the implementation of some adaptation options. Our study highlights the need for a dialogue between farmers and researchers to develop new strategies to compensate for the expected negative impacts of heat stress on agricultural productivity.","[Amadou, Traore; Mamoutou, Kouressy; Alassane, B.

As plantation crops with a long lifespan, their cultivation requires long-term planning. The evaluation of climate change impacts on their biophysical suitability is therefore essential for developing adaptation measures and selecting appropriate varieties or crops. In this study, we modelled the current and future suitability of coffee arabica, cashew and avocado on a global scale based on climatic and soil requirements of the three crops. We used climate outputs of 14 global circulation models based on three emission scenarios to model the future (2050) climate change impacts on the crops both globally and in the main producing countries. For all three crops, climatic factors, mainly long dry seasons, mean temperatures (high and low), low minimum temperatures and annual precipitation (high and low), were more restrictive for the global extent of suitable growing regions than land and soil parameters, which were primarily low soil pH, unfavourable soil texture and steep slopes. We found shifts in suitable growing regions due to climate change with both regions of future expansion and contraction for all crops investigated. Coffee proved to be most vulnerable, with negative climate impacts dominating in all main producing regions. For both cashew and avocado, areas suitable for cultivation are expected to expand globally while in most main producing countries, the areas of highest suitability may decrease. The study reveals that climate change adaptation will be necessary in most major producing regions of all three crops. At high latitudes and high altitudes, however, they may all profit from increasing minimum temperatures. The study presents the first global assessment of climate change impacts on cashew and avocado suitability.","[Grueter, Roman; Trachsel, Tim; Laube, Patrick; Jaisli, Isabel] Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Inst Nat Resource Sci, Wadenswil, Switzerland",Zurich University of Applied Sciences,"Gruter, R (corresponding author), Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Inst Nat Resource Sci, Wadenswil, Switzerland.",roman.grueter@zhaw.ch,,"Laube, Patrick/0000-0002-5926-3177; Gruter, Roman/0000-0002-4441-9909",Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture,Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture(Syngenta),This study has been funded by the Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture.,,52,12,12,6,9,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JAN 26,2022,17,1,,,,,,,e0261976,10.1371/journal.pone.0261976,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261976,,,24,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,3D9IN,35081123,"Green Published, Green Accepted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000829607600019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Shanghai is a coastal megacity at large estuary delta with rising flood risks. This study aims to quantify the overall economic-societal risks of storm flooding and their spatial patterns in Shanghai. Design/methodology/approach Based on multiple storm flood scenarios at different return periods, as well as fine-scale data sets including gridded GDP, gridded population and vector land-use, a probabilistic risk model incorporating geographic information system is used to assess the economic-societal risks of flooding and their spatial distributions. Findings Our results show that, from 1/200 to 1/5,000-year floods, the exposed assets will increase from USD 85.4bn to USD 657.6bn, and the direct economic losses will increase from USD 3.06bn to USD 52bn. The expected annual damage (EAD) of assets is around USD 84.36m. Hotpots of EAD are mainly distributed in the city center, the depressions along the upper Huangpu River in the southwest, the north coast of Hangzhou Bay, and the confluence of the Huangpu River and Yangtze River in the northeast. From 1/200 to 1/5,000-year floods, the exposed population will rise from 280 thousand to 2,420 thousand, and the estimated casualties will rise from 299 to 1,045. The expected annual casualties (EAC) are around 2.28. Hotspots of casualties are generally consistent with those of EAD. Originality/value In contrast to previous studies that focus on a single flood scenario or a particular type of flood exposure/risk in Shanghai, the findings contribute to an understanding of overall flood risks and their spatial patterns, which have significant implications for cost-benefit analysis of flood resilience strategies.","[Tang, Jin; Li, Weijiang; Zhang, Zhonghao; Du, Shiqiang; Wen, Jiahong] Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Environm & Geog Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Fang, Jiayi] East China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yanjuan] Ningbo Univ, Dept Geog & Spatial Informat Tech, Ningbo, Peoples R China",Shanghai Normal University; East China Normal University; Ningbo University,"Li, WJ (corresponding author), Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Environm & Geog Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",lwj@shnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771540, 4187010049, 42001014]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC1503001]; Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [20YJCZH180]; Zhejiang Public Welfare Technology Research Project [LGF21D010003]; Basic Science and Technology Project of Ningbo [202002N3200]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China; Zhejiang Public Welfare Technology Research Project; Basic Science and Technology Project of Ningbo,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 41771540, 4187010049, 42001014), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFC1503001), the Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. 20YJCZH180), the Zhejiang Public Welfare Technology Research Project (Grant No. LGF21D010003), the Basic Science and Technology Project of Ningbo (Grant No. 202002N3200), and the Ningbo Fan-3315 Plan.",,74,2,2,10,39,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

These five datasets were extracted from 115 literature sources on the daylighting of streams that were published between 1992 and 2018. Dataset I consist of 19 variables that combine two types of data extracted from these sources: ten manifest variables (indisputable, obvious, factual) and nine variables extracted from the sources' latent content (indirect, hence, based on careful reading of the sources' contents). Manifest variables include, among others, authors' names and affiliations, authorship location, and publication year. Latent variables include primarily the literature sources' underlying themes and their sub-themes (sub-categories), the daylighting case studies/projects discussed, and the geographic coverage or scope addressed in the literature sources. Datasets II identifies 16 literature sources that delve into the climate change adaptation and/or mitigation theme and reveal how it was tackled vis-a-vis the other themes/sub-themes. Dataset III identifies and provides detailed information on the 145 different stream daylighting case studies/projects mentioned in the literature's sources, such as each project's location, daylighted length, completion date, cost, and type of treatment. Dataset IV is a Tableau Dashboard that offers interactive analytical querying in the form of relational analyses and data visualization while Dataset V is an Interactive Map created in Google My Map that maps the 145 stream daylighting case studies/projects mentioned in the literature sources over and provides a synopsis on each based on the literature's contents. The combination of these five datasets and their diversity in type and presentation yields a comprehensive, global, and unique repository of information on the daylighting of urban streams for all types of audiences (academic, professional, and laypeople).

Precipitation extremes will change due to global warming, but these low frequency events are difficult to analyse using (short) observed time series. In this study, we analysed large 2000 year ensembles of present day climate and of a 2 and 3 degrees C warmer world produced with the EC-Earth model. We performed a regional assessment of climate indicators related to temperature and precipitation (positive degree days, accumulated precipitation, [pre- and post-] monsoon precipitation), their sensitivity to temperature change and the change in return periods of extreme temperature and precipitation in a 2 and 3 degrees C warmer climate. In general, the 2 degrees C warmer world shows a homogeneous response of changes in climate indicators and return periods, while distinct differences between regions are present in a 3 degrees C warmer world and changes no longer follow a general trend. This non-linear effect can indicate the presence of a tipping point in the climate system. The most affected regions are located in monsoon-dominated regions, where precipitation amounts, positive degree days, extreme temperature, extreme precipitation and compound events are projected to increase the most. Largest changes in climate indicators are found in East Himalaya, followed by the Hindu Kush and West and Central Himalaya regions. Western regions will experience drier summers and wetter winters, while monsoon dominated regions drier winters and wetter summers and northern regions a wetter climate year round. We also found that precipitation increases in HMA in a 3 degrees C warmer world are substantially larger (13%) compared to the global average (5.9%). Additionally, the increase in weather extremes will exacerbate natural hazards with large possible impacts for mountain communities. The results of this study could provide important guidance for formulating climate change adaptation strategies in HMA.","[Bonekamp, P. N. J.; Wanders, N.; Lutz, A. F.; Immerzeel, W.

Understanding rural vulnerability is vital for developing effective disaster risk reduction strategies. Even though rural areas and cities are intrinsically linked, rural vulnerability was assessed without considering its relation to cities. Numerous theoretical frameworks on systemizing and assessing vulnerability were developed with varying level of scope and depth in terms of scale, dimensions, and components. Nevertheless, these frameworks did not explicitly mention the impact of flood or other hazards on the linkages between spatial units i.e., rural and urban. This study aims to understand and conceptualize the rural vulnerability with respect to the dynamics of rural-urban linkages in the case of flood events. To do so, current literature on rural-urban linkages, vulnerability, as well as factors that influence them were critically reviewed. Taking into account the main elements of rural-urban linkages (flow of people, information, finances, goods and services), components of vulnerability (exposure, susceptibility, and capacity), and factors (social, economic, institutional, infrastructural, spatial, and environmental), a unified framework is proposed. The framework underscores that the role of rural-urban linkages is essential to fully understand rural flood vulnerability. Moreover, the framework highlights the role of spatial factors-city size and proximity to the city-as crucial to comprehend rural vulnerability. This framework can be used as a tool for understanding multifaceted rural vulnerability for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction considering spatial development perspective. In this context, empirical investigations can be made to validate the proposed framework and policies can be introduced accordingly. Overall, the proposed framework can help recognize concepts and links of vulnerability, rural-urban dependencies, and rural development dynamics.","[Jamshed, Ali; Birkmann, Joern; Feldmeyer, Daniel] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Spatial & Reg Planning IREUS, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Rana, Irfan Ahmad] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Sch Civil & Environm Engn SCEE, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan",University of Stuttgart; National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan,"Jamshed, A (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Spatial & Reg Planning IREUS, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",ali.jamshed@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de; joern.birkmann@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de; daniel.feldmeyer@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de; irfanrana90@hotmail.com,"Birkmann, Joern jb/J-5736-2015; Rana, Irfan Ahmad/C-2560-2017","Rana, Irfan Ahmad/0000-0002-3157-1186; Jamshed, Ali/0000-0003-4802-1225; Birkmann, Joern/0000-0001-8733-3964","Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan [SAP-50020940]; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) [PIN = 91549672]; University of Stuttgart","Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan(Higher Education Commission of Pakistan); German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); University of Stuttgart","This research was funded by Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan (SAP-50020940) and German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) (PIN = 91549672) and The APC was funded by University of Stuttgart.",,147,24,24,4,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2020,12,7,,,,,,,2894,10.3390/su12072894,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12072894,,,25,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LL4WR,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000531558100319,View Full Record in Web of Science

The phenomenon of climate change threatens to worsen poverty or burden populations with additional hardships, especially in poor societies with weak infrastructure and economic well-being. The importance of the perceptions, experiences, and knowledge of indigenous peoples has gained prominence in discussions of climate change and adaptation in developing countries and among international development organizations. Efforts to evaluate the role of indigenous knowledge in adaptation planning, however, have largely focused on rural people and their agricultural livelihoods. This paper presents the results of a study that examines perceptions, experiences, and indigenous knowledge relating to climate change and variability in three communities of metropolitan Accra, which is the capital of Ghana. The study design is based on a three-part conceptual framework and interview process involving risk mapping, mental models, and individual stressor cognition. Most of the residents interviewed in the three communities of urban Accra attributed climate change to the combination of deforestation and the burning of firewood and rubbish. None of the residents associated climate change with fossil fuel emissions from developed countries. Numerous potential adaptation strategies were suggested by the residents, many of which have been used effectively during past drought and flood events. Results suggest that ethnic residential clustering as well as strong community bonds in metropolitan Accra have allowed various groups and long-settled communities to engage in the sharing and transmission of knowledge of weather patterns and trends. Understanding and building upon indigenous knowledge may enhance the design, acceptance, and implementation of climate change adaptation strategies in Accra and urban regions of other developing nations.","[Codjoe, Samuel Nii Ardey] Univ Ghana, Reg Inst Populat Studies, Legon, Ghana; [Owusu, George] Univ Ghana, Inst Stat Social & Econ Res, Legon, Ghana; [Burkett, Virginia] US Geol Survey, Many, LA 71449 USA",University of Ghana; University of Ghana; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Codjoe, SNA (corresponding author), Univ Ghana, Reg Inst Populat Studies, POB LG 96, Legon, Ghana.",scodjoe@ug.edu.gh; gowusu@ug.edu.gh; virginia_burkett@usgs.gov,"mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020; Owusu, George/AAI-3380-2020",,,,,,54,66,66,5,77,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

The information gathered was based on web searches, meetings and questionnaire responses with organizations and individuals working as environmental policy developers, stakeholders and practitioners of catchment management and river restoration. The paper utilizes this information to explore generic issues promoting and constraining a move to integrated catchment scale river restoration. Catchment scale river restoration was defined as any river restoration activity that singly, or in combination, restores natural catchment processes and a naturally functioning ecosystem and brings benefit or environmental services to the whole catchment and not just to the site of restoration. The river restoration project data compiled showed that the number of projects in Scotland is on a strong upward trajectory, but the number of catchment scale projects is still limited. The data also showed a trend towards a range of underpinning reasons for river restoration. Traditionally the reasons for river restoration in Scotland have been strongly fisheries focussed, with another key driver being biodiversity conservation. Sustainable flood management and climate change adaptation are seen as emerging drivers of river restoration. In terms of the individuals interviewed, most appreciated that river restoration can bring about multiple benefits and should be underpinned by a good understanding of catchment processes. Our overall assertion based on our study is that unless there is a fundamental paradigm shift, a change in the nature and level of funding for river restoration and a single organization is given overall authority to direct river restoration. 'business as usual' will continue and the benefits of catchment scale river restoration will be limited.

We conducted workshops and in-depth interviews in two 'communities' to develop insight into Yolngu peoples' observations and perspectives on climate change, and their ideas and preferences for adaptation. All participants reported observing changes in their ecological landscape, which they attributed to mining, tourism 'development', and climate change. 'Strange changes' noticed particularly in the last five years, had caused concern and anxiety among many participants. Despite their concern about ecological changes, participants were primarily worried about other issues affecting their community's general welfare. The results suggest that strategies and policies are needed to strengthen adaptive capacity of communities to mitigate over-arching poverty and wellbeing issues, as well as respond to changes in climate. Participants believed that major constraints to strengthening adaptive capacity had external origins, at regional, state and federal levels. Examples are poor communication and engagement, top-down institutional processes that allow little Indigenous voice, and lack of recognition of Indigenous culture and practices. Participants' preferences for strategies to strengthen community adaptive capacity tended to be those that lead towards greater self-sufficiency, independence, empowerment, resilience and close contact with the natural environment. Based on the results, we developed a simple model to highlight main determinants of community vulnerability. A second model highlights components important in facilitating discourse on enhancing community capacity to adapt to climatic and other stressors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, there are limits to the ability of systems to adapt. Here, we introduce the concept of an. adaptation frontier., which is defined as a socio-ecological system's transitional adaptive operating space between safe and unsafe domains. A number of driving forces are responsible for determining the sustainability of systems on the frontier. These include path dependence, adaptation/development deficits, values conflicts and discounting of future loss and damage. The cumulative implications of these driving forces are highly uncertain. Nevertheless, the fact that a broad range of systems already persist at the edge of their frontiers suggests a high likelihood that some limits will eventually be exceeded. The resulting system transformation is likely to manifest as anticipatory modification of management objectives or loss and damage. These outcomes vary significantly with respect to their ethical implications. Successful navigation of the adaptation frontier will necessitate new paradigms of risk governance to elicit knowledge that encourages reflexive reevaluation of societal values that enable or constrain sustainability.","[Preston, Benjamin L.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Preston, Benjamin L.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Dow, Kirstin] Univ S Carolina, Dept Geog, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Berkhout, Frans] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Preston, BL (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, POB 2008,MS 6301, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",prestonbl@ornl.gov; kdow@sc.edu; frans.berkhout@vu.nl,"Preston, Benjamin L/B-9001-2012; Berkhout, Frans/N-4196-2013","Preston, Benjamin L/0000-0002-7966-2386; Berkhout, Frans/0000-0001-8668-0470",Oak Ridge National Laboratory's (ORNL) Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program; US Department of Energy [DE-AC05-00OR22725],Oak Ridge National Laboratory's (ORNL) Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program; US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"The lead author's contributions to this research were sponsored through Oak Ridge National Laboratory's (ORNL) Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program.

This study used the AquaCrop model to evaluate climate change impacts on the wheat yield, crop water use and water footprint of wheat production in the Middle-Manyame sub-catchment of Zimbabwe. Climate scenarios were based on simulations from the NCC-NorESM1-M, CCCma-CanESM2 and MOHC-HadGEM2-ES General Climate Models downscaled using three Regional Climate Models (RCA4, RegCM4 and CRCM5) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The results showed that, compared to the baseline climate (1980-2010), yield may increase by 22.60, 29.47 27.80, and 53.85% for the RCP4.5 2040 s, RCP4.5 2080 s, RCP8.5 2040 s and RCP8.5 2080 s scenarios, respectively. Crop water use may decrease by 1.68, 1.25, 3.7 and 6.47%, respectively, under the four scenarios, respectively. Consequently, the blue water footprint may decrease by 19, 23, 24 and 38%, respectively, under the four scenarios. Sensitivity analysis attributed the increase in yields and the decrease in crop water use to the CO2 fertilization effect, which had a dominant effect over high-temperature effects. The results suggest that future wheat yields could be enhanced while crop water use is reduced because of climate change. However, the realization of these benefits requires farmers to adapt to climate change by adopting recommended agronomic practises and farm input rates that are consistent with those used in the modelling approach of this study.","[Govere, Simbarashe] Chinhoyi Univ Technol, Dept Environm Sci & Technol, Private Bag 7724, Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe; [Nyamangara, Justice] Marondera Univ Agr Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Sci & Technol, Private Bag 35, Marondera, Zimbabwe; [Nyakatawa, E.

We explored the impact of climate change induced sea level rise (SLR) and tropical cyclone (TC) exposure on mental illness symptom prevalence. Methods:: Using three datasets, TC exposure scores were calculated for each subject to determine how exposure affects posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and major depressive disorder (MDD) symptom prevalence. Inundation mapping of various SLR and storm surge (SS) scenarios were performed for the susceptible region of Miami-Dade and Broward counties to determine the population impact of flooding. Results:: We found an elevated risk of mental illness symptoms from exposure to more high- intensity TCs and identified demographic variables that may contribute to this risk. Furthermore, inundation mapping demonstrated severe and widespread impact of SLR and SS on the mental health of communities. Limitations:: This study did not include data directly measuring comorbidity, resilience, preparedness, or ability to adapt to climate change. Also, multiple imputation using chained equations may have been imperfect. Furthermore, there is uncertainty in predicting and mapping SLR and TC intensity, which limits complete confidence in our SS predictions. Conclusion:: The impacts of climate change have been frequently studied in terms of physical health, natural disaster prevalence, and economic impacts, but rarely on mental health burden. However, it is vital that national, state, and local governments develop and deploy plans to address mental health needs along with expenditures for protecting infrastructure, the economy, and physical health from the combined effects of SLR and climate change-induced natural disasters.","[Monsour, Molly] Duke Univ, Dept Neurosci, Durham, NC USA; [Morey, Rajendra A.] VA Midatlant Mental Hlth Educ & Clin Ctr, Durham, NC USA; [Clarke-Rubright, Emily; Morey, Rajendra A.] Duke Univ, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med, Durham, NC USA; [Lieberman-Cribbin, Wil; Taioli, Emanuela] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Inst Translat Epidemiol, New York, NY USA; [Timmins, Christopher] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Schwartz, Rebecca M.; Corley, Samantha S.] Zucker Sch Med Hofstra Northwell, Dept Occupat Med Epidemiol & Prevent, Great Neck, NY USA; [Laucis, Anna M.] Univ Michigan, Dept Radiat Oncol, Rogel Comprehens Canc Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Duke University; Duke University; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Duke University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Monsour, M (corresponding author), Duke Univ, 1905 5 Holly Ln, Tampa, FL 33629 USA.",mollymonsour@icloud.com,,"Brown, Anna/0000-0001-9123-5451",Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [U01-TP000573-01],Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA),This work was supported by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (grant number U01-TP000573-01).,,82,0,0,11,28,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0165-0327,1573-2517,,J AFFECT DISORDERS,J.

However, some difficulties exist in operating such a system, due to its intrinsic multi-period, multi-factor and multi-layer features. In addition, the fluctuation in weather elements under climate change exacerbates the inaccuracy of energy demand prediction and facilities' power output calculation, leading to imbalanced energy supply and demand. To tackle this issue, a dynamic interactive model combining userdemand prediction, energy-provision calculation and operational collaborative optimization was developed. It attempts to combine the regional climate simulation (PRECIS), demand prediction (TRNSYS), equipment output calculation (mechanism modeling) and collaborative optimization (LINGO) into a general framework. The specific operation processes include: (i) utilize PRECIS model to identify the variations in temperature and radiation under climate change; (ii) exploit TRNSYS software to predict the users' demand of targeted hospital in the future; (iii) establish a mechanism simulation model for gas turbine and estimate power output under extreme meteorological condition; (iv) incorporate the results generated by processes (ii) and (iii) into formulated operation optimization model of CCHP system; (v) generate optimal energy provision scheme adapted to climate change. This dynamic interactive model comprehensively considers the interactions at all aspects involved into operation management of CCHP system and improves the economy and adaptability of operation pattern. This study mainly addressed the problem background and model formulation.

This percentage is expected to increase due to the global warming effect. This work deals with the cooling energy use reduction strategies for residential buildings compatible with the Egyptian market accounting for the global warming effects. A study in the Egyptian market was done to explore the best available technologies in the Egyptian market. A series of dynamic simulations were executed in each city to optimize the building envelope using the best available technologies to reduce the cooling needs. Financial, energetic and environmental factors were taken into consideration, and comparative analysis was done to assess the best alternatives. The double wall with air gap and insulation on the outside was found to be the best alternative in all the cities. Moreover, simple measures to further reduce the cooling energy need were explored, such as the usage of more efficient lighting and night ventilation. This work led to an average reduction of 40% in the cooling energy needs and CO2 emissions across the three cities, with a maximum discounted payback period down to 6.3 years. Future weather files adapted to climate change were generated, and the selected passive strategies were tested to assess the validity of such strategies in the future. The cooling energy needs are expected to increase by 39%, while the peak cooling loads are also expected to increase by 23% by 2080, rendering the current installed HVAC systems undersized.","[Abdollah, Mohammad Abdollah Fadel; Scoccia, Rossano; Filippini, Giulia; Motta, Mario] Politecn Milan, Dept Energy, Via R Lambruschini 4, I-20156 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Scoccia, R (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Energy, Via R Lambruschini 4, I-20156 Milan, Italy.",mohammadabdollah.abdollah@polimi.it; rossano.scoccia@polimi.it; giulia.filippini@polimi.it; mario.motta@polimi.it,"Motta, Mario/AAX-9417-2021; Motta, Mario/S-3135-2016","Motta, Mario/0000-0002-7203-4213; Motta, Mario/0000-0002-7203-4213; Scoccia, Rossano/0000-0002-5894-7198; Abdollah, Mohammad Abdollah Fadel/0000-0001-7753-5124",United Nations Environment Programme [DTIE17-EN006],United Nations Environment Programme,"This research was funded by United Nations Environment Programme, grant number DTIE17-EN006.",,19,1,1,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,MAR,2021,9,3,,,,,,,45,10.3390/cli9030045,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli9030045,,,21,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,RD4UT,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000633475800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The climate crisis requires swift action that starts with public awareness of climate-related health impacts and leads to public support for individual, community and systemic actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Intervention This paper discusses learnings about public opinion research and communication strategies and how a health-focused climate communication campaign-#MakeItBetter-could help to increase awareness and engage new audiences, including public health partners, in conversations about climate change in order to reduce climate-related health impacts for current and future generations. The#MakeItBettercampaign was grounded in evidence-informed messaging, being sensitive to health inequities. Emerging research and pre-campaign testing suggest that framing climate change as a health issue is a promising practice. Outcomes The#MakeItBettercampaign appeals to parents/caregivers to learn more about climate-related health impacts, take protective action for children and support multi-level climate action. The campaign launch secured 89 news stories, including multicultural media coverage. Longer-term evaluation is required to determine the campaign's effectiveness in building public support for climate action. Implications An innovative approach to climate communication that draws on the intersections between behavioural and climate sciences and engages in multi-sectoral collaboration can spur both climate action and health protection, aiding public health practitioners and partners in effectively communicating the urgency for climate action. More work is needed to support communication on climate change as an inequity multiplier and promote climate action and community resilience for health equity co-benefits.","[Sanderson, Melanie; Walsh, Pegeen] Ontario Publ Hlth Assoc, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Doyle, Helen] Ontario Publ Hlth Assoc, Tottenham, ON, Canada",,"Doyle, H (corresponding author), Ontario Publ Hlth Assoc, Tottenham, ON, Canada.",msanderson@opha.on.ca; helenmariedoyle@icloud.com; pwalsh@opha.on.ca,,,Atmospheric Fund; Ivey Foundation; McConnell Foundation through the Clean Economy Fund,Atmospheric Fund; Ivey Foundation; McConnell Foundation through the Clean Economy Fund,"OPHA received funding for the development of the health-focused climate communication strategy from The Atmospheric Fund.

However, mechanisms affecting the amount and composition of labile fractions and their relationship with SOC content at regional scales have not been thoroughly studied. The aim of this study was to examine the spectral features associated with these labile organic matter fractions in samples collected from 75 sites under different soil types, land use and climatic conditions in Chile. Topsoil was analyzed for total C and N content, aggregate stability, and texture. Additionally, the spectral properties of LF material and whole soils were analyzed using diffuse reflectance mid-infrared spectroscopy (MidIR). Our results show that LF shared a similar spectral composition but with different band intensities across climatic regimes. LF spectra were associated with O-alkyl C in cool and rainy areas, whereas a relative accumulation of aromatic structures was found in warmer areas. Whole soils spectra showed that SOC, PDXC and aggregability were related to the prevalence of aliphatic and polysaccharides compounds in colder areas. While in warm arid areas, the stabilization of aliphatic compounds was found to be related to clay minerals. Furthermore, we found that PDXC and SOC content were closely related and changes in PDXC were affected by variations in climate conditions. The understanding of spectral features linked to labile SOC fractions on at larger geographical scale will contribute to the development of sustainable land management options for the prevention of land degradation in the context of adaptation to climate change.","[Ramirez, Paulina B.; Bonilla, Carlos A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ingn Hidraul & Ambiental, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Calderon, Francisco J.] USDA ARS, Cent Great Plains Res Stn, Akron, CO 80720 USA; [Fonte, Steven J.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Santibanez, Fernando] Univ Chile, Dept Ingn & Suelos, Casilla 1004, Santiago, Chile; [Bonilla, Carlos A.] Ctr Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable CONICYT FONDAP, El Comendador 1916, Santiago 7520245, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Colorado State University; Universidad de Chile,"Bonilla, CA (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ingn Hidraul & Ambiental, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",cbonilla@ing.puc.cl,"Bonilla, Carlos A/A-1676-2013; Ramirez, Paulina/HLQ-3083-2023","Fonte, Steven/0000-0002-3727-2304","National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research, CONICYT/FONDECYT [1161045]; CONICYT Doctorado Nacional Scholarship, Government of Chile [21140873]","National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research, CONICYT/FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); CONICYT Doctorado Nacional Scholarship, Government of Chile","This research was supported by funding from the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research, CONICYT/FONDECYT/Regular 1161045.

European Union and Member State adaptation policies and strategies have been promulgated but associated with minimal delivery of adaptation interventions and tangible gains in resilience. Generic stages of adaptation and barriers to adaptation have been identified: various tools or instruments have potential to strengthen adaptation delivery. Scenario analysis is one tool which provides a description of alternate possible future states and has been used to support adaptation planning. This work aims to assess how readily those engaged in coastal management decision-making are able to develop and utilise scenarios of change for adaptation and whether it represents a 'best practice' approach for adaptation planning. The scenario analysis facilitated many aspects of the adaptation process, which ultimately led to a tractable adaptation strategy being produced. However, pathways for integrated approaches to co-deliver adaptation were less evident. The planning horizon, much beyond usual governmental budget and project cycles, the need for trade-offs and embedded institutional constraints meant that a majority of those who had started out on the scenario analysis became disengaged by its conclusion. The analysis undertaken concurs with theoretical work which projects a tail-off of the benefits of scenario analysis at the later stages of the adaptation cycle. The work concludes that scenario analysis offers the potential to overcome key barriers to adaptation progress. However, the gains may be limited as the institutional drivers for longer-term pro-active planning may be weak compared to present day roles, responsibilities and competitive pressures.

Its high protein content and efficient atmospheric nitrogen-fixing ability makes faba bean a vital crop. This study, thus, focused on assessing the importance of faba bean in Ethiopia, specifically at reviewing the status, trend, economic and nutritional values, consumption patterns, environmental importance, and its potential role in the face of climate change. The study was conducted through a critical review of secondary data and published research and analytical reports and presented the findings and implications in Ethiopian context. The analysis revealed that about 4,840,090 tons of faba bean was produced globally on 2,463,966 hectares of land. China (1,803,019 tons), Ethiopia (930,633 tons), Australia (373,605 tons), United Kingdom (302,468 tons) and Germany (188,800 tons) are the top five faba bean producers in 2017. Moreover, the mean yield of faba bean is 1,964.3 kg ha(-1) globally. In Ethiopia, there was an average of 41,473.4 tons faba bean export from 2012 to 2016 and an average of 1,995.52 kg ha(-1) productivity potential from 2013 to 2017. The economic and nutritional values of faba bean can be promoted through the joint initiative between farmers union to train them, and the government should establish integrated crop markets that provide incentives to the farmers to sell their produce by using the linking farmers to markets approach.","[Merga, Bulti] Haramaya Univ, Sch Plant Sci, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia; [Egigu, Meseret Chimdessa; Wakgari, Mulatu] Haramaya Univ, Sch Biol Sci & Biotechnol, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia",Haramaya University; Haramaya University,"Merga, B (corresponding author), Haramaya Univ, Sch Plant Sci, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia.",bultimerga@gmail.com; meseretc2019@yahoo.com; mulatuwakgari@yahoo.com,,"Merga, Bulti/0000-0002-4362-3035",,,,,36,9,9,2,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1932,,,COGENT FOOD AGR,Cogent Food Agr.,NOV 14,2019,5,1,,,,,,,1683938,10.1080/23311932.2019.1683938,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2019.1683938,,,12,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,JS0TB,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000500026200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the ability of natural and human systems to successfully adapt to climatic changes depends on both the magnitude and rate of change, the latter of which will depend on how quickly a given level of cumulative emissions occurs. We show that cumulative CO2 emissions of 4620 GtCO(2) (reached in 2100 in RCP4.5 and 2057 in RCP8.5) produce globally averaged warming rates that are nearly twice as fast in RCP8.5 than RCP4.5 (0.34 +/- 0.08 degrees C per decade versus 0.19 +/- 0.05 degrees C per decade, respectively). Similarly, the globally averaged velocity of climate change calculated according to the 'nearest equivalent climate' is greater by a factor of similar to 2 in RCP8.5 than in RCP4.5 (2.51 +/- 0.67 km yr(-1) versus 1.32 +/- 0.39 km yr(-1), respectively), despite equivalent cumulative emissions. These differences in the projected velocity of climate change represent uncertainty for ecosystems that may be unable to adapt to the faster changes. Particularly at risk are boreal forests, of which 48% are projected to experience rates of change beyond their expected adaptive capacity (i.e. >0.3 degrees C per decade) in RCP4.5, compared with 95% in RCP8.5. Thus, the same budget of cumulative carbon emissions may result in critically different impacts on natural and human systems, depending on the amount of time over which that budget is expended.","[LoPresti, Anna; Woodard, Dawn; Randerson, James; Davis, Steven J.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Charland, Allison; Diffenbaugh, Noah S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Charland, Allison; Diffenbaugh, Noah S.] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Stanford University; Stanford University,"LoPresti, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",aloprest@uci.edu,"Davis, Steven/Y-2838-2019; Randerson, James/Y-2550-2019; Davis, Steven J/F-9968-2010; Diffenbaugh, Noah S/I-5920-2014","Davis, Steven/0000-0002-9338-0844; Randerson, James/0000-0001-6559-7387; Davis, Steven J/0000-0002-9338-0844; Diffenbaugh, Noah S/0000-0002-8856-4964; Bagley, Allison/0000-0001-5955-1542",,,,,57,18,18,1,41,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

The main agricultural product in southern Taiwan is rice, the planting of which consumes far more water than other crops. This makes agriculture in Taiwan especially vulnerable to climate change. In this study, we used the generalized watershed loading functions (GWLF) hydrological model to simulate the discharge of the Kaoping River under climate change scenarios A2 and B2 as released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We discussed the potential impact of climate change on water resources based on the results of GWLF simulations carried out using rainfall and temperature data from five general circulation models (GCMs). The simulation results indicate that river discharge in the wet season increases significantly, and decreases in the dry season. The discharge variations from using the various GCMs as inputs fall within the range of -26 to +15 % for the dry season and -10 to +82 % for the wet season. The variation in available water will seriously impact the first period rice farming (the period between the beginning of January and the end of May) in southern Taiwan. Consequently, effective reduction in conveyance loss in the irrigation canal systems and proper fallowing of paddy fields will be the main challenges to Taiwan's agricultural sector for alleviating the impact of climate change. For further decision making, we show the effects of adapting to climate change by various degrees of the following two methods: fallowing paddy fields to various degrees and reducing conveyance loss in irrigation canal systems.","[Chiang, Jie-Lun] Natl Pungtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Soil & Water Conservat, Pingtung, Taiwan; [Liu, Tzu-Ming] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioenvironm Syst Engn, Taipei 10764, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chiang, JL (corresponding author), Natl Pungtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Soil & Water Conservat, Pingtung, Taiwan.",jlchiang@mail.npust.edu.tw,"Chiang, Jie-Lun/F-7267-2011",,"National Science Council of Taiwan [NSC 98-2625-M-020-001, NSC 100-2625-M-020 -002]","National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",The authors are grateful for the financial support (NSC 98-2625-M-020-001 and NSC 100-2625-M-020 -002) of the National Science Council of Taiwan and to the Global Change Research Center in National Taiwan University and Prof. C.

In England and Wales, housing contributes significantly to the emissions and many properties are at risk of flooding. This paper investigates the preparedness of homeowners in England and Wales to make changes to their homes in response to the predicted effects of climate change. A telephone survey of 961 homeowners investigated their interest in purchasing mitigation and adaptation improvements against their concern about climate change, awareness of flood risk and attribution of responsibility for action. Whilst the majority of homes had some energy-saving improvements, few were found to have property-level flood protection. The high levels of awareness about climate change and flooding were coupled with the perception of risks as low. Whilst some respondents accepted personal responsibility for action, most believed that the authorities were responsible for flood protection, and would not pay the costs required to make their home more energy-efficient and better prepared for the eventuality of floods. The results suggest that there is scope for further improvement of energy-saving measures, and that the levels of adoption of flood-protection measures are very low. Multi-faceted strategies, including more effective communication of risks and responsibilities, incentives, and material support for the poorest, will need to be developed to overcome the current reluctance by homeowners to invest in flood-protection measures and further energy conservation solutions in the future.","[Bichard, Erik] Univ Salford, Sch Built Environm, Salford M5 4WT, Lancs, England; [Kazmierczak, Aleksandra] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Salford; University of Manchester,"Bichard, E (corresponding author), Univ Salford, Sch Built Environm, Maxwell Bldg, Salford M5 4WT, Lancs, England.",e.bichard@salford.ac.uk,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Kazmierczak, Aleksandra/0000-0001-6704-1892",Environment Agency,Environment Agency,"This research was carried out as part of the Resilient Homes project funded by the Environment Agency.

In this study we focus on heat-mortality relationships in Toronto, Ontario, between 1980 and 1996 and evaluate the potential effectiveness of the city's interim hot weather-health response plan. Using two heat stress indexes-humidex and apparent temperature-we identified excess mortality associated with hot and humid weather and then estimated excess deaths for hot and cool summers. Mortality rates for all ages and for > 64 years age groups rose with increasing humidex and apparent temperature, with no significant increase for the population < 65 years. Excess mortality occurred as low as the 30-35&DEG;C humidex range, which is below the 40&DEG;C humidex used to issue a heat warning under Toronto's interim hot weather response Plan. During a hot summer (such as 1988 or 1995), 32 excess deaths would be expected, whereas 34 fewer deaths than baseline levels would be expected during a cool summer like 1982 or 1992. Days with high humidex levels occur infrequently in Toronto, and thus exposure is limited under i current climatic conditions. In the event of a warming climate, more days with dangerously high humidex levels are likely to occur, and summer deaths are expected to increase.

However, much less is known about the integrated livelihood and climate vulnerabilities of coastal communities to natural disasters in southwestern Bangladesh. Therefore, this paper proposes a holistic approach to measuring livelihood vulnerability in the southwestern coast of Bangladesh based on primary data from 300 respondents through face-to-face interviews, focus group discussion (FGD), and key informant interviews (KII), and secondary data on rainfall and temperature for the years 2010-2017. This study developed the livelihood vulnerability index (LVI), the climate vulnerability index (CVI), and the LVI-IPCC to estimate climate vulnerability by incorporating 36 indicators of 9 major components under three dimensions. The pragmatic results show that the three coastal unions have different LVI, CVI, and LVI-IPCC values. Still, the households of the Gabura union showed more vulnerability than the rest of the two, with the highest LVI, CVI, and LVI-IPCC values due to their inadequate access to fresh water, limited physical resources, fewest livelihood strategies, the least variety of crops, and worst health conditions. This logical approach may be applied in data-scarce regions to assess vulnerability and evaluate potential policy efficiency for baseline comparison. The study demonstrates that the requirement for focused interventions and context-specific sustainable policies and development approaches should be implemented to lessen the vulnerability of coastal dwellers. These findings have implications for developing and implementing household resilience and climate change adaptation projects by the government, donor organizations, and other pertinent groups in three susceptible unions.","[Tasnuva, Anjum] Khulna Univ Engn & Technol KUET, Inst Disaster Management, Khulna, Bangladesh; [Bari, Quazi Hamidul] Khulna Univ Engn & Technol KUET, Dept Civil Engn, Khulna 9203, Bangladesh; [Islam, Abu Reza Md Towfiqul] Begum Rokeya Univ, Dept Disaster Management, Rangpur 5400, Bangladesh; [Alam, G.

General greening was a major trend (55.59% and 64.33%) during 1982-2002 and 2003-2019, respectively. Browning accounted for a minor trend (2.86% and 2.73%) during 1982-2002 and 2003-2019.

A combined analysis of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and climatic factors using wavelet coherence confirmed that the climatic variables contributed significantly (p < 0.01) to vegetation growth. Vegetation growth strongly responded to temperature with a lag time of 1-5 weeks throughout 1982-2019. Automatic feature engineering (AFE) also revealed that temperature is the most relevant variable for predicting vegetation change. Overall, our analysis suggests that temperature is a critical factor in controlling vegetation growth. The results have substantial implications for identifying ecosystem management measures for climate change adaptation across the TP.","[Bafitlhile, Thabo Michael; Liu, Yuanbo] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Bafitlhile, Thabo Michael] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Liu, YB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.",thabo_bafitlhile@yahoo.com; ybliu@niglas.ac.cn,,,Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program [2019QZKK0202]; Chinese Academy of Sciences and the World Academy of Sciences (CAS-TWAS),Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program; Chinese Academy of Sciences and the World Academy of Sciences (CAS-TWAS),This work was supported by the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (2019QZKK0202) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the World Academy of Sciences (CAS-TWAS) President's PhD.

Understanding the temporal and spatial changes of vegetation in the Amazon Basin and the response of vegetation to climatic factors is essential for global climate change adaptation. However, the respective contributions of precipitation and temperature variability to vege-tation dynamics in the Amazon Basin remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the annual variation of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and the relationship between EVI and hydrothermal conditions in the Amazon Basin from 2000 to 2019. The results indicate that EVI and precipitation have slightly increased in the Amazon Basin over the past 20 years, whereas temperature has significantly increased. Spatially, the EVI shows an increasing trend in most areas and a decreasing trend in some local areas. The spatial heterogeneity of precip-itation is apparent, which is higher in the south and lower in the north. Across the basin, both precipitation and temperature have significant positive effects on the EVI. Seasonally, the positive impact of climatic factors on vegetation growth in the dry season was greater than that in the wet season. Furthermore, the results show that vegetation dynamics are impacted more by precipitation than temperature in regions that receive less than 2000 mm/yr of precipitation, while temperature is the dominant factor where the annual precipitation is over 2000 mm/yr. The research results provide scientific evidence of the effect of climate change on vegetation dynamics and can support local government policy making for the protection of vegetation in the Amazon Basin.","[Zhong, Rui; Wang, Pengfei; Mao, Ganquan; Chen, Aifang; Liu, Junguo] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, 1088 Xueyuan Rd, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Southern University of Science & Technology,"Liu, JG (corresponding author), Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, 1088 Xueyuan Rd, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",junguo.liu@gmail.cm,"Chen, Aifang/AET-2075-2022; Chen, Aifang/AAG-6613-2019; Liu, Junguo/B-3021-2012","Chen, Aifang/0000-0002-3237-3122; Liu, Junguo/0000-0002-5745-6311; Zhong, Rui/0000-0002-2844-2893","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0603704]; National Natural Science Foun-dation of China [41625001]; High-level Special Funding of the Southern University of Science and Technology [G02296302, G02296402]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foun-dation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); High-level Special Funding of the Southern University of Science and Technology,"This study was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (grant number 2017YFA0603704) , the National Natural Science Foun-dation of China (grant number 41625001) , and the High-level Special Funding of the Southern University of Science and Technology [Grant no.

The present study reviews observed and modelled changes in the climate, cryosphere and impacts related to hazards, agriculture and ecosystems. An increasing temperature trend over the IHR is reported, which over a few locations is found to be higher than the global average. For precipitation, a complex and inconsistent response with considerable variation in the sign and magnitude of change is observed. Future projections show significant warming. Climate-driven changes and impacts are clearly observed. Snow cover has declined since the 1960s, with an enhanced decreasing trend during the 1990s and variable trends since 2000. Glaciers are losing mass and retreating at varying rates since the early 20th century, with an exception over the Karakoram region. An observed heterogeneous response of glaciers to atmospheric warming is controlled by regional variations in topography, debris cover, circulation and precipitation. Initial assessments of permafrost extent of 1 million km(2) across the IHR roughly translate into 14 times the glacier area. Extreme floods represent the most frequent natural disaster in the IHR. Studies have highlighted the significant threat from glacial lakes. Landslides occur in combination with heavy rainfall and flooding, with poor land- use practices such as road-cutting and deforestation being additional drivers. Climate change has also stressed traditional subsistence agriculture and food systems. Improving systematic and coordinated monitoring of climate and related impacts is crucial to contribute to effective climate change adaptation and response strategies.yy","[Dimri, A.

Co-production of actionable climate information between scientists and users has been advocated to increase its use in climate change adaptation. Consequently, Weather and Climate Services (WCS) co-production models have been expanding, but there have been few evaluations of their effects. Those that exist mostly focus on the end user. The empirical contribution of this paper is an evidence-based evaluation of the scaling of WCS based on co-production models in Senegal. The methodological contribution is a systemic and iterative evaluation method involving multiple analytical tools. The scaling of WCS in Senegal involved at least 161 actors and resulted in five axes of transformation: 1) continuous improvement of WCS, 2) emergence and consolidation of WCS facilitators, 3) inclusion of WCS in action planning, 4) active mobilisation to sustain WCS scaling, and 5) empowerment of actors. New users and uses emerged beyond agriculture, involving the fisheries, water and energy sectors, producing changes in institutional communication strategies, operational planning, and in coordination between actors. Enabling factors for scaling included capacity strengthening, knowledge-sharing and action platforms, interaction opportunities, and financial and political support. However, reduced precision of forecasts over time is perceived. New challenges are emerging including improving delivery and finer grain information, getting the private sector involved, and building capacity and trust at a large scale, to keep pace with the increase in uses and users","[Blundo-Canto, Genowefa; Adam, Nawalyath Soule] CIRAD, UMR Innovat, 73 Ave Jean Francois Breton, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Blundo-Canto, Genowefa; Andrieu, Nadine; Adam, Nawalyath Soule] Univ Montpellier, F-34090 Montpellier, France; [Andrieu, Nadine] CIRAD, UMR Innovat, Int Ctr Trop Agr, Decis & Policy Anal Res Area, Cali, Colombia; [Ndiaye, Ousmane] Agence Natl Aviat Civile & Meteorol ANACIM, Dakar, Senegal; [Chiputwa, Brian] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Nairobi, Kenya",CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; CIRAD; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF),"Blundo-Canto, G (corresponding author), CIRAD, UMR Innovat, 73 Ave Jean Francois Breton, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",genowefa.blundo_canto@cirad.fr,,,"CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR Trust Fund","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); CGIAR Trust Fund(CGIAR)","This work was funded under the 2018 call for ex-post impact assessment (ep-IA) of climate change related work in the CGIAR.

The analysis of the future extreme events was conducted using data output of four ensemble models for two IPCC emission scenarios, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. A bias correction method, the quantile-quantile (Q-Q) transformation technique, was applied to all the modelled temperature and rainfall data set prior to the index calculation. The results of analysis of the present-day climate indicate warming and wetting of the BVRB. Increasing trends were seen in the extreme warm indices while the extreme cold indices showed mostly decreasing trends. Majority of the trends observed in the indices were statistically significant (95% confidence level). The extremes in rainfall also showed increasing trends in amounts and intensity of rainfall events (majority of increasing trends were statistically insignificant). Projected temperatures for the late twenty-first century showed decreasing and increasing trends in the cold and warm indices respectively, suggesting warming during the period. Trend analysis of future rainfall projections mostly showed a mix of positive and negative trends offering no clear indication of the direction of change in majority of the extreme rainfall indices. An increase in extremely wet day events is however projected for the period. The results from this study could inform climate change adaptation strategies targeted at reducing vulnerability and building resilience to extreme weather events in the BVRB.","[Aziz, Fati] Univ Abomey Calavi, Lab Hydrol Appl, Abomey Calavi, Benin; [Obuobie, Emmanuel] CSIR, Water Res Inst, Accra, Ghana; [Sylla, Mouhamadou Bamba] WASCAL Competence Ctr, West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapt, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Jeong, Jaehak] Texas A&M AgriLife Res, Blackland Res & Extens Ctr, Temple, TX USA; [Daggupati, Prasad] Univ Guelph, Sch Engn, Guelph, ON, Canada",University of Abomey Calavi; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M AgriLife Research; University of Guelph,"Aziz, F (corresponding author), Univ Abomey Calavi, Lab Hydrol Appl, Abomey Calavi, Benin.",fatiaziz17@gmail.com,"Sylla, Mouhamadou Bamba/HJI-6023-2023; Jeong, Jaehak/AAQ-6940-2021","Sylla, Mouhamadou Bamba/0000-0002-5566-0538; ",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL),German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The authors would like to thank the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) for providing the funds for this research through the West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL; www.wascal.org).

In this respect, both the composition and spatial patterns of anthropogenic land use play an important role in local thermal pattern. The urban environments' climate change adaptation strategy needs adequate knowledge systems urban planners can use to organise and design more resistant and resilient urban spaces. This study examined the relationship between Land Surface Temperature (LST) variations and increasing urbanised areas during the period 2001-2011 in the Po Valley, utilising different urban growth spatial patterns (UGSP). Remotely sensed LST data was obtained from MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) at a resolution of 1 km/pixel for an 11 year-period, from 2001 to 2011, with urbanisation data from the ISTAT map (nominal scale 1:10,000) respectively for the 2001 and 2011 time sections. The relationship between dependent (mean annual daytime, nighttime and daily values) and independent (urbanised areas) variables were investigated through ANOVA test and post-hoc analysis (p < 0.01) for all defined UGSP. Results showed that there is a decreasing LST range (in all conditions) associated with progressive increase of urbanised areas. Furthermore, clustered patterns urban growth have a statistically significant relationship with daytime, nighttime and daily conditions while dispersed pattern urban growth have the same with nighttime only. The outcomes are helpful for understanding the effects of different UGSP, which have significant implications for urban planning, and identifying the critical territorial sectors in need of sustainable mitigation actions.

However, their hydrological balance and possible future changes in river flow remain poorly understood because of high meteorological variability, physical inaccessibility, and the complex interplay between climate, cryosphere, and hydrological processes. Here, we use a state-of-the art glacio-hydrological model informed by data from high-altitude observations and the latest climate change scenarios to quantify the climate change impact on water resources of two contrasting catchments vulnerable to changes in the cryosphere. The two study catchments are located in the Central Andes of Chile and in the Nepalese Himalaya in close vicinity of densely populated areas. Although both sites reveal a strong decrease in glacier area, they show a remarkably different hydrological response to projected climate change. In the Juncal catchment in Chile, runoff is likely to sharply decrease in the future and the runoff seasonality is sensitive to projected climatic changes. In the Langtang catchment in Nepal, future water availability is on the rise for decades to come with limited shifts between seasons. Owing to the high spatiotemporal resolution of the simulations and process complexity included in the modeling, the response times and the mechanisms underlying the variations in glacier area and river flow can be well constrained. The projections indicate that climate change adaptation in Central Chile should focus on dealing with a reduction in water availability, whereas in Nepal preparedness for flood extremes should be the policy priority.","[Ragettli, Silvan] ETH, Inst Environm Engn, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Immerzeel, Walter W.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Phys Geog, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Pellicciotti, Francesca] Northumbria Univ, Dept Geog, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Utrecht University; Northumbria University,"Ragettli, S (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Environm Engn, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",ragettli@ifu.baug.ethz.ch,,"Immerzeel, Walter/0000-0002-2010-9543; Ragettli, Silvan/0000-0001-9817-8541",Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; US Agency for International Development High Mountain Glacier Watershed Programs Climber-Scientist Grant [CCRDCS0010]; Swiss National Science Foundation (Understanding Contrasts in High Mountain Hydrology in Asia project); Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research [CJRP-1003]; European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation Program [676819]; South Asia Research Hub of the UK Department for International Development,Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; US Agency for International Development High Mountain Glacier Watershed Programs Climber-Scientist Grant(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Swiss National Science Foundation (Understanding Contrasts in High Mountain Hydrology in Asia project); Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research; European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation Program; South Asia Research Hub of the UK Department for International Development,"We are grateful to all the people who assisted with the data collection.

The main differences identified, beyond formal divergences in terminology, are linked to: process (stress vs shock), scale (temporal, functional and spatial), assessment approach (statistical vs prospective) and levels of uncertainty. We argue that the underlying source of divergence is the initial difference of purpose, one being identification of climate change adaptation pathways, the other being disaster risk reduction. In this context, the notion of vulnerability and its expression through assessment studies is the focal point connecting both domains. Indeed, the ongoing and active development of vulnerability concepts and methods have already produced some tools to help overcome common issues, such as acting in a context of high uncertainties, taking into account the dynamics and spatial scale of a social-ecological system, or gathering viewpoints from different sciences to combine human and impact-based approaches. Based on this assessment, this paper proposes concrete perspectives and possibilities to benefit from existing commonalities in the construction and application of assessment tools.","[Romieu, E.; Vinchon, C.] Bur Rech Geol & Minieres, F-45060 Orleans 2, France; [Welle, T.] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Schneiderbauer, S.] EURAC, Inst Appl Remote Sensing, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Pelling, M.] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London, England",Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM); European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano; University of London; King's College London,"Romieu, E (corresponding author), Bur Rech Geol & Minieres, 3 Av C Guillemin, F-45060 Orleans 2, France.",eromieu@gmail.com; welle@ehs.unu.edu; stefan.schneiderbauer@eurac.edu; mark.pelling@kcl.ac.uk; c.vinchon@brgm.fr,"Schneiderbauer, Stefan/E-8662-2017","Schneiderbauer, Stefan/0000-0001-7587-849X; Pelling, Mark/0000-0002-6472-9875","FP7 research project; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0937777] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","FP7 research project; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This paper has been made possible by the FP7 research project MOVE (methods for the improvement of vulnerability assessment in Europe), which brings together scientists from different disciplines and domains.

It also reviews the mitigation and adaptations undertaken, and future strategies to manage the impacts of regional climate change. Methodology: The review encompasses historical climate data comprising mean daily temperature, precipitation, mean sea level and occurrences of extreme weather events. Future climate projections have also been reviewed in addition to scholarly papers and news articles related to impacts, contributors, mitigation and adaptations in relation to climate change. Findings: The review shows that annual mean temperature, occurrences of extreme weather events and mean sea level are rising while rainfall shows variability. Future projections point to continuous rise of temperature and mean sea level till the end of the 21st century, highly variable rainfall and increased frequency of extreme weather events. Climate change impacts particularly on agriculture, forestry, biodiversity, water resources, coastal and marine resources, public health and energy. The energy and waste management sectors are the major contributors to climate change. Mitigation of and adaptations to climate change in Malaysia revolve around policy setting, enactment of laws, formulation and implementation of plans and programmes, as well as global and regional collaborations, particularly for energy, water resources, agriculture and biodiversity. There are apparent shortcomings in continuous improvement and monitoring of the programmes as well as enforcement of the relevant laws. Originality/value: This paper presents a comprehensive review of the major themes of climate change in Malaysia and recommends pertinent ways forward to fill the gaps of mitigation and adaptations already implemented.

The challenge then lies in sustaining cooperative mitigation against the temptation to free-ride on others' contributions, which can undermine public endeavours. When all possible future scenarios entail costs, however, the rationale for contributing to a public good changes from altruistic sacrifice of personal profit to necessary investment in minimizing personal debt. Here we demonstrate analytically how an economic framework of costly adaptation to climate change can sustain cooperative mitigation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We develop game-theoretic scenarios from existing examples of insurance for adaptation to natural hazards exacerbated by climate-change that bring the debt burden from future climate events into the present. We model the as-yet untried potential for leveraging public contributions to mitigation from personal costs of adaptation insurance, by discounting the insurance premium in proportion to progress towards a mitigation target We show that collective mitigation targets are feasible for individuals as well as nations, provided that the premium for adaptation insurance in the event of no mitigation is at least four times larger than the mitigation target per player. This prediction is robust to players having unequal vulnerabilities, wealth, and abilities to pay. We enumerate the effects of these inequalities on payoffs to players under various sub-optimal conditions. We conclude that progress in mitigation is hindered by its current association with a social dilemma, which disappears upon confronting the bleak consequences of inaction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Use of systematic review for evidence in this field is complicated by the heterogeneity of methods used and by uneven reporting. In order to facilitate synthesis of results and design of subsequent research a method, construct-centered methods aggregation, was designed to 1) provide a transparent, valid and reliable description of research methods, 2) support comparability of primary studies and 3) contribute to a shared empirical basis for improving research practice. Rather than taking research reports at face value, research designs are reviewed through inductive analysis. This involves bottom-up identification of constructs, definitions and operationalizations; assessment of concepts' commensurability through comparison of definitions; identification of theoretical frameworks through patterns of construct use; and integration of transparently reported and valid operationalizations into ideal-type research frameworks. Through the integration of reliable bottom-up inductive coding from operationalizations and top-down coding driven from stated theory with expert interpretation, construct-centered methods aggregation enabled both resolution of heterogeneity within identically named constructs and merging of differently labeled but identical constructs. These two processes allowed transparent, rigorous and contextually sensitive synthesis of the research presented in an uneven set of reports undertaken in a heterogenous field. If adopted more broadly, construct-centered methods aggregation may contribute to the emergence of a valid, empirically-grounded description of methods used in primary research. These descriptions may function as a set of expectations that improves the transparency of reporting and as an evolving comprehensive framework that supports both interpretation of existing and design of future research.","[Delaney, Aogan; Tamas, Peter A.] Wageningen Univ, Res Methodol Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Crane, Todd A.] Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi, Kenya; [Chesterman, Sabrina] Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England",Wageningen University & Research; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Tamas, PA (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Res Methodol Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands.",peter.tamas@vvur.nl,,"Tamas, Peter/0000-0002-5409-1273; Delaney, Aogan/0000-0003-1692-5174",International Livestock Research Institute; International Livestock Research Center,International Livestock Research Institute(CGIAR); International Livestock Research Center,"This work was support by International Livestock Research Institute (Grant Number: none, https://www.ilri.org/, Recipient: Peter Tamas, Wageningen University).

The negative effects of this on rural populations in India may include crop and livestock loss, livelihood risk, health and sanitation disruptions and shelter risk. Overseas Development Assistance, in the form of aid, will help rural communities to counter these impacts; several development agencies already require that the adaptation to climate change risks be included as project activities in the aid programme. However, it is often difficult to accurately target development aid in developing countries due to uneven and cluster-like development of areas. To help counter this problem, we developed a poverty index intended to help prioritize development aid towards communities at risk, in order of need. The district-wise poverty index was created for seven states of northeast India, a region with highly uneven development, and has been developed from data available from the North-East Data Bank (DoNER). The indicators were selected to adequately represent the poverty of the people as well as to act as a prioritizing mechanism in a data scarce region. The inclusion of a Gini coefficient of land distribution is new to poverty indexes, and helps to capture the pattern of highly unequal land distribution in northeast India, which in turn affects the distribution of income. Although primarily developed for northeast India, the index can be used in other developing countries with imbalances in regional development. If the biophysical factors affecting vulnerability are known, this index can be used in a weighted combination with vulnerability.","[Nair, Malini; Ravindranath, N.

Efficient health surveillance systems are required to support adaptation to climate change. However, despite a growing awareness, the public health surveillance sector has had very little involvement in the drafting of adaptation plans. This paper proposes a method to raise awareness about climate change in the public health community, to identify possible health risks and to assess the needs for reinforced health surveillance systems. Methods: A working group was set up comprising surveillance experts in the following fields: environmental health; chronic diseases and; infectious diseases. Their goal was to define common objectives, to propose a framework for risk analysis, and to apply it to relevant health risks in France. Results: The framework created helped to organize available information on climate-sensitive health risks, making a distinction between three main determinants as follows: (1) environment; (2) individual and social behaviours; and (3) demography and health status. The process is illustrated using two examples: heatwaves and airborne allergens. Conclusion: Health surveillance systems can be used to trigger early warning systems, to create databases which improve scientific knowledge about the health impacts of climate change, to identify and prioritize needs for intervention and adaptation measures, and to evaluate these measures. Adaptation requires public health professionals to consider climate change as a concrete input parameter in their studies and to create partnerships with professionals from other disciplines.

These changes are having implications for the Arctic's Inuit population and are being exacerbated by the dependence of Inuit on biophysical resources for livelihoods and the low socio-economic-health status of many northern communities. Given the nature of current climate change and projections of a rapidly warming Arctic, climate policy assumes a particular importance for Inuit regions. This paper argues that efforts to stabilize and reduce greenhouse gas emissions are urgent if we are to avoid runaway climate change in the Arctic, but unlikely to prevent changes which will be dangerous for Inuit. In this context, a new policy discourse on climate change is required for Arctic regions-one that focuses on adaptation. The paper demonstrates that states with Inuit populations and the international community in general has obligations to assist Inuit to adapt to climate change through international human rights and climate change treaties. However, the adaptation deficit, in terms of what we know and what we need to know to facilitate successful adaptation, is particularly large in an Arctic context and limiting the ability to develop response options. Moreover, adaptation as an option of response to climate change is still marginal in policy negotiations and Inuit political actors have been slow to argue the need for adaptation assistance. A new focus on adaptation in both policy negotiations and scientific research is needed to enhance Inuit resilience and reduce vulnerability in a rapidly changing climate.","McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada",McGill University,"Ford, JD (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Geog, 805 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",james.ford@mcgill.ca,"Ford, James/A-4284-2013","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456",International Polar Year CAVIAR,International Polar Year CAVIAR,"This research was supported by the International Polar Year CAVIAR project, ArcticNet, and the Nasivvik Centre for Inuit Health and Changing Environments.

Many areas of our coasts are already under threat from coastal hazards such as erosion and inundation. Future climate change is expected to have a range of repercussions. A combination of these changes and the current or increased development along our favourite coastlines will require an integrated view of the pressures and impacts in the coastal zone. However, how prepared are we to face these impacts of climate change where populations are growing and economic interests are expanding. To what extent do policy makers and planners understand potential changes and are prepared to act to reduce vulnerabilities, and how do we as scientists educate them on the changes in light of scientific uncertainty. In reviewing the present capacity to adapt to climate change on the Australian coast, it is apparent that there are gaps and uncertainties in current institutional arrangements, policy and government initiatives. Accordingly, the challenge is to work together to identify gaps in our management strategies and provide the necessary advice that links research, management, development, planning and economics.

It is essential to understand how montane communities currently depend especially on the provisioning ecosystem services (ES) and the ways in which climate change will impact these services, so that people can develop relevant adaptation strategies. The ES in the Gurez Valley, in the Western Himalayas of Pakistan, provide a unique opportunity to explore these questions. This understudied area is increasingly exposed not only to climate change but also to the over exploitation of resources. Hence, this study aimed to (a) identify and value provisioning ES in the region; (b) delineate indigenous communities' reliance on ES based on valuation; and (c) measure the perceptions of indigenous communities of the impact of climate change on the ES in Gurez Valley. Semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions were used to classify the provisioning ES by using the 'Common International Classification on Ecosystem Services' (CICES) table and applying the 'Total Economic Valuation (TEV)' Framework. Results indicate that the indigenous communities are highly dependent on ES, worth 6730 & PLUSMN; 520 USD/ Household (HH)/yr, and perceive climate change as a looming threat to water, crops, and rearing livestock ESS in the Gurez Valley.

Identifying the distribution of SESs is crucial for integrating and formulating effective programs and policies to ensure human well-being while protecting and conserving natural systems. This work aims to identify and spatially map the boundaries of SESs to address the questions of how SESs can be delineated and what the characteristics of these systems are. The study was carried out for the state of Uttarakhand, India, a part of the Central Himalaya. The presented approach for mapping and delineation of SESs merges socio-economic and ecological data. It also includes validation of delineated system boundaries. We used 32 variables to form socio-economic units and 14 biophysical variables for ecological units. Principal component analysis followed by sequential agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis was used to delineate the units. The geospatial statistical analysis identified 6 socio-economic and 3 ecological units, together resulting in 18 SESs for the entire state. The major characteristics for SESs were identified as forest types and agricultural practices, indicating the influence and dependency of SESs on these two features. The database would facilitate diverse application studies in vulnerability assessment, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and other socio-ecological studies. Such a detailed database addresses particularly site-specific characteristics to reduce risks and impacts. Overall, the identified SESs will help in recognizing local needs and gaps in existing policies and institutional arrangements, and the given methodological framework can be applied for the entire Himalayan region and for other mountain systems across the world.","[Kumar, Praveen; Joshi, P.

We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to simulate future (2050-2070) streamflow and baseflow for four combined climate and land use scenarios across the Yadkin-Pee Dee River watershed and three subwatersheds. The combined scenarios pair land use change and climate change scenarios together. Compared to the baseline, projected streamflow increased in three out of four combined scenarios and decreased in one combined scenario. Baseflow decreased in all combined scenarios, but decreases were largest in subwatersheds that lost the most forest. The effects of land use change and climate change were additive, amplifying the increases in runoff and decreases in baseflow. Streamflow was influenced more strongly by climate change than land use change. However, for baseflow the reverse was true; land use change tended to drive baseflow more than climate change. Land use change was also a stronger driver than climate in the most urban subwatershed. In the most extreme land use and climate projection the volume of the 1-day, 100 year flood nearly doubled at the watershed outlet. Our results underscore the importance of forests as hydrologic regulators buffering streamflow and baseflow from hydrologic extremes. Additionally, our results suggest that land managers and policy makers need to consider the implications of forest loss on streamflow and baseflow when planning for future urbanization and climate change adaptation options.

This paper draws attention to the need for interpretations that foster policies and institutions with the breadth and flexibility to recognize and support a wide range of locally relevant adaptation strategies. Social scientists have argued that, in practice, the standard definition of adaptation tends to prioritize economic over other values and technical over social responses, draw attention away from underlying causes of vulnerability and from the broader context in which adaptive responses take place, and exclude discussions of inequality, justice, and transformation. In this paper, we discuss an alternate understanding of adaptation, which we label living with climate change, that emerged from an ethnographic study of how rural residents of the U.S. Southwest understand, respond to, and plan for weather and climate in their daily lives, and we consider how it might inform efforts to develop a more comprehensive definition. The discussion brings into focus several underlying features of this lay conception of adaptation, which are crucial for understanding how adaptation actually unfolds on the ground: an ontology based on nature society mutuality; an epistemology based on situated knowledge; practice based on performatively adjusting human activities to a dynamic biophysical and social environment; and a placed-based system of values. We suggest that these features help point the way toward a more comprehensive understanding of climate change adaptation, and one more fully informed by the understanding that we are living in the Anthropocene.

The response of past societies to climatic variability, particularly in terms of water management, can provide useful insights into the timing and scale of response to future events. We present a regional case study from South India to illustrate the influence of climate on shaping the rise and economic prosperity of the Chola Kingdom from 850 to 1280 ce - a period approximately coinciding with the Medieval Climatic Anomaly. An investigation of instrumental and proxy climatic data sets between 500 and 2010 ce indicates that the period between similar to 850 and similar to 1300 CE, a time of frequent El Nino-like conditions, was associated with a substantial increase in North-East Indian monsoon rainfall (NEIMR), whereas South-West Indian monsoon rainfall (SWIMR) suffered substantial deficits. The spatial pattern and chronology of water harvesting infrastructure development under Chola rule indicate that these features were concentrated in the NEIMR-receiving regions of southeastern India and that their construction peaked during El Nino-dominated intervals. Overall, enhanced NEIMR conditions and adaptation strategies practiced in the Chola's territory, combined with less favorable climatic conditions over the neighboring kingdoms, appears to have underpinned the well-documented political and economic strengths of the Chola superpower. We infer that the water management infrastructure promoted by the Chola rulers helped to buffer the consequences of climatic extremes in later history, whether droughts (e.g. the El Nino-related mega-drought of 1876-1878) or floods (because the reservoirs can contain surplus runoff). More recently, however, a preference for groundwater irrigation and other landscape changes driven by population pressure has made the region more vulnerable to the incidence of heavy NEIMR episodes, as illustrated by the severe floods of 2015. Future climate adaptation planning in South India should appreciate the merits of restoring and expanding the currently decaying legacy of Chola-style 'no regrets' water management infrastructures.","[Shanmugasundaram, Jothiganesh; Hessl, Amy E.; Lee, Eungul] West Virginia Univ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Gunnell, Yanni] Univ Lyon Lumiere, Lyon, France",West Virginia University,"Lee, E (corresponding author), West Virginia Univ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.;Lee, E (corresponding author), West Virginia Univ, Dept Geol & Geog, POB 6300, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",Eungul.Lee@mail.wvu.edu,"Lee, Eungul/AAJ-2993-2020","Lee, Eungul/0000-0002-1887-1870; Shanmugasundaram, Jothiganesh/0000-0001-9919-5351",,,,,127,5,5,0,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2053-0196,2053-020X,,ANTHROPOCENE REV,Anthr.

Changes in climate are expected to exacerbate these impacts, particularly through increases and intensification of precipitation events during various times of the year. While decreases in greenhouse gas emissions are ultimately necessary to minimize changes in climate, best management practices (BMPs), such as reforestation, can serve as watershed climate adaptation strategies to mitigate the impacts of changes in air temperature and precipitation. The Meramec River Basin (MRB) in eastern Missouri is of economic and recreational importance and supports high levels of biodiversity. While much of the MRB is forested, various land transformations are increasing sediment inputs throughout the basin, and these contributions are expected to increase as climate changes. To address the potential of riparian reforestation to serve as a climate adaptation strategy in the MRB, we developed a Soil and Water Assessment Tool model to simulate streamflow and sediment transport throughout the basin. We then used model outputs characterizing spatial variation in sediment yields to identify critical source areas (CSAs) at the subbasin level. The application of a riparian buffer BMP was simulated in each CSA to quantify the effectiveness of this strategy in reducing sediment for contemporary conditions (1990-2009) as well as under three future climate scenarios for two time periods, 2040-2059 (mid-century) and 2080-2099 (late-century). For the contemporary period, the simulated addition of a riparian buffer BMP resulted in a projected 12.1% average reduction in surface sediment yield among CSAs. For the mid-century projection, subbasin surface sediment output is projected to increase by an average of 277.5% and 221.8% for the climate change scenario and the climate change + BMP scenario, respectively. In the late-century, respective increases in sediment for CSAs are estimated to be, on average, 690.7% and 528.3% for the climate change scenario and the climate change + BMP scenario. Results suggest that surface sediment yields will increase with climate change even with riparian buffer BMP applications. While adding a riparian buffer can potentially reduce sediment outputs, the reduction, on average, is likely inadequate to fully offset the impacts from changes in climate.","[Wu, Chin-Lung; Knouft, Jason H.] St Louis Univ, Dept Biol, 3507 Laclede Ave, St Louis, MO 63103 USA; [Herrington, Steven J.; Charry, Barbara] Nature Conservancy, POB 440400, St Louis, MO 63144 USA; [Chu, Maria L.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, 1304 W Penn Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Saint Louis University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Wu, CL (corresponding author), St Louis Univ, Dept Biol, 3507 Laclede Ave, St Louis, MO 63103 USA.",chinlung.wu@stu.edu,,"WU, CHIN-LUNG/0000-0003-2222-3398",Nature Conservancy grant [06171601],Nature Conservancy grant,This project was funded by The Nature Conservancy grant (06171601).,,48,6,6,0,26,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Despite these vulnerabilities, we know very little about how WW managers are responding to current climate risks or to future climate change. This study aims to fill this critical gap in the literature. Data from surveys and interviews were used to understand what WW managers are doing to adapt to the current climate, what facilitates those adaptations, and if they are adapting to future climate change. Findings show most WW managers (78%) are making changes to build resiliency to storms they have experienced in the past (e.g., extra fuel on site, extra staff on call, more training, better communication, adding generators, elevating components, adding capacity); most are not adapting to future climate change. Our work suggests organizational leadership, concern about future climate-related impacts, and experiencing storm impacts drive resiliency changes while regulatory requirements drive adaptation to future climate change. Beyond advancing science, our work offers practical suggestions for building WW system resilience and for increasing WW system's consideration of future climate impacts in their resiliency building efforts.","[Kirchhoff, Christine J.; Watson, Peter L.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut,"Kirchhoff, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",christine.kirchhoff@uconn.edu,,"Kirchhoff, Christine/0000-0002-2686-6764",,,,,68,12,12,2,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1093-474X,1752-1688,,J AM WATER RESOUR AS,J.

Then, we input them into the mesoscale WRF-UCM model and simulate after loading the meteorological data to derive the meteorological indicators of each case, quantitatively analyze the meteorological conditions in the ecological patch boundaries with different surface attributes, and conduct research on the quality-efficiency correspondence of the physical characteristics of the ecological patches and the spillover effects of climate regulation. Studies have shown that the highest surface temperature difference between water patches and patches with other attributes Delta Tsk is up to 6.5 degrees C in winter and 11.5 degrees C in summer. The highest temperature difference at a somatosensory height of 2 meters Delta T2 is up to 2.0 degrees C in winter and 3.0 degrees C in summer, which can improve the surrounding environment. Under light wind conditions, water patches will have a positive spillover effect within 5.5 km of the downwind direction. Based on the data, an optimization strategy for the spatial pattern of urban ecological patches is proposed: the best distribution of water patches that are beneficial to the climate adjustment of Wuhan in winter and summer is in the north or northeast of the city, followed by the south or southwest. The north and northeast of the city should keep the woodland patches and reduce the setting of vegetation/arable land and wetland patches. This research is an interdisciplinary study of urban spatial planning that adapts to climate change, to supplement the deficiencies of urban planning theory, and to provide guidance for the promotion of green and ecological city construction.","[Li, Xuesong; Lin, Kai] Hubei Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn Architecture & Environm, Wuhan 430068, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Chen, Hong] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China",Hubei University of Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Li, XS (corresponding author), Hubei Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn Architecture & Environm, Wuhan 430068, Hubei, Peoples R China.",19890028@hbut.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [51778251]; Hubei Meteorological Bureau Science and Technology Development Foundation of China [2018Z10]; 2020 College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Program of China [X202010500115],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hubei Meteorological Bureau Science and Technology Development Foundation of China; 2020 College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Program of China,"This work was supported by projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 51778251), the Hubei Meteorological Bureau Science and Technology Development Foundation of China (Project No. 2018Z10), and the 2020 College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Program of China (Project No. X202010500115).",,19,0,0,5,5,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",1530-8669,1530-8677,,WIREL COMMUN MOB COM,Wirel.

Crop diversification is considered to be an effective mechanism to increase the sustainability of cropping systems and promote their transition to agroecology. To test this hypothesis, farmers, agricultural advisers and scientists developed a participative co-design project. OBJECTIVE: The main objective was to co-design cropping systems to reduce the use of inputs, experiment with them on farms and assess their sustainability over several years. METHODS: Eight diversified cropping systems were designed during multi-actor co-innovation workshops. These systems were established and monitored for eight years (2010-2017) on two fields on each of eight farms located in areas with different soil and climate conditions. At the end of the eight-year study, the performance of these cropping systems was evaluated using 15 economic, environmental and social indicators. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Crop diversification improved most of the environmental indicators. Pesticide use decreased by 20-64% in five of the eight systems but increased in the other three, due to production contracts that required systematic applications or in order to control high levels of pest or weed pressure. In parallel, mean energy consumption (-30%), greenhouse gas emissions (-36%) and irrigation water consumption (-43%) decreased significantly after diversification, which helped the systems mitigate and adapt to climate change. The economic performance, however, was more contrasted, with four of the eight farms showing a decrease in seminet margin of 10-35% compared to those of the initial systems, but the other four showing an increase of 5-190%. Production of food energy also generally decreased (by up to 40%) after diversification, mainly due to a decrease in the amount of cereals produced (especially maize). Thus, crop diversification usually improves the environmental sustainability of cropping systems; however, for certain specialised high-value cropping systems, which often have high environmental impacts, it tends to reduce their economic performances.","[Alletto, Lionel; Debaeke, Philippe] Univ Toulouse, INRAE, UMR AGIR, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Vandewalle, Aline] Chambre regionale Agr Occitanie, F-31321 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Vandewalle, Aline] Chambre Agr Pays Loire, F-49105 Angers, France",INRAE,"Alletto, L (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, INRAE, UMR AGIR, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.",lionel.alletto@inrae.fr,,"Alletto, Lionel/0000-0003-0933-9476","European Union's [727482]; Agence de l'Eau Adour-Garonne [180 2014 655, 10051579]; Occitanie region;  [180 2014 656]",European Union's(European Commission); Agence de l'Eau Adour-Garonne; Occitanie region; ,"This project received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement no. 727482, DiverIMPACTS), the Agence de l'Eau Adour-Garonne (grant agreements no. 180 2014 656 & 180 2014 655) and the Occitanie region (former Midi-Pyrenees region) (grant agreement no. 10051579, MAESTRIA project).

To that end, 28 climate models participating to the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are considered, after a statistical post-correction of their biases. A multi-scale approach is proposed, covering the Sahel, Senegal, and three thermally-coherent zones within Senegal. HWs are defined as a sequence of at least three consecutive days above a moving 95th percentile of current temperature distributions. Climate change over Senegal translates into a general shift of the whole statistical distribution towards higher temperature values, with a general stability in the shape of the distribution. Ongoing mean warming could reach +5 degrees C in 2100 under RCP8.5 scenario, implying that coastal Senegal could experience then a mean climate comparable to the hinterland parts today. HWs have increased in intensity, frequency and duration across Sahel and Senegal over the past years, such intensification being higher on recent decades. Future HWs over all regions present intrinsic properties that radically differ from those observed so far. The severity and length of HWs displayed stationary conditions until the late 1990s, but started increasing since then. Projected changes show marked and rapid increase in these variables, the amplitude of which is primarily RCP-dependent, and secondarily region-dependent. For both metrics, the largest changes occur over hinterland Senegal and Sahel. There, under RCP8.5 and after the 2070s, the whole spring season could be considered as a permanent HW lasting 3 months. Along the coast, by contrast, average temperatures are both weaker and more variable, causing more frequent threshold crossings and limiting the duration of HWs. The multi-scale approach used here highlights contrast within Senegal, which constitutes important information for public policy decision-makers and its inhabitants in terms of adaptation to climate change.","[Sambou, Marie-Jeanne Gnacoussa; Badiane, Daouda; Gaye, Amadou Thierno] Univ Cheikh Anta Diop Dakar, LPAOSF, ESP, Dakar, Senegal; [Pohl, Benjamin; Roucou, Pascal] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, UMR6282 Biogeosci, CRC, Dijon, France; [Sambou, Marie-Jeanne Gnacoussa; Janicot, Serge; Landry Famien, Adjoua Moise] Sorbonne Univ, IRD LOCEAN, UPMC CNRS IRD MNHN, UMR7159, Paris, France; [Landry Famien, Adjoua Moise] Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, LAPAMF UFR SSMT, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire",University Cheikh Anta Diop Dakar; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Bourgogne; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite,"Sambou, MJG (corresponding author), Univ Cheikh Anta Diop Dakar, LPAOSF, ESP, Dakar, Senegal.",marie-jeanne.sambou@locean-ipsl.upmc.fr,"Pohl, Benjamin/L-7696-2017","Pohl, Benjamin/0000-0002-9339-797X; SAMBOU, Marie Jeanne/0000-0003-0790-3627; FAMIEN, Adjoua Moise Landry/0000-0002-4551-7033",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement [ANR-13-SENV-007]; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC/DFID) [NE/M019934/1]; European FP7 IS-ENES2 project [312979]; ANR [ANR-10-LABX-0018]; NERC [NE/M019934/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC/DFID); European FP7 IS-ENES2 project; ANR(French National Research Agency (ANR)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement, Grant/Award Number: ANR-13-SENV-007; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC/DFID), Grant/Award Number: NE/M019934/1; European FP7 IS-ENES2 project, Grant/Award Number: 312979; ANR, Grant/Award Number: ANR-10-LABX-0018",,43,4,4,4,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

The aims of this study were to better understand why grape maturity (defined here as the day of the year the grapes reached 11.5 Be) is advancing, and how different cultivars and regions are responding to the seasonal temperature conditions. Methods and Results Trends in rate of ripening (Be/day or Be/degrees C day) and the day of year veraison (DOYV) were analysed at four Victorian vineyard regions and included 24 cultivars covering 20 years. There was a significant difference between cultivars in their rate of ripening with later ripening cultivars ripening more slowly (Be/day). Higher yield slowed the rate of ripening (Be/day), significantly at two vineyards. No significant temporal trends were observed for the rate of ripening nor for the interval between DOYV and day of year maturity (DOYM), as related to Vintage Year or Springtime Temperature (max), although these may become apparent with a longer series of data and resulting smaller confidence intervals. Different cultivars, however, had a significantly different rate of change for this interval over time, and higher yield was associated with a longer interval length. Day of year veraison advanced significantly as related to Springtime Temperature (max) at all vineyards, and at a significantly different rate for different cultivars at three of the four vineyards. There was a positive association between yield and DOYV. Conclusions These results suggest that the observed advancement of grape maturity can be explained by the advancement of veraison, rather than an increase in the rate of ripening, for these cultivars in these regions. Significance of the Study The study showed that there is existing cultivar diversity which, if better understood, could help better anticipate phenological timing, improve vineyard management and assist in adapting to climate change.","[Cameron, W.; Barlow, E.

The information reported here includes: two drought indices (the Standardised Precipitation Index, SPI, and the Standardised Soil Moisture Index, SSMI); four drought metrics (percent time spent in droughts, mean drought duration, mean drought frequency, and mean drought intensity); and two drought categories (drought and extreme drought). The projections are developed from CMIP5 global climate model simulations of rainfall and soil moisture for the historical (1900-2005) and future (2006-2100) climates. The multi-model results project significant increases in all the drought hazard metrics, except frequency, with larger changes in the SSMI compared to SPI. The more severe drought hazard under climate change is apparent over a larger area than previously indicated, particularly in southern and eastern Australia. Although the majority of modelling results indicate more severe drought conditions, the range in the results is large, mainly because of the uncertainty in the global climate model rainfall projections. A projected decrease in rainfall results in a projected increase in drought severity (which is further enhanced by the increase in potential evapotranspiration), and a projected increase in rainfall results in a projected decrease in drought severity (moderated by the increase in potential evapotranspiration). The assessment of the ability of models to reproduce historical observations does not show clusters of models that best simulate all the different drought metrics. Unlike previously assumed, the results show that the models that best reproduce the observed rainfall are not necessarily best in simulating the drought metrics. For this reason, all the models are used here to estimate the multi-model median and range of results. The large uncertainty in the projections can be confusing to end users and present challenges in adapting to climate change. The presentation and communication of projections here will also go some way towards overcoming this challenge.","[Kirono, Dewi G.

An attempt has been made to track the vulnerability in wheat producing regions for climate smart farming in India sourcing relevant historical data on multi-dimensional indicators for sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity. The composite vulnerability index has been estimated for 16 wheat growing states using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) approach. First, the variables were normalised to make them unit free for comparison and second, weights were assigned to each variable across three dimensions (sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity) using the principal component analysis. Later, the regions were categorised into three groups based on the magnitude of the index viz., high, moderate, and less. Jharkhand registered the highest sensitivity (0.61) while Punjab registered the lowest (0.18). Considering the exposure of regions to various climatic and weather variables in the wheat growing season (Rabi: November-April), it was found that Jharkhand had the highest exposure (0.48) and Punjab witnessed the lowest (0.30). In terms of adaptation to climate change, it was found that Maharashtra (0.63) had the highest adaptive capacity, followed by Haryana and Punjab. On the contrary, Jharkhand had the lowest adaptive capacity (0.21). Overall, the analysis of cross-sectional and multi-dimensional data indicated that Jharkhand is the most vulnerable region and Punjab is the least vulnerable region across wheat producing ecologies. Vulnerability mapping indicated that the magnitude of vulnerability is high in five regions (contributing 19% of total production), moderate in six regions (12% production) and low in five wheat growing regions (69% production). Regional prioritization has to be made in lieu of deviation in area and yield to minimize production losses. Further, adaptive measures and climate smart farming need to be practiced at farm and regional levels by formulating suitable policies and investment plans..","[Sendhil, R.] ICAR Indian Inst Wheat & Barley Res, Agr Econ, Social Sci, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India; [Jha, Ankita] ICAR Indian Inst Wheat & Barley Res, Resource Management, Agr Meteorol, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India; [Kumar, Anuj; Singh, Satyavir] ICAR Indian Inst Wheat & Barley Res, Agr Extens, Social Sci, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India",Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Institute of Wheat & Barley Research; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Institute of Wheat & Barley Research; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Institute of Wheat & Barley Research,"Sendhil, R (corresponding author), ICAR Indian Inst Wheat & Barley Res, Agr Econ, Social Sci, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India.",r.sendhil@icar.gov.in,"Ramadas, Sendhil/AAH-7051-2019; Ramadas, Sendhil/AFR-7057-2022; R, Sendhil/AAN-5951-2020","Ramadas, Sendhil/0000-0002-5336-6415; Ramadas, Sendhil/0000-0002-5336-6415; R, Sendhil/0000-0002-5336-6415","ICAR-Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research, Kamal [CRSCIIWBRSIL201503400178]","ICAR-Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research, Kamal","The authors duly thank for the support and infrastructure facilities rendered by the Director, ICAR-Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research, Kamal for carrying out the research (Project Code: CRSCIIWBRSIL201503400178].",,51,23,23,1,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

J,"Torres, JM; Casey, JA",,,,"Torres, Jacqueline M.; Casey, Joan A.",,,The centrality of social ties to climate migration and mental health,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,Human migration; Climate change; Mental health; Social support; Social ties; Environmental justice,UNITED-STATES; DISASTER; ADAPTATION; DEPRESSION; DISORDERS; PREPAREDNESS; RESILIENCE; COHESION; SUPPORT; STRESS,"Climate change-related hazards and disasters, known to adversely impact physical and mental health outcomes, are also expected to result in human migration above current levels. Environmentally-motivated migration and displacement may lead to the disruption of existing social ties, with potentially adverse consequences for mobile populations as well as their family members who remain in places of origin. We propose that the disruption of social ties is a key mechanism by which climate-related migration may negatively impact mental health, in particular. Existing social ties may provide social and material resources that buffer mental health stressors related to both prolonged and acute climate events. Preparation for such events may also strengthen these same ties and protect mental health. Communities may leverage social ties, first to mitigate climate change, and second, to adapt and rebuild post-disaster in communities of origin. Additionally, social ties can inform migration decisions and destinations. For example, scholars have found that the drought-motivated adaptive migration of West African Fulbe herders only occurred because of the long-term development of social networks between migrants and non-migrants through trade and seasonal grazing. On the other hand, social ties do not always benefit mental health. Some migrants, including those from poor regions or communities with no formal safety net, may face considerable burden to provide financial and emotional resources to family members who remain in countries of origin. In destination communities, migrants often face significant social marginalization. Therefore, policies and programs that aim to maintain ongoing social ties among migrants and their family and community members may be critically important in efforts to enhance population resilience and adaptation to climate change and to improve mental health outcomes. Several online platforms, like Refugee Start Force, serve to integrate refugees by connecting migrants directly to people and services in destination communities. These efforts may increasingly draw upon novel technologies to support and maintain social networks in the context of population mobility due to climatic and other factors.","[Torres, Jacqueline M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Robert Wood Johnson Fdn, Hlth & Soc Scholars Program, 3333 Calif St,Suite 465, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Torres, Jacqueline M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Hlth & Community, 3333 Calif St,Suite 465, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Casey, Joan A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Robert Wood Johnson Fdn, Hlth & Soc Scholars Program, Mulford Hall,130 Hilgard Way, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Casey, Joan A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Mulford Hall,130 Hilgard Way, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF); University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF); University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Torres, JM (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Robert Wood Johnson Fdn, Hlth & Soc Scholars Program, 3333 Calif St,Suite 465, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA.;Torres, JM (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Hlth & Community, 3333 Calif St,Suite 465, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA.",Jacqueline.Torres@ucsf.edu,"Casey, Joan/H-6405-2019","Casey, Joan/0000-0002-9809-4695",Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health & Society Scholars program; Berkeley Research Impact Initiative (BRII); UC Berkeley Library,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health & Society Scholars program(Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)); Berkeley Research Impact Initiative (BRII); UC Berkeley Library,At the time of writing this manuscript the authors were supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health & Society Scholars program.

Green infrastructure (GI) is an effective and popularly strategy used to moderate UHIs. This paper aims to better understand the progress of different GI types (urban parks, urban forests, street trees, green roofs, green walls) in mitigating UHIs, and what benefits they provide. Firstly, this paper used CiteSpace to analyze 1243 publications on the Web of Science from 1990 to 2021, then analyzed the function/regulation of ecosystem services/benefits and values of GI types in reducing UHIs. The historical review results show that research on all GI types showed rapid growth since 2013, and their GR increased rapidly. The highest-ranking keywords were urban heat island/heat island, climate/climate change/microclimate, and temperature/land surface temperature/air temperature. Design, vegetation, quality, and reduction are the top four strongest keyword bursts. The most published countries are the People's Republic of China, USA, Australia, Germany, and Italy, and the top three institutions are the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Arizona State University, and the National University of Singapore. Landscape and Urban Planning, Building and Environment, Energy and Building, and Urban Forestry and Urban Greening are the most published journals. In urban areas, different GI types as a form of ecosystem hardware provide multiple functions (reduced land surface temperatures, lower building energy usage, improved thermal comfort and enhanced human health, reduced morbidity and mortality, etc.). GI thus provides a regulated ecosystem service to ameliorate UHIs primarily through temperature regulation and shade. At the same time, GI provides benefits and values (ecological, economic, social, and cultural) to humans and urban sustainable development. GI types determine the functions they provide, afford corresponding regulated ecosystem services, and provide benefits and values in a logical/recycle system. Overall, this review highlights the development and importance of GI, as well as the relationship of GI types and functions of regulating the ecosystem service benefits and values to mitigate UHI, and advances the study of climate change adaptation in cities.","[Shao, Huamei; Kim, Gunwoo] Hanyang Univ, Grad Sch Urban Studies, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 04763, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Kim, G (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Grad Sch Urban Studies, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 04763, South Korea.",gwkim1@hanyang.ac.kr,,"Kim, Gunwoo/0000-0001-6862-4061",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MIST) [NRF2022R1F1A107516111],National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MIST)(National Research Foundation of Korea),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MIST) (No. NRF2022R1F1A107516111).,,69,2,2,55,55,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,OCT,2022,11,10,,,,,,,1792,10.3390/land11101792,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11101792,,,22,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,5S6HZ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000875289800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study employs comprehensive data obtained in 2018 from 4351 farm households in five countries to appraise the key climate hazards experienced by farmers, the risk coping methods adopted, and factor influencing the use of these methods. Although droughts, floods, hailstorms, and crop pests/diseases are major climate-induced risks in ESA. droughts are predominant in all these countries. Farm households in ESA have adopted various strategies to address climate risk, which includes changing farming practices, reducing consumption, using savings and borrowing, and seeking new employment. Farming families headed by a female, married, or an elderly member opt to change farming methods and decrease consumption, whereas they are less inclined to look for alternate livelihood options. Farming families with higher livestock endowments commonly use savings or borrow and are unlikely to change farming methods, decrease consumption, and search for alternate employment. Better-off families tend to change farming methods but are unlikely to adopt other risk coping options. Farming families with non-farm livelihood options are unlikely to change farming methods, use savings/borrowings, or decrease consumption, whereas they tend to search for alternate employment.Training on agriculture and economic status are crucial for climate change adaptation in these regions. Findings exhibit substantial differences among the study countries regarding the adoption of coping strategies. Compared to farmers in Kenya, farmers in other countries change agricultural methods to cope with climate shocks. Ethiopian farmers, compared to their Kenyan counterparts, decrease consumption to deal with climate risks, whereas, farmers in Tanzania, Malawi, and Mozambique are less likely to use this option. Similarly, the likelihood of seeking alternative employment as a risk coping strategy is lower among Ethiopian farmers, while it is higher among the farmers in other countries. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is also ongoing uncertainty surrounding what the advantages and disadvantages of resettling poor and vulnerable communities might be. This article helps address this knowledge gap by considering what might be learned from recent and ongoing state-led relocation programmes in rural Africa and Asia. It draws on a review of planned displacement and resettlement in eight countries, and six months' experience researching a relocation programme in central Mozambique, to make three arguments: first, there is a need to uncover long-standing governmental perceptions of rural populations and the ways in which these affect state-led responses to climate shocks and stresses; second, it is necessary to develop a more sophisticated understanding of human choice, volition and self-determination during resettlement as adaptation; and third, greater attention should be paid to how development narratives are generated, transmitted and internalized during climate-induced relocations. Taking into account socioeconomic, political and historical realities in these ways will help to avoid situations in which present-day interventions to assist populations experiencing or threatened by climate displacement simply repeat or reinforce past injustices.","[Arnall, Alex] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Arnall, A (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading, Berks, England.",a.h.arnall@reading.ac.uk,,"Arnall, Alex/0000-0001-6218-5926",,,,,67,43,43,9,31,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Research on these efforts has identified numerous barriers to climate adaptation planning, but has not yet systematically evaluated the relative importance of different constraints for a large number of diverse cities. We draw on responses from 156 U.S. cities that participated in a 2011 global survey on local adaptation planning, 60% of which are planning for climate change. We use logistic regression analysis to assess the significance of 13 indicators measuring political leadership, fiscal and administrative resources, ability to obtain and communicate climate information, and state policies in predicting the status of adaptation planning. In keeping with the literature, we find that greater local elected officials' commitment, higher municipal expenditures per capita, and an awareness that the climate is already changing are associated with cities engaging in adaptation planning. The presence of state policies on climate adaptation is surprisingly not a statistically significant predictor, suggesting that current policies are not yet strong enough to increase local adaptation planning. However, the model's sampling bias toward larger and more environmentally progressive cities may mask the predictive power of state policies and other indicators.Takeaway for practice: State governments have an opportunity to increase local political commitment by integrating requirements for climate-risk evaluations into existing funding streams and investment plans. Regional planning entities also can help overcome the lack of local fiscal capacity and political support by facilitating the exchange of information, pooling and channeling resources, and providing technical assistance to local planners.","[Shi, Linda; Debats, Jessica] MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Chu, Eric] Univ Amsterdam, Ctr Urban Studies, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Chu, Eric] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam,"Shi, LD (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",lindashi@mit.edu; E.K.Chu@uva.nl; jdebats@mit.edu,"Chu, Eric/O-6464-2015; Chu, Eric/B-6509-2015","Chu, Eric/0000-0002-5648-6615; Chu, Eric/0000-0002-5648-6615; Shi, Linda/0000-0002-2444-367X",National Science Foundation [0926349],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We dedicate this article to JoAnn Carmin (1957-2014), associate professor at MIT, who conducted the survey (supported by National Science Foundation Grant No. 0926349) used in this article.

The present investigation focuses on groundwater recharge processes in a fluvial-deltaic aquifer in the northern part of the Rio de Janeiro state (Brazil), a region that relies on groundwater resources and where meteorological data indicate a shift from tropical humid climatic conditions to semiarid. The main objective is to understand how groundwater resources respond to the consequences of climate change on groundwater recharge, in order to improve groundwater management practices and guarantee quantitative and qualitative good status. Climate models' data and projections were used as a tool to provide a better understanding of how climate change can modify the dynamics in the studied groundwater system. The present climate indices for extreme temperature and precipitation (1961-1990) were examined in order to establish the current climatology for the study area, and the Thornthwaite-Mather hydrometeorological balance (TMHB) was used to calculate inputs to the aquifer. Projections for annual rainfall and air temperature for the period 2041-2070 obtained from Eta5km_HadGEM2-ES outputs for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 were used to estimate recharge to the aquifer using the hydrological code Visual Balan v2.0. Results revealed a tendency to air temperature increase and decrease in precipitation rate for the period of study. Consequently, there was a reduction of recharge in both IPCC scenarios used for the estimation, indicating a decrease in the groundwater resources stored in the region. These results place new challenges to guarantee sustainable groundwater management and the achievement of new aquifer system equilibrium to adapt to climate change impacts.","[Cordeiro, Mariana La Pasta; da Silva Junior, Gerson Cardoso] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Geociencias, Dept Geol, Av Athos da Silveira Ramos 274,Bloco J, BR-21941916 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Dereczynski, Claudine Pereira] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Geociencias, Dept Meteorol, Av Athos da Silveira Ramos 274,Bloco G, BR-21941916 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Peixoto Chrispim, Zelia Maria] Univ Estadual Norte Fluminense, Ctr Ciencias & Tecnol, Av Alberto Lamego 2000,Parque California, Campos Dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil; [Condesso de Melo, Maria Teresa] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, CERIS, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminense; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico,"Cordeiro, ML (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Geociencias, Dept Geol, Av Athos da Silveira Ramos 274,Bloco J, BR-21941916 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",mlpasta@hotmail.com; gerson@acd.ufrj.br; claudine@acd.ufrj.br; zeliachrispim.100@gmail.com; teresa.melo@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,"Condesso de Melo, Maria Teresa/AGC-1641-2022; da Silva, Gerson C/C-5767-2013; Dereczynski, Claudine/G-4836-2013","Condesso de Melo, Maria Teresa/0000-0001-5665-6744; da Silva, Gerson C/0000-0002-7160-0893; La Pasta Cordeiro, Mariana/0000-0002-9844-8756; Dereczynski, Claudine/0000-0002-9394-1832",CAPES-Coordination of Improvement of Higher Level Personnel; Federal University of Rio de Janeiro-(UFRJ),CAPES-Coordination of Improvement of Higher Level Personnel; Federal University of Rio de Janeiro-(UFRJ),The author would like to thank CAPES-Coordination of Improvement of Higher Level Personnel for the scholarship and the financial support of this research and to the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro-(UFRJ) for all the support during field trips.,,133,3,3,1,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Until recently, the effect of spatial configuration of vegetation to enhance or mitigate urban heat island has received little consideration in urban thermal assessments. This study examines the impact of spatial configuration of vegetation patches on urban thermal warming and cooling in Harare metropolitan city, Zimbabwe. The study used Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Landsat and Sentinel 2 data acquired between 1994 and 2017 to derive detailed information on vegetation patches, landscape metrics, and land surface temperature LST(degrees C). The spatial configuration of urban vegetation patterns was analyzed using landscape metrics in Fragstats program. Getis Ord Gi* as a Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) was used to characterize the spatial clustering and dispersion of urban vegetation patches. Results of the Getis Ord Gi* showed that clustered vegetation lowers surface temperatures more effectively than dispersed and fragmented patterns of vegetation. The size, density, shape complexity, and cohesion of vegetation patches conferred different levels of cooling but Patch Cohesion Index had the strongest negative relationship with LST(degrees C) at three spatial resolutions of 10 m (Sentinel 2), 15 m (ASTER) and 30 m (Landsat 8). The Spatial Lag Regression model performed better than the Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis in exploring the relationship between LST(degrees C) and landscape metrics. Specifically, the Spatial Lag Regression model showed higher R-2 values and log likelihood, lower Schwarz criteria, and Akaike information criterion, and reduced spatial autocorrelations. The overall information provides important insights into the provision of larger, connected, and less fragmented urban vegetation patches to derive maximum and higher cooling effects which is critical for urban planning and design approaches for mitigating increasing surface temperatures in cities.","[Kowe, Pedzisai; Mutanga, Onisimo; Odindi, John] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Discipline Geog, Private Bag X01, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Kowe, Pedzisai] Geoinformat & Remote Sensing Inst, Sci & Ind Res & Dev Ctr SIRDC, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Dube, Timothy] Univ Western Cape, Dept Earth Sci, Bellville, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal; University of the Western Cape,"Kowe, P (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Discipline Geog, Private Bag X01, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.;Kowe, P (corresponding author), Geoinformat & Remote Sensing Inst, Sci & Ind Res & Dev Ctr SIRDC, Harare, Zimbabwe.",Kowemuso5@gmail.com,,"Odindi, John/0000-0002-4934-1346",Department of Science and Technology (DST)/National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa Chair in Land Use Planning and Management [84157],Department of Science and Technology (DST)/National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa Chair in Land Use Planning and Management,This research work was financially supported by the Department of Science and Technology (DST)/National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa Chair in Land Use Planning and Management (Grant Numbers: 84157).,,99,12,12,13,77,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1548-1603,1943-7226,,GISCI REMOTE SENS,GISci.

Investigating the non-stationarity and better estimating the changes of the extreme precipitation are valuable for informing policy decisions. In this study, two precipitation indices are employed to describe the extreme events, including maximum 5-day precipitation amount (RX5day) and the number of very heavy precipitation days (R20). The generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) is employed to characterize non-stationarities in extreme precipitation events and related climate indices in 13 stations in the Hanjiang River basin (HJRB). Three models including stationary model without change (M0), non-stationary models over time (M1) and non-stationarity models with large-scale climate indices (M2) as predictors, respectively, are considered to analyse occurrence rates of extreme precipitation. The optimal model and the significant predictors were selected by the Akaike information criterion (AIC). To investigate the main predictors at regional scale, the homogeneous subregions for precipitation extremes are identified by clustering analysis. Results indicate that: (a) the non-stationarities of RX5day series and R20 series at all stations are identified in the HJRB; (b) extreme precipitation behaviour is significantly influenced by climate indices and non-stationary model 2 to describe the changes of extreme precipitation is better than non-stationary model 1, indicating the impact of large-scale climate forcing on the changes of extreme precipitation regimes; (c) the HJRB can be categorized into three homogenous regions. The optimal distributions and the main predictors of extreme precipitation events in most stations of each subregion are basically the same; (d) the dominated climate indices influencing the extreme precipitation events are different in different regions and have regional patterns.

The population increase poses a serious challenge of increasing food supply to meet the future demand. This challenge is compounded by climate change impacts on agriculture. In this paper, how poverty contributes to household food insecurity is explored and measures suggested to help address this challenge. To plan adaptation measures, linkages among food insecurity, poverty, and illiteracy should be considered. For the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), adaptation (focused on poverty alleviation) should be prioritized and preferred to mitigation. Enhancement of adaptive capacity should not only be tailored toward empowerment of women but also made highly localized to household levels. Generally, efforts could be geared toward yield gap closure, addressing challenges regarding food distribution, promoting non-farm income-generating activities, and unification of government priorities in agriculture and food security. Government in each country of the SSA should ensure that governance strongly embraces transparency, accountability, and integrity otherwise as it is said a fish rots from the head down. Estimates of uncertainty in predicting future climate and their implications on expenditure related to adaptation should to always be made in an integrated way and reported to support actionable policies. To increase credibility in climate prediction especially at local scales, advances toward improving climate models (for instance by refining spatiotemporal scales, enhancing models' capacity to reproduce observed natural variability in key climatological variables like rainfall) should be made, and this requires support from the investment in climate science. Science-policy interfacing is required in planning and implementation of measures for adapting to climate change impacts. In summary, food insecurity and persistent poverty especially in the SSA should be of direct relevance and concern at a global scale. Thus, global collaboration in science is key to achieve food security in the SSA.","[Onyutha, Charles] Kyambogo Univ, Dept Civil & Bldg Engn, Kyambogo, Uganda; [Onyutha, Charles] Muni Univ, Fac Technosci, Arua, Uganda",,"Onyutha, C (corresponding author), Kyambogo Univ, Dept Civil & Bldg Engn, Kyambogo, Uganda.",conyutha@kyu.ac.ug,"Onyutha, Charles/L-2194-2016","Onyutha, Charles/0000-0002-0652-3828",,,,,76,18,18,4,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2048-3694,,,FOOD ENERGY SECUR,Food Energy Secur.,FEB,2019,8,1,,,,,,,e00160,10.1002/fes3.160,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fes3.160,,,18,Agronomy; Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,HL8OA,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000459001300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study addressed the effectiveness of long-term (15-37 years old) enclosures in enhancing soil carbon sequestration in a semi-arid rangeland of Southern Ethiopia. We tested for differences in soil properties and vegetation characteristics between enclosures and adjacent open-grazed areas, while accounting for effects of age of enclosures and soil depths. Three enclosures age categories ( < 20, 20-30 and > 30 years) each paired with adjacent open grazed areas were selected. We collected soil samples at three soil depths (0-5 cm, 5-15 cm and 15-30 cm), and vegetation attributes from 90 plots within 9 enclosures and adjacent open grazing sites. The results showed that soil properties did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) between the two management systems across the three soil depths. However, relatively higher soil organic carbon content and stock was recorded in the enclosures than open-grazed lands. We recorded an overall mean of soil organic carbon stock of 39.6 +/- 3.5 Mg ha(-1) in enclosures of < 20 years old, 40.8 +/- 3.4 Mg ha(-2) in enclosures of 20-30 years old and 51.0 +/- 4.4 Mg ha(-1) in enclosures of > 30 years old. The soil organic carbon stock for the adjacent open-grazed areas ranged from 34.4 +/- 2.5 to 47.9 +/- 5.1 Mg ha(-1). The age of enclosures did not show any significant effect on soil organic carbon stocks. However, enclosure management had a significant (P <= 0.05) effect on vegetation attributes. We concluded that enclosure had a significant role in terms of soil carbon sequestration and adaptation to climate change.","[Feyisa, Kenea; Beyene, Sheleme; Angassa, Ayana; Abebe, Aster] Hawassa Univ, Coll Agr, POB 05, Hawassa, Ethiopia; [Said, Mohammed Y.] Int Livestock Res Inst ILRI, POB 30709, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Megersa, Bekele] Hawassa Univ, Sch Vet Med, POB 05, Hawassa, Ethiopia; [de Leeuw, Jan] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, POB 30677, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Angassa, Ayana] Botswana Univ Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Anim Sci & Prod, Private Bag 0027, Gaborone, Botswana",Hawassa University; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Hawassa University; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF),"Angassa, A (corresponding author), Botswana Univ Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Anim Sci & Prod, Private Bag 0027, Gaborone, Botswana.",aabdeta@bca.bw,"said, mohammed/E-4932-2019","said, mohammed/0000-0001-9278-3193; Angassa, Ayana/0000-0002-6763-3959; Megersa, Bekele/0000-0002-6306-1236",German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) (GIZ) GmbHA [10.7860.9-001.00],German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) (GIZ) GmbHA,"This study was performed under collaborative research agreement Livelihood diversifying potential of livestock based carbon sequestration options in pastoral and agro-pastoral systems in Africa between the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI, Kenya) and Hawassa University, financed by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) (GIZ) GmbHA [10.7860.9-001.00].

As paradoxical as it might seem, humans are an important part of wilderness, helping to define the very concept and representing an important component of wilderness use and management. Much of the past five decades of wilderness-related social science has focused on recreational use, documenting the impacts of recreation on wilderness resources and the quality of the wilderness experience, exploring application of the concept of recreational carrying capacity to wilderness, and developing planning and management frameworks for balancing the inherent tension between wilderness use and protecting the quality of wilderness resources and the experience of visiting wilderness. The Limits of Acceptable Change and related planning frameworks, including formulation of recreation-related indicators and standards, continues to help guide wilderness management today. Other programs of social science research have developed protocols for measuring and monitoring wilderness recreation, defined the root causes of conflict among wilderness users and identified management approaches to minimize this conflict, explored the appropriate and acceptable use of fees for wilderness use, and identified a growing suite of wilderness values. All of these programs of research and others that could not be included in this review article have helped guide wilderness management and policy. However, social science research has evolved as a function of changes in both wilderness and society. This evolution continues through a focus on public attitudes toward adaptation to climate change, public attitudes toward restoration in wilderness to correct past human intervention, appropriate use of technology in wilderness, and issues related to the relevance of wilderness in light of changes in society and use of public lands. This article tells the story of these changes in issues and the relationship between wilderness and the American people.","[Watson, Alan E.; Cordell, H.

In the last decade, the concerted efforts of the Chinese government and its people to meet its grain demand have been highly successful. Despite the current global grain crisis, China's grain market has remained relatively stable, allowing it to contribute to world grain security. The purpose of this chapter was to give an overview of grain security in China, with an analysis of the present national and global grain security, as well as a historical accounting of the most important factors that have led to success. The Chinese grain production process was analyzed in detail, discussing in-depth achievements and experiences, which can then be used for reference in other countries. Although currently stable, grain security for China faces many long-term challenges, such as loss of cultivated land from degradation and urbanization, limited water resources, frequent natural disasters, impacts of climate change, vulnerable ecosystems, increased demand from population growth and improved standard of living, a small-scale agricultural economy, and outdated aging agricultural infrastructure, among others. The chapter then in details suggested countermeasures that should be taken to guarantee grain security, including the improvement of agricultural infrastructure, increased fiscal input, greater use of science and technology, protection of cultivated land and water resources, support for the farmers' livelihood, adaptation to climatic change, improvements in grassland agriculture, and controls on population growth, etc. The chapter concludes with two case studies serving to tie the chapter together with the idea that China's present successes and proactive long-term plans are working, thus presenting a highly favorable outlook for the future.","[Wang, Huixiao; Cai, Yan] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Water Sci, Key Lab Water & Sediment Sci, Minist Educ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Wang, HX (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Water Sci, Key Lab Water & Sediment Sci, Minist Educ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,74,32,34,6,56,ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B STREET, SUITE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0065-2113,,978-0-12-374819-5,ADV AGRON,Adv.

Agriculture and forestry also form a significant global source of greenhouse gas emissions, although in Germany these are of secondary importance when compared to those arising from energy generation, industry, traffic and domestic households. Regional adaptation to climatic change appears to be possible, but on a global scale it will lead to a deterioration in the standard of living. The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change of 1992 and the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, initiated a process aimed at reversing this trend. Agriculture and forestry are also being called upon to contribute to this. At national level, these efforts are embedded in a comprehensive programme for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In the agricultural sector, priority is being afforded to the exploitation and tapping of potentials for reducing laughing gas (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), and in animal husbandry, to the possibility of reducing methane (CH4) and N2O. The employment of renewable raw materials in the form of biofuels, or for the generation of heat and electricity, creates a certain potential for reducing CO2. The binding of CO2 in woodlands and wood products (CO2 sinks) provides only temporary and small-scale relief. Against the background of the increasingly concrete contributions agriculture and forestry will be required to make to global climate protection in future, the necessity for research and development studies to examine possible contributions to every facet of this field will continue, also to continued assistance for political decision-making.","Bundesministerium Ernahrung, Landwirtschaft & Forsten, D-53123 Bonn, Germany",,"Braune, I (corresponding author), Bundesministerium Ernahrung, Landwirtschaft & Forsten, Rochusstr 1, D-53123 Bonn, Germany.",,,,,,,,54,3,3,0,10,LANDWIRTSCHAFTSVERLAG GMBH,MUNSTER HILTRUP,"POSTFACH 48 02 49, D-48079 MUNSTER HILTRUP, GERMANY",0005-9080,,,BER LANDWIRTSCH,Ber.

Smaller farms generally have different planted crops, yields, agricultural inputs, and irrigation applications compared to larger farms. However, gridded farm-size-specific data that are moreover crop specific, are currently lacking. This obscures our understanding of differences between smallscale and large-scale farms, e.g., with respect to climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, contribution to (local) food security, and water consumption patterns. This study fills a significant part of the current data gap, by developing high-resolution gridded, simultaneously farm-size-specific and crop-specific datasets of harvested areas for 56 countries (i.e., covering about half the global cropland). Hereto, we downscaled the most complete global direct measurements of farm size and crop type by compiling state of the art datasets, including crop maps, cropland extent maps, and dominant field size distribution, representative for the year 2010. Using two different crop map sources, we were able to produce two new 5 arcmin gridded datasets on simultaneously derived farm-size-specific and crop-specific harvested areas: one for 11 farm sizes, 27 crops, and 2 farming systems, and one for 11 farm sizes, 42 crops, and 4 farming systems. In line with previous findings, our resulting datasets show major differences in planted crops and irrigated area (%) between farm sizes. Consistency between our resulting datasets and (i) observations from satellite images on farm-size-specific oil palm, (ii) household surveys on the farm-size-specific irrigated area (%), and (iii) previous studies that mapped noncrop-specific farm sizes and support the validity of our datasets. Although at grid level some uncertainties remain to be overcome, particularly those stemming from uncertainties in crop maps, results at country level seem robust.

Fluvial system structure is presented in the first section of the paper along with permafrost controls over its functioning, which vary across fluvial system compartments. The distinction is drawn between primarily fluvial landforms that are expected to adjust to future hydrology with less permafrost constraints, and primarily cryogenic landforms evolving in line with permafrost disturbances. The influence of permafrost on fluvial action varies across compartments: on hillslopes, permafrost mostly controls the occurrence of surface runoff, in river valleys and channels, sediment erodibility, while thermal interaction is essential for growing thermo-erosional gullies. Observed and projected changes in permafrost and hydrology are outlined, and their relevance for cryo-fluvial evolution of fluvial systems is reviewed. Based on these projections, future changes in fluvial action in each compartment are discussed. On hillslopes, where permafrost exerts important controls on hillslope hydrology, fluvial activity of overland flow is expected to decrease following the active layer deepening and decreased overland flow duration. In erosional networks, controlled by thermal interaction between runoff and permafrost terrain, higher water temperature is expected to increase the occurrence and rates of thermo-erosional gully development. In river valleys and channels, where permafrost controls the erodibility of bed and bank material, the expected fluvial feedbacks vary across scales and stream orders, and include changes in seasonality of channel deformations, increased retreat rates in lower river banks and decreased, in higher banks, along with floodplain subsidence, and minor potential for complete destabilization of existing channel patterns. Future collateral effects of fluvial change include alterations of terrestrial biogeochemical cycles and societal impact that must be accounted for in climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.","[Tananaev, Nikita] Russian Acad Sci, Melnikov Permafrost Inst, Siberian Branch, 36 Merzlotnaya Str, Yakutsk 677010, Russia; [Tananaev, Nikita] North Eastern Fed Univ, 46 Kulakovskogo Str, Yakutsk 677004, Russia; [Lotsari, Eliisa] Aalto Univ, Dept Built Environm, Water & Environm Engn, PL 15200,Tietotie 1B, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland","Melnikov Permafrost Institute, Siberian Branch of the RAS; Russian Academy of Sciences; North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk; Aalto University","Tananaev, N (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Melnikov Permafrost Inst, Siberian Branch, 36 Merzlotnaya Str, Yakutsk 677010, Russia.",TananaevNI@mpi.ysn.ru; eliisa.s.lotsari@aalto.fi,"Tananaev, Nikita/J-3471-2012","Tananaev, Nikita/0000-0003-2997-0169; Lotsari, Eliisa/0000-0002-0120-8722",Academy of Finland Mobility [333218]; SB RAS [333218]; RFBR [????-A20-120111690008-9],Academy of Finland Mobility; SB RAS(Russian Academy of Sciences); RFBR(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)),"This paper was prepared under the Academy of Finland Mobility Grant to N.T.

Here, we investigate the short-term effects of temperature on suicide deaths occurring in Brussels between January 1st, 2002 and December 31st, 2011. Methods: We conducted a bidirectional time-stratified case-crossover study with cases being suicide deaths occurring among Brussels residents aged 5 years or older. Cases were matched by day of the week with control days from the same month and year. The exposure was the daily average temperature measured at the Uccle station (Brussels) and obtained from the Belgian Royal Meteorological Institute. We combined conditional logistic regression with distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) to obtain one week (lag 0-6) cumulative risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the effects of moderate and extreme cold (5th and 1st percentiles of temperature, respectively) and moderate and extreme heat (95th and 99th percentiles of temperature, respectively), relative to the median temperature. Results: In total, 1891 suicide deaths were included. The median temperature was 11.6 degrees C, moderate and extreme cold temperatures were 0 and -3.1 degrees C, respectively, and moderate and extreme high temperatures were 20.9 and 24.4 degrees C, respectively. The cumulative risk of suicide mortality was almost twice higher among lags 0 to 6 for both moderate and extreme heat, relative to the period median temperature (e.g. moderate heat RR = 1.80 CI:1.27-2.54). No statistically significant associations were observed for cold temperatures. Conclusions: In Brussels, a western European city with temperate climate, high temperatures may trigger suicide deaths up to one week later. In the context of climate change, adaptation strategies must take into consideration the effects of temperature on mental health.","[Casas, Lidia] Univ Antwerp, Dept Family Med & Populat Hlth, Social Epidemiol & Hlth Policy, Doornstr 331, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Casas, Lidia] Univ Antwerp, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev IMDO, Antwerp, Belgium; [Cox, Bianca; Nawrot, Tim S.] Hasselt Univ, Ctr Environm Sci, Agoralaan Gebouw D, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Nemery, Benoit; Nawrot, Tim S.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Environm & Hlth, Dept Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Herestr 49, Leuven, Belgium; [Deboosere, Patrick] Vrije Univ Brussel, Sociol Dept, Interface Demog, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp; Hasselt University; KU Leuven; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Casas, L (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Family Med & Populat Hlth, Social Epidemiol & Hlth Policy, Doornstr 331, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",Lidia.casasruiz@uantwerpen.be,"; Cox, Bianca/A-9480-2015","Deboosere, Patrick/0000-0002-8148-3694; Casas, Lidia/0000-0003-1820-8742; Nawrot, Tim/0000-0002-3583-3593; Nemery, Benoit/0000-0003-0571-4689; Cox, Bianca/0000-0001-9824-6276","Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) [12I1517N, 12Q0517N]",Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)(FWO),"Lidia Casas and Bianca Cox are recipients of post-doctoral fellow-ships of the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) , grant numbers 12I1517N and 12Q0517N, respectively.",,33,4,4,4,11,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0013-9351,1096-0953,,ENVIRON RES,Environ.

To quantify the relative soil C contribution from trees in agroforestry systems (AFS), this study assessed the reported differences in SOC stocks under agroforestry systems in comparison with other land-use systems (Agriculture, Forestry, Pasture, or Uncultivated Land) in various soil-depth classes in four agroecological regions (arid and semiarid, ASA; lowland humid tropics, LHT; Mediterranean, MED; and temperate, TEM) around the world. Using mixed-effect models and a meta-analytical approach, we synthesized data from 78 peer-reviewed studies that generated 858 data points (sites) on SOC stock under various AFS practiced globally. Comparing Agroforest vs. Agriculture or Agroforest vs. Pasture, SOC stocks under AFS were higher by + 27% in the ASA region, + 26% in LHT, and + 5.8% in TEM, but -5.3% in the TEM in the 0-100 cm soil depth. The Agroforest aged between 10-20 years had higher SOC stock than newly established, as well as < 10-year-old systems across all soil-depth classes and agroecological regions. Overall, Agroforest vs. Agriculture land management practices resulted in positive SOC stock changes within AFS up to 100 cm soil depth, whereas SOC stock under AFS was lower than under Forest. The results suggest that a general pattern of Forest - Agroforest - Agriculture - Pasture continuum could be expected in SOC stock decline during land-use changes. Improvement of SOC stocks under AFS varied across agroecological regions, the highest being under arid and semiarid region, closely followed by the low humid tropics. The important outcome of this meta-analysis is worthy of emphasizing of the role of AFS in climate change adaptation and greenhouse gas mitigation strategies by promoting carbon sinks.",,,,nilovnachatterjee79@gmail.com,"Chatterjee, Nilovna/AAE-9310-2022","Chatterjee, Nilovna/0000-0001-9517-3462; Nair, Vimala/0000-0002-1096-284X; Chakraborty, Saptarshi/0000-0002-3121-9174","USDA/NIFA/Mcintire-Stennis Project [FLA-FOR-005249, 233673]",USDA/NIFA/Mcintire-Stennis Project,"The study was conducted during the terms of Graduate Research Fellowships awarded to the first and third authors by their respective departments of the University of Florida, Gainesville, USA.

However, to date few studies have sought to investigate the awareness, attitudes and behaviours of DWWTS owners and the efficacy of associated communication initiatives. The current study provides an examination of a public national engagement campaign undertaken in the Republic of Ireland which seeks to minimise the impact of DWWTSs on human and ecological health via concurrent inspection and information dissemination. Overall, 1634 respondents were surveyed using a before and after study design to capture if and how awareness, attitudes and behaviours evolved over time. Findings suggest that whilst the campaign provided a modest baseline to raise general awareness associated with the basic operational and maintenance requirements of DWWTS, there has been little or no behavioural engagement as a result, suggesting a significant awareness-behaviour gap. Accordingly, efforts to minimise potential human and ecological, impacts have been unsuccessful. Moreover, results suggest that public attitudes towards water-related regulation and policy became increasingly negative over the study period due to parallel political and economic issues, further complicating future engagement. Future strategies, both in Ireland and further afield, should focus on health-based demographically-focused message framing to achieve significant knowledge and attitudinal shifts amongst specific population cohorts, and thus bring about significant behavioural change. Study findings and recommendations may be used by myriad stakeholders including local, provincial and national authorities to effectively engage with individuals and communities prior to and during implementation of legislative and policy-based instruments within numerous spheres including climate change adaptation, environmental quality, hydrological risk, and hydro-ecology.

Design/methodology/approach The study used the household survey method of to collect data collected in Charsadda district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, involving 116 randomly selected respondents. Findings Prevalent crops diseases, water scarcity, soil fertility loss and poor socio-economic conditions were main contributing factors of climate change vulnerability. The results further showed that changing crops type and cultivation pattern, improved seed varieties, planting shaded trees and the provision of excessive fertilizers are the measures adapted to improve agricultural productivity, which may reduce the climate change vulnerability at a household level. Research limitations/implications The major limitation of this study was the exclusion of women from the survey due to religious and cultural barriers of in Pashtun society, wherein women and men do not mingle. Practical implications Reducing climate change vulnerability and developing more effective adaptation techniques require assistance from the government. This help can be in the form of providing basic resources, such as access to good quality agricultural inputs, access to information and extension services on climate change adaptation and modern technologies. Consultation with other key stakeholder is also required to create awareness and to build the capacity of the locals toward reducing climate change vulnerability and facilitating timely and effective adaptation. Originality/value This original research work provides evidence about farm-level vulnerability, adaptation strategies and risk perceptions on dealing with climate-change-induced natural disasters in Pakistan. This paper enriches existing knowledge of climate change vulnerability and adaptation in this resource-limited country so that effective measures can be taken to reduce vulnerability of farming communities, and enhance their adaptive capability.","[Ullah, Wahid; Nihei, Takaaki] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Letters, Dept Reg Geog, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Nafees, Muhammad; Zaman, Rahman; Ali, Muhammad] Univ Peshawar, Dept Environm Sci, Peshawar, Pakistan",Hokkaido University; University of Peshawar,"Ullah, W (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Letters, Dept Reg Geog, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.",waheedullah@live.in; ntakaaki@pb3.so-net.ne.jp; nafees@upesh.edu.pk; rahmanzaman13@yahoo.com; khanalman146@gmail.com,"Ullah, Wahid/O-3782-2018; Nafees, Mohammad/J-4769-2019","Ullah, Wahid/0000-0001-9370-133X; Nafees, Mohammad/0000-0002-8717-8092","Research Promotion Office of the Graduate School of Letters, Hokkaido University","Research Promotion Office of the Graduate School of Letters, Hokkaido University","This study is part of PhD research at the Department of Regional Geography, Graduate School of Letters, Hokkaido University, Japan.

In response, urban water utilities systematically give more attention to criteria such as water safety, climate change adaptation and mitigation, environmental life cycle assessment (LCA), total cost efficiency, and on how to improve their operations within the water-energy-carbon nexus. The authors of this paper collaborated in the development of a 'Dynamic Metabolism Model' (DMM). The model is developed for generic use in the sustainability assessment of urban water services, and it has been initially tested for the city of Oslo, Norway. The purpose has been to adopt a holistic systemic perspective to the analysis of metabolism and environmental impacts of resource flows in urban water and wastewater systems, in order to offer a tool for the examination of future strategies and intervention options in such systems. This paper describes the model and its application to the city of Oslo for the analysis time period 2013-2040. The external factors impacting decision-making and interventions are introduced along with realistic scenarios developed for the testing, after consultation with officials at the Oslo Water and Wastewater Works (Norway). Possible interventions that the utility intends to set in motion are defined and numerically interpreted for incorporation into the model, and changes in the indicator values over the time period are determined. This paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the DMM, as a decision-support tool for water-wastewater utilities. The scenarios considered and interventions identified do not include all possible scenarios and interventions that can be relevant for water-wastewater utilities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We demonstrate how this can occur by comparing a stakeholder participatory approach to assessing rural livelihood vulnerability across Pacific Island countries, with a widely used non-contextual approach, the Environmental Vulnerability Climate Change sub-index. The participatory approach was conducted in collaboration with a group of regional Pacific representatives. The approach included three activities: (i) producing a shared vision of the characteristics of vulnerability, (ii) estimating the relative vulnerability and capacity to adapt of Pacific Island communities using the Sustainable Livelihoods conceptual framework, and (iii) producing a post-hoc perspective of desirable policy-relevant outcomes to enhance adaptive capacity using Public Values Mapping analysis. The comparison of outputs derived from the two vulnerability assessment methods highlighted two notable differences: (i) different rankings of the vulnerability status of rural livelihoods in individual Pacific island countries, and (ii) differing capacities to support the delivery of action-orientated outputs and policy development. We argue that the participatory approach is more likely to result in effective policy outcomes, i.e. a reduction in the policy relevance gap and increased capacity to adapt. We substantiate this argument by attempting to create policy relevant outcomes from both vulnerability approaches. We show that the three-stage participatory approach is more able to satisfy the demand for decision-making processes relating to the allocation of climate change adaptation resources to be transparent and based on scientific evidence, as well as delivering outcomes that are in the public's interest. Output from the Environmental Vulnerability Climate Change sub-index was considered inadequate to effectively inform the development of policies and adaptation actions to reduce vulnerability in rural livelihoods.

However, identifying such systems is confounded on both conceptual and methodological grounds, especially in systems that are moving toward thresholds, a common trait of dryland environments. This study explores these challenges by analyzing how a range of external pressures affect the vulnerability of dryland pastoral systems in the Kalahari. This is achieved by employing dynamic systems modeling approaches to understand the pathways by which communities became vulnerable to drought. Specifically, we evaluate how external pressures have changed: (1) different agroecosystems' abilities to tolerate drought, i.e., ecosystem resilience; (2) rural communities' abilities to adapt to drought, mediated via their access to assets; and (3) the ability of institutions and policy interventions to play a role in mediating drought-related crises, i.e., socio-political governance. This is done by reanalyzing ecological and participatory research findings along with farm-scale livestock offtake data from across the Kalahari in Botswana. An iterative process was followed to establish narratives exploring how external drivers led to changes in agroecosystem resilience, access to assets, and the institutional capacity to buffer the system. We use causal loop diagrams and statistical dynamic system models to express key quantitative relationships and establish future scenarios to help define where uncertainties lie by showing where the system is most sensitive to change. We highlight how that greater sharing of land management knowledge and practices between private and communal land managers can provide 'win-win-win' benefits of reducing system vulnerability, increasing economic income, and building social capital. We use future scenario analyses to identify key areas for future studies of climate change adaptation across the Kalahari.","[Dougill, Andrew J.; Fraser, Evan D.

However, the effect of climate change on the spatiotemporal variability in NEP is still unclear. Using the Integrated Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon-budget (InTEC) model, this study takes the typical subtropical forests in the Zhejiang Province, China as an example, simulated the spatiotemporal patterns of forest NEP from 1979 to 2079 based on historically observed climate data (1979-2015) and data from three representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) provided by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5). We analyzed the responses of NEP at different forest age classes to the variation in meteorological factors. The NEP of Zhejiang's forests decreased from 1979 to 1985 and then increased from 1985 to 2015, with an annual increase rate of 9.66 g C.m(-2).yr(-1) and a cumulative NEP of 364.99 Tg.C. Forest NEP decreased from 2016 to 2079; however, the cumulative NEP continued to increase. The simulated cumulative NEP under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios was 750 Tg.C, 866 Tg.C, and 958 Tg.C, respectively, at the end of 2079. Partial correlation analysis between forest NEP at different age stages and meteorological factors showed that temperature is the key climatic factor that affects the carbon sequestration capacity of juvenile forests (1979-1999), while precipitation is the key climatic factor that affects middle-aged forests (2000-2015) and mature forests (2016-2079). Adopting appropriate management strategies for forests, such as selective cutting of different ages, is critical for the subtropical forests to adapt to climate change and maintain their high carbon sink capacity.","[Mao, Fangjie; Du, Huaqiang; Zhou, Guomo; Zheng, Junlong; Li, Xuejian; Xu, Yanxin; Huang, Zihao; Yin, Shiyan] Zhejiang A&F Univ, State Key Lab Subtrop Silviculture, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China; [Mao, Fangjie; Du, Huaqiang; Zhou, Guomo; Zheng, Junlong; Li, Xuejian; Xu, Yanxin; Huang, Zihao; Yin, Shiyan] Zhejiang A&F Univ, Key Lab Carbon Cycling Forest Ecosystems & Carbon, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China; [Mao, Fangjie; Du, Huaqiang; Zhou, Guomo; Zheng, Junlong; Li, Xuejian; Xu, Yanxin; Huang, Zihao; Yin, Shiyan] Zhejiang A&F Univ, Sch Environm & Resources Sci, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China",Zhejiang A&F University; Zhejiang A&F University; Zhejiang A&F University,"Du, HQ (corresponding author), Zhejiang A&F Univ, State Key Lab Subtrop Silviculture, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China.",dhqrs@126.com,"Mao, Fangjie/GXZ-7139-2022","Mao, Fangjie/0000-0003-2005-3452; Huang, Zihao/0000-0002-7443-6515","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31901310, 32171785, 31670644, U1809208]; State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Silviculture Foundation [zy20180201]; Joint Research fund of Department of Forestry of Zhejiang Province and Chinese Academy of Forestry [2017SY04]; Zhejiang Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center for Bamboo Resources and High-efficiency Utilization [S2017011]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Silviculture Foundation; Joint Research fund of Department of Forestry of Zhejiang Province and Chinese Academy of Forestry; Zhejiang Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center for Bamboo Resources and High-efficiency Utilization,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31901310, 32171785, 31670644, U1809208), the State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Silviculture Foundation (No. zy20180201), Joint Research fund of Department of Forestry of Zhejiang Province and Chinese Academy of Forestry (No. 2017SY04), Zhejiang Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center for Bamboo Resources and High-efficiency Utilization (No. S2017011).",,73,4,4,33,40,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

Every day, at different places of the world, the planet sends alarming messages about the enormous transformations it is experiencing due to human-based activities. The latter are responsible for changing weather patterns that threaten food production, energy production and energy consumption, the desertification of land, the displacement of people and animals because of food and water shortages due to the reductions in rainfall, natural disasters and rising sea levels. The effects of climate change affect us all, and if drastic measures are not considered in a timely manner, it will be more difficult and costly to adapt to the aforementioned effects in the future. Considering this context, the aim of this work is to implement a prospective study/structural analysis to the identified sectors of a regional plan of adaptation to climate change so as to promote the resilience of the region against the negative phenomena generated by the climate crisis. This was achieved in two steps: first, we identified the relationships between the strategic sectors of the plan and organized them in order of importance. Second, we assessed the effectiveness of several public policies oriented towards a city's resilience according to their impact upon the strategic sectors of the plan and the co-benefits generated by their implementation for society. The results highlight that the most essential sectors for the mitigation of climate change are flood risk management, built environment, forest ecosystem management, human health, tourism and rise in sea level. As a consequence, the most important measures for the resilience of the North Aegean Region against climate change are the ones related to the preparation of strategic master plans for flood protection projects.","[Chatziioannou, Ioannis; Alvarez-Icaza, Luis] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ingn, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Bakogiannis, Efthimios; Kyriakidis, Charalampos] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Rural & Surveying Engn, Dept Geog & Reg Planning, Athens 15780, Greece",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; National Technical University of Athens,"Chatziioannou, I (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ingn, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",ioannis.gits@gmail.com; ebako@mail.ntua.gr; kyriakidisharry@gmail.com; alvar@pumas.iingen.unam.mx,"ebako@mail.ntua.gr, Efthimios/AAL-5282-2021","ebako@mail.ntua.gr, Efthimios/0000-0001-6726-4762; Kyriakidis, Charalampos/0000-0003-4144-0216; Chatziioannou, Ioannis/0000-0002-2434-1964; Alvarez-Icaza, Luis/0000-0001-9516-3950",DGAPA scholarship program,DGAPA scholarship program,The first author specially acknowledges the support from the DGAPA scholarship program.,,70,1,1,1,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2020,12,24,,,,,,,10420,10.3390/su122410420,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su122410420,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PL7HO,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000603288300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this paper is to identify potential groundwater (GW) bodies with reduced vulnerability to pumping, which can be used as buffer values to define sustainable conjunctive use management during droughts. Assuming that the long term natural mean reserves are maintained, a preliminary assessment of GW vulnerability can be obtained by using the natural turnover time (T) index, defined in each GW body as the storage capacity (S) divided by the recharge (R). Aquifers where R is close to S are extremely vulnerable to exploitation. This approach will be applied in the 146 Spanish GW bodies at risk of not achieving the Water Framework Directive (WFD objectives, to maintain a good quantitative status. The analyses will be focused on the impacts of the climate drivers on the mean T value for Historical and potential future scenarios, assuming that the Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes and the management strategies will allow maintenance of the long term mean natural GW body reserves. Around 26.9% of these GW bodies show low vulnerability to pumping, when viewing historical T values over 100 years, this percentage growing to 33.1% in near future horizon values (until 2045). The results show a significant heterogeneity. The range of variability for the historical T values is around 3700 years, which also increases in the near future to 4200 years. These T indices will change in future horizons, and, therefore, the potential of GW resources to undergo sustainable strategies to adapt to climate change will also change accordingly, making it necessary to apply adaptive management strategies.","[Pulido-Velazquez, David; Collados-Lara, Antonio-Juan; Baena-Ruiz, Leticia] Inst Geol & Minero Espana, 4 Edificio Zulema, Granada 18006, Spain; [Romero, Javier] Univ Catolica San Antonio Murcia, Campus Jeronimos S-N, Murcia 30107, Spain; [Alcala, Francisco J.] Inst Geol & Minero Espana, Rios Rosas 23, Madrid 28003, Spain; [Alcala, Francisco J.] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Ingn, Inst Ciencias Quim Aplicadas, Santiago 7500138, Chile; [Fernandez-Chacon, Francisca] IES Ribera de Fardes, Granada 18519, Spain",Universidad Catolica de Murcia; Universidad Autonoma de Chile,"Pulido-Velazquez, D (corresponding author), Inst Geol & Minero Espana, 4 Edificio Zulema, Granada 18006, Spain.",d.pulido@igme.es; romerog.javier@gmail.com; aj.collados@igme.es; fj.alcala@igme.es; paquifchacon@gmail.com; l.baena@igme.es,"Ruiz, Leticia Baena/AAC-4160-2021; Alcalá, Francisco Javier/C-4533-2013; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Pulido-Velazquez, David/D-7412-2013; Collados-Lara, Antonio-Juan/A-9635-2016","Ruiz, Leticia Baena/0000-0003-2912-0690; Alcalá, Francisco Javier/0000-0002-8165-8669; Pulido-Velazquez, David/0000-0001-7985-0769; Collados-Lara, Antonio-Juan/0000-0002-5693-2048","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [GeoE.171.008-TACTIC, GeoE.171.008-HOVER]; SIGLO-AN project from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (Programa Estatal de I +D +I orientada a los Retos de la Sociedad) [RTI2018-101397 -B-I00]","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; SIGLO-AN project from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (Programa Estatal de I +D +I orientada a los Retos de la Sociedad)","This research has been partially funded by the projects GeoE.171.008-TACTIC and GeoE.171.008-HOVER, funded by European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; and SIGLO-AN (RTI2018-101397 -B-I00) project from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (Programa Estatal de I +D +I orientada a los Retos de la Sociedad).",,54,8,8,4,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2020,12,11,,,,,,,3281,10.3390/w12113281,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12113281,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,OZ1MB,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000594697700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Breeding novel crop cultivars adaptable to climate change is one potential solution, but this approach requires an understanding of complex adaptive traits for climate-change conditions. In this study, plant growth, nitrogen (N) uptake, and yield in relation to climatic resource use efficiency of nine representative maize cultivars released between 1973 and 2000 in China were investigated in a 2-year field experiment under three N applications. The Hybrid-Maize model was used to simulate maize yield potential in the period from 1973 to 2011. During the past four decades, the total thermal time (growing degree days) increased whereas the total precipitation and sunshine hours decreased. This climate change led to a reduction of maize potential yield by an average of 12.9% across different hybrids. However, the potential yield of individual hybrids increased by 118.5 similar to kg similar to ha-1 similar to yr-1 with increasing year of release. From 1973 to 2000, the use efficiency of sunshine hours, thermal time, and precipitation resources increased by 37%, 40%, and 41%, respectively. The late developed hybrids showed less reduction in yield potential in current climate conditions than old cultivars, indicating some adaptation to new conditions. Since the mid-1990s, however, the yield impact of climate change exhibited little change, and even a slight worsening for new cultivars. Modern breeding increased ear fertility and grain-filling rate, and delayed leaf senescence without modification in net photosynthetic rate. The trade-off associated with delayed leaf senescence was decreased grain N concentration rather than increased plant N uptake, therefore N agronomic efficiency increased simultaneously. It is concluded that modern maize hybrids tolerate the climatic changes mainly by constitutively optimizing plant productivity. Maize breeding programs in the future should pay more attention to cope with the limiting climate factors specifically.","[Chen, Xiaochao; Chen, Fanjun; Chen, Yanling; Yang, Xiaoli; Yuan, Lixing; Zhang, Fusuo; Mi, Guohua] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Ctr Resources Environm & Food Secur, Key Lab Plant Soil Interact,MOE, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Gao, Qiang] Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Changchun 130118, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; Jilin Agricultural University,"Mi, GH (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Ctr Resources Environm & Food Secur, Key Lab Plant Soil Interact,MOE, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",miguohua@cau.edu.cn,"chen, yanling/GRE-8287-2022; Yuan, Lixing/I-2727-2012; Zhang, Fusuo/AAV-4517-2021","Yuan, Lixing/0000-0003-0233-6184; zhang, fusuo/0000-0001-8971-0129; Chen, Fanjun/0000-0001-8105-1683","National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China [2009CB11860, 2011CB100305]; National Nature Science Foundation of China [31272233, 31121062]; Special Fund for the Agricultural Profession [201103003]",National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special Fund for the Agricultural Profession,"This work is supported by the National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China (nos. 2009CB11860; 2011CB100305), the National Nature Science Foundation of China (nos. 31272233 and 31121062), and the Special Fund for the Agricultural Profession (201103003) for financial support.

On its passage through the Critical Zone, DOM is subject to biogeochemical conversions. Therefore, it carries valuable cross-habitat information for monitoring and predicting the stability of groundwater ecosystem services and assessing these ecosystems' response to fluctuations caused by external impacts such as climatic extremes. Challenges arise from insufficient knowledge on groundwater metabolite composition and dynamics due to a lack of consistent analytical approaches for long-term monitoring. Our study establishes groundwater metabolomics to decipher the complex biogeochemical transport and conversion of DOM. We explore fractured sedimentary bedrock along a hillslope recharge area by a 5-year untargeted metabolomics monitoring of oxic perched and anoxic phreatic groundwater. A summer with extremely high temperatures and low precipitation was included in the monitoring. Water was accessed by a monitoring well-transect and regularly collected for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) investigation. Dimension reduction of the resulting complex data set by principal component analysis revealed that metabolome dissimilarities between distant wells coincide with transient cross-stratal flow indicated by groundwater levels. Time series of the groundwater metabolome data provides detailed insights into subsurface responses to recharge dynamics. We demonstrate that dissimilarity variability between groundwater bodies with contrasting aquifer properties coincides with recharge dynamics. This includes groundwater high- and lowstands as well as recharge and recession phases. Our monitoring approach allows to survey groundwater ecosystems even under extreme conditions. Notably, the metabolome was highly variable lacking seasonal patterns and did not segregate by geographical location of sampling wells, thus ruling out vegetation or (agricultural) land use as a primary driving factor. Patterns that emerge from metabolomics monitoring give insight into subsurface ecosystem functioning and water quality evolution, essential for sustainable groundwater use and climate change-adapted management.","[Zerfass, Christian; Sanchez-Arcos, Carlos; Pohnert, Georg] Friedrich Schiller Univ, Inst Inorgan & Analyt Chem, Dept Bioorgan Analyt, Jena, Germany; [Lehmann, Robert; Totsche, Kai Uwe] Friedrich Schiller Univ, Inst Geosci, Dept Hydrogeol, Jena, Germany; [Ueberschaar, Nico] Friedrich Schiller Univ, Fac Chem & Earth Sci, Mass Spectrometry Platform, Jena, Germany; [Sanchez-Arcos, Carlos] Univ Cologne, Fac Math & Sci, Inst Zool, Cologne, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; University of Cologne,"Pohnert, G (corresponding author), Friedrich Schiller Univ, Inst Inorgan & Analyt Chem, Dept Bioorgan Analyt, Jena, Germany.",georg.pohnert@uni-jena.de,"Totsche, Kai Uwe/E-2086-2013","Totsche, Kai Uwe/0000-0002-2692-213X; Sanchez-Arcos, Carlos/0000-0001-7576-8063; Zerfass, Christian/0000-0001-8960-1926; Ueberschaar, Nico/0000-0002-4192-490X","DFG [SFB 1076, 218627073, EXC 2051, 390713860]",DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"DFG SFB 1076, project number 218627073, AquaDiva.

The first dataset was an eddy-resolving 10-km resolution product covering the North Pacific Ocean area and ranging continuously from 1981 to 2100, in which the Kuroshio current and mesoscale structures were reasonably resolved. The second dataset was a 2-km resolution product covering the regional domain surrounding Japan and comprising 10-15-year time slices, in which the coastal geometry and current structure were resolved even more realistically. An important feature of these datasets was the availability of reference datasets based on atmospheric and oceanic reanalysis data for cross-validation during the historical run period. Using these reference datasets, biases of regional surface thermal properties and the Kuroshio states during the historical run period were evaluated, which constitute important information for users of the datasets. In these downscaled datasets, the future surface thermal responses were generally consistent with those of their original data. Utilizing the high-resolution property of the downscaled data, possible future impact analyses regarding coastal phenomena such as strait throughflows, coastal sea level variability, and the Kuroshio intrusion phenomenon into bays (Kyucho phenomenon) were demonstrated and the important role of the Kuroshio state representation was indicated, which had proved difficult to analyze using the low-resolution projection data. Given these properties, the present datasets would be useful in climate change adaptation studies regarding the Japanese coastal region.","[Nishikawa, Shiro; Ishizaki, Hiroshi; Tanaka, Yusuke; Kamachi, Masafumi; Ishikawa, Yoichi] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showa Machi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Wakamatsu, Tsuyoshi] Nansen Ctr, Bergen, Norway; [Wakamatsu, Tsuyoshi] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Sakamoto, Kei; Tsujino, Hiroyuki; Yamanaka, Goro] Japan Meteorol Agcy, Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Japan Meteorological Agency; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan,"Nishikawa, S (corresponding author), Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showa Machi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan.",snishika@jamstec.go.jp,,,"Nansen Center (NERSC); Social Implementation Program on Climate Change Adaptation Technology (SI-CAT) [JPMXD0715667163]; Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU) - Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [JPMXD0717935561]","Nansen Center (NERSC); Social Implementation Program on Climate Change Adaptation Technology (SI-CAT); Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU) - Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))","TW was supported partially by the Nansen Center (NERSC) basic funding.

In this study, based on questionnaires surveys of 143 representative government officials, experts, scholars, and industry engineers from developing countries who have been engaged in climate change, the current situation and priority requirements of developing countries in terms of policies and actions, technology, financing, capacity building, and international cooperation for addressing climate change were systematically analyzed. We found that 1. Most developing countries have already taken national general actions and sectoral and industry-level actions focus on renewable or clean energy, waste management and recycling, sustainable urban transport and forestry carbon sequestration. 2. The demands for climate change mitigation are mainly concentrated in technology and capital, and the priority areas are energy and electricity and waste management; for climate change adaptation, the demands differ significantly among regions. 3. Developing countries show high preferences for emission reduction and energy-saving technology, solar energy, wind energy and bio-energy, whereas a low preference for supercritical and ultra supercritical power units, nuclear energy and tidal energy. 4. Agroforestry, energy conservation and efficiency, renewable energy and water resources are priority areas for climate change financing. 5. Building institutional capacity, improving technology R&D networks and institutions, formulation and implementation ability of planning schemes, and data statistics and verification are priority areas needed for capacity building.

Opportunities exist to increase agricultural production and improve the policy environment. However, policymakers lack local empirical evidence to provide local solutions to agricultural development in many developing countries, including Togo. This paper assesses farmers' willingness to pay for weather index-based insurance (WII) as a market option for sharing climatic risks. A choice modeling approach is used based on data collected from 704 randomly selected households in northern Togo, West Africa. Statistical analysis of the data shows that dry spells are the major concern of farmers and maize is perceived as the most affected food crop. Results also indicate that respondents are willing to participate in a WII market and would prefer insuring crops, such as maize over sorghum and rice against drought by paying on average about $14.5 per hectare. The results show that WII should not be offered standalone, but interlinked with other factors such as providing drought tolerant and high yielding varieties; loans to organized farmers' groups; and weather information through TV, radio and mobile phones in local languages, while encouraging education to enable the diffusion of more advisory services. These factors are likely to influence positively farmers' preferences in participating in a WII market. Key policy insights Very often, insurance is seen as a magic bullet in agricultural risk management policy discussions. A standalone WII could suffer from low adoption, a problem that calls for other policy options. As a climate change adaptation policy, WII could be bundled with other risk-reducing options for a better uptake and to improve farmers' welfare. WII can be an effective channel for farm credit facilities and advisory services, as well as other agricultural risk management interventions.","[Ali, Essossinam] Univ Kara, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Kara, Togo; [Egbendewe, Aklesso Y.

Cities must cope with poor air quality, heat island effects, increased flood risk and the frequency/severity of extreme events (e.g., droughts and heat waves), increasing crime and social inequity, poverty and degraded urban environments, amongst other negative consequences. Climate change adaptation and mitigation as well as sustainable management are therefore key challenges for cities in Europe and around the world. What must be developed therefore is a robust, wide evidence-base and reference framework of nature-based solutions (NBS) - measures that mimic the complex features and processes of natural ecosystems - for local/regional city authorities and other policy and decision makers to increase climate resilience and address inclusive urban regeneration in cities. In response to this need, we propose an applicative framework for NBS using the structure of the DPSIR (Driving force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response) model, in conformity with European Community standards. Indeed, under the umbrella of the EC's Framework Program - Horizon 2020 - international institutions, scientific experts and policy makers worldwide are seeking to increase collaboration with cities to enhance ecosystem services and develop the evidence-base for the economic, social and environmental benefits of nature-based solutions. They are eager to exchange knowledge and inspire positive action for nature in urban areas to meet their growing social and environmental challenges. The time has come to acknowledge NBS as the most fitting response to the numerous challenges posed by our changing climate and for the realization of sustainable and healthy cities. It is hoped that this article will pioneer others in settling the issue for NBS as the undisputable answer to challenged urban landscapes and societies globally.","[Lafortezza, Raffaele] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog, Centennial Campus,Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lafortezza, Raffaele; Sanesi, Giovanni] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, Via Amendola 165-A, I-70126 Bari, Italy",University of Hong Kong; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Lafortezza, R (corresponding author), Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, Via Amendola 165-A, I-70126 Bari, Italy.",raffaele.lafortezza@uniba.it,"Lafortezza, Raffaele/G-2104-2018","Lafortezza, Raffaele/0000-0003-4642-8435; sanesi, giovanni/0000-0002-4218-3605","European Commission's Horizon 2020 research project productive Green Infrastructure for post-industrial urban regeneration (proGlreg) [776528]; Hui OiChow Trust Fund - General Award, The University of Hong Kong","European Commission's Horizon 2020 research project productive Green Infrastructure for post-industrial urban regeneration (proGlreg); Hui OiChow Trust Fund - General Award, The University of Hong Kong","This work was carried out under the European Commission's Horizon 2020 research project productive Green Infrastructure for post-industrial urban regeneration (proGlreg) (Project ID No.: 776528) and partially supported by the Hui OiChow Trust Fund - General Award, The University of Hong Kong.",,41,63,63,51,224,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0013-9351,1096-0953,,ENVIRON RES,Environ.

Their occurrence is favoured by the formation of new glacier lakes and the destabilization of moraines and hillslopes due to climate warming. Understanding the frequency-magnitude of these processes is essential for the implementation of Disaster Risk Reduction strategies. Yet, long-term records of past GLOFs or DF in the region are almost completely missing, which renders rational hazard and risk assessments difficult. Here, we present a unique, multi-century dataset of regional GLOF-DF reconstruction for the Tien Shan based on tree ring analyses from six different torrential fans, and provide insights on regional processes activity. Based on this dataset, we also test whether GLOF-DF activity is related to glacier degradation and changes in geomorphic characteristics at the catchment scale. Results from > 430 disturbed trees growing on six different DF fans suggest frequent GLOF-DF activity since the 19th century, which is consistent with available historical records. We also observe an increase in process activity during the mid-20th century coinciding with phases of glacier stagnation or even slight glacier advances. This means GLOF-DF activity in northern Tien Shan is inversely related to moraine-glacier ratios as well as to glacier area shrinkage rates and fan characteristics (such as slope and depositional area). These findings imply that glaciological and geomorphic features could be used for regional susceptibility assessments in the future. Results presented here are the longest, annually resolved GLOF-DF series in the region, if not worldwide, and constitute a unique dataset to understand process variability. As such, they should be used for further climate change adaptation to mitigate natural hazard and risk in the region.","[Zaginaev, V.; Erokhin, S.; Meleshko, A.] Natl Acad Sci, Inst Water Problems & Hydroenergy, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; [Petrakov, D.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Geog, Moscow, Russia; [Stoffel, M.; Ballesteros-Canovas, J.

In Australia, with its long history of state-sponsored agricultural development, there is renewed interest in the agricultural development of tropical and sub-tropical northern regions. Climate projections suggest that there will be less water available to the main irrigation systems of the eastern central and southern regions of Australia, while net rainfall could be sustained or even increase in the northern areas. Hence, there could be more intensive use of northern agricultural areas, with the relocation of some production of economically important commodities such as vegetables, rice and cotton. The problem is that the expansion of cropping in northern Australia has been constrained by agronomic and economic considerations. The present paper examines the economics, at both farm and regional level, of relocating some cotton production from the east-central irrigation areas to the north where there is an existing irrigation scheme together with some industry and individual interest in such relocation. Integrated modelling and expert knowledge are used to examine this example of prospective climate change adaptation. Farm-level simulations show that without adaptation, overall gross margins will decrease under a combination of climate change and reduction in water availability. A dynamic regional Computable General Equilibrium model is used to explore two scenarios of relocating cotton production from south east Queensland, to sugar-dominated areas in northern Queensland. Overall, an increase in real economic output and real income was realized when some cotton production was relocated to sugar cane fallow land/new land. There were, however, large negative effects on regional economies where cotton production displaced sugar cane. It is concluded that even excluding the agronomic uncertainties, which are not examined here, there is unlikely to be significant market-driven relocation of cotton production.","[Mushtaq, S.; White, N.; Cockfield, G.] Univ So Queensland, Int Ctr Appl Climate Sci, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [White, N.; Power, B.] Queensland Dept Agr Fisheries & Forestry, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [Jakeman, G.] ACIL Allen Consulting, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Southern Queensland; Queensland Department of Agriculture & Fisheries,"Mushtaq, S (corresponding author), Univ So Queensland, Int Ctr Appl Climate Sci, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia.",Shahbaz.Mushtaq@usq.edu.au,"White, Neil A/C-5782-2008","White, Neil A/0000-0002-8763-975X; Cockfield, Geoff/0000-0002-0776-3313","Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF), Canberra, Australia","Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF), Canberra, Australia","This project was conducted with funding from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF), Canberra, Australia.",,37,2,2,0,72,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0021-8596,1469-5146,,J AGR SCI-CAMBRIDGE,J.

Yet despite the large number of papers considering the health impact of climate change, few have considered what public health interventions may be of most value in reducing the disease burden. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions to reduce the disease burden of high priority climate sensitive diseases. Methods and Findings: For each disease, we performed a systematic search with no restriction on date or language of publication on Medline, Web of Knowledge, Cochrane CENTRAL and SCOPUS up to December 2010 to identify systematic reviews of public health interventions. We retrieved some 3176 records of which 85 full papers were assessed and 33 included in the review. The included papers investigated the effect of public health interventions on various outcome measures. All interventions were GRADE assessed to determine the strength of evidence. In addition we developed a systematic review quality score. The interventions included environmental interventions to control vectors, chemoprophylaxis, immunization, household and community water treatment, greening cities and community advice. For most reviews, GRADE showed low quality of evidence because of poor study design and high heterogeneity. Also for some key areas such as floods, droughts and other weather extremes, there are no adequate systematic reviews of potential public health interventions. Conclusion: In conclusion, we found the evidence base to be mostly weak for environmental interventions that could have the most value in a warmer world. Nevertheless, such interventions should not be dismissed. Future research on public health interventions for climate change adaptation needs to be concerned about quality in study design and should address the gap for floods, droughts and other extreme weather events that pose a risk to health.","[Bouzid, Maha; Hooper, Lee; Hunter, Paul R.] Univ E Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Hunter, PR (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",paul.hunter@uea.ac.uk,"Hooper, Lee/D-2795-2009; Hunter, Paul/A-7172-2008; Hunter, Paul/N-9021-2019","Hooper, Lee/0000-0002-7904-3331; Hunter, Paul/0000-0002-5608-6144; Hunter, Paul/0000-0002-5608-6144",European Union under the RESPONSES project,European Union under the RESPONSES project,"This study was funded by the European Union under the RESPONSES project.

The condition of urban greenery was analysed and described, with a special emphasis on the untapped potential of green areas on housing estates. Using examples from abroad, cases of successful revitalisation of urban greenery areas on housing estates are given, and the main problems faced by the selected region were assessed. Apart from the above-mentioned main aim, there was the intention to discover new trends for using greenery in the urban environment, to compare past and present conditions, or to present new options and possibilities for designing greenery. A proposal to set up a new system of private and semi-public green areas is viewed as a possible promising result.

Planned relocation has been attempted in many communities globally and has raised serious issues of equity in some cases. Implementation driven by principles of equity is crucial in ensuring successful planned relocations that decrease loss and damage. In this Policy Analysis, we put forth a framework for equitable planned relocation rooted in theories of justice as a basis for implementation. The framework centers around three principles: comprehensive recognition of affected stakeholders in decision-making, consideration of socio-cultural risk factors relevant to relocation, and evaluation of multiple measures of well-being. There are many actors involved in planned relocation. Unique features and abilities of international organizations lend themselves to promoting equitable planned relocation in partnership with other stakeholders. Through the exploration of case studies, we identify best practices that international organizations have available to influence the design, implementation, and evaluation of planned relocation processes. These practices are relevant when striving for equity for all affected individuals and communities. Points of intervention include agenda-setting and advocacy, funding and implementation standards, and facilitation of international cooperation. International organizations also face barriers to supporting equitable planned relocation. Limitations include lack of enforcement mechanisms, limited resources, and fundamental dependence on existing governance structures and global collaboration.

It is still unknown how irrigation water needs will change in a warmer planet and where freshwater will be locally available to expand irrigation without depleting freshwater resources. Here, we identify the rain-fed cropping systems that hold the greatest potential for investment in irrigation expansion because water will likely be available to suffice irrigation water demand. Using projections of renewable water availability and irrigation water demand under warming scenarios, we identify target regions where irrigation expansion may sustain crop production under climate change. Our results also show that global rain-fed croplands hold significant potential for sustainable irrigation expansion and that different irrigation strategies have different irrigation expansion potentials. Under a 3 degrees C warming, we find that a soft-path irrigation expansion with small monthly water storage and deficit irrigation has the potential to expand irrigated land by 70 million hectares and feed 300 million more people globally. We also find that a hard-path irrigation expansion with large annual water storage can sustainably expand irrigation up to 350 million hectares, while producing food for 1.4 billion more people globally. By identifying where irrigation can be expanded under a warmer climate, this work may serve as a starting point for investigating socioeconomic factors of irrigation expansion and may guide future research and resources toward those agricultural communities and water management institutions that will most need to adapt to climate change.","[Rosa, Lorenzo; Beltran-Pena, Areidy Aracely; D'Odorico, Paolo; Fung, Inez] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chiarelli, Davide Danilo; Rulli, Maria Cristina] Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Sangiorgio, Matteo] Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Fung, Inez] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rosa, Lorenzo] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Energy & Proc Engn, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Polytechnic University of Milan; Polytechnic University of Milan; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Rosa, L; Fung, I (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Fung, I (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Rosa, L (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Energy & Proc Engn, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",lorenzo_rosa@berkeley.edu; ifung@berkeley.edu,"Sangiorgio, Matteo/J-1184-2019","Sangiorgio, Matteo/0000-0003-1624-6809; Rosa, Lorenzo/0000-0002-1280-9945; Chiarelli, Davide Danilo/0000-0002-4707-3018; Beltran-Pena, Areidy/0000-0001-9448-1156; Rulli, Maria Cristina/0000-0002-9694-4262",AGU Horton Hydrology Research Grant; ENI Enrico Mattei Foundation; Cariplo Foundation SUSFEED Project [0887 CUP D44I19001030007]; NSF InFEWS Fellowship [DGE-1633740]; USDA Hatch Multistate Project [W4190],AGU Horton Hydrology Research Grant; ENI Enrico Mattei Foundation; Cariplo Foundation SUSFEED Project(Fondazione Cariplo); NSF InFEWS Fellowship; USDA Hatch Multistate Project,L.R. was supported by the AGU Horton Hydrology Research Grant.

However, African farmers are the most sensitive in respect of climate variability and change. Climate change impacted negatively on crop production and the livelihoods of the local farmers. In black township South Africa, agricultural activities are highly dominated by small-scale farmers, whose farming system is highly vulnerable to changes in climate. This paper presents the analysis of how small-scale farmers employed adaptation strategies in response to climate change and determinants of small-scale households' choices of coping and adaptation approach to climate variability and change in Vhembe District, South Africa. Multi nominal logit model was used on a surveyed of 224 local farmers. Farmers' socio-economic attributes, was used in response to climate changes and further, households have adaptation strategies both on-farm and off-farm approach. Such approaches were; drought-tolerant seeds, shorter cycle crops, diversification of crops, changing planting dates, small-scale irrigation, migrating to urban areas and involvement in petty business. The results of the findings reveals that the significant drivers affecting choice of adaptation approach include climate information, gender, farm size, education level, farmer experience, decreasing rainfall and increases in temperature as farmers' determinant choices of adaptation to climate change. While, on the other hand, off-farm resources, headed households and age had no significant impact on the choice of coping and adaptation approach to climate change. Therefore, policy makers in the local municipality should play a significant role by enhancing adaptation strategies appropriate for particular climatic shock on the study area.","[Kom, Zongho; Nethengwe, N.

Human behavior can mitigate the impacts of climate change. The present study aimed to evaluate rural people's readiness for sustainable management of water resources. To achieve this goal, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Health Belief Model (HBM) were used as the research framework. The research instrument was a closed-end questionnaire developed on the basis of TPB and HBM. The face and content validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by a panel of experts in sustainable agriculture. Its reliability was also checked in a pilot study by calculating Cronbach's alpha, the average variance extracted (AVE), R-2, and composite reliability (CR). The research sample was composed of 480 villagers from Hamadan province, Iran, who were familiar with sustainable water resources management in the context of the rooftop rainwater harvesting project. The results showed that in TPB, the variables of moral norms, attitude, and self-identity could account for 61 percent of the variance in rural people's intention to adopt the practices of sustainable water resources management. Based on HBM, the variables of perceived benefits, perceived susceptibility, and perceived severity could capture 49 percent of this variance. The results revealed that both theories had the potential to predict rural people's intention to engage in the sustainable management of water resources, but TPB proved to provide a more robust prediction than HBM.","[Aliabadi, Vahid] Bu Ali Sina Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Hamadan, Hamadan, Iran; [Gholamrezai, Saeed] Lorestan Univ, Fac Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Rural Dev, Khorramabad, Iran; [Ataei, Pouria] Tarbiat Modares Univ TMU, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Tehran, Iran",Bu Ali Sina University; Lorestan University; Tarbiat Modares University,"Gholamrezai, S (corresponding author), Lorestan Univ, Fac Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Rural Dev, Khorramabad, Iran.",gholamrezai.s@lu.ac.ir,"Ataei, Pouria/I-8517-2019",,,,,,95,19,19,3,15,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",1606-9749,1607-0798,,WATER SUPPLY,Water Supply,AUG,2020,20,5,,,,,1847,1861,,10.2166/ws.2020.094,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2020.094,,,15,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,QF8JX,,Bronze,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000617137800022,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although a sine qua non of successful mangrove rehabilitation or restoration projects is accurate attention to local hydrology and basic biology of mangrove trees and their associated fauna, their long-term success depends on far more axes, each with their own challenges. Rehabilitation projects: are planned, designed, executed, and managed by people with diverse backgrounds and different scientific and socio-political agendas; need to be responsive to these multiple stakeholders and agents who hold different values; are often influenced by laws and treaties spanning local to international scales; and must be able to adapt and evolve both geomorphologically and socioeconomically over decades-to-centuries in the context of a rapidly changing climate. We view these challenges as opportunities for innovative approaches to rehabilitation and restoration that engage new and larger constituencies. Restored mangrove ecosystems can be deliberately designed and engineered to provide valuable ecosystem services, be adaptable to climatic changes, and to develop platforms for educating nonspecialists about both the successes and failures of restored mangrove ecosystems. When mangrove rehabilitation or restoration projects are developed as experiments, they can be used as case-studies and more general models to inform policy- and decision-makers and guide future restoration efforts. Achieving this vision will require new investment and dedication to research and adaptive management practices. These ideas are illustrated with examples from mangrove restoration and rehabilitation projects in the Indo-West Pacific and Caribbean regions, the two hotspots of mangrove biodiversity and its ongoing loss and degradation.","[Ellison, Aaron M.] Harvard Univ, Harvard Forest, Petersham, MA 01366 USA; [Felson, Alexander J.] Univ Connecticut, Connecticut Inst Resilience & Climate Adaptat, Groton, CT USA; [Felson, Alexander J.] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Friess, Daniel A.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore, Singapore",Harvard University; University of Connecticut; University of Melbourne; National University of Singapore,"Ellison, AM (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Harvard Forest, Petersham, MA 01366 USA.",aellison@fas.harvard.edu,"Friess, Dan/G-2056-2011; Friess, Daniel/HJY-2143-2023","Friess, Daniel/0000-0002-3087-5233",Harvard Forest; Yale University,Harvard Forest; Yale University,AE's contribution to this work has been supported by the Harvard Forest.

Implementing Recommended Management Practices (RMPs) may increase SOC stocks, contributing to achieve the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 21(st) Conference of the Parties agreements reached in Paris, France. In this framework, the 4 per 1000 initiative invites partners implementing practical actions to reach a SOC stock annual growth of 4 parts per thousand. For the first time, we assessed the achievement of 4 parts per thousand objective in Mediterranean agricultural soils, aiming at (i) analyzing a representative data collection assessing edaphoclimatic variables and SOC stocks from field experiments under different managements in arable and woody crops, (ii) providing evidence on SOC storage potential, (iii) identifying the biophysical and management variables associated with SOC storage, and (iv) recommending a set of mitigation strategies for global change. Average storage rates amounted to 15 and 80Mg Cha(-1)year(-1)x1000 in arable and woody crops, respectively. Results show that application of organic amendments led to significantly higher SOC storage rates than conventional management, with average values about 1.5 times higher in woody than in arable crops (93 vs. 63Mg Cha(-1)year(-1)x1000). Results were influenced by the initial SOC content, experiment duration, soil texture, and climate regime. The relatively lower levels of SOC in Mediterranean soils, and the high surface covered by woody crops, may reflect the high potential of these regions to achieving significant increases in SOC storage at the global scale.","[Francaviglia, Rosa; Di Bene, Claudia; Farina, Roberta] Council Agr Res & Econ, Res Ctr Agr & Environm CREA AA, Via Navicella 4, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Salvati, Luca] Council Agr Res & Econ, Res Ctr Forestry & Wood CREA FL, Viale S Margherita 80, I-52100 Arezzo, Italy; [Vicente-Vicente, Jose Luis] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15,EUREF Campus 19, D-10829 Berlin, Germany",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Francaviglia, R (corresponding author), Council Agr Res & Econ, Res Ctr Agr & Environm CREA AA, Via Navicella 4, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",rosa.francaviglia@crea.gov.it,"Salvati, Luca/AAS-6179-2021; Di Bene, Claudia/B-4530-2011; Francaviglia, Rosa/J-7466-2012","Di Bene, Claudia/0000-0002-3830-251X; FARINA, ROBERTA/0000-0003-4378-0484; Vicente Vicente, Jose Luis/0000-0003-3554-9354; Francaviglia, Rosa/0000-0002-4362-5428",,,,,143,30,30,2,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

The timing of these cultural changes was variably influenced by local developments, interaction with other regions of Mesoamerica, and climate change. We present a high-resolution radiocarbon chronology for the growth of the early polity of Cahal Pech, Belize, one of the first permanent settlements in the southern Maya lowlands. We compare our results to a database containing over 1190 radiocarbon dates from cultural contexts reported from five major regions of the southern lowlands to interpret the expansion and decline of emerging complex social groups during the Preclassic. Comparisons to paleoclimate proxy datasets suggest that fluctuating climate regimes may have promoted alternating integration and fragmentation of early hierarchically organized societies. Stable climatic conditions during the Middle Preclassic (1000/900-300 cal BCE) fostered the centralization of populations and the formation of large regional polities across the southern lowlands. An extended drought at the end of the Late Preclassic (cal 150-300 CE) likely contributed to the decline of some major polities in the central Peten, but smaller sites located in productive environments were more resilient and persisted in to the Classic period. This research provides a framework for understanding the complex social and environmental factors that influenced localized adaptations to climate change and the episodic growth and decline of early complex societies in prehistory.

It aims to achieve impact at scale by combining modern ICTs with knowledge management skills and the ability to bridge the gap between research and the practical application of scientific knowledge. The global Plantwise program, led by CABI, aims to reduce crop losses by focusing on improving plant health information services throughout the developing world, where up to 80% of the world's food is produced. Its aim is to lose less and feed more by providing appropriate, authoritative, and practical information to farmers through a network of face-to-face plant clinics, backed up by a vast Knowledge Bank of factsheets, distribution maps, images, and pest management toolkits.

We investigated this possibility for the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia between 1970 and 2007, analyzing data on suicides with a previously established climatic drought index. Using a generalized additive model that controlled for season, region, and long-term suicide trends, we found an increased relative risk of suicide of 15% (95% confidence interval, 8%-22%) for rural males aged 30-49 y when the drought index rose from the first quartile to the third quartile. In contrast, the risk of suicide for rural females aged >30 y declined with increased values of the drought index. We also observed an increased risk of suicide in spring and early summer. In addition there was a smaller association during unusually warm months at any time of year. The spring suicide increase is well documented in nontropical locations, although its cause is unknown. The possible increased risk of suicide during drought in rural Australia warrants public health focus and concern, as does the annual, predictable increase seen each spring and early summer. Suicide is a complex phenomenon with many interacting social, environmental, and biological causal factors. The relationship between drought and suicide is best understood using a holistic framework. Climate change projections suggest increased frequency and severity of droughts in NSW, accompanied and exacerbated by rising temperatures. Elucidating the relationships between drought and mental health will help facilitate adaptation to climate change.","[Hanigan, Ivan C.; Butler, Colin D.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Populat Hlth, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Hanigan, Ivan C.] CSIRO, Climate Adaptat Flagship, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia; [Kokic, Philip N.] CSIRO, Math Informat & Stat, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Hutchinson, Michael F.] Australian Natl Univ, Coll Med Biol & Environm, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Australian National University,"Hanigan, IC (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Populat Hlth, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",ivan.hanigan@anu.edu.au,"Butler, Colin D./H-2267-2019","Butler, Colin D./0000-0002-2942-5294; Hanigan, Ivan/0000-0002-6360-6793; Hutchinson, Michael/0000-0001-8205-6689",,,,,33,127,129,1,48,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

For this reason, the EU has the ambitious goal of protecting at least 30% of land by 2030. Member states are called to improve and expand the network of protected areas within the next few years; to do so, scientific studies aimed at identifying areas with high ecological value, as well as at defining best management practices, are highly needed. In this study, we used the InVEST suite of models to spatially assess three regulating ecosystem services, that is, carbon storage, seasonal water yield, and urban flood risk mitigation in three administrative regions of central Italy. Using overlay analysis, we found areas with the highest delivery in each of the considered ESs; based on these findings, we eventually proposed four new protected areas, which combine for 888 km(2), that is, 2.73% of the study area. Interestingly, each of the newly proposed protected areas has somehow been discussed and hypothesized by stakeholders, but only one is presumably going to be part of the national network of protected areas within the next years. Hopefully, by prioritizing areas according to the production of ecosystem services, this study can be intended as a step towards the systematic inclusion of ecosystem services studies for enhancing the network of areas under national protection schemes and achieving the goal of protecting at least 30% of land in Europe by 2030.","[Sebastiani, Alessandro] Council Agr Res & Econ CREA, Res Ctr Forestry & Wood FL, I-00166 Rome, Italy; [Fares, Silvano] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst BioEcon, Via Taurini 19, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Fares, Silvano] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Agr & Forestry Syst Mediterranean, Ple Enr Fermi 1-Loc, I-80055 Portici, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per la BioEconomia (IBE-CNR); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per i Sistemi Agricoli e Forestali del Mediterraneo (ISAFoM-CNR),"Sebastiani, A (corresponding author), Council Agr Res & Econ CREA, Res Ctr Forestry & Wood FL, I-00166 Rome, Italy.",alessandro.sebastiani@crea.gov.it,"SEBASTIANI, Alessandro/AAC-1725-2021","SEBASTIANI, Alessandro/0000-0003-4877-3769",Regione Lazio [36388],Regione Lazio(Regione Lazio),Regione Lazio: project n. 36388 TECNOVERDE: Tecnologie geomatiche e ambientali di precisione per il monitoraggio e la valorizzazione dei servizi ecosistemici delle infra-strutture verdi urbane e peri-urbane; 2021 @CNR project BIOCITY Riforestazione urbana: nuovi strumenti conoscitivi e di supporto decisionale; PRIN2020-MULTIFORMulti-scale observations to predict Forest response to pollution and climate change; CIR01_00019-PRO-ICOS_MED Potenziamento della Rete di Osservazione ICOS-Italia nel Mediterraneo-Rafforzamento del capitale umano funded by the Ministry of Research.,,63,0,0,7,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,JAN,2023,14,1,,,,,,,145,10.3390/f14010145,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f14010145,,,12,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,8C5TB,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000917669600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on face-to-face interview data from 427 randomly selected pastoral households of the Hulun Buir grassland in northern China, this study investigated perceptions and impacts of historical climate change and the associations of these perceptions with observed climate change. Meanwhile, we identified pastoralists' responses to climate change, as well as barriers to the adaptation process. We used binary logistic regression models to determine the factors that influence climate change adaptation strategies. The results show that pastoralists' perception of the inter-annual variability in climate variables is relatively consistent with the observed meteorological data. Pastoralists' adaptive strategies for climate variability comprise primarily livestock and pasture management interventions, such as purchasing fodder, reducing livestock, part-time grazing, and renting pasture. In addition, pastoralists identified several barriers that are allied with adaptation practices, such as limited grassland tenure, an absence of credit, and limited access to agricultural markets. Furthermore, the sex, age, and education level of the head of household and the household livelihood capital and location were found to be the key factors determining the choice of adaptation strategies. This knowledge helps to assess the needs for action and information and to improve the credibility of policies that shape collective actions based on a unified plan or goal. Combined, these efforts aid in adaptation to reduce the vulnerability of the livestock sector, especially the livelihood security of smallholder pastoralists in grassland ecosystems.","[Zhang, Qin; Cui, Fengqi; Dai, Luwei; Feng, Bing; Lu, Yunjing; Tang, Haiping] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Tang, HP (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangqinbz@163.com; zhcuifengqi@163.com; 1006511161@qq.com; 1094955094@qq.com; 782184995@qq.com; tanghp@bnu.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Qin/0000-0001-6568-7286",National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC0500608-3]; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology [2017-KF-20],National Key R&D Program of China; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology,"The study was jointly funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFC0500608-3) and the State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology (Grant No. 2017-KF-20).

Therefore, is it important to quantify projected changes and associated uncertainty, and understand model processes responsible. This paper addresses these challenges for southern Africa and the adjacent Indian Ocean focusing on the local wet season. Precipitation projections for the end of the twenty-first century indicate a pronounced dipole pattern in the CMIP5 multimodel mean. The dipole indicates future wetting (drying) to the north (south) of the climatological axis of maximum rainfall, implying a northward shift of the ITCZ and south Indian Ocean convergence zone that is not consistent with a simple wet get wetter pattern. This pattern is most pronounced in early austral summer, suggesting a later and shorter wet season over much of southern Africa. Using a decomposition method we determine physical mechanisms underlying this dipole pattern of projected change, and the associated intermodel uncertainty. The projected dipole pattern is largely associated with the dynamical component of change indicative of shifts in the location of convection. Over the Indian Ocean, this apparent northward shift in the ITCZ may reflect the response to changes in the north-south SST gradient over the Indian Ocean, consistent with a warmest get wetter mechanism. Over land subtropical drying is relatively robust, particularly in the early wet season. This has contributions from dynamical shifts in the location of convection, which may be related to regional SST structures in the southern Indian Ocean, and the thermodynamic decline in relative humidity. Implications for understanding and potentially constraining uncertainty in projections are discussed.","[Lazenby, Melissa J.; Todd, Martin C.; Wang, Yi] Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Chadwick, Robin] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Sussex; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Lazenby, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",m.lazenby@sussex.ac.uk,"Wang, Yi/F-2689-2011","Wang, Yi/0000-0002-3984-3879","Peter Carpenter Scholarship for African Climate Change at the University of Sussex; Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) regional consortium project UMFULA - NERC [NE/M020258/1]; Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) regional consortium project UMFULA - U.K. government's Department for International Development (DfID); NERC [NE/M008592/1, NE/M008932/1, NE/M008576/1, NE/M008207/1, NE/M008347/1, NE/M020258/1, NE/L001780/1, NE/R014272/1, NE/M008266/1, NE/M008584/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Peter Carpenter Scholarship for African Climate Change at the University of Sussex; Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) regional consortium project UMFULA - NERC; Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) regional consortium project UMFULA - U.K. government's Department for International Development (DfID); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work was supported financially by the Peter Carpenter Scholarship for African Climate Change at the University of Sussex and the Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) regional consortium project UMFULA funded by NERC (Grant NE/M020258/1) and the U.K. government's Department for International Development (DfID).

Despite the potential benefits of cropping systems diversity, few farmers in the US Corn Belt use diverse rotations. This study examines factors that may influence farmers' decisions to use more diversified crop rotations in the US Corn Belt through a parallel convergent mixed methods approach, using a multi-level analysis of Corn Belt farmer survey data (n = 4,778) and in-depth interviews (n = 159). Analyses were conducted to answer questions regarding what factors influence farmers' use of extended crop rotations in intensive corn-based cropping systems and to explore whether farmers in the Corn Belt might use extended crop rotations in response to climatic changes. Findings suggest that path dependency associated with the intensive corn-based cropping system in the region limits farmers' ability to integrate more diverse crop rotations. However, farmers in more diversified watersheds, those who farm marginal land, and those with livestock are more likely to use extended rotations. Additionally, farmers who currently use more diverse rotations are also more likely to plan to use crop rotations as a climate change adaptation strategy. If more diverse cropping systems are desired to reduce climate risks, in addition to reducing the negative impacts associated with industrial agricultural production, then further efforts must be made to facilitate more diverse crop rotations in the U.S. Corn Belt. This may be achieved by adjusting policy and economic incentives that presently discourage cropping system diversity in the region.","[Roesch-McNally, Gabrielle E.] US Forest Serv, Northwest Reg Climate Hub, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Arbuckle, J.

In this paper, the combination of elasticity method and Budyko framework was applied with the meteorological and hydrological data from 1980 to 2014. The variability and variation of streamflow were explained by individual elasticity coefficient and contribution of climate change and ecological restoration between 1980-1999 and 2000-2014. Results showed that streamflow was more sensitive to climate change in the Yellow River source (YER) than in the Yangtze River source (YZR). Ecological restoration was positively correlated with the variability of streamflow in YER with 7.38% relative change in elasticity coefficients, while it was opposite trend in YZR with a relative change of - 7.41%. However, the impacts of climate change and ecological restoration on the variation of streamflow were not consistent with the variability. In YER, ecological restoration dominated the streamflow reduction with a contribution of 82.43%, whereas, in YZR, climate change mainly contributed to the streamflow increase which could explain 123.72% and the precipitation was the major contributor. By analysis, the difference in two catchments might result from the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation conditions and land use/cover change, especially the conversion of grassland. The results suggest that the implementation of ecological recovery should consider the difference of streamflow change in response to ecological restoration and climate change for the sustainability of water resources.","[Feng, Aiqing] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Li, Yanzhong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Hydrometeorol, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Gao, Jiangbo; Wu, Shaohong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Feng, Aixia] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Meteorol Informat Ctr, Data Serv Off, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","China Meteorological Administration; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; China Meteorological Administration","Li, YZ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Hydrometeorol, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Gao, JB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",liyz_egi@163.com; gaojiangbo@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41671098, 4177508, 41701019]; Clean Development Mechanism Funding Projects of China [2013034]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Clean Development Mechanism Funding Projects of China,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41671098, 41775081, 41701019) and the Clean Development Mechanism Funding Projects of China (Grant No. 2013034).

In this study, the changes in the surface energy and their contributions from global climate change and/or land-cover change over eastern China during the past nearly 30 years were investigated and assessed using a process-based land surface model [ the Ecosystem-Atmosphere Simulation Scheme (EASS)]. The modeled results show that climate change contributed more to the changes of land surface energy fluxes than land-cover change, with their contribution ratio reaching 4:1 or even higher. Annual average temperature increased before 2000 and reversed thereafter; annual total precipitation continually decreased, and incident solar radiation continually increased over the past nearly 30 years. These climatic changes could lead to increased NR, H, and LE, assuming land cover remained unchanged during the past nearly 30 years. Among these meteorological variables, at spatial distribution, the incident solar radiation has the greatest effect on land surface energy exchange. The impacts of land-cover change on the seasonal variations in land surface heat fluxes between the four periods were large, especially for H. The changes in the regional energy fluxes resulting from different land-cover type conversions varied greatly. The conversion from farmland to evergreen coniferous forests had the greatest influence on land surface energy exchange, leading to a decrease in H by 19.39% and an increase in LE and NR by 7.44% and 2.74%, respectively. The results of this study can provide a basis and reference for climate change adaptation.","[Yan, J. W.; Liu, J. Y.; Chen, B. Z.; Fang, S.

Neoliberalism, or the global institutionalization of laissez-faire economics, has helped to generalize individual and community vulnerability to climate-induced changes and decrease resilience by increasing poverty and thereby limiting options; the global majority face increasingly contingent employment and downward pressure on wages while global economic competition deprives smallholders of their assets. States compete to attract mobile capital by deregulating private activity such as logging and real estate development, increasing climate-related risks to individuals and communities. At the same time, neoliberal limits on the state have inhibited states' ability to fund and coordinate a range of necessary climate adaptations. Finally, neoliberalism undermines social cohesion and thereby limits the potential of civil society to substitute for the diminished state.

Climate change scholars have argued that rural dwellers, particularly smallholder farmers who engage in food crops production, suffer the most due to their low capacity to adapt. A growing body of knowledge also suggests that local practices serve as safeguards, that enable smallholder farmers to lessen their vulnerability in food crops production. However, limited scholarly insight has been advanced about sustainable food production via the use of local practices. Through the mixed research approach, the study contributes to local practices and climate adaptation debates by examining the various local practices of smallholder farmers, the challenges they encounter with the use of such practices and the possibility for sustainable food crops production in the future in Ghana. The findings suggest that smallholders encounter multiple drawbacks in attempt to utilize local practices to adapt food crops production to climate change including the advent of modern farming inputs/practices. Even when multiple local practices (the planting of multiple crops' varieties, switching between crops and livestock rearing, reducing cultivatable land size) are utilized, only the increment in farm size, the use of income/ remittances of rural-urban migrants to support food crops production, and early cultivation offered some possibilities of sustaining improvement in food crops production for the future. Therefore, the study concluded that local practices are not necessarily panaceas for sustaining food crops production under climate change. The study recommended that further studies pay attention to the sustainability of local practices under climate change.","[Dambeebo, Daniel] Univ Stuttgart, Fac Civil & Environm Engn 2, Masters Program Infrastruct Planning, Allmandring 6, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Dakyaga, Francis] SD Dombo Univ Business & Integrated Dev Studies, Dept Local Governance & City Management, Bamahu Wa Box WA64, Wa, Upper West Regi, Ghana; [Dakyaga, Francis] Tech Univ Dortmund, Fac Spatial Planning, August Schmidt Str 10, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany; [Dakyaga, Francis] Ardhi Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, POB 35176, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Derbile, Emmanuel K.] SD Dombo Univ Business & Integrated Dev Studies, Fac Planning & Land Management, Dept Planning, Bamahu Wa Box WA64, Wa, Upper West Regi, Ghana",University of Stuttgart; Dortmund University of Technology,"Dambeebo, D (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Fac Civil & Environm Engn 2, Masters Program Infrastruct Planning, Allmandring 6, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",ddambeebo@gmail.com; dakyaga@ubids.edu.gh; derbile_uds@hotmail.com,,,Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,64,0,0,0,0,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2662-9984,,DISCOV SUSTAIN,Discov.

The study then analyses the preferences for and perceptions of adaptation strategies of downhill ski operators in terms of the adaptation measures they can implement or are willing to take. The findings indicate that climatic conditions set preconditions for the operation of the ski areas, but short-term operational prospects and inter-annual variability in weather conditions rather than foreseen changes in climatic conditions guide the operational decisions of the ski area operators. A key adaptation strategy to respond to uncertain snow conditions is artificial snowmaking, which lowers the vulnerability of the areas to the impacts of climate change too.","[Haanpaa, Simo; Juhola, Sirkku; Landauer, Mia] Aalto Univ, Dept Real Estate Planning & Geoinformat, Espoo, Finland; [Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, Helsinki, Finland",Aalto University; University of Helsinki,"Haanpaa, S (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Dept Real Estate Planning & Geoinformat, Espoo, Finland.",simo.haanpaa@aalto.fi,"Juhola, Sirkku/GVS-5485-2022","Juhola, Sirkku/0000-0003-0095-2282; Landauer, Mia/0000-0002-7153-8495",Academy of Finland,Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),"Data utilised in the study was collected during the MAVERIC-project (Map-based assessment of vulnerability to climate change employing regional indicators), funded by the Academy of Finland in 2009-2012 and coordinated by the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE).",,23,19,19,1,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1368-3500,1747-7603,,CURR ISSUES TOUR,Curr.

For cash crops like Vietnamese coffee, this is even more relevant, since the country experiences climate change impacts, with direct implications for the well-being of smallholder farmers. Understanding the factors that influence farmers' decision to adopt SAP can unravel useful recommendations for decision-makers. In this paper we explore the factors that influence farmers' intention to adopt SAP for coffee farming using data from 93 interviews in Ban Me Thuot, Vietnam. The decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior was the theoretical framing of our work, with the extension that included climate change perception and farmers' past behavior. We employed the grounded theory approach for data collection and structuring to reveal variables pertaining to sustainable agriculture adoption. We used Structural equation modeling to test the relations among behavioral determinants (attitude, social norms, perceived behavioral control, and past behavior) that lead to intention to adopt sustainable agriculture. The results showed that farmers' intention to adopt sustainable agricultural practices is influenced by their perception of social pressure and their abilities to perform sustainable agriculture. Farmers' climate change perception also significantly influenced their behavioral determinants. A significant finding was that social trust covaries with financial control. We highlight the need for raising climate perception and awareness to promote the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices while building trust in both the scientific information received by local farmers but also their social circle.

Nonetheless, climate change is expected to affect the future productivity of hydropower by influencing the hydrologic cycle and different climate variables in the region. Although reactive plans to minimize climate change impacts on hydropower production have been implemented in the developed world, the developing world can still benefit from proactive actions. Studies of climate change impacts before and during implementation of hydropower projects can result in timely responses and adaptation to climate change with a potential of considerable cost savings. This study investigates the potential impacts of climate change on the hydropower systems in the Karkheh River Basin-the third largest river basin in Iran-in terms of potential for hydroelectricity generation. A simulation model is developed to examine how hydropower generation levels vary for different future climate change scenarios in this representative Middle Eastern basin. The obtained results suggest that the existing operation rules and design specifications, developed based on the historical climatic conditions, can lead to inefficient operations of the hydropower in the basin. Because of insignificant stream-flow reductions in the short term, hydropower production may not change considerably in the near future. However, a serious hydropower generation deficit is expected in the midterm and long-term horizons in the Karkheh River Basin. Therefore, adaptation to the future climate change conditions and revision of the operation rule curves and design specifications are essential to optimal hydropower operations in this basin.

The results show that when the rainfall changes due to climate change, the flow rate tends to decrease at high tide and increase at low tide. When the sea level rises due to climate change, the flow rate tends to increase at high tide and decrease at low tide. For 2030, the flow will decrease up to 15.6% and 14.3% at the low tide period for RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 compared to the present, respectively. The flow will increase up to 63.5% and 58.9% at the high tide period for RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 compared to the present, respectively. The water demand evaluation shows that the water resource reserve in Can Tho city meets water demands in current and future scenarios under climate change. While rainwater and groundwater can provide enough water in the rainy season, the city has to use surface water during the dry season due to a lack of rainwater. Of these, agriculture contributes the most water demands (85%).

As rising temperatures continue to reduce the suitability of many historical coffee-growing regions, some farmers are practicing regenerative, organic coffee farming as a means of climate change mitigation. In the Central Highlands, the primary coffee growing region of Vietnam, conventional sun-grown, monocrop coffee requires intensive inputs, including fertilizers, pesticides and water. However, some farmers are converting their conventional sun farms to organic shade farms utilizing regenerative farming techniques for both environmental and economic reasons. This study examined regenerative farming practices and sustainable coffee in a small ethnic minority village in Lam D`ong province. The comparative analysis between soil samples taken from a regenerative shade-grown coffee farm and two conventional sun-grown coffee farms revealed that the soil of the regenerative farm, enriched with organic manure, is comparable to, or healthier than, the soil on the conventional farms enriched with chemical fertilizers. The results indicate that regenerative farming practices promote biodiversity; however, they also maintain microclimates that promote the growth of Roya fungus, which can decrease coffee yields. The economic analysis of farm costs and net returns found that regenerative farming practices decrease external inputs through a system of crop diversification and integrated livestock production that improves productivity and economic performance while preserving the ecological and environmental integrity of the landscape. Regenerative agriculture is an important step toward climate change adaptation and mitigation; however, in order for the farm communities in the Central Highlands to make the transition to regenerative agriculture, the success factors and benefits of this method must be demonstrated to the coffee farmers.","[Le, Quan Vu] Fulbright Univ Vietnam, Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiat YSEALI Acad, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Cowal, Sanya] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Social Sci Div, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Jovanovic, Grace] Seattle Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Environm Studies, Seattle, WA 98122 USA; [Le, Don-Thuan] Seattle Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Dept Comp Sci, Seattle, WA 98122 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Seattle University; Seattle University,"Le, QV (corresponding author), Fulbright Univ Vietnam, Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiat YSEALI Acad, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",quan.le@fulbright.edu.vn,,"Cowal, Sanya/0000-0003-0186-0734",,,,,54,1,1,11,34,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

Previous flood risk assessments can barely take into account future changes of fine-scale hydroclimatic characteristics and hardly quantify multivariate interactions among flood variables, thereby resulting in an unreliable assessment of flood risk. In this study, for the first time, we develop probabilistic projections of multidimensional river flood risks at a convection-permitting scale through the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) climate simulations with 4-km horizontal grid spacing. Vine copula has been widely used to assess the multidimensional dependence structure of hydroclimate variables, but the commonly used frequentist approach may fail to identify the correct vine model and to obtain the uncertainty interval. Thus, a Bayesian vine copula approach is proposed to explicitly address the multidimensional dependence of flood characteristics (i.e., flood peak, volume, and duration) and underlying uncertainties. The proposed approach enables a robust assessment of return periods of future floods for Guadalupe and Mission river basins located in South Texas of the United States. Our findings reveal that the South Texas region is projected to experience more flood events with longer duration and greater discharge volume. The flood peak, however, will not necessarily increase even though precipitation extremes are expected to become more frequent. The projected flood return periods over the Guadalupe river basin do not show an obvious increase while the Mission river basin is projected to face a dramatic increase in flood risk with exposed to 100-year and even severer floods nearly every 2 years, on average, when considering the combined effects of flood peak, volume, and duration.","[Zhang, B.; Wang, S.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, S.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Wang, Y.] SUNY Coll Oswego, Dept Atmospher & Geol Sci, Oswego, NY 13126 USA",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) - Oswego,"Wang, S (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Wang, S (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",shuo.s.wang@polyu.edu.hk,"Wang, Shuo/I-3017-2013; Zhang, Boen/GPK-7523-2022","Wang, Shuo/0000-0001-7827-187X; Zhang, Boen/0000-0002-4633-3033",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51809223]; Hong Kong Research Grants Council Early Career Scheme [PP5Z],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hong Kong Research Grants Council Early Career Scheme,"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51809223) and the Hong Kong Research Grants Council Early Career Scheme (Grant PP5Z).

In this opinion piece we give a concise overview of the most recent developments in measuring key indicators and metrics for the three pillars of CSA (food security, adaptation, and mitigation) and give our opinion on how we think this would allow for improvements in the current state of assessing CSA in a smallholder farming context. Our assessment shows that all tools reviewed here have a biophysical lens while looking at productivity, and largely ignore potential social (e.g., food security, gender) and economic (poverty) aspects of the sustainability of intensified production. Mitigation was also analyzed in all approaches but few tools go beyond greenhouse gas emissions to analyse environmental sustainability (for example water quality, soil health, ecosystem services) more generically. Climate change adaptation was the CSA pillar with the weakest representation within the approaches reviewed here. Based on an overview of recent advantages in work focusing on CSA our key recommendations are (i) to make better use of recent advances in indicator development for sustainability assessments, including work on quantification of water and land footprints in relation to farm management; (ii) to use household level analyses to quantify pathways from productivity toward food security and improved nutrition as well as descripting drivers of adoption of adaptation options; and (iii) to use recent advances in system specific quantification of greenhouse gas emissions through both LMIC focused modeling and empirical work.","[van Wijk, Mark T.; Merbold, Lutz; Hammond, James; Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus] Int Livestock Res Inst, Sustainable Livestock Syst, Nairobi, Kenya; [Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol Climate Res Atmospher Environm Res, Karlsruhe, Germany",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"van Wijk, MT (corresponding author), Int Livestock Res Inst, Sustainable Livestock Syst, Nairobi, Kenya.",m.vanwijk@cgiar.org,"Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus/A-8081-2013; Merbold, Lutz/K-6103-2012","Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus/0000-0001-9499-6598; Merbold, Lutz/0000-0003-4974-170X","CGIAR Fund Council, Australia (ACIAR); Irish Aid; European Union; International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); Programme for Climate-Smart Livestock (PCSL)","CGIAR Fund Council, Australia (ACIAR)(CGIAR); Irish Aid(CGIAR); European Union(European Commission); International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); Programme for Climate-Smart Livestock (PCSL)","The authors acknowledge the financial support of the CGIAR Fund Council, Australia (ACIAR), Irish Aid, European Union, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Netherlands, New Zealand, UK, USAID, and Thailand for funding to the CGIAR Research Program on Livestock.

Yet, the growing literature on the topic has been largely descriptive and little attention has been placed on how to transform barriers into enablers for action. By taking a fragile socio-ecological lagoon system in Southern Mexico as a case study, the paper applies a social network analytical approach to: i) reveal the actual web of connections tying stakeholders through local governance arrangements; ii) identify shortcomings in multi-actor collaboration networks; and iii) propose ways to tackle them so that the full potential of adaptation can be exploited. The paper employs a mixed-method approach combining both a quantitative and qualitative Social Network Analysis (SNA). The quantitative SNA is used to assess the quality and strength of relationships among formal public organisations working on climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction in the site. The qualitative SNA is employed to both assess linking ties between formal organizations and local coastal communities potentially targeted with adaptation interventions, and bonding ties connecting community members. The approach proves to be useful to map the relational architecture of the system of interest and to reveal network characteristics that are important for collective action including: network fragmentation in subgroups; density of relations; centralization around a few actors. The actual topology of the network, as revealed, can then be compared with what is required for achieving societally desired adaptation outcomes and for identifying agents that can promote change. The paper acknowledges that a social analytical approach might be limited in unveiling the interests and motives behind actors' participation in the network, and that the latter ultimately determine actors' contribution in defining and enacting a joint solution for a common problem. However, the mixed-methods approach presented in this paper allows for gaining first insights on the way a mismatch between formal and informal institutions might drive socio-ecological systems towards inadequate adaptation outcomes.","[Calliari, Elisa] UCL, London, England; [Calliari, Elisa; Michetti, Melania] Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Lecce, Italy; [Farnia, Luca] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Milan, Italy; [Rarnieri, Emiliano] Thetis SPA, Venice, Italy; [Calliari, Elisa] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Venice, Italy",University of London; University College London; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Fondazione Mattei; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Calliari, E (corresponding author), UCL, London, England.;Calliari, E (corresponding author), Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Lecce, Italy.;Calliari, E (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Venice, Italy.",elisa.calliari@cmcc.it,"Michetti, Melania/AAB-4075-2021; Farnia, Luca/I-6200-2017; Calliari, Elisa/G-4082-2016","Michetti, Melania/0000-0001-6649-1349; Farnia, Luca/0000-0001-9635-3457; Ramieri, Emiliano/0000-0003-1444-7754; Calliari, Elisa/0000-0002-8075-558X","World Bank Consultancy Design of adaptation measures to reduce vulnerability of the pilot site Carmen-Pajonal-Machona Lagoon System, Tabasco, to the impacts from climate change and anthropogenic activities [IMTA-SRM/BIRF/2014/14]; European Commission's Horizon 2020 research & innovation programme under the Placard (PLAtform for Climate Adaptation and Risk reDuction) [653255]; CCLAD (The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage) project [755753 - CCLAD - ERC-2017-STG]","World Bank Consultancy Design of adaptation measures to reduce vulnerability of the pilot site Carmen-Pajonal-Machona Lagoon System, Tabasco, to the impacts from climate change and anthropogenic activities; European Commission's Horizon 2020 research & innovation programme under the Placard (PLAtform for Climate Adaptation and Risk reDuction); CCLAD (The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage) project","The research leading to this paper has been largely developed in the framework of the World Bank Consultancy Design of adaptation measures to reduce vulnerability of the pilot site Carmen-Pajonal-Machona Lagoon System, Tabasco, to the impacts from climate change and anthropogenic activities [Grant Agreement IMTA-SRM/BIRF/2014/14].

While climate change is not a core focus of the roadmap, the call of A New Song presents a unique opportunity to draft new or revised fishery legislation with climate principles in mind. In light of observed and predicted physical, chemical, and biological changes in the-region's waters-as-a result of climate change, elimate-ready legislation should promote effective, sustainable management of marine resources to maintain resilience to human and environmental drivers. Recent policy documents such as A New Song and the FAO's Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries provide guidance that can direct legislators in this work. This paper distills the guidance from A New Song and the FAO Guidelines into twelve benchmarks and conducts a coarse analysis of how well existing legislation in Pacific Island nations meets these benchmarks. While both A New Song and the FAO Guidelines mention the importance of mitigating and adapting to climate change, they are light on specifics. Considerations specific to climate change and its associated effects should also be incorporated where new or revised legislation is necessary. This paper suggests that to effectively implement the benchmarks of A New Song and the FAO Guidelines under a changing climate, legislation must allow management flexibility in the face of environmental change, ensure that scientific understanding of climate effects supports management decisions, and minimize adverse effects of climate change on the lives, livelihoods, and rights of communities. While acknowledging that most adaptation planning will occur at the scale of sub-national policies, strategies, and plans, this paper focuses on the capacity of new or revised legislation as called for by A New Song to affect adaptive capacity in Pacific island coastal fisheries.","[Gourlie, Don; Davis, Ruth; Govan, Hugh; Marshman, James; Hanich, Quentin] USP Sch Govt Dev & Int Affairs SGDIA, LMMA Network, ANCORS, COS, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Gourlie, D (corresponding author), USP Sch Govt Dev & Int Affairs SGDIA, LMMA Network, ANCORS, COS, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",dgourlie@stanford.edu,"Govan, Hugh/O-6123-2019","Govan, Hugh/0000-0003-4387-5029; Hanich, Quentin/0000-0001-9402-6233",,,,,35,6,6,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

Future water supply, water withdrawal, and water security under the impacts of climate change and human interventions have been of key concern. Numerous studies have projected future changes in river runoff and surface water resources under climate change. However, the changes in the major water withdrawal components including agricultural irrigation water, industrial, domestic and ecological water withdrawal, as well as the balance between water supply and withdrawal, under the joint impacts of climate change and socio-economic development have been seldom investigated, especially at the basin and national scales. In this study, changes in surface water resources, agricultural irrigation water, industrial, domestic and ecological water withdrawal, as well as the balances between water supply and withdrawal, under the baseline climate (2006-2015), 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C warming scenarios (2106-2115) in the 10 major basins across China, were investigated by combining modelling and local census data. The results showed that water withdrawal exceeded water supply in the basins of Liao River, Northwest River, Hai River, Yellow River and Huai River in the baseline period. Under the 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C warming scenarios, the shortage of water resources would aggravate in the above-mentioned basins and the Songhua River basin. And the surplus of water resources would reduce substantially in the basins of Yangtze River, Southeast River and Pearl River. Overall, the difference between water supply and water withdrawal was 435.88 billion m(3) during the baseline period, and would be 261.84 and 218.39 billion m(3), respectively, under the 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C warming scenarios. This study provides a comprehensive perspective on future water security in the 10 major basins across China, has important implications for water resources management and climate change adaptation.","[Tao, Fulu; Chen, Yi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhai, Ran; Dai, Huichao; Liu, Zhiwu] China Three Gorges Corp, Inst Sci & Technol, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Tao, Fulu; Chen, Yi; Fu, Bojie] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Tao, Fulu] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Helsinki 00790, Finland; [Fu, Bojie] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; China Three Gorges Corporation; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES)","Tao, FL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",taofl@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0604703]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U2040212]; China Three Gorges Corporation [202103584],National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Three Gorges Corporation,"This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (no. 2017YFA0604703), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (project U2040212) and China Three Gorges Corporation (Contract Number: 202103584).",,58,0,0,54,66,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

Social vulnerability in 2030, 2040 and 2050 is predicted based on the RCP8.5 climate change scenario that projects drought intensities and rising sea levels. Social vulnerability was based on the three dimensions of sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity using 18 socio-economic and five climate indicators identified by experts. All but one indicator related very strongly to the dimension it sought to represent. Despite improvements in adaptive capacity over time, social vulnerability increased between 1988 and 2017 and rates of change accelerated after change point years that occurred between 1998 and 2002 in most counties. Extrapolating past changes of each indicator over time enabled forecasts of social vulnerability in the future. While social variability decreased between 2017 and 2030, it increased again between 2030 and 2050. The lowest future social vulnerability is expected along the eastern PG coast, the greatest along the western PG and the GO. The worsening of socio-economic indicators contributed to increased sensitivity, and increased drought intensities plus the expected rise in sea levels will lead to social vulnerabilities in 2050 comparable to present levels. Between 1.4 and 1.7 M people will live in areas that are likely submerged by water in the future. About 80% of these people live in six counties with variable social vulnerabilities. While counties with lower social variabilities migh/be better able to cope with the challenges posed by climate change, adaptation programs to enhance the resilience of the residents in these and the remaining counties along the PG and the GO need to be implemented soon to avoid uncontrolled mass migration of millions of people from the region.

Yet, whether and how transformation occurs in the messy realities of policy and action, and what separates it from other forms of risk reduction, is far from clear. Jakarta appears to be the perfect example to study these questions. It is amongst the cities with the highest flood risk in the world. Its flood hazard is driven by land subsidence, soil sealing, changes in river discharge, andincreasinglysea level rise. As all of these trends are set to continue, Jakarta's flood hazard is expected to intensify in the future. Designing and implementing large-scale risk reduction and adaption measures therefore has been a priority of risk practitioners and policy-makers at city and national level. Against this background, the paper draws on a document analysis and original empirical household survey data to review and evaluate current adaptation measures and to analyze in how far they describe a path that is transformational from previous risk reduction approaches. The results show that the focus is clearly on engineering solutions, foremost in the Giant Sea Wall project. The project is likely to transform the city's flood hydrology. However, it cements rather than transforms the current risk management paradigm which gravitates around the goal of controlling flood symptoms, rather than addressing their largely anthropogenic root causes. The results also show that the planned measures are heavily contested due to concerns about ecological impacts, social costs, distributional justice, public participation, and long-term effectiveness. On the outlook, the results therefore suggest that the more the flood hazard intensifies in the future, the deeper a societal debate will be needed about the desired pathway in flood risk reduction and overall development planningparticularly with regards to the accepted levels of transformation, such as partial retreat from the most flood-affected areas.","[Garschagen, Matthias; Surtiari, Gusti Ayu Ketut; Harb, Mostapha] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur, UN Campus,Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",,"Garschagen, M (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur, UN Campus,Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",garschagen@ehs.unu.edu; surtiari@ehs.unu.edu; harb@ehs.unu.edu,,"Harb, Mostapha/0000-0001-8951-8700",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the TWIN-SEA research grant,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the TWIN-SEA research grant,This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the TWIN-SEA research grant.,,49,19,19,5,26,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2018,10,8,,,,,,,2934,10.3390/su10082934,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10082934,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GW3CI,,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000446767700350,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Marsh Equilibrium Model (MEM), a one-dimensional mechanistic elevation model, incorporates feedbacks of organic and inorganic inputs to project elevations under sea-level rise scenarios. We tested the feasibility of deriving two key MEM inputs-average annual suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and aboveground peak biomass-from remote sensing data in order to apply MEM across a broader geographic region. We analyzed the precision and representativeness (spatial distribution) of these remote sensing inputs to improve understanding of our study region, a brackish tidal marsh in San Francisco Bay, and to test the applicable spatial extent for coastal modeling. We compared biomass and SSC models derived from Landsat 8, DigitalGlobe WorldView-2, and hyperspectral airborne imagery. Landsat 8-derived inputs were evaluated in a MEM sensitivity analysis. Biomass models were comparable although peak biomass from Landsat 8 best matched field-measured values. The Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer SSC model was most accurate, although a Landsat 8 time series provided annual average SSC estimates. Landsat 8-measured peak biomass values were randomly distributed, and annual average SSC (30 mg/L) was well represented in the main channels (IQR: 29-32 mg/L), illustrating the suitability of these inputs across the model domain. Trend response surface analysis identified significant diversion between field and remote sensing-based model runs at 60 yr due to model sensitivity at the marsh edge (80-140 cm NAVD88), although at 100 yr, elevation forecasts differed less than 10 cm across 97% of the marsh surface (150-200 cm NAVD88). Results demonstrate the utility of Landsat 8 for landscape-scale tidal marsh elevation projections due to its comparable performance with the other sensors, temporal frequency, and cost. Integration of remote sensing data with MEM should advance regional projections of marsh vegetation change by better parameterizing MEM inputs spatially. Improving information for coastal modeling will support planning for ecosystem services, including habitat, carbon storage, and flood protection.","[Byrd, Kristin B.] US Geol Survey, Western Geog Sci Ctr, 345 Middlefield Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Windham-Myers, Lisamarie] US Geol Survey, Natl Res Program, 345 Middlefield Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Leeuw, Thomas] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Downing, Bryan] US Geol Survey, Calif Water Sci Ctr, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA; [Morris, James T.] Univ South Carolina, Belle W Baruch Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, Columbia, SC 20208 USA; [Morris, James T.] Univ South Carolina, Dept Biol, Columbia, SC 20208 USA; [Ferner, Matthew C.] San Francisco State Univ, San Francisco Bay Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, Tiburon, CA 94920 USA; [Leeuw, Thomas] Sequoia Sci Inc, Bellevue, WA 98005 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Byrd, KB (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Western Geog Sci Ctr, 345 Middlefield Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",kbyrd@usgs.gov,"morris, james/AAQ-5605-2020; morris, james/ABC-8111-2020","morris, james/0000-0002-0511-642X; Byrd, Kristin/0000-0002-5725-7486",NASA [NNH14AX16I]; U.S. Geological Survey Land Change Science Program; Federal Coastal Zone Management Act,NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); U.S. Geological Survey Land Change Science Program; Federal Coastal Zone Management Act,"We thank Lisa Schile for access to Rush Ranch data, DEM, and vegetation distribution models.

The knowledge of irrigation distribution is essential to understand regional water cycles and guide agricultural management decision-making, but such information is scarce in China. We developed a remote sensing-dominated framework to map irrigated croplands in China at 500 m resolution using a synergetic training sample generating method, machine learning classifier, and a cloud computing platform (Google Earth Engine, GEE). To overcome the challenges of lacking nationwide training samples, we first produced two provisional irrigation maps by fusing statistics and MODIS-derived annual peak greenness indices. The two provisional irrigation maps were then spatially filtered with an existing irrigation product (GRIPC) to construct the initial training sample pool. Next, to enhance the robustness and cover more irrigated candidates, we screened and introduced the irrigated croplands in three land use/cover maps (CCI-LC, GLC_FCS, and NLCD) to supplement the training data pool. Afterward, we utilized locally adaptive random forest classifiers and data cubes (MODIS-derived spectral indices, climatic and topographic variables) to generate irrigation maps in each province of China on GEE. The resulting map outperformed other current irrigation maps with an overall accuracy of 79.2% . The map also showed a reasonable consistency with statistical data at the province and prefecture levels, with the determination coefficient (R2) of 0.89 and 0.77, respectively. In total, we identified 87.04 million hectares of irrigated croplands in mainland China in 2015. Using the resulting map and water use statistics, we found a high correlation between irrigation area and agricultural water use in Northwest, Northeast, and South China, and a low correlation in North China Plain. This map is expected to serve national water resource management and assist decision-making in improving agricultural adaption to climate change.","[Zhang, Chao; Dong, Jinwei; Zhang, Xuezhen; Ge, Quansheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Xie, Yanhua] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Nelson Inst Ctr Sustainabil & Global Environm SAGE, 1710 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53726 USA; [Xie, Yanhua] Univ Wisconsin Madison, DOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53726 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; United States Department of Energy (DOE); University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison","Dong, JW; Ge, QS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",dongjw@igsnrr.ac.cn; geqs@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Dong, Jinwei/C-4949-2009; Zhang, XZ/HJA-4189-2022","Dong, Jinwei/0000-0001-5687-803X; , Chao/0000-0003-0513-7981","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19040301, XDA23100400]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41871349]",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grants No. XDA19040301, XDA23100400) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41871349) .",,66,2,2,41,50,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1569-8432,1872-826X,,INT J APPL EARTH OBS,Int.

However, largely unexamined, are the ways that narrative understandings conveyed in adaptation plans consider and attempt to address inequality in climate risk to urban populations and FEW-systems. In this paper, we examine whether and how adaptation plans from C40 member cities address inequality in risk, by planning actions to reduce hazard exposure or tackling the drivers of social vulnerability. C40 is a network of 94 of the world's cities fostering policies to address climate change. We apply a mixed methods approach, including a discourse analysis and meta-analysis of adaptation plans. The discourse analysis helps to unpack framings of urban equity issues as they relate to policy actions, and the meta-analysis seeks to quantitatively investigate patterns of framing and policy across adaptation plans. Our findings suggest that FEW-nexus thinking is not yet embedded in narrative understandings of risk and planned adaptation actions, within the adaptation plans we studied. In the city adaptation plans we analyzed, we found multiple frames coexisting behind the broader adaptation visions (e.g., risk and resilience). Rather than converging, issues, and principles such as those of equality, coexist with economic issues in an imbalance of incongruent political movements and priorities. Techno-infrastructural and economic investments and concerns tend to take precedence over concerns and interests for inequality in climate risks. We discuss some of the institutional factors explaining this. Knowledge integration, for instance, is constrained by the existence of a plurality of sectors, levels of government, power, values, and ways of understanding and managing climate risk. We also suggest that the relatively low importance of equality considerations in the adaptation plans will likely limit the capacity of cities to support broader goals such as those of the New Urban Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.","[Romero-Lankao, Patricia] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Romero-Lankao, Patricia] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Romero-Lankao, Patricia] Univ Chicago, Mansueto Inst Urban Innovat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Gnatz, Daniel] Inst Sustainable Urban Transformat, Boulder, CO USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA; University of Chicago,"Romero-Lankao, P (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.;Romero-Lankao, P (corresponding author), Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO 80401 USA.;Romero-Lankao, P (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Mansueto Inst Urban Innovat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",paty.romerolankao@nrel.gov,,,C40 through Bloomberg Philanthropies; National Center for Atmospheric Research - National Science Foundation; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC36-08GO28308],C40 through Bloomberg Philanthropies; National Center for Atmospheric Research - National Science Foundation; National Renewable Energy Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"Research for this article was funded by the C40 through Bloomberg Philanthropies and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, sponsored by the National Science Foundation.

Assessing the effects of future climate change on urban flood volumes is crucial to informing better management of such disasters given the severity of the devastating impacts of flooding (e.g. the 2016 flooding events across China). Although recent studies have investigated the impacts of future climate change on urban flooding, the effects of both climate change mitigation and adaptation have rarely been accounted for together in a consistent framework. In this study, we assess the benefits of mitigating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and locally adapting to climate change by modifying drainage systems to reduce urban flooding under various climate change scenarios through a case study conducted in northern China. The urban drainage model - Storm Water Management Model was used to simulate urban flood volumes using current and two adapted drainage systems (i.e. pipe enlargement and low-impact development, LID), driven by bias-corrected meteorological forcing from five general circulation models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 archive. Results indicate that urban flood volume is projected to increase by 52% over 2020-2040 compared to the volume in 1971-2000 under the business-as-usual scenario (i.e. Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5). The magnitudes of urban flood volumes are found to increase nonlinearly with changes in precipitation intensity. On average, the projected flood volume under RCP 2.6 is 13% less than that under RCP 8.5, demonstrating the benefits of global-scale climate change mitigation efforts in reducing local urban flood volumes. Comparison of reduced flood volumes between climate change mitigation and local adaptation (by improving drainage systems) scenarios suggests that local adaptation is more effective than climate change mitigation in reducing future flood volumes. This has broad implications for the research community relative to drainage system design and modelling in a changing environment. This study highlights the importance of accounting for local adaptation when coping with future urban floods.","[Zhou, Qianqian] Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Civil & Transportat Engn, Waihuan Xi Rd, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Leng, Guoyong] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Huang, Maoyi] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Earth Syst Anal & Modeling Grp, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Leng, Guoyong] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",Guangdong University of Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; University of Oxford,"Leng, GY (corresponding author), Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.;Leng, GY (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",guoyong.leng@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Huang, Maoyi/I-8599-2012; Zhou, Qianqian/GXG-4345-2022","Huang, Maoyi/0000-0001-9154-9485; Leng, Guoyong/0000-0001-6345-143X","Public Welfare Research and Ability Construction Project of Guangdong Province, China [2017A020219003]; Water Conservancy Science and Technology Innovation Project of Guangdong province, China [201710]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China [2014A030310121]; Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry; Integrated Multi-sector, Multi-scale Modeling (IM3) Scientific Focus Area (SFA) - Biological and Environmental Research Division of Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy; U.S. DOE [DE-AC05-76RL01830]","Public Welfare Research and Ability Construction Project of Guangdong Province, China; Water Conservancy Science and Technology Innovation Project of Guangdong province, China; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars); Integrated Multi-sector, Multi-scale Modeling (IM3) Scientific Focus Area (SFA) - Biological and Environmental Research Division of Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy; U.S. DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This research was supported by the Public Welfare Research and Ability Construction Project of Guangdong Province, China (grant no. 2017A020219003), the Water Conservancy Science and Technology Innovation Project of Guangdong province, China (grant no. 201710), the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China (no. 2014A030310121), and the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry.

For a variety of reasons, mostly related to overgrazing and the resulting problems of soil erosion and weed encroachment, many of the worlds natural grasslands are in poor condition and showing signs of degradation. This review examines their contribution to global food supply and to combating climate change. Grasslands make a significant contribution to food security through providing part of the feed requirements of ruminants used for meat and milk production. Globally, this is more important in food energy terms than pig meat and poultry meat. Grasslands are considered to have the potential to play a key role in greenhouse gas mitigation, particularly in terms of global carbon storage and further carbon sequestration. It is estimated that grazing land management and pasture improvement (e.g. through managing grazing intensity, improved productivity, etc) have a global technical mitigation potential of almost 15 Gt CO2 equivalent in 2030, with additional mitigation possible from restoration of degraded lands. Milk and meat production from grassland systems in temperate regions has similar emissions of carbon dioxide per kilogram of product as mixed farming systems in temperate regions, and, if carbon sinks in grasslands are taken into account, grassland-based production systems can be as efficient as high-input systems from a greenhouse gas perspective. Grasslands are important for global food supply, contributing to ruminant milk and meat production. Extra food will need to come from the worlds existing agricultural land base (including grasslands) as the total area of agricultural land has remained static since 1991. Ruminants are efficient converters of grass into humanly edible energy and protein and grassland-based food production can produce food with a comparable carbon footprint as mixed systems. Grasslands are a very important store of carbon, and they are continuing to sequester carbon with considerable potential to increase this further. Grassland adaptation to climate change will be variable, with possible increases or decreases in productivity and increases or decreases in soil carbon stores.","TEAGASC, Res Directorate, Head Off, Oak Pk, Carlow, Ireland",Teagasc,"O'Mara, FP (corresponding author), TEAGASC, Res Directorate, Head Off, Oak Pk, Carlow, Ireland.",frank.omara@teagasc.ie,,,,,,,48,336,361,100,633,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,1095-8290,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

At large scales, simple model aggregation may have a prohibitive computational cost and lead to over-detailed problem representation. Methods that guide model simplification and revision have the potential to support the choice of the appropriate level of detail or heterogeneity within upscaled models. Efficient upscaling will retain only the heterogeneity that contributes to accurate aggregated results. This approach to model revision is challenging, because automatic generation of alternative models is difficult and the set of possible revised models is very large. In the case where simplification alone is considered, there are at least 2(n) - 1 possible simplified models where n is the number of model variables. Even with the availability of High Performance Computing, it is not possible to evaluate every possible simplified model if the number of model variables is greater than roughly 35. To address these issues, we propose a method that extends an existing procedure for simplifying and aggregating mechanistic models based on replacing model variables with constants. The method generates simplified models by selectively aggregating existing model variables, retaining existing model structure while reducing the size of the set of possible models and ordering them into a search tree. The tree is then searched selectively. We illustrate the method using a catchment scale optimization model with c. 50,000 variables (Farm-adapt) in the context of adaptation to climatic change. The method was successful in identifying redundant model variables and an adequate model 10% smaller than the original model. We discuss how the procedure can be extended to other large models and compare the method to those proposed by others. We conclude by urging model developers to regard their models as a starting point and to consider the need for alternative models during model development. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, knowledge of temperature extremes' spatial and temporal patterns, as well as their links to atmospheric oscillation and topography, is scarce in Bangladesh. To this end, this research intends to analyze the spatial and temporal trends in recent extreme temperatures and their relationships with oscillation indices and the topography of Bangladesh. Daily temperature data obtained from 20 meteorological stations for 1980-2017 were employed for this purpose. Results revealed increasing trends in summer days (SU25), tropical nights (TR20), warm days (TX90p), warmest days (TXx), and warm nights (TN90p), while decline in the coldest days (TNn), cold days (TX10p), and cold nights (TN10p) was observed in Bangladesh. Spatial distribution of trends revealed an increase in SU25 and TN90p by 1.9-2.38, 2.33-2.90 days/decade, and a decrease in TX10p and TN10p by 1.7-3.3 days/decade in most regions. Besides, TR20 showed an increase of 3.22-4.17 days/ decade in all sub-regions. The temperature extremes of Bangladesh showed a significant connection with multivariate ENSO index (MEI) and Sea Surface Temperature (SST). Besides, the extremes in most regions of the country showed a significant connection with Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). The influence of atmospheric oscillation indices was more evident on cold days/nights than on warm days/nights. TN10p and SU25 also showed a significant correlation with elevation, which suggests an increase in cold night and summer day temperature with the increase in elevation in Bangladesh. Large-scale climate mode reanalysis revealed that a strong (weak) wind speed, enhancing (decreasing) geopotential height, and fast warming (cooling) over the northwestern (southeast) region have attributed to the variations in extreme temperature in Bangladesh to several extents. These findings will assist the policymakers in disaster mitigation and climate change adaptation in Bangladesh.","[Mallick, Javed] King Khalid Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Abha, Saudi Arabia; [Salam, Roquia; Islam, H.

Collaborative and participatory approaches can help to address such challenges and enable proactive adaptation. However, there is limited empirical evidence of such approaches yielding outcomes that can genuinely be described as shifting business as usual, and fewer still that have informed institutional change. This paper provides such evidence based on an assessment of a novel collaboration between local government, Ma over bar ori, stakeholders, community members, consultants and researchers in the formulation of a 100-year coastal hazard management strategy in Aotearoa New Zealand. Thematic analysis of interviews, surveys and workshop materials was used to distil lessons learned by participants involved in formulating this anticipatory long-term strategy. Results indicated the importance of deliberative, flexible and transparent governance processes that can enable collaboration amongst Ma over bar ori, local and region-wide stakeholders, in a process consistent with and supported by the national governmental frameworks, and regulatory and non-regulatory measures. The importance of aligning scientific, local and Indigenous knowledges is highlighted. Furthermore, novel tools and methodologies were used in the strategy formulation process, hitherto not applied in a real-life coastal decision-making process, to address changing risk over time and uncertainties. This enabled the tailoring of strategic planning and decision processes to reflect local contexts and governance interactions. Adaptive pathways were developed to enable short-term actions to be taken while leaving open longterm options and alternative pathways available for future adjustment as the hazards and impacts intensify. The lessons learned from the development of the coastal management strategy offer insights to support future collaborative decision-making processes in climate change adaptation. They advance scholarly understanding about how sea-level rise risks can be addressed in a long-term strategic formulation process in a dynamic and 'fitfor-purpose' manner.","[Ryan, E. J.; Owen, S.

Emerging changes in global freshwater availability have been recently detected as a combined result of human interventions, natural variability and climate change. Expected future socio-economic and climatic changes will further impact freshwater resources. The quantification of the impacts is challenging due to the complexity of interdependencies between physical and socioeconomic systems. This study demonstrates a vulnerability based assessment of global freshwater availability through a conceptual framework, considering transient hydro-climatic impacts of crossing specific warming levels (1.5 degrees C, 2 degrees C and 4 degrees C) and related socio-economic developments under high-end climate change (RCP8.5). We use high resolution climate scenarios and a global land surface model to develop indicators of exposure for 25,000 watersheds. We also exploit spatially explicit datasets to describe a range of adaptation options through sensitivity and adaptive capacity indicators according to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The combined dynamics of climate and socio-economic changes suggest that although there is important potential for adaptation to reduce freshwater vulnerability, climate change risks cannot be totally and uniformly eliminated. In many regions, socio-economic developments will have greater impact on water availability compared to climate induced changes. The number of people under increased freshwater vulnerability varies substantially depending on the level of global warming and the degree of socio-economic developments, from almost 1 billion people at 4 degrees C and SSP5 to almost 3 billion people at 4 degrees C and SSP3. Generally, it is concluded that larger adaptation efforts are required to address the risks associated with higher levels of warming of 4 degrees C compared to the lower levels of 1.5 degrees C or 2 degrees C. The watershed scale and country level aggregated results of this study can provide a valuable resource for decision makers to plan for climate change adaptation and mitigation actions.","[Koutroulis, A.

Hence, many of them have started to develop climate adaptation strategies or implement measures to help prepare for the challenges it will present. This study aims to provide an overview of climate adaptation in 104 German cities. While existing studies on adaptation tracking rely heavily on self-reported data or the mere existence of adaptation plans, we applied the broader concept of adaptation readiness, considering five factors and a total of twelve different indicators, when making our assessments. We clustered the cities depending on the contribution of these factors to the overall adaptation readiness index and grouped them according to their total score and cluster affiliations. This resulted in us identifying four groups of cities. First, a pioneering group comprises twelve (mainly big) cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants, which showed high scores for all five factors of adaptation readiness. Second, a set of 36 active cities, which follow different strategies on how to deal with climate adaptation. Third, a group of 28 cities showed considerably less activity toward climate adaptation, while a fourth set of 28 mostly small cities (with between 50,000 and 99,999 inhabitants) scored the lowest. We consider this final group to be pursuing a 'wait-and-see' approach. Since the city size correlates with the adaptation readiness index, we recommend policymakers introduce funding schemes that focus on supporting small cities, to help them prepare for the impact of a changing climate.","[Otto, Antje; Thieken, Annegret H.] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Gopfert, Christian] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Energy Efficient & Sustainable Design & Bldg, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Gopfert, Christian] Ruckermainstr 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany",University of Potsdam; Technical University of Munich,"Otto, A (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.",anotto@uni-potsdam.de,"Thieken, Annegret Henriette/B-1946-2017","Thieken, Annegret Henriette/0000-0001-7068-2615",Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [FKZ 01LR1709A1],Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This study was developed within the framework of the joint research project Urban resilience against extreme weather events-typologies and transfer of adaptation strategies in small metropolises and medium-sized cities (ExTrass) funded by Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, FKZ 01LR1709A1).",,78,4,4,8,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

In this study, semi-structured interviews are used to investigate how plans to build a water plaza in the city of Cologne are perceived by local residents.

Experience with flooding, knowledge of the planned construction and awareness of benefits turned out to be important for acceptance, whereas social and personal norms were less relevant.

Rice is an important staple food, especially in Senegal. The scope for increase in rice production under irrigated conditions is uncertain. Rainfed rice is therefore a key component for regional food security impelling agronomists to assess climate change impact on rainfed rice yield and to design rainfed rice ideotypes suited to future climate scenarios. The DSSAT CSM-CERES-Rice model was thus calibrated and evaluated on 19 agronomic experiments conducted in 2012, 2013, and 2014, in 6 locations, with 21 cultivars and two fertilization levels (20 and 80 kg N ha(-1)). Simulations were then carried out with the crop model forced with the downscaled projections of seven climate models, with and without considering the impact of an increase in atmospheric [CO2], using an ensemble of global circulation models and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). Simulated rice yield was divided by two over the century with RCP8.5 and stagnated with RCP2.6. Elevated [CO2] significantly increased yields, but this effect could not offset the yield decline due to elevated temperatures. Cultivars with longer vegetative phases and greater temperature tolerance were better adapted to climate change than current cultivars. Using these new cultivars with the recommended fertilization rate (80 kg N ha(-1)) could offset the yield decline due to climate change. For the first time, we bring together a study based on a process-based crop model handling crop response to elevated [CO2], a large set of field experiments and up-to-date climate projections (i) to provide useful insights into plausible impacts of climate change on rainfed rice in Senegal and (ii) to identify cultivar characteristics relevant for adaptation to future possible climates. Our findings will help set priorities for breeding resilient cultivar in the region.","[Gerardeaux, Edward; Falconnier, Gatien; Goze, Eric; Affholder, Francois] CIRAD, UPR AIDA, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Gerardeaux, Edward; Loison, Romain] Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, AIDA, Montpellier, France; [Sultan, Benjamin] Univ Avignon Maison Teledetect, Univ Antilles, Univ Reunion, Univ Montpellier,IRD,ESPACE DEV, 500 Rue Jean Francois Breton, F-34093 Montpellier, France; [Kouakou, Paul-Martial] INP HB Yamassoukro, Yamassoukro, Cote Ivoire; [Loison, Romain] CIRAD, UPR AIDA, Dakar, Senegal; [Loison, Romain] SODEFITEX, Dakar, Senegal; [Muller, Bertrand] CIRAD, UMR AGAP, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Muller, Bertrand] Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, Montpellier, France; [Defrance, Dimitri] Climate Data Factory, 12 Rue Belzunce, F-75010 Paris, France",CIRAD; CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; University of La Reunion; CIRAD; CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier,"Gerardeaux, E (corresponding author), CIRAD, UPR AIDA, F-34398 Montpellier, France.;Gerardeaux, E (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, AIDA, Montpellier, France.",gerardeaux@cirad.fr,"Sultan, Benjamin/C-8957-2012; Falconnier, Gatien/AAA-3403-2022; AFFHOLDER, Francois/HHZ-4086-2022","Sultan, Benjamin/0000-0003-0416-0338; AFFHOLDER, Francois/0000-0002-3919-4805; Loison, Romain/0000-0001-6562-658X",AfricaRice-CCAFS; AMMA (NERC/DFID) [NE/M020126/1]; NERC [NE/M020126/1] Funding Source: UKRI,AfricaRice-CCAFS; AMMA (NERC/DFID); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This study was funded by AfricaRice-CCAFS for the experiments and AMMA 2050 (NERC/DFID, grant number NE/M020126/1) for the climatic predictions.",,37,1,1,1,15,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1774-0746,1773-0155,,AGRON SUSTAIN DEV,Agron.

Trotter) is a staple, ancient food crop in Ethiopia. Its growth is affected by climate change, so it is essential to understand climatic effects on its habitat suitability in order to design countermeasures to ensure food security. Based on the four Representative Concentration Pathway emission scenarios (i.e., RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we predicted the potential distribution of teff under current and future scenarios using a maximum entropy model (Maxent). Eleven variables were selected out of 19, according to correlation analysis combined with their contribution rates to the distribution. Simulated accuracy results validated by the area under the curve (AUC) had strong predictability with values of 0.83-0.85 for current and RCP scenarios. Our results demonstrated that mean temperature in the coldest season, precipitation seasonality, precipitation in the cold season and slope are the dominant factors driving potential teff distribution. Proportions of suitable teff area, relative to the total study area were 58% in current climate condition, 58.8% in RCP2.6, 57.6% in RCP4.5, 59.2% in RCP6.0, and 57.4% in RCP8.5, respectively. We found that warmer conditions are correlated with decreased land suitability. As expected, bioclimatic variables related to temperature and precipitation were the best predictors for teff suitability. Additionally, there were geographic shifts in land suitability, which need to be accounted for when assessing overall susceptibility to climate change. The ability to adapt to climate change will be critical for Ethiopia's agricultural strategy and food security. A robust climate model is necessary for developing primary adaptive strategies and policy to minimize the harmful impact of climate change on teff.","[Zewudie, Dinka; Ding, Wenguang] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Rong, Zhanlei] Qinghai Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Xining, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Chuanyan; Chang, Yapeng] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University; Qinghai Normal University; Lanzhou University,"Ding, WG (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Lanzhou, Peoples R China.",wgding@lzu.edu.cn,,,Priority research program of Chinese Academy of Science (XDA) [20100102],Priority research program of Chinese Academy of Science (XDA),"This work was supported by the Priority research program of Chinese Academy of Science (XDA) (NO. 20100102).

A study has been conducted for the evaluation of trends in hydro-meteorological variables and their response to runoff to understand the changing pattern of water resources in Hengshui City, located in the North China Plain. The inverse distance weighting interpolation, nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK) test, Sen's slope estimator, and wavelet analysis methods were used to assess the spatiotemporal changes in precipitation and runoff for the period 1963-2013. Besides, MK mutation point test and sequential clustering method were used to identify the mutation points of annual runoff sequence. Finally, rescaled range analysis, fractal dimension approximation, and power spectrum exponent estimation were used to predict the possible future annual runoff trends. The results revealed that average annual precipitation of Hengshui City was decreasing from its long-term average of 508.65 mm. The seasonal precipitation showed an increase in spring and autumn and a decrease in summer and winter. The precipitation of the city has a periodicity of 29, 17, and 6-7 years, among which 29 years is the main cycle. Analysis of river flow data revealed that the surface water resources in the central area are relatively short. The annual runoff in six out of eight rivers flowing through the vicinity of the city showed a downward trend while the rest two showed an upward trend. A periodicity in annual runoff of the main rivers was also observed. The mutation points in inflow series of different rivers were found to vary between 1968 and 1983. Future projections of runoff revealed both increase and decrease in flow of different rivers. The findings of the study can be used for water resources management and adaptation to climate change.","[Sun, Jiaqi] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Sun, Jiaqi; Wang, Xiaojun] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaojun] Minist Water Resources, Res Ctr Climate Change, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China; [Shahid, Shamsuddin] Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Fac Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia",Hohai University; Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Sun, JQ (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.;Sun, JQ (corresponding author), Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China.",sunjq92@qq.com; xjwang@nhri.cn; sshahid@utm.my,"SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/B-5185-2010","SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/0000-0001-9621-6452","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0403506]; Young Top-Notch Talent Support Program of National High-level Talents Special Support Plan, China Water Resource Conservation and Protection Project [126302001000150005, 126302001000150001]; Strategic Consulting Projects of Chinese Academy of Engineering [2016-ZD-08-05-02]","National Key R&D Program of China; Young Top-Notch Talent Support Program of National High-level Talents Special Support Plan, China Water Resource Conservation and Protection Project; Strategic Consulting Projects of Chinese Academy of Engineering","We are grateful to the National Key R&D Program of China (NO: 2017YFC0403506), Young Top-Notch Talent Support Program of National High-level Talents Special Support Plan, China Water Resource Conservation and Protection Project (NO: 126302001000150005, 126302001000150001), and Strategic Consulting Projects of Chinese Academy of Engineering (NO: 2016-ZD-08-05-02) for providing financial support for this research.

On the basis of human clothing adjustment behavior, a dynamic setting temperature (DST) that adapts to climate change was proposed in this paper, i.e. indoor air-conditioning setting temperature changes dynamically with outdoor air temperature; furthermore. A method was established to obtain the DST. The daily mean clothing insulation was predicted according to the historical temperature at first, then indoor thermal comfort temperature was calculated based on the variable clothing insulation, and finally the DST was determined. According to the value or range of predicted mean vote (0, -0.5 similar to 0.5, -1 similar to+ 1) corresponding to the thermal comfort, three levels of DST were defined. The corresponding thermal acceptability rates were 95%, 90% and 73%, respectively. A simulation of DST was conducted in a public building in Changsha, China based on meteorological data of 2017. Three levels of DST ranges were obtained, varied from 20.1 to 27.8 degrees C in level I, 17.8 to 28.7 degrees C in level II and 15.4 to 29.7 degrees C in level III, respectively. The simulation results of operational air-conditioning energy consumption shows that the application of DST could save up to 65.5% of energy consumption compared with the traditional fixed setting temperature (FST), and the operational energy consumption decreased by 59.1% due to the application of level-III DST compared with level-I DST. Therefore, the DST proposed in this paper has significant energy saving potential while meeting the thermal comfort requirements. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This study uses a whole-farm land use optimisation approach to explore climate change impacts, when including adaptation, on farm profitability, production and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the Loess Plateau of northern China. The results show that with adaptation activities, the losses in smallholder farm profitability caused by the climate change could be moderate. Declining rainfall results in land use changes that generate higher on-farm GHG emissions with the most economically beneficial adaptations. With 5 % or 10 % decline in annual rainfall, the introduction of agricultural carbon tax would generate substantial reduction in on-farm GHG emissions. With 30 % rainfall reduction, agricultural carbon tax is not likely to bring about considerable emission reduction. The economically optimised land uses are generally sensitive to potential changes. When rainfall reductions appear, there is a clear trend toward reducing cropping area and transiting to pasture. With 5-10% rainfall reductions, increasing agricultural carbon tax with same rainfall reduction leads to the expansion in cropping enterprises. However, with 30 % rainfall reduction, land allocations are not sensitive to agricultural carbon tax. When with declining annual rainfall, in the optimal enterprises more oats-pasture rotations are employed to reduce wheat dominated rotations. Besides land use patterns, adaptations through altering farm management practices are also necessary. The economically optimised sheep flock would be increased considerably with declining rainfall. Overall, policymakers are suggested to initial more educational schemes to tell smallholder farmers how to make the best use of available adaptation strategies and consider changes in climate when design and implement agricultural policy.","[Tang, Kai] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Econ & Trade, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Hailu, Atakelty] Univ Western Australia, Discipline Agr & Resource Econ, UWA Sch Agr & Environm, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",Guangdong University of Foreign Studies; University of Western Australia,"Tang, K (corresponding author), Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Econ & Trade, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.",francistang1988@hotmail.com,"Hailu, Atakelty/AAB-7606-2020","Hailu, Atakelty/0000-0002-1024-7520; Tang, Kai/0000-0002-4878-0187",Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2019A1515010884]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2018A030310025]; Humanities and Social Sciences Project from Ministry of Education of China [17YJA790021]; Guangdong Province through the Pearl River Talents Plan,Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Humanities and Social Sciences Project from Ministry of Education of China; Guangdong Province through the Pearl River Talents Plan,"This work was supported by Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2019A1515010884), Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (2018A030310025), Humanities and Social Sciences Project from Ministry of Education of China (17YJA790021), and Guangdong Province through the Pearl River Talents Plan.",,48,33,33,10,40,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,FEB,2020,91,,,,,,,,104353,10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104353,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104353,,,8,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KH9GX,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000510958200061,View Full Record in Web of Science

A vulnerability scenario, which varies according to the autonomous adaptation effect for conventional disaster mitigation efforts, was developed based on historical vulnerability values derived from flood damage records and a river inundation simulation. Coupled with general circulation model outputs and future socioeconomic scenarios, potential future flood fatalities and economic loss were estimated. By including the effect of autonomous adaptation, our multimodel ensemble estimates projected a 2.0% decrease in potential flood fatalities and an 821% increase in potential economic losses by 2100 under the highest emission scenario together with a large population increase. Vulnerability changes reduced potential flood consequences by 64%-72% in terms of potential fatalities and 28%-42% in terms of potential economic losses by 2100. Although socioeconomic changes made the greatest contribution to the potential increased consequences of future floods, about a half of the increase of potential economic losses was mitigated by autonomous adaptation. There is a clear and positive relationship between the global temperature increase from the pre-industrial level and the estimated mean potential flood economic loss, while there is a negative relationship with potential fatalities due to the autonomous adaptation effect. A bootstrapping analysis suggests a significant increase in potential flood fatalities (+5.7%) without any adaptation if the temperature increases by 1.5 degrees C-2.0 degrees C, whereas the increase in potential economic loss (+0.9%) was not significant. Our method enables the effects of autonomous adaptation and additional adaptation efforts on climate-induced hazards to be distinguished, which would be essential for the accurate estimation of the cost of adaptation to climate change.","[Kinoshita, Youhei] Remote Sensing Technol Ctr Japan, Minato Ku, TOKYU REIT Toranomon Bldg 3F,3-17-1, Tokyo 1050001, Japan; [Tanoue, Masahiro; Hirabayashi, Yukiko] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Meguro Ku, 4-6-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1538505, Japan; [Watanabe, Satoshi] Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, 2-11-16 Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan",University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo,"Kinoshita, Y (corresponding author), Remote Sensing Technol Ctr Japan, Minato Ku, TOKYU REIT Toranomon Bldg 3F,3-17-1, Tokyo 1050001, Japan.",kinoshita_youhei@restec.or.jp,"Hirabayashi, Yukiko/E-5628-2010; Watanabe, Satoshi/AAR-3380-2020; Tanoue, Masahiro/AAC-9450-2019","Hirabayashi, Yukiko/0000-0001-5693-197X; Watanabe, Satoshi/0000-0001-5601-7854; Tanoue, Masahiro/0000-0003-1365-0187","Funding Program for the Global Environmental Research Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan [S-14]; Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT), Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [16H06291]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26820198] Funding Source: KAKEN","Funding Program for the Global Environmental Research Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan; Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT), Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study was supported financially by the Funding Program for the Global Environmental Research Fund (S-14) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan; the Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT), Japan; and a grant-in-aid for scientific research (ID: 16H06291) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).

It is unknown, however, whether existing surveillance systems in the United States have adequate capacity to serve that role, nor what actions may be needed to develop adequate capacity. Objective: Our goals were to review efforts to assess and strengthen the capacity of public health surveillance systems to support health-related adaptation to climate change in the United States and to determine whether additional efforts are warranted. Methods: Building on frameworks issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we specified 4 core components of public health surveillance capacity relevant to climate change health threats. Using standard methods, we next identified and analyzed multiple assessments of the existing, relevant capacity of public health surveillance systems as well as attempts to improve that capacity. We also received information from selected national public health associations. Findings: Multiple federal, state, and local public health agencies, professional associations, and researchers have made valuable, initial efforts to assess and strengthen surveillance capacity. These efforts, however, have been made by entities working independently and without the benefit of a shared conceptual framework or strategy. Their principal focus has been on identifying suitable indicators and data sources largely to the exclusion of other core components of surveillance capacity. Conclusions: A more comprehensive and strategic approach is needed to build the public health surveillance capacity required to protect the health of Americans in a world of rapidly evolving climate change.

In traditional bias correction schemes, the statistics of the simulated model outputs are adjusted to those of the observation data. However, the model output and the observation data are only one case (i.e., realization) out of many possibilities, rather than being sampled from the entire population of a certain distribution due to internal climate variability. This issue has not been considered in the bias correction schemes of the existing climate change studies. Here, three approaches are employed to explore this issue, with the intention of providing a practical tool for bias correction of daily rainfall for use in hydrologic models ((1) conventional method, (2) non-informative Bayesian method, and (3) informative Bayesian method using a Weather Generator (WG) data). The results show some plausible uncertainty ranges of precipitation after correcting for the bias of RCM precipitation. The informative Bayesian approach shows a narrower uncertainty range by approximately 25-45% than the non-informative Bayesian method after bias correction for the baseline period. This indicates that the prior distribution derived from WG may assist in reducing the uncertainty associated with parameters. The implications of our results are of great importance in hydrological impact assessments of climate change because they are related to actions for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Since this is a proof of concept study that mainly illustrates the logic of the analysis for uncertainty-based bias correction, future research exploring the impacts of uncertainty on climate impact assessments and how to utilize uncertainty while planning mitigation and adaptation strategies is still needed.

Impacts on agriculture, forestry, water resources, and energy, were emphasized. The study was future-oriented, focusing on the year 2030, by which time the effects of 'greenhouse' warming may be felt. The records of the AD 1930s were used to provide an analog of the kinds of climate change (warmer and drier) that climate models predict will occur in the MINK region. Our results indicate that impacts of the projected climate change on agriculture, at least in the future, are expected to be profound, but that likely-to-be available technologies should facilitate substantial adaptation; that current water-resource limitations in the region would be exacerbated and lead to an eastward shift in irrigation; that impacts on forestry would be severe, and that opportunities for forestry adaptation would be very limited unless biomass production were to become economically viable; and that the net impacts on energy supply and demand would be small and adaptation to them relatively simple. Climate change in the MINK region could, of course, go somewhat beyond the conditions represented by the AD 1930s analog, in which case the findings of this study may be too optimistic. However, the future-oriented 'MINK methodology' is not scenario-dependent, and can be used to test other, more severe (or benign), scenarios as well. Further, the capacity for adaptation to climate change demonstrated in this study, may remain applicable even in more stringent circumstances.",,,"ROSENBERG, NJ (corresponding author), ENERGY & NAT RESOURCES DIV,CLIMATE RESOURCES PROGRAM,1616 P ST NW,WASHINGTON,DC 20036, USA.",,,,,,,,16,10,11,1,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211",0376-8929,,,ENVIRON CONSERV,Environ.

Clarifying urban park cooling effect can improve climate change adaptability and urban sustainability. However, park cooling effects were mainly explored in maximum perspective in previous studies, without considering the cumulative impact resulting from spatial continuity. Therefore, focusing on 24 urban parks in the main city zone of Shenzhen, China, such cumulative indexes as park cooling intensity and park cooling gradient, were proposed in this study and integrated with maximum indexes of park cooling area and park cooling efficiency, so as to explore park cooling effects comprehensively. The results showed that the park areas and cold spot areas of land surface temperature overlapped spatially by 64.40%. The partial correlation analysis showed that, park perimeter, area and shape index were significantly and positively correlated with park cooling area, with significantly negative correlation for park cooling efficiency. The vegetation index was significantly and positively correlated with park cooling intensity and park cooling gradient, and the impact of water body area ratio to all the four park cooling indexes was not significant. Then cooling effects of 24 urban parks were classified into four cooling capacity bundles, which showed that parks designed to serve different social functions behaved different cooling effects. The cooling effect of comprehensive parks was more efficient, with the same low value of all four cooling indexes for theme parks, high cooling intensity and cooling gradient for small ecological parks, and the highest cooling area for large ecological parks. This study proposed a comprehensive approach to measuring park cooling effects with both maximum and accumulation perspectives, which can guide urban park planning and design to maximize the ecological benefits.","[Peng, Jian; Dong, Jianquan] Peking Univ, Lab Earth Surface Proc, Minist Educ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Peng, Jian; Dan, Yuzhuo; Qiao, Ruilin; Wu, Jiansheng] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Sch Urban Planning & Design, Key Lab Environm & Urban Sci, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yanxu] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University; University Town of Shenzhen; Beijing Normal University,"Peng, J (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Lab Earth Surface Proc, Minist Educ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Peng, J (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Sch Urban Planning & Design, Key Lab Environm & Urban Sci, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",jianpeng@urban.pku.edu.cn,"Wu, Jian/AAU-5221-2020; Wu, Jian/AAU-5221-2020","Wu, Jian/0000-0001-9933-7364; Wu, Jian/0000-0002-3394-1507",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41671182],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41671182).,,51,56,58,116,324,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0034-4257,1879-0704,,REMOTE SENS ENVIRON,Remote Sens.

To meet changes in capacity and post-COVID-19 passenger processing, airport infrastructure such as terminal buildings, airfields, and ground service equipment require substantial upgrades. Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but that estimate excludes airport construction and operation. Metrics that assess an airport's sustainability, in addition to environmental impacts that are sometimes unaccounted for (e.g. water consumption), are necessary for a more complete environmental accounting of the entire aviation sector. This review synthesizes the current state of environmental sustainability metrics and methods (e.g. life-cycle assessment, Scope GHG emissions) for airports as identified in 108 peer-reviewed journal articles and technical reports. Articles are grouped according to six categories (Energy and Atmosphere, Comfort and Health, Water and Wastewater, Site and Habitat, Material and Resources, Multidimensional) of an existing airport sustainability assessment framework. A case study application of the framework is evaluated for its efficacy in yielding performance objectives. Research interest in airport environmental sustainability is steadily increasing, but there is ample need for more systematic assessment that accounts for a variety of emissions and regional variation. Prominent research themes include analyzing the GHG emissions from airfield pavements and energy management strategies for airport buildings. Research on water conservation, climate change resilience, and waste management is more limited, indicating that airport environmental accounting requires more analysis. A disconnect exists between research efforts and practices implemented by airports. Effective practices such as sourcing low-emission electricity and electrifying ground transportation and gate equipment can in the short term aid airports in moving towards sustainability goals. Future research must emphasize stakeholder involvement, life-cycle assessment, linking environmental impacts with operational outcomes, and global challenges (e.g. resilience, climate change adaptation, mitigation of infectious diseases).","[Greer, Fiona; Rakas, Jasenka; Horvath, Arpad] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Greer, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",fionagreer@berkeley.edu; jrakas@berkeley.edu; horvath@ce.berkeley.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Rakas, Jasenka/0000-0001-9694-3588; Greer, Fiona/0000-0001-9453-0640",Sustainability Office at Groupe ADP,Sustainability Office at Groupe ADP,FG and JR acknowledge the financial support of the Sustainability Office at Groupe ADP.,,133,24,24,26,94,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

The management goal involved maximizing potential water availability, understood as the maximum volume of water supplied at a certain point of the river network that satisfies a defined demand, and taking into account specified reliability requirements. We focused on potential water availability for agriculture and assumed two types of demands: urban supply and irrigation. If potential water availability was not enough to satisfy all irrigation demands, management measures were applied aiming at achieving a compromise solution between resources and demands. The methodological approach consisted of estimation and comparison of runoff for current and future period under climate change effects, calculation of water availability changes due to changes in runoff, and evaluation of the adaptation choices that can modify the distribution of water availability, under climate change. Adaptation choices include modifying water allocation to agriculture, increasing the reservoir storage capacity, improving the efficiency of urban water use, and modifying water allocation to environmental flows. These management measures were evaluated at the desired points of the river network by applying the Water Availability and Adaptation Policy Analysis (WAAPA) model. We simulated the behavior of a set of reservoirs that supply water for a set of prioritized demands, complying with specified ecological flows and accounting for evaporation losses. We applied the methodology in six representative basins of southern Europe: Duero-Douro, Ebro, Guadalquivir, Po, Maritsa-Evros, and Struma-Strymon. While in some basins, such as the Ebro or Struma-Strymon, measures can significantly increase water availability and compensate for a fraction of water scarcity due to climate change, in other basins, like the Guadalquivir, water availability cannot be enhanced by applying the management measures analyzed, and irrigation water use will have to be reduced.","[Sordo-Ward, Alvaro; Granados, Alfredo; Garrote, Luis] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Ingn Civil Hidraul Energia & Medio Ambiente, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Iglesias, Ana] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Econ Agr Estadist & Gest Empresas, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Iglesias, Ana] Univ Politecn Madrid, CEIGRAM, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Dolores Bejarano, Maria] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Recursos & Sistemas Nat, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Centro de Estudios e Investigacion para la Gestion de Riesgos Agrarios Medioambientales CEIGRAM; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Garrote, L (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Ingn Civil Hidraul Energia & Medio Ambiente, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",alvaro.sordo.ward@upm.es; a.granados@upm.es; ana.iglesias@upm.es; l.garrote@upm.es; mariadolores.bejarano@upm.es,"Sordo-Ward, Alvaro/AAS-2893-2020; Garrote, Luis/B-5925-2013; Bejarano, Maria D/M-5032-2015; Granados, Alfredo/AAA-6648-2019; Iglesias, Ana/AEN-3261-2022","Sordo-Ward, Alvaro/0000-0002-9186-8395; Garrote, Luis/0000-0001-9087-3638; Bejarano, Maria Dolores/0000-0002-5180-4442","Universidad Politecnica de Madrid through the Programa propio: ayudas a proyectos de I+D de investigadores posdoctorales; ADAPTA project; European Commission BASE project of the 7th Framework Program [ENV-308337]; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness [IJCI-2016-29157]","Universidad Politecnica de Madrid through the Programa propio: ayudas a proyectos de I+D de investigadores posdoctorales; ADAPTA project; European Commission BASE project of the 7th Framework Program; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness(Spanish Government)","This research was partially funded by Universidad Politecnica de Madrid through the Programa propio: ayudas a proyectos de I+D de investigadores posdoctorales and the ADAPTA project.

Potential solutions need first to be evaluated under present climate conditions to determine their utility as climate change adaptation strategies. An urban drainage network receiving both stormwater and wastewater was studied to evaluate potential solutions to reduce the impact of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) in a drinking water source. A detailed hydraulic model was applied to the drainage basin to model the implementation of best management practices at a drainage basin scale. The model was calibrated and validated with field data of CSO flows for seven events from a survey conducted in 2009 and 2010. Rain gardens were evaluated for their reduction of volumes of water entering the drainage network and of CSOs. Scenarios with different levels of implementation were considered and evaluated. Of the total impervious area within the basin directly connected to the sewer system, a maximum of 21% could be alternately directed towards rain gardens. The runoff reductions for the entire catchment ranged from 12.7% to 19.4% depending on the event considered. The maximum discharged volume reduction ranged from 13% to 62% and the maximum peak flow rate reduction ranged from 7% to 56%. Of concern is that in-sewer sediment resuspension is an important process to consider with regard to the efficacy of best management practices aimed at reducing extreme loads and concentrations. Rain gardens were less effective for large events, which are of greater importance for drinking water sources. These practices could increase peak instantaneous loads as a result of greater in-sewer resuspension during large events. Multiple interventions would be required to achieve the objectives of reducing the number, total volumes and peak contaminant loads of overflows upstream of drinking water intakes.

Using bivariate and mixed recursive models, and drawing on three waves of nationally representative panel survey data, we find that receiving food aid significantly increases the probability of adopting soil and water conservation structures in both countries and increasing livestock holdings in Ethiopia. We argue that food aid influences the adoption of these resource-intensive practices directly by easing households' constraints to capital and labour, and indirectly by enabling greater risk-taking. For less risky and less resource-intensive practices, namely organic fertilizer use and legume intercropping, the impacts of food aid on adoption are negative, suggesting a substitution effect triggered by food aid. We further examine the heterogeneous impacts of food aid in terms of variations in transfer values and the levels of low rainfall risk exposure experienced by households in order to better understand how targeting and food aid implementation features influence CAP adoption choices. Our analysis makes two important contributions: (1) it provides cross-country evidence on the productive impacts of food aid in smallholder contexts, and; (2) it demonstrates the value of leveraging existing social assistance interventions in order to achieve climate adaptation objectives.","[Sitko, Nicholas J.] UN, Inclus Rural Transformat & Gender Equ Div, FAO, Rome, Italy; [Scognamillo, Antonio] UN, Agrifood Econ Div, FAO, Rome, Italy; [Malevolti, Giulia] Univ Firenze, Dept Econ & Management, Florence, Italy; [Malevolti, Giulia] Univ Trento, Doctoral Sch Social Sci, Trento, Italy",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); University of Florence; University of Trento,"Sitko, NJ (corresponding author), UN, Inclus Rural Transformat & Gender Equ Div, FAO, Rome, Italy.",Nicholas.sitko@fao.org,"Scognamillo, Antonio/ABA-7757-2021","Scognamillo, Antonio/0000-0002-0276-6814; Malevolti, Giulia/0000-0001-6533-5352",,,,,99,3,3,8,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,JUL,2021,102,,,,,,,,102041,10.1016/j.foodpol.2021.102041,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2021.102041,,JUL 2021,23,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,TS7FM,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000679812200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Intense solar radiation at Control plot triggered significant material heating, which in turn warmed near-ground air to intensify UHI effect and indoor space to lift energy consumption. Sedum plot with incomplete plant cover, sluggish transpiration and limited substrate moisture storage had feeble evapotranspiration cooling. The warmed roof passed heat to near-ground air and subsurface layers to impose a small indoor cooling load. Peanut plot with high transpiration rate can significantly cool foliage surface and near-ground air to ameliorate UHI. Its high moisture-holding capacity, however, can generate an appreciable heat-sink to push heat downwards and increase indoor cooling load. Practical hints on green roof design and management were distilled from the findings for application in Hong Kong and beyond and to contribute to climate-resilient cities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Approaches for effective adaptation to climate change through national and local efforts fundamen-tally aim to create environmentally sustainable, socially inclusive, and economically vibrant communities. This paper associates the impacts of climate change to the preservation of threatened minority languages in semi-arid areas in Northern Ghana. This review relies on primary and secondary sources on climate-induced migration, minority languages, and threats of language loss through a keyword search followed by rigorous content analysis. The study confirms that forced displacement due to harsh climatic and other environmental conditions is currently occurring in the upper regions (Upper East and Upper West Regions) of Ghana with mi-nority linguistic groups being forced to migrate to the southern part of the country, where their culture and language are threatened due to large linguistic groups. The literature well establishes the north-south mobility with various debates on its root causes. However, the phenomenon is understudied along with the lack of spe-cific national strategies for addressing it and the associated language loss. Therefore, the need emerges for fur-ther studies to enhance the current understanding of the phenomenon to inform policy interventions and pro-tect minority languages threatened by climate-induced migration. The focus on an understudied subject and geographic scope makes the findings extremely relevant for the expansion of knowledge on internal migration in the context of climate change in Northern Ghana.","[Addaney, Michael; Akudugu, Jonas Ayaribilla] Univ Energy & Nat Resources, Dept Planning & Sustainabil, Sunyani, Ghana; [Yegblemenawo, Stella Afi Makafui; Kodua, Mavis Antiri] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Language & Commun Sci, Kumasi, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Addaney, M (corresponding author), Univ Energy & Nat Resources, Dept Planning & Sustainabil, Sunyani, Ghana.",michael.addaney@uenr.edu.gh,,"Yegblemenawo, Stella Afi Makafui/0000-0002-8181-7607",,,,,73,0,0,1,2,KEAI PUBLISHING LTD,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING, DONGCHENG DISTRICT 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",2096-9589,2325-4262,,CHIN J POPUL RESOUR,Chin.

Their (semi) permanence generates high stakes in what seems like a one-shot game. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically explore a model of short-term area-based conservation that prioritizes adaptive co-management: temporary areas closed to fishing, designed by the fishers they affect, approved by the government, and adapted every 5 years. In this model, no-take zones are adapted through learning and trust-building between fishers and government fisheries scientists. We use integrated social-ecological theory and a case study of a network of such fisheries closures (fishing refugia) in northwest Mexico to hypothesize a feedback loop between trust, design, and ecological outcomes. We argue that, with temporary and adaptive area-based management, social and ecological outcomes can be mutually reinforcing as long as initial designs are ecologically good enough and supported in the social-ecological context. This type of adaptive management also has the potential to adapt to climate change and other social-ecological changes. This feedback loop also predicts the dangerous possibility that low trust among stakeholders may lead to poor design, lack of ecological benefits, eroding confidence in the tool's capacity, shrinking size, and even lower likelihood of social-ecological benefits. In our case, however, this did not occur, despite poor ecological design of some areas, likely due to buffering by social network effects and alternative benefits. We discuss both the potential and the danger of temporary area-based conservation measures as a learning tool for adaptive co-management and commoning.","[Quintana, Anastasia C.

This paper documents lessons learned from the Africa Climate Change Resilience Alliance (ACCRA) programme - a multi-stakeholder consortium comprised of four large international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and a research organization. It revisits the development and implementation of the conceptual framework that guided ACCRA's work: the Local Adaptive Capacity (LAC) framework. Between 2009 and 2013, ACCRA's research used the LAC to understand the impact of development interventions on levels of adaptive capacity at community and household levels. This in turn informed targeting of NGO and government programming. Challenges such as definitional overlaps between resilience and adaptation, difficulties in articulating the intangible elements of LAC's five characteristics of adaptive capacity and differing interpretations of commonly used terms between academic and practitioner partners each had to be grappled with. Experiences from ACCRA's research highlight the LAC's utility as a unifying framework. However, they also point to the need to ensure that certain elements of the LAC are not under-represented (such as gender, power and politics). In addition, the need for improved guidance in describing how the conceptual elements of the LAC can be operationalized, and ensuring greater levels of collaboration between all stakeholders were identified. It is hoped that the lessons from ACCRA not only help to shape future applications of the LAC but the large number of other adaptation and resilience-oriented frameworks that guide development research and practice.","[Jones, Lindsey; Ludi, Eva] Overseas Dev Inst, London, England; [Jones, Lindsey] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England; [Jones, Lindsey] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Jeans, Helen; Barihaihi, Margaret] Oxfam GB, Oxford, England; [Barihaihi, Margaret] ACCRA, Kampala, Uganda",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Jones, L (corresponding author), Overseas Dev Inst, London, England.;Jones, L (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England.;Jones, L (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England.",l.jones@odi.org.uk,,"Ludi, Eva/0000-0002-9069-7598",,,,,79,14,15,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

We develop a new adaptation of the policy transfer heuristic (based on the work of Dolowitz, D., and D. Marsh. 1996. Who Learns What from Whom: A Review of the Policy Transfer Literature. Political Studies; Evans, Mark. 2009a. New Directions in the Study of Policy Transfer. Policy Studies 30 (3): 237-241. doi:10.1080/01442870902863810) which draws attention to different types of multilevel governance systems (Hooghe, Liesbet, and Gary Marks. 2003. Unraveling the Central State, but How? Types of Multi-Level Governance. American Political Science Review 97: 02. doi:10.1017/S0003055403000649). This new adaption, Policy Transfer Across Governance Systems (PTAGS) heuristic helps to anticipate challenges and opportunities for potential transfer (Manwaring, Rob. 2016. The Big Society in Australia: A Case of 'Non'-Policy Transfer? Australian Journal of Public Administration 75 (2): 191-201. doi:10.1111/1467-8500.12164). To demonstrate this, we present three hypothetical scenarios of policy transfer from the European Union Green Capital Awards (EUGCA) to Australia. Using PTAGS reveals three main complexities that policy actors' may face when developing city-scale climate change policy. These are: problem identification; the type of transfer networks used; and what aspects of policy contents and goals can be transferred. We argue that the adapted PTAGS heuristic enables a more nuanced understanding of the dynamics of transfer across different governance systems. This can better equip policy actors and relevant stakeholders to develop more holistic city-scale climate change adaptation policy that draws on the strengths of governance systems rather than amplifying their weaknesses.","[Hulicka, Anna] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Geog & Spatial Management, Krakow, Poland; [Lucas, Patrick; Carson, Lisa] Australia & New Zealand Sch Govt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Carson, Lisa] Univ New South Wales, Publ Serv Res Grp, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Lucas, Patrick] Univ New South Wales, Sch Business, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Jagiellonian University; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Lucas, P (corresponding author), Australia & New Zealand Sch Govt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",p.austin.lucas@gmail.com,,"Carson, Lisa/0000-0002-7786-1082",Australian Government Research Training Scholarship,Australian Government Research Training Scholarship(Australian Government),This work was supported by Australian Government Research Training Scholarship.,,77,0,0,11,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-2872,1470-1006,,POLICY STUD-UK,Policy Stud.,JAN 2,2023,44,1,,,SI,,4,25,,10.1080/01442872.2021.1987407,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01442872.2021.1987407,,OCT 2021,22,Public Administration,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Public Administration,7K4NF,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000706226700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding the spatiotemporal change of soil conditions is important to support food production, environmental sustainability, and climate change adaptation. Nevertheless, spatiotemporal prediction of soil properties could be seriously influenced by the uncertainties of the data and model. Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) with the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) was proposed as a general model that can account for the uncertainties in spatiotemporal soil modelling and prediction. INLA-SPDE has significant advantages in computation efficiency over commonly-used geostatistical methods with Markov Chain Monte Carlo. However, until now, only few pedometrics studies used it for soil spatial modelling. This study demonstrates an application of INLA-SPDE within a hierarchical spatiotemporal model for soil organic matter based on soil survey data collected in Jiangsu, China, during three periods, i.e., 1979-1982, 2000 and 2006-2007. Compared with updating digital soil maps using the Bayesian Maximum Entropy approach, the prediction generated using INLA-SPDE is more accurate. For example, the root mean square error using INLA-SPDE (i.e., 6.57 g kg(-1)) was reduced by 20% compared to the updating approach (i.e., 8.39 g kg(-1)). Moreover, accounting for sources of uncertainties made the prediction using INLA-SPDE more certain. Nevertheless, the uncertainty in the temporal prediction of soil change is still large due to the scarcity of data across the sampling periods. The INLA-SPDE model predicts much detailed spatiotemporal changes along the sampling periods. Therefore, this study recommends the use of INLA-SPDE within a hierarchical model as an effective method for studying spatiotemporal soil change.","[Sun, Xiao-Lin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Sun, Xiao-Lin; Zhao, Yu-Guo; Zhang, Gan-Lin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Minasny, Budiman] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney Inst Agr, Eveleigh, NSW, Australia; [Wang, Hui-Li] Guangxi Forestry Res Inst, Nanning 530002, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Gan-Lin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Gan-Lin] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yun-Jin] Minist Ecol & Environm Peoples Republ China, Nanjing Inst Environm Sci, Nanjing 210042, Peoples R China","Sun Yat Sen University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil Science, CAS; University of Sydney; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology, CAS","Zhang, GL; Wu, YJ (corresponding author), 73 Beijing East Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.",glzhang@issas.ac.cn; wyj@nies.org,"wang, hui/GRS-4730-2022; Wang, Hui/HMU-9512-2023; wang, huimin/HDM-8421-2022; Minasny, Budiman/B-4744-2011","Minasny, Budiman/0000-0002-1182-2371","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771246, 42071062]; University of Sydney, China Studies Center; ARC Discovery project Forecasting soil conditions [DP200102542]; LE STUDIUM Loire Valley Institute for Advanced Studies through its LE STUDIUM Research Consortium Programme; Australian Research Council [DP200102542] Funding Source: Australian Research Council","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); University of Sydney, China Studies Center; ARC Discovery project Forecasting soil conditions(Australian Research Council); LE STUDIUM Loire Valley Institute for Advanced Studies through its LE STUDIUM Research Consortium Programme; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41771246 and 42071062).

We assessed the vulnerability to climate change of 993 terrestrial and coastal-marine Brazilian PAs by combining indicators of climatic-change hazard with indicators of PA resilience (size, native vegetation cover, and probability of climate-driven vegetation transition). This combination of indicators allows the identification of broad climate-change adaptation pathways. Seventeen PAs (20,611 km(2)) were highly vulnerable and located mainly in the Atlantic Forest (7 PAs), Cerrado (6), and the Amazon (4). Two hundred fifty-eight PAs (756,569 km(2)), located primarily in Amazonia, had a medium vulnerability. In the Amazon and western Cerrado, the projected severe climatic change and probability of climate-driven vegetation transition drove vulnerability up, despite the generally good conservation status of PAs. Over 80% of PAs of high or moderate vulnerability are managed by indigenous populations. Hence, besides the potential risks to biodiversity, the traditional knowledge and livelihoods of the people inhabiting these PAs may be threatened. In at least 870 PAs, primarily in the Atlantic Forest and Amazon, adaptation could happen with little or no intervention due to low climate-change hazard, high resilience status, or both. At least 20 PAs in the Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, and Amazonia should be targeted for stronger interventions (e.g., improvement of ecological connectivity), given their low resilience status. Despite being a first attempt to link vulnerability and adaptation in Brazilian PAs, we suggest that some of the PAs identified as highly or moderately vulnerable should be prioritized for testing potential adaptation strategies in the near future.","[Lapola, David M.; Braga, Diego R.] Univ Estadual Campinas, Ctr Meteorol & Climat Res Appl Agr, BR-13083886 Campinas, SP, Brazil; [da Silva, Jose Maria C.] Univ Miami, Dept Geog & Reg Studies, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Braga, Diego R.; Carpigiani, Larissa; Ogawa, Fernanda] Sao Paulo State Univ, Dept Ecol, BR-13506900 Rio Claro, SP, Brazil; [Torres, Roger R.] Univ Fed Itajuba, Nat Resources Inst, BR-37500903 Itajuba, MG, Brazil; [Barbosa, Luis C.

While mean state and variability changes have been studied separately, much less is known about their combined impact or relative importance. Additionally, studies of projected changes in ENSO have tended to focus on changes in, or adjacent to, the Pacific. Here we examine projected changes in climatic conditions during El Nino years and in ENSO-driven precipitation variability in 36 CMIP5 models. The models are forced according to the RCP8.5 scenario in which there are large, unmitigated increases in greenhouse gas concentrations during the twenty-first century. We examine changes over much of the globe, including 25 widely spread regions defined in the IPCC special report Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX). We confirm that precipitation variability associated with ENSO is projected to increase in the tropical Pacific, consistent with earlier research. We also find that the enhanced tropical Pacific variability drives ENSO-related variability increases in 19 SREX regions during DJF and in 18 during JJA. This externally forced increase in ENSO-driven precipitation variability around the world is on the order of 15%-20%. An increase of this size, although substantial, is easily masked at the regional level by internally generated multidecadal variability in individual runs. The projected changes in El Ntho driven precipitation variability are typically much smaller than projected changes in both mean state and ENSO neutral conditions in nearly all regions.","[Power, Scott B.; Delage, Francois P.

There is a gap in this research area centred in the Australian disaster context. Since Australia is predicted to be highly impacted by the effects of climate change in the form of an increased incidence of flooding, an urgent need exists to examine the factors that confer resilience to disaster-impacted localities to inform suitable disaster mitigation and adaptation policies for the future. Because of the complexity of community resilience and its interrelationship with individual resilience, a multi-method approach was used: a demographic study to assess community stability and functioning before and after the flood disaster, focus group interviews to obtain from community members their views on what supported them and their community resilience and a survey to generalise the interview findings. Our operating hypothesis was that individuals remaining in the town post-flood were likely to be resilient to the flood disaster. The demographic study results pointed to a resilient community after the floods as they reflected stability in population numbers and socio-economic indicators. The interviews and survey showed that individual resilience was promoted by social connectedness and a sense of place, a factor that was also negatively linked to the desire to relocate from the community. The use of structural equation modelling of our results provided verification of prior research findings about the role of sense of place in supporting individuals' resilience. Results are discussed in the context of future climate change adaptation policy.","James Cook Univ, Sch Educ, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",James Cook University,"Boon, HJ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Sch Educ, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",Helen.Boon@jcu.edu.au,"Boon, Helen Joanna/L-3239-2016; Boon, Helen/AAE-9909-2020","Boon, Helen Joanna/0000-0003-3842-9622; Boon, Helen/0000-0003-3842-9622",Australian Government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency); National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility,Australian Government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency)(Australian Government); National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility,This work was carried out with financial support from the Australian Government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) and the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility.,,49,68,68,10,110,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

The few existing systematic studies of these plans have focused on either adaptation or mitigation issues, and are typically based on surveys completed by city officials rather than analysis of documented evidence. To gain insight into the status of adaptation and mitigation action across the UK, climate change documents from 30 urban areas (representing similar to 28 % of the UK's population) were analysed. An Urban Climate Change Preparedness Score, which could be applied to other urban areas outside the UK, has been devised for comparative analysis. This analysis characterizes progress against (i) Assessment, (ii) Planning, (iii) Action, and (iv) Monitoring, for both adaptation and mitigation. The Preparedness Score allows a quantitative comparison of climate change strategies across the urban areas analysed. This methodology can be transferred to other countries and makes an international comparison of urban areas and their climate change adaptation and mitigation plans possible. We found that all areas acknowledge climate change being a threat and that adaptation and mitigation planning and action is required. However, two urban areas did not have official adaptation or mitigation plans. Typically, mitigation activities across all cities were more advanced than adaptation plans. Emissions reduction targets ranged from 10 %-80 % with differing baselines, timeframes and scopes, for defining and meeting these targets. Similar variability was observed across adaptation plans. Several reasons for these differences are considered, but particularly notable is that a combination of incentives and regulation seem to stimulate more comprehensive strategies and action in many urban areas.","[Heidrich, Oliver; Dawson, Richard J.; Walsh, Claire L.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Heidrich, Oliver; Dawson, Richard J.; Walsh, Claire L.] Newcastle Univ, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Reckien, Diana] Columbia Univ, Ctr Res Environm Decis, New York, NY 10027 USA",Newcastle University - UK; Newcastle University - UK; Columbia University,"Heidrich, O (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",Oliver.heidrich@ncl.ac.uk; richard.dawson@newcastle.ac.uk; dianareckien@columbia.edu; claire.walsh@newcastle.ac.uk,"Reckien, Diana/P-7348-2015; WALSH, CLAIRE L/B-7932-2008; Dawson, Richard/D-6933-2011","Reckien, Diana/0000-0002-1145-9509; Dawson, Richard/0000-0003-3158-5868; Heidrich, Oliver/0000-0002-6581-5572; Walsh, Claire/0000-0002-4047-1216","European Science Foundation [TU0902]; Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council Fellowship [EP/H003630/1]; German Research Foundation [RE 2927/2-1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/G061254/1, EP/G061254/2, EP/H003630/1, EP/G013403/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/G061254/1, EP/H003630/1, EP/G013403/1, EP/G061254/2] Funding Source: UKRI",European Science Foundation(European Science Foundation (ESF)European Commission); Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This analysis was made possible through a European Science Foundation funded COST Action network (TU0902): Integrated assessment technologies to support the sustainable development of urban areas.

We suggest that only clubs focused on climate adaptation could help cities signal their resilience to climate risks and their ability to service their municipal bonds. Yet, club membership is only a signal of intent. By itself, it does not offer concrete evidence that cities have adopted adaptation policies or enhanced their resilience to climate risks. We examine three climate clubs: ICLEI, whose membership obligations cover climate and other environmental issues; C40, whose scope covers both climate mitigation and adaptation; and 100 Resilient Cities (100RC), which focuses on adaptation only. Employing a two-way fixed effects model for a panel of 80 US cities from 1995 to 2018, we find that 100RC membership leads to a small improvement in bond ratings. This has important policy implications: Assurances about implementing adaptation policy, as opposed to evidence about how adaptation reduces climate risks, could have spillover effects on municipal finance. In such cases, climate adaptation could have tangible implications for city-level finances.","[Ko, Inhwan; Prakash, Aseem] Univ Washington, Dept Polit Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Prakash, A (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Polit Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",inhwanko@uw.edu; aseem@uw.edu,,"Ko, Inhwan/0000-0003-4787-1666",,,,,72,1,1,1,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The framework incorporates a range of diverse indicators, from ones that are related to demographic characteristics to others that represent economic and infrastructure features. As such, the framework encapsulates multiple and complex dimensions of socio-economic vulnerability rather than deriving a less nuanced single index; this is an approach that, whilst more commonly employed elsewhere, may mask critical features of socioeconomic vulnerability at local levels. The paper describes the piloting of the SVIF as it quantifies and visually summarizes the susceptibility and resilience of four townships (Mailiao, Kauho, Linbian and Jiadong) along the exposed coast of Southwest Taiwan. The paper demonstrates the SVIF's potential in characterizing specific aspects of socio-economic vulnerability that local decision-makers could use to tailor local adaptation. The SVIF was successful in differentiating between the four local areas, highlighting clear differences between urban and rural townships. With further development by using a more participative approach and expanding its application to wider geographical contexts both in Taiwan and further afield, the authors are confident that the SVIF has the potential to provide a useful tool for local adaptation.","[Jhan, Hao-Tang; Ting, Kuo-Huan] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Marine Affairs & Business Management, Kaohsiung 81157, Taiwan; [Ballinger, Rhoda; Jaleel, Azmath] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff CF10 3AT, Wales",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; Cardiff University,"Jhan, HT (corresponding author), Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Marine Affairs & Business Management, Kaohsiung 81157, Taiwan.",jhanht@nkust.edu.tw; ballingerrc@cardiff.ac.uk; azmathjaleel@hotmail.com; dgh0809@nkust.edu.tw,,,,,,,129,9,9,1,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB 2,2020,12,4,,,,,,,1585,10.3390/su12041585,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12041585,,,27,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KY3GT,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000522460200303,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the key influences on what trajectory is adopted in different instances have yet to be explored in depth. This article highlights and explores an emerging connection between climate adaptation, sustainable urban design and regeneration or what is termed the 'green adaptation-regeneration nexus'. This is identified as an ambiguous phenomenon which could instantiate more integrated and collaborative models of planning or, alternatively, denote an intensified economic focus. The implications of the green adaptation-urban regeneration nexus are explored through two case studies of combined climate adaptation and regeneration projects in Sheffield and Copenhagen. The key finding is that both projects' institutional setting within pre-existing regeneration planning frameworks has been a key influence in both enabling and constraining community participation. The article's key contribution is to highlight the inadequacy of inherited and often flawed planning frameworks from the perspective of realizing innovative, socially and ecologically sustainable approaches to design in an increasingly important sector of urban planning and design practice.","[Tubridy, Daniel] Univ Sheffield, Urban Studies & Planning, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Tubridy, Daniel] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Architecture Planning & Environm Policy, Dublin 4, Ireland",University of Sheffield; University College Dublin,"Tubridy, D (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Architecture Planning & Environm Policy, Dublin 4, Ireland.",daniel.tubridy@ucd.ie,,"Tubridy, Fiadh/0000-0002-1934-6883",,,,,71,6,6,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0965-4313,1469-5944,,EUR PLAN STUD,Eur.

With per capita water resources at a quarter of the world average level, China is one of the most water-scarce countries. Employing a single stage Stochastic Frontier Analysis, this paper studies the impact of climate change induced fluctuation in temperature and precipitation on agricultural water (AW) use efficiency in China and addresses its volatility and regional disparity over time and across region. We utilize fine-scale meteorological factors including temperature, precipitation, crop growing degree days and crop harmful degree days to proxy the changing climate condition. Our results reveal temperature-related cli-mate change factors such as average annual temperature, crop growing degree days and crop harmful degree days demonstrate the negative impacts on AW use efficiency, and the decline in precipitation due to climate change lowers AW use efficiency. More importantly, we find that when the information on climate damage is provided to farmers, the negative effect of climate change on AW use efficiency can be alleviated. Furthermore, we conclude that the North China Plain, Southwest and Northeast regions with shortages of water endowment have the best AW use efficiency, followed by the Yangtze River Basin and the Northwest region. The South Coast region with ample water sources has the poorest performance. We therefore conclude that AW use effi-ciency in China is affected by climate change, with heterogeneous impacts across regions.

A variety of actors have argued that these natural solutions-variously involving the protection, conservation, restoration, management, enhancement, or imitation of natural ecosystems-can play a crucial role in both mitigating and adapting to climate change. What is more, by virtue of their label, natural solutions promise to be particularly attractive to the public and policymakers and have received significant media and scholarly attention. But what is natural is also social: people, acting in various social groups, can selectively emphasize or deemphasize certain characteristics of climate solutions to make them seem more or less natural. The framing of particular solutions as natural or unnatural has far-reaching implications for climate policy, but has thus far been overlooked. Here, we undertake a critical review of the ways in which natural solutions to climate change have been framed and examine the normative and practical implications of this framing. We review what counts (and what does not count) as a natural solution, and find that those labeled natural are routinely framed under technical and social appraisal criteria as being more beneficial, cost effective, mature, and democratic than ostensibly artificial counterparts. And yet we show that, under greater scrutiny, the natural framing obscures the reality that natural solutions can be just as risky, expensive, immature, and technocratic. We conclude by reflecting on the dangers of narrowing the range of solutions considered natural and indeed, of selecting solutions through recourse to nature at all. Rather, climate solutions must be evaluated in terms of their specific qualities, against a far broader range of framings.

We argue that, while the Green-Win proposition is central to many state and expert models of sustainability transitions, as a construction, it belies more complex trade-offs and cognitive models of sustainability and societal transitions. Cultural models are cognitive representations shared by a community which provide both models of the world, which aid in interpreting what is in the world, how it works, what is possible (or not) and why, and models for the world, which suggest how to act in it to bring about desired outcomes (cf. Geertz 1973). We surveyed 225 respondents in Shanghai, China, Istanbul, Turkey, and Beirut, Lebanon to assess their basic beliefs about sustainability, specifically whether it is possible to implement concrete practices that realize environmental sustainability goals in conjunction with economic development-the Green-Win proposition. We found important similarities and differences among urban stakeholders' cultural models of sustainable development. For example, Chinese and Lebanese respondents displayed a strong belief that economic growth and environmental sustainability are compatible, while Turkish respondents showed significant disagreement with this proposition. We argue that such basic notions about the possibility of Green-Win opportunities between environmental sustainability and economic development are important to understand in the context of mitigating and adapting to climate change in critical urban environments. Cultural models of and for green development may either enable or inhibit transformations in urban systems according to local conditions. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of cultural models' research for targeting communications and engendering collaborations among diverse stakeholders in order to align perspectives and overcome barriers that may otherwise limit successful visioning, planning, and implementation for transformation towards sustainable development.","[Thornton, Thomas F.; Ma, Yuge] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England; [Thornton, Thomas F.] Univ Alaska Southeast, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Mangalagiu, Diana] Neoma Business Sch, Mont St Aignan, France; [Lan, Jing] Tongji Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Yazar, Mahir; Saysel, Ali Kerem] Bogazici Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Chaar, Abdel Maoula] ESA Business Sch, Beirut, Lebanon",University of Oxford; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Southeastern; NEOMA Business School; Tongji University; Bogazici University,"Thornton, TF (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England.;Thornton, TF (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Southeast, Juneau, AK 99801 USA.",thomas.thornton@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Yazar, Mahir/HPH-3673-2023; Thornton, Tom/AAJ-5105-2020; Chaar, Abdel-Maoula/F-4687-2019","Thornton, Thomas F./0000-0002-1065-5495; Saysel, Ali Kerem/0000-0001-7524-1050",,,,,38,9,9,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The mitigation and adaptation to climate change, however, are offering tremendous business opportunities around the world, especially for businesses operating in the agri-food, energy, finance, and health sectors, water infrastructure, built environments, and other relevant services. When the severity of heat waves is considered, for instance, it would become quite clear that the demand for cooling would accelerate, putting further stress on energy supply and increasing the risk of electricity black outs. Similarly, the projections also provide warnings about increased drought risk in many regions around the globe, and even worse, it should also be emphasized that 60% more food will be needed globally, while 100% more demand for food is projected in developing countries by the year 2050. While all these are being projected, we are experiencing progressively increasing stress on our global freshwater resources, which are worsened further by climate change-driven impacts and water pollution. Consequently, reducing agri-food production systems' susceptibility to climate change and strengthening the resilience of such systems are extremely important to sustain and improve the livelihoods of billions of people around the globe. Moreover, reducing emissions due to fossil fuels consumption and production is vital for the whole global population, and agri-food and energy sectors have tremendous potentials for reducing inefficiencies and emissions while simultaneously playing their crucial roles in food and energy security as well as poverty reduction. Both of these sectors are facing significant climate change-driven challenges, which provide ample opportunities for cutting-edge novel knowledge and innovative products, processes, services, and policies. And due to the reciprocal relationships between climate change and agri-food and energy innovations, in return, complementing the other forms, such innovations will speed up the climate change mitigation and adaptation processes.","[Yildiz, Ilhami] Dalhousie Univ, Fac Grad Studies Halifax, Interdisciplinary PhD Program, Halifax, NS B3H 4H6, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Yildiz, I (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Fac Grad Studies Halifax, Interdisciplinary PhD Program, Halifax, NS B3H 4H6, Canada.",iyildiz@dal.ca,,"YILDIZ, ILHAMI/0000-0003-4893-215X",,,,,65,14,15,0,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0363-907X,1099-114X,,INT J ENERG RES,Int.

Whilst adaptation to climate change is necessary to ensure food security and protect livelihoods of poor farmers, mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can lessen the extent of climate change and future needs for adaptation. Many agricultural practices can potentially mitigate GHG emissions without compromising food production. India is the third largest GHG emitter in the world where agriculture is responsible for 18% of total national emissions. India has identified agriculture as one of the priority sectors for GHG emission reduction in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Identification of emission hotspots and cost-effective mitigation options in agriculture can inform the prioritisation of efforts to reduce emissions without compromising food and nutrition security. We adopted a bottom-up approach to analyse GHG emissions using large datasets of India's 'cost of cultivation survey' and the '19th livestock census' together with soil, climate and management data for each location. Mitigation measures and associated costs and benefits of adoption, derived from a variety of sources including the literature, stakeholder meetings and expert opinion, were presented in the form of Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACC). We estimated that by 2030, business-as-usual GHG emissions from the agricultural sector in India would be 515 Megatonne CO2 equivalent (MtCO(2)e) per year with a technical mitigation potential of 85.5 MtCO(2)e per year through adoption of various mitigation practices. About 80% of the technical mitigation potential could be achieved by adopting only cost-saving measures. Three mitigation options, i.e. efficient use of fertilizer, zero-tillage and rice-water management, could deliver more than 50% of the total technical abatement potential. (c) 2018 The Authors.

Two approaches for estimating this potential are presented. Method 1 (M1) considers literature-derived best estimates for annual soil organic carbon (SOC) gains (Mg C ha(-1)) by bioclimatic zone; Method 2 (M2) assumes an annual C increase of 3 to 5 promille with respect to present SOC mass (similar to the French '4 pour mille' initiative). Four management scenarios are considered, capturing the varying level of plausibility of meeting the full technological potential. According to M1, achievable gains range from 0.05-0.12 Pg C yr(-1) to 0.14-0.37 Pg C yr(-1), with a technological potential of 0.32-0.86 Pg C yr(-1). For M2, these are 0.07-0.12 Pg C yr(-1), 0.21-0.35 Pg C yr(-1), and 0.60-1.01 Pg C yr(-1). Consideration of the technological potential only and use of a proportional annual increase in SOC (M2), rather than using best estimates for soil carbon gains by bioclimatic zone (M1), will provide too 'bright a picture' in the context of rehabilitating degraded lands and mitigating/adapting to climate change. Further, M2 assumes that possible C gains will be greatest where present SOC stocks are highest, which is counter-intuitive. Although all measures aimed at increasing SOC content should be encouraged due to the creation of win-win situations, it is important to create a realistic picture of the amount of SOC gains that are feasible based on bioclimatic and management implementation constraints.","[Batjes, Niels H.] ISRIC World Soil Informat, Wageningen, Netherlands",,"Batjes, NH (corresponding author), ISRIC World Soil Informat, Wageningen, Netherlands.",niels.batjes@wur.nl,"Batjes, Niels H./F-7195-2010","Batjes, Niels H./0000-0003-2367-3067",,,,,62,25,26,2,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1085-3278,1099-145X,,LAND DEGRAD DEV,Land Degrad.

Key solutions are included in the energy and climate package adopted in 2008 and Directive 2012/27/EU, which obliges EU Member States to establish a system to support energy efficiency. Considering these formal requirements, the aim of the article is to diagnose the degree of progress in implementing the assumptions of the energy and climate package in Poland and to present the results of the analysis in the field of the energy efficiency of the Polish industrial sector. The main problem of the study is to indicate trends in the studied phenomenon in the manufacturing, which in 2016 was responsible for 22.6% of final energy consumption. The study uses an analytical and descriptive method. The concept of sustainable development was characterised based on a review of the literature and source documents. The research on the progress in the implementation of the energy and climate package was based on a taxonomic measure using the Hellwig's multidimensional comparative analysis method, while the ODEX index was used to assess the energy efficiency of the industrial sector. The study covered the years 2005-2016. The conducted research indicates that the Polish economy should fulfil the objective of the energy and climate package in the field of energy efficiency improvement, and manufacturing is the sector in which changes in this area are the fastest.","[Pach-Gurgul, Agnieszka; Ulbrych, Marta] Uniwersytet Ekon Krakowie, Katedra Miedzynarodowych Stosunkow Gospodarczych, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Pach-Gurgul, A (corresponding author), Uniwersytet Ekon Krakowie, Katedra Miedzynarodowych Stosunkow Gospodarczych, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",apach@uek.krakow.pl; ulbrychm@uek.krakow.pl,,,,,,,20,2,2,0,4,"PEDAGOGICAL UNIV CRACOW, INST GEOGR, DEPT ENTREPRENEURSHIP & SPATIAL MGMT",KRAKOW,"2 PODCHORAZYCH ST, KRAKOW, 30-084, POLAND",2080-1653,2449-903X,,PRACE KOMISJI GEOGRA,Prace Komisji Geogr.

We reviewed the literature dealing with SOC distribution between soil fractions to evaluate carbon saturation for tropical soils and estimate the C storage potential of cropland. We collected 258 data points on SOC distribution between soil fractions in tropical soils from 84 sites in 27 countries. We used boundary line analysis to estimate the maximum stabilized SOC depending on soil group, clay type and land use. SOC storage potential was calculated as the SOC saturation deficit, the difference between the actual SOC content and the maximum stabilized SOC content. We found that the maximum SOC in the fine fraction of tropical soils (53 g C kg(-1) fine fraction) was lower than previous assessments of global SOC storage scale based mainly on temperate soils. The F < 20 mu m fractions were closer to SOC saturation in forest soils than in croplands. The cropland had a higher soil C storage potential, but changing agricultural management practices did not fill the deficit that is calculated using the whole dataset. The deficit was much lower when it was estimated with grassland or cropland data only: this provides a more realistic estimate for SOC storage potential for croplands. The SOC content in the coarser fraction (F > 50 mu m) did not depend on soil texture and significantly contributed to the total SOC, especially in sandy soils (41.3%). This is affected by changes in agricultural management practices. We concluded that, although the aim of increasing SOC stabilization originally arose from climate change mitigation strategies, it must now be more viewed as being more relevant to food security and local adaptation to climate change.","[Fujisaki, Kenji; Chapuis-Lardy, Lydie; Albrecht, Alain; Chotte, Jean-Luc; Chevallier, Tiphaine] Univ Montpellier, INRA, CIRAD, Montpellier SupAgro,Eco & Sols,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Razafimbelo, Tantely] Univ Antananarivo, Lab Radioisotopes, BP,3383 Route Andraisoro, Antananarivo 101, Madagascar",INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; University Antananarivo,"Fujisaki, K (corresponding author), UMR Eco & Sols, Campus SupAgro,Batiment 12,2 Pl Vials, F-34060 Montpellier 2, France.",kenji.fujisaki@ird.fr,"LARDY, Lydie/AAS-6313-2021; Chevallier, Tiphaine/F-9151-2011; LARDY, Lydie/B-5324-2009; CHOTTE, Jean-Luc/A-5813-2009","LARDY, Lydie/0000-0003-0393-3239; Chevallier, Tiphaine/0000-0001-8285-3856; LARDY, Lydie/0000-0003-0393-3239; Fujisaki, Kenji/0000-0001-5067-2567; Razafimbelo, Tantely M./0000-0003-2101-9715",ECOBIO department of IRD,ECOBIO department of IRD,K.F. received support from the ECOBIO department of IRD.

A long-term assessment of resilience in CIS requires understanding the transformation of CIS caused by climate change stressors and adaptation decision-making behaviors of institutional agencies. In addition, resilience assessment for CIS includes significant uncertainty regarding future climate change scenarios and subsequent impacts. Thus, resilience analysis in CIS under climate change impacts need to capture complex adaptive behaviors and uncertainty in order to enable robust planning and decision-making. This paper presents a system-of-systems (SoS) framework for abstraction and integrated modeling of climate change stressors, physical infrastructure performance, and institutional actors' decision-making processes. The application of the proposed SoS framework is shown in an illustrative example related to the impacts of sea level rise and subsequent saltwater intrusion on a water system. Through the use of the proposed SoS framework, various attributes, processes, and interactions related to physical infrastructure and actor's decision-making were abstracted and used in the creation of a computational simulation model. Then, the computational model was used to simulate various scenarios composed of sea level rise and adaptation approaches. Through an exploratory analysis approach, the simulated scenario landscape was used to identify robust adaptation pathways that lead to a greater system resilience under future uncertain sea level rise. The results of the illustrative example highlight the various novel capabilities of the SoS framework: (i) abstraction of various attributes and processes that affect the long-term resilience of infrastructure under climate change; (ii) integrated modeling of CIS transformation based on simulating the adaptive decision-making processes, physical infrastructure performance, and climate change impacts; and (iii) exploratory analysis and identification of robust pathways for adaptation to climate change impacts.","[Mostafavi, Ali] Texas A&M Univ, Zachry Dept Civil Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Mostafavi, A (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Zachry Dept Civil Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",mostafavi@tamu.edu,,,National Science Foundation (NSF) Sustainability Research Network (SRN) [1444758],National Science Foundation (NSF) Sustainability Research Network (SRN)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) Sustainability Research Network (SRN) Cooperative Agreement [grant number 1444758].,,48,24,24,0,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2378-9689,2378-9697,,SUSTAIN RESIL INFRAS,Sustain.

However, the mechanisms of how climatic trend and fluctuations affect crop yields are not well understood and need to be further investigated. Thus, using the GIS-based Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model, we simulated the yields of major crops (i.e., wheat, maize, and rice) and evaluated the impacts of climatic factors on crop yields in the Agro-Pastoral Transitional Zone (APTZ) of northern China between 1980 and 2010. The partial least squares regression model was used to assess the contribution rates of climatic factors (i.e., precipitation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), minimum temperature (T-min), maximum temperature (T-max)) to the variation of crop yields. The Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) model was adopted to decompose the climate factors into trend and fluctuation components, and the relative contributions of climate trend and fluctuation were then evaluated. The results indicated that the contributions of climatic factors to yield variations of wheat, maize, and rice were 31.7, 37.7, and 23.1%, respectively. That is, climate change had larger impacts on maize than wheat and rice. More cultivated areas were significantly and positively correlated with precipitation than with other climatic factors due to the limited precipitation in the APTZ. Also, climatic trend component had positive impacts on crop yields in the whole region, whereas the climate fluctuation was associated mainly with the areas where the crop yields decreased. This study helps improve our understanding of the mechanisms of climate change impacts on crop yields, and provides useful scientific information for designing regional-scale strategies of adaptation to climate change.","[Qiao, Jianmin; Yu, Deyong; Liu, Yupeng] Beijing Normal Univ, CHESS, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Fac Geog Sci, 19 XinJieKouWai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Yu, DY (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, CHESS, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Fac Geog Sci, 19 XinJieKouWai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",dyyucas@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41571170]; Fund for Creative Research Groups of National Natural Science Foundation of China [41621061]; 111 project Hazard and Risk Science Base at Beijing Normal University [B08008]; Ministry of Education and State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs of China; Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology through the National Basic Research Program of China [2014CB954301, 2014CB954300]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fund for Creative Research Groups of National Natural Science Foundation of China; 111 project Hazard and Risk Science Base at Beijing Normal University; Ministry of Education and State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs of China; Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology through the National Basic Research Program of China,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant 41571170, Fund for Creative Research Groups of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41621061), the 111 project Hazard and Risk Science Base at Beijing Normal University under Grant B08008, Ministry of Education and State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs of China, and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology through the National Basic Research Program of China (2014CB954301, 2014CB954300).

To use these scenarios as a global context that is relevant for policy guidance at regional and national levels, they have to be connected to an exploration of drivers and challenges informed by regional expertise. In this paper, we present scenarios for West Africa developed by regional stakeholders and quantified using two global economic models, GLOBIOM and IMPACT, in interaction with stakeholder-generated narratives and scenario trends and SSP assumptions. We present this process as an example of linking comparable scenarios across levels to increase coherence with global contexts, while presenting insights about the future of agriculture and food security under a range of future drivers including climate change. In these scenarios, strong economic development increases food security and agricultural development. The latter increases crop and livestock productivity leading to an expansion of agricultural area within the region while reducing the land expansion burden elsewhere. In the context of a global economy, West Africa remains a large consumer and producer of a selection of commodities. However, the growth in population coupled with rising incomes leads to increases in the region's imports. For West Africa, climate change is projected to have negative effects on both crop yields and grassland productivity, and a lack of investment may exacerbate these effects. Linking multi-stakeholder regional scenarios to the global SSPs ensures scenarios that are regionally appropriate and useful for policy development as evidenced in the case study, while allowing for a critical link to global contexts.

Locally, sea level can strongly deviate from the global mean rise due to changes in wind and ocean currents. In addition, gravitational adjustments redistribute seawater away from shrinking ice masses. However, the land ice contribution to sea level rise (SLR) remains very challenging to model, and comprehensive regional sea level projections, which include appropriate gravitational adjustments, are still a nascent field (Katsman et al., 2011; Slangen et al., 2011). Here, we present an alternative approach to derive regional sea level changes for a range of emission and land ice melt scenarios, combining probabilistic forecasts of a simple climate model (MAG-ICC6) with the new CMIP5 general circulation models. The contribution from ice sheets varies considerably depending on the assumptions for the ice sheet projections, and thus represents sizeable uncertainties for future sea level rise. However, several consistent and robust patterns emerge from our analysis: at low latitudes, especially in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific, sea level will likely rise more than the global mean (mostly by 10-20 %). Around the northeastern Atlantic and the northeastern Pacific coasts, sea level will rise less than the global average or, in some rare cases, even fall. In the northwestern Atlantic, along the American coast, a strong dynamic sea level rise is counteracted by gravitational depression due to Greenland ice melt; whether sea level will be above-or below-average will depend on the relative contribution of these two factors. Our regional sea level projections and the diagnosed uncertainties provide an improved basis for coastal impact analysis and infrastructure planning for adaptation to climate change.","[Perrette, M.; Frieler, K.; Meinshausen, M.] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Landerer, F.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Riva, R.] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Geosci & Remote Sensing, Delft, Netherlands; [Riva, R.] Delft Univ Technol, TU Delft Climate Inst, Delft, Netherlands",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); Delft University of Technology; Delft University of Technology,"Perrette, M (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Telegraphenberg A26, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",mahe.perrette@pik-potsdam.de,"Meinshausen, Malte/A-7037-2011; Meinshausen, Malte/AAG-7985-2019; Meinshausen, Malte/AAG-6505-2019; Landerer, Felix W/ABG-2849-2021; Perrette, Mahé/B-8712-2016","Meinshausen, Malte/0000-0003-4048-3521; Meinshausen, Malte/0000-0003-4048-3521; Landerer, Felix W/0000-0003-2678-095X; Perrette, Mahé/0000-0002-6309-4863; Riva, Riccardo/0000-0002-2042-5669; Frieler, Katja/0000-0003-4869-3013","Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (Germany) [SURVIVE 11_II_093_Global_A_SIDS _and_LDC]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Federal Environment Agency for Germany (UBA) under project UFOPLAN [FKZ 370841103]","Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (Germany); National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Federal Environment Agency for Germany (UBA) under project UFOPLAN","We thank B.

Design/methodology/approach - Primary data from 116 female-headed households (FHHs) and 184 male-headed households (MHHs) is examined for the three Northern provinces of Cameroon. The survey generated information on the response and coping strategies to climatic variation; and the socioeconomic impacts of climate on households. The multinomial logit model is employed to establish the determinants of the choice selection for climate risk coping options by households. Findings - Both and MHHs are exposed to stresses related to food production and availability, low incomes and food accessibility and utilization of food supplies, heightened by the real and perceived effects of the variability of current climate. Short-term coping choices include diversification of livelihood which in turn impacts food accessibility and consumption choices. Practical implications - A seasonal pattern is revealed in household expenditure with households spending more than 70 percent of their income on food in spring. The lowest food expenditures are in summer. Market and income manipulation choices for food supply stability include a range of non-farm income generation strategies to cope with expected shortages induced by climatic variability. The current climate variation, household demography, and farming conditions via access to credit, tenure, and extension service delivery are significant determinants of coping choices for households perceiving change in climatic patterns. Originality/value - Significant seasonal patterns in household food availability, accessibility and utilization are observed with important implications for both household welfare and as precursor to long-term adaptation to climate change.","Univ Buea, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Buea, Cameroon",,"Molua, EL (corresponding author), Univ Buea, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Buea, Cameroon.",emolua@gmx.net,,"MOLUA, ERNEST/0000-0001-8724-6035",,,,,96,13,13,1,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

These early assessments, internationally and in New Zealand, provided a limited view of 'smart farmer' adaptation. While impact assessment provides some useful insights, experience with vulnerability and adaptation assessment provides a more appropriate foundation for understanding and characterising practical smart farmer adaptation. Findings are presented from 8 years of engagement with farmers in eastern regions of New Zealand. A comprehensive farm resilience picture has emerged from this work. This picture reflects a strong belief from real-world smart farmers that there is sufficient knowledge and experience to adapt to climate change. Proactive farmers are already reading multiple signals, including changes in climate, and are responding. The farm resilience picture provides a foundation for exploring alternative adaptation options and pathways for agriculture. These are presented and discussed in response to two proposed climate change scenarios, a high carbon world scenario and a rapidly decarbonising world scenario. Knowledge intensive, low input systems are consistent with the resilience picture drawn from farmers. Such systems are also consistent with a rapidly decarbonising world scenario and, it is argued, are likely to become increasingly attractive under a high carbon world scenario. A smart farming approach, focused on resilience, provides the basis for development of a response capacity, with potentially significant co-benefits in terms of adaptation and mitigation to climate change. Wider issues and needs to support the further development of farm resilience, and more widely landscape or regional resilience, are identified and discussed. It is apparent from this work that ongoing engagement with smart farmers, focused on resilience, can contribute significantly to development of a coordinated 'bottom up' and 'top down' response capacity. Addressing the psychology of change is a fundamental need to ensure wider engagement.","Earthwise Consulting Ltd, Hastings, New Zealand",,"Kenny, G (corresponding author), Earthwise Consulting Ltd, Hastings, New Zealand.",gavinkenny@clear.net.nz,,,NZ Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; Hawke's Bay Regional Council; Environment Bay of Plenty; NZ Parliamentary Commission for the Environment,NZ Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; Hawke's Bay Regional Council; Environment Bay of Plenty; NZ Parliamentary Commission for the Environment,"Thanks are due to the farmers and growers who have willingly shared their practical wisdom with me.

To overcome these limitations, various evaporation demand-based drought indices have been proposed, focusing on the aspect of atmospheric moisture demand. However, drought indices that consider only precipitation or the demand for atmospheric evaporation are difficult to comprehensively interpret drought caused by various climatic factors. The novelty of this study is to propose a new drought index to simultaneously monitor droughts occurring in terms of atmospheric moisture supply and demand. The proposed Copula-based Joint Drought Index (CJDI) combines the Standardized Precipitation Index and the Evaporative Demand Drought Index using copula. Since CJDI reflects the correlation between the two drought indices, it is shown that CIDI can better monitor Korea's past droughts than other drought indices. It is found that quantification of past drought using CJDI can be used to objectively recognize the level of drought currently in progress by combining with drought severity-duration-frequency curves derived from partial duration series. As a result of analyzing the future drought pattern in Korea, it was revealed that the drought would be alleviated by about 11% in the case of SPI and SPEI, but the drought would intensify by about 89% in the case of EDDI. In the case of CJDI, it is projected that the drought is likely to intensify to about 17%. From the perspective of better reproducing past droughts and projecting a more convincing future drought than other drought indices, CJDI is expected to be fully utilized as a drought index to monitor droughts and establish climate change adaptation policies.

This paper aims to provide a better understanding of the state of knowledge on urban resilience assessment through mapping the knowledge domain and highlighting emerging trends during different periods. The objects of study were 420 papers published in the Web of Science from 1998 to 2020. Science mapping was done using VOSviewer and CiteSpace, two widely known software tools for bibliometrics analysis and scientometric visualization. The results show that research published on urban resilience assessment was very limited and fragmented until 2009, and the focus has mainly been on risk mitigation and vulnerability assessment. The intellectual base grew between 2010 and 2014, when a paradigm shift from approaches based on robustness and reliability toward more adaptation-oriented approaches occurred. Finally, the annual publication trends have grown rapidly over the past five years and there has been more emphasis on climate change adaptation and flood resilience. Overall, in terms of dimensional focus, more attention has been paid to infrastructural, institutional, and environmental aspects at the expense of social and economic dimensions. In addition to information on thematic focus and evolution, this paper also provides other bibliometrics information on the influential authors, institutions, journals, and publications that lay the foundation of the field and can be used by various interested groups as points of reference to gain better knowledge about the structure and thematic evolution of urban resilience assessment. The paper concludes by highlighting gaps and making some recommendations for future improvement of the field. Major gaps are related to assessing resilience against socio-economic and health risks (e.g., economic recession and pandemics such as COVID-19).","[Sharifi, Ayyoob] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Higashihiroshima 7398530, Japan; [Sharifi, Ayyoob] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Adv Sci & Engn, Higashihiroshima 7398530, Japan; [Sharifi, Ayyoob] Hiroshima Univ, Network Educ & Res Peace & Sustainabil NERPS, Higashihiroshima 7398530, Japan",Hiroshima University; Hiroshima University; Hiroshima University,"Sharifi, A (corresponding author), Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Higashihiroshima 7398530, Japan.;Sharifi, A (corresponding author), Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Adv Sci & Engn, Higashihiroshima 7398530, Japan.;Sharifi, A (corresponding author), Hiroshima Univ, Network Educ & Res Peace & Sustainabil NERPS, Higashihiroshima 7398530, Japan.",sharifi@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,"Sharifi, Ayyoob/M-7584-2013","Sharifi, Ayyoob/0000-0002-8983-8613",,,,,69,34,34,47,165,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2020,12,15,,,,,,,5918,10.3390/su12155918,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12155918,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NA0TR,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000559533000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding determinants of smallholder farming practices is critical for designing and implementing successful interventions, including climate change adaptation programs. We examine two dimensions wherein smallholder farmers may adapt agricultural practices; through intensification (i.e., adopt more practices) or diversification (i.e. adopt different practices). We use data on 5314 randomly sampled households located in 38 sites in 15 countries across four regions (East and West Africa, South Asia, and Central America). We estimate empirical models designed to assess determinants of both intensification and diversification of adaptation activities at global scales. Aspects of adaptive capacity that are found to increase intensification of adaptation globally include variables associated with access to information and human capital, financial considerations, assets, household infrastructure and experience. In contrast, there are few global drivers of adaptive diversification, with a notable exception being access to weather information, which also increases adaptive intensification. Investigating reasons for adaptation indicate that conditions present in underdeveloped markets provide the primary impetus for adaptation, even in the context of climate change. We also compare determinants across spatial scales, which reveals a variety of local avenues through which policy interventions can relax economic constraints and boost agricultural adaptation for both intensification and diversification. For example, access to weather information does not affect intensification adaptation in Africa, but is significant at several sites in Bangladesh and India. Moreover, this information leads to diversification of adaptive activities on some sites in South Asia and Central America, but increases specialization in West and East Africa.","[Chen, Minjie; Wichmann, Bruno; Luckert, Marty] Univ Alberta, Fac Agr Life & Environm Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Winowiecki, Leigh] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Nairobi, Kenya; [Forch, Wiebke] GIZ, Gaborone, Botswana; [Laderach, Peter] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Decis & Policy Anal DAPA, Hanoi, Vietnam",University of Alberta; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF); Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT,"Laderach, P (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Decis & Policy Anal DAPA, Hanoi, Vietnam.",p.laderach@cgiar.org,,"Chen, Minjie/0000-0002-0794-8561; Laderach, Peter/0000-0001-8708-6318; Wichmann, Bruno/0000-0003-1104-0035",CGIAR Fund,CGIAR Fund(CGIAR),"This work was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.

Objectives: To determine the effect of indoor and outdoor heat exposure on COPD morbidity and to determine whether air pollution concentrations modify the effect of temperature. Methods: Sixty-nine participants with COPD were enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study, and data from the 601 participant days that occurred during the warm weather season were included in the analysis. Participants completed home environmental monitoring with measurement of temperature, relative humidity, and indoor air pollutants and simultaneous daily assessment of respiratory health with questionnaires and portable spirometry. Measurements and Main Results: Participants had moderate to severe COPD and spent the majority of their time indoors. Increases in maximal indoor temperature were associated with worsening of daily Breathlessness, Cough, and Sputum Scale scores and increases in rescue inhaler use. The effect was detected on the same day and lags of 1 and 2 days. The detrimental effect of temperature on these outcomes increased with higher concentrations of indoor fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide (P < 0.05 for interaction terms). On days during which participants went outdoors, increases in maximal daily outdoor temperature were associated with increases in Breathlessness, Cough, and Sputum Scale scores after adjusting for outdoor pollution concentrations. Conclusions: For patients with COPD who spend the majority of their time indoors, indoor heat exposure during the warmer months represents a modifiable environmental exposure that may contribute to respiratory morbidity. In the context of climate change, adaptive strategies that include optimization of indoor environmental conditions are needed to protect this high-risk group from the adverse health effects of heat.","[McCormack, Meredith C.; Belli, Andrew J.; Paulin, Laura; Saha, Anik; Diette, Gregory B.; Hansel, Nadia N.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Pulm & Crit Care, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Matsui, Elizabeth C.; Aloe, Charles M.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Div Allergy & Immunol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [McCormack, Meredith C.; Williams, D'Ann L.; Diette, Gregory B.; Breysse, Patrick N.; Hansel, Nadia N.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Baltimore, MD USA; [Peng, Roger D.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD USA; [Waugh, Darryn] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Johns Hopkins University,"McCormack, MC (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Pulm & Crit Care Med, 1830 East Monument St,5th Floor, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",mmccor16@jhmi.edu,"Waugh, Darryn W/K-3688-2016","Waugh, Darryn W/0000-0001-7692-2798; Matsui, Elizabeth/0000-0001-8134-5593; Koehl, Rachelle/0000-0002-7797-7456; Pham, Hewlett/0000-0003-0330-6104; Paulin, Laura/0000-0003-0265-6858; Ayers, Andrew/0000-0001-5305-7156","National Institutes of Health (NIH)-National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS) [R21ES024021, R21ES015781, R21ES025840, R01 ES022607, R01ES019560, R01 ES023500]; NIH-National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [K24AI114769]; NIEHS/Environmental Protection Agency [P50ES015903/RD83213901, P01ES018176/RD83451001]; NIH-National Institute on Minority and Health Disparities (NIMHD) [P50 MD010431/RD83615201]; Johns Hopkins Environment, Energy, Sustainability, and Health Institutes Faculty Award","National Institutes of Health (NIH)-National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS); NIH-National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)); NIEHS/Environmental Protection Agency; NIH-National Institute on Minority and Health Disparities (NIMHD); Johns Hopkins Environment, Energy, Sustainability, and Health Institutes Faculty Award","Supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS) (R21ES024021 [M.C.M.], R21ES015781 [N.N.H.], R21ES025840 [M.C.M.], R01 ES022607 [N.N.H.], R01ES019560 [R.D.P.], and R01 ES023500 [N.N.H.]), the NIH-National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) (K24AI114769 [E.C.M.]), the NIEHS/Environmental Protection Agency (P50ES015903/RD83213901 [E.C.M. and G.B.D] and P01ES018176/RD83451001 [M.C.M., R.D.P., and N.N.H.]), the NIH-National Institute on Minority and Health Disparities (NIMHD) (P50 MD010431/RD83615201 [M.C.M., R.D.P., and N.N.H.]), and a Johns Hopkins Environment, Energy, Sustainability, and Health Institutes Faculty Award (M.C.M.).",,42,34,34,4,31,AMER THORACIC SOC,NEW YORK,"25 BROADWAY, 18 FL, NEW YORK, NY 10004 USA",1546-3222,2325-6621,,ANN AM THORAC SOC,Ann.

For Switzerland, recent climate change assessments based on the ENSEMBLES regional climate models project for the A1B emission scenario summer mean precipitation to significantly decrease by the end of this century, whereas winter mean precipitation tend to rise in Southern Switzerland. From an end-user perspective, projected changes in seasonal means are often insufficient to adequately address the multifaceted challenges of climate change adaptation. In this study, we investigate the projected changes in seasonal precipitation by considering changes in frequency and intensity, precipitation type (convective vs stratiform) and temporal structure (wet and dry spells) over Switzerland. As proxies for rain-type changes, we rely on the parameterized convective and large-scale precipitation components simulated by the models. The study reveals that the projected summer drying over Switzerland at the end of the century is mainly driven by a widespread reduction in the number of precipitation days. Thereby, the drying evolves altitude-specific: over low-land regions it is associated with a decrease in both convective and large-scale precipitation. Over elevated regions it is primarily associated with a decline in large-scale precipitation only, whereas convective precipitation remains at current levels. As a consequence, almost all the models project an increase in convective fraction at elevated altitudes. The decrease in the number of wet days during summer is accompanied by decreases (increases) in the number of multi-day wet (dry) spells. This future shift in multi-day episodes also lowers down the likelihood of short dry spell occurrence in all of the models. The models further project a higher mean precipitation intensity in spring and autumn north of the Alps, whereas a similar tendency is expected for the winter season over most of Switzerland.","[Fischer, A.

Proportionately, these disasters affect the least developed countries most intensely, proving to be especially harmful to poverty stricken populations. In the future, a changing climate is likely to exacerbate these effects and could make development unsustainable in many places. It is necessary to develop the capacity of all countries to combat hazards so that they do not become disasters. The international framework connects climate change and development, mainly within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Millennium Development Goals and Hyogo Framework for Action on Disaster Risk Reduction, and most recently the Declarations of the G8 and the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate provide further mandates for action. Climate hazards are now clearly linked with issues such as food security, migration, and national security. The linking of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction provides a framework for responding. The development of capacity for knowledge-based reduction of hazards and disasters risk demands an integrated approach that recognizes the changing nature of natural hazards. Further, capacity development must also recognize the limitations in governmental response and facilitate alternate ways to overcome barriers. For example, the role of resilience is examined in order to demonstrate the tools available for policymakers and individuals, to respond to hazards as they occur. The path forward to sustainable development depends on investments in the development and then the utilization of knowledge-based, integrated approaches that factor in the future in balance with the present needs of societies.

Specifically, we ask: 1) are simulated yield responses to low-resolution climate change, after adaptation (without and with increased atmospheric CO2), significantly different from simulated yield responses to high-resolution climate change, after adaptation (without and with increased atmospheric CO2)? and 2) does the scale of the soils information, in addition to the scale of the climate change information, affect yields after adaptation? Equilibrium (1 x CO2 versus 2 x CO2) climate changes are simulated at two different spatial resolutions in the Great Plains using the CSIRO general circulation model (low resolution) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) RegCM2 regional climate model (high resolution). The EPIC crop model is used to simulate the effects of these climate changes; adaptations in EPIC include earlier planting and switch to longer-season cultivars. Adapted yields (without and with additional carbon dioxide) are compared at the different spatial resolutions. Our findings with respect to question 1 suggest adaptation is more effective in most cases when simulated with a higher resolution climate change than its more generalized low resolution equivalent. We are not persuaded that the use of high resolution climate change information provides insights into the direct effects of higher atmospheric CO2 levels on crops beyond what can be obtained with low resolution information. However, this last finding may be partly an artifact of the agriculturally benign CSIRO and RegCM2 climate changes. With respect to question 2, we found that high resolution details of soil characteristics are particularly important to include in adaptation simulations in regions typified by soils with poor water holding capacity.","Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Penn State Univ, Ctr Earth Syst Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Environm & Soc Impacts Grp, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resource Sci, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; Univ Nebraska, Dept Biometry, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Easterling, WE (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,,,,,,,22,42,42,0,15,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

So far, discussions on adaptation tracking have focused on the technocratic reasons for limited progress on adaptation tracking, for example, financial, methodological, and technical capacity gaps. Substantial variation exists in the institutional context within which adaptation takes place and is being tracked. Yet, recent discussions overlook the importance of the extent to which new systems of adaptation tracking fit within the prevailing rules and practices of knowledge production and use. Although such a fit-for-context approach has been considered important in other fields, no adequate frameworks exist to operationalize it within adaptation tracking. We develop a six-dimensional framework for analyzing institutional structures as the first step towards alignment in the design and use of adaptation tracking: 1) stakeholder participation, 2) transparency, 3) bureaucratic accountability, 4) engagement with experts, 5) politico-administrative relations, and 6) coordination within the administration. For each dimension, we synthesize academic literature, provide variables for operationalization, and provide examples drawn from various regions. The resulting framework allows the description of the institutional structures of knowledge production and use and supports the context-specific design of new programs, tools, and practices for tracking adaptation progress.","[Njuguna, Lucy; Biesbroek, Robbert; Dewulf, Art] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Njuguna, Lucy; Crane, Todd A.] Int Livestock Res Inst ILRI, Nairobi, Kenya; [Tamas, Peter] Wageningen Univ & Res, Biometr Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Wageningen University & Research,"Njuguna, L (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.;Njuguna, L (corresponding author), Int Livestock Res Inst ILRI, Nairobi, Kenya.",Lucy.Njuguna@wur.nl,"Biesbroek, Robbert/GZZ-4476-2022","Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419; Tamas, Peter/0000-0002-5409-1273",German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); Deut-sche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) through the Fund International Agricultural Research (FIA) [81231239],German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); Deut-sche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) through the Fund International Agricultural Research (FIA),"The work by Lucy Njuguna and Todd Crane is funded through the Program for Climate Smart Livestock (PCSL) which has received financial support from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) commissioned by the Deut-sche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) through the Fund International Agricultural Research (FIA) , grant number: 81231239.",,117,1,1,2,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

These cities differ in urban area and structure as well as in topography and hinterland land-cover features. LCZs were delineated on the basis of a GIS-based classification method. Land surface temperature (LST) was derived from LANDSAT-8 scenes in the period 2013-2018. The first step was to detect seasonal SUHI intensity differences for built LCZ types and LST for land-cover types of LCZ. The results revealed the highest differences in summer and spring, and lowest in winter. The highest SUHI intensity values occur in densely built-up and industrial zones, and the lowest in sparsely-built city outskirts. The coolest LCZs based on LST were dense trees and water areas in spring and summer. The second step aimed to analyze the effects of vegetation on SUHI formation. Hence, 11 land cover subclasses (from dense trees to bush/scrub) were defined in order to research intra-zonal seasonal LST variability. The height and density of vegetation have substantial effects on intra-zonal variability of LST in land-cover types of LCZ, whereas differences between forest subclasses were relatively low. Finally, the character of the vegetation had a substantial influence on intra-zonal LCZ variability of LST and SUHI formation. Further research in this field could contribute to better understanding of micro- and mezzo-climate-scale patterns, as well as better adaptation to climate change in urban areas.","[Geletic, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Comp Sci, Prague 18207 8, Czech Republic; [Geletic, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Lehnert, Michal] Palacky Univ Olomouc, Fac Sci, Dept Geog, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic; [Savic, Stevan; Milosevic, Dragan] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Sci, Climatol & Hydrol Res Ctr, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 3, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Computer Science of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Palacky University Olomouc; University of Novi Sad,"Savic, S (corresponding author), Univ Novi Sad, Fac Sci, Climatol & Hydrol Res Ctr, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 3, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",geletic@cs.cas.cz; stevan.savic@dgt.uns.ac.rs,"Lehnert, Michal/V-2649-2019; Geletič, Jan/U-9763-2018; Savic, Stevan/AAD-5748-2020; Milošević, Dragan/S-5510-2016","Lehnert, Michal/0000-0001-7691-1618; Geletič, Jan/0000-0002-0904-3133; Savic, Stevan/0000-0002-4297-129X; Milošević, Dragan/0000-0001-5050-0052","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Program I (NPU I) [LO1415]; Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [176020]; Palacky University, Olomouc [IGA_PrF_2018_018]; Masaryk University in Brno; Palacky University in Olomouc (Czech Republic); University of Novi Sad (Republic of Serbia);  [RVO: 67985807]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Program I (NPU I); Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia); Palacky University, Olomouc; Masaryk University in Brno; Palacky University in Olomouc (Czech Republic)(Czech Republic Government); University of Novi Sad (Republic of Serbia); ","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Program I (NPU I), grant reference LO1415 and with institutional support, ref.

Climate change has been disrupting the lives of millions of households along the coastal region of Bangladesh. The country has allocated support from its national funds and accessed international funds for the implementation of adaptation interventions. With the focus of the scientific community on climate finance mechanisms and governance at the global and the national level, there is a lacuna in empirical evidence of how climate finance affects risk appraisal and engagement in adaptation measures at the local level. This paper aims to examine how the support from climate finance affects risk appraisal in terms of the perceived probability and severity and the factors which influence risk appraisal. A field survey was conducted on 240 climate finance recipient households (CF HHs) and 120 nonclimate finance recipient households (non-CF HHs) in Galachipa Upazila of Patuakhali District in coastal Bangladesh. The results indicate that both CF and non-CF HHs experience a high probability of facing climatic events in the future; however, CF HHs anticipated a higher severity of impacts of climatic events on different dimensions of their households. With higher income and social capital, the overall risk appraisal decreases for CF HHs. CF HHs have higher engagement in adaptation measures and social groups and maintain alternative sources of income. Climate finance played a critical role in supporting households in understanding the risks that they were facing, assisting them in exploring as well as enhancing their engagement in adaptation options.","[Hussain, Firdaus Ara; Ahmad, Mokbul Morshed] Asian Inst Technol, Sch Environm Resources & Dev SERD, RRDP, Klongluang 12120, Pathum Thani, Thailand",Asian Institute of Technology,"Hussain, FA (corresponding author), Asian Inst Technol, Sch Environm Resources & Dev SERD, RRDP, Klongluang 12120, Pathum Thani, Thailand.",st116549@ait.asia,"Ahmad, Mokbul Morshed/AAE-5819-2020","Ahmad, Mokbul Morshed/0000-0002-4003-0920; Hussain, Firdaus Ara/0000-0002-1268-4206",,,,,37,2,2,1,8,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-9309,1687-9317,,ADV METEOROL,Adv.

The climate is generally wetter in the east becoming drier towards the west of the region. Using a Pressure-State-Response model to select climate-related assessment indicators, a vulnerability assessment to climate change framework of counties in Inner Mongolia was built, which included three layers and 17 indicators. Climate change vulnerability of eight counties in the steppe area of Inner Mongolia was assessed from 1980 to 2009. The results showed that in the past 30 years, climate change vulnerability of eight counties has decreased with the decrease more pronounced after 2000. The lowest value for vulnerability was in 2008. The vulnerability of the western region was higher than that of the eastern region. Counties with a desert ecological system had a higher vulnerability than counties with steppe. Under the background of exposure increasing and sensitivity slightly decreasing, a continuing significant improvement in adaptive capacity is the key reason for a reduction invulnerability of the Inner Mongolia steppe area to climate change. The volatility of the climate on an inter-annual scale can cause changes in vulnerability between years. With the development of the rural economy and increases in national investment in the environment, the vulnerability of the Inner Mongolian steppe has been significantly reduced, but, overall, the vulnerability remains high. Most of the counties are moderately vulnerable, some counties are seriously vulnerable, even extremely vulnerable, and strong measures need to be adopted to strengthen the ability to adapt to climate change.","[Yang, Tingting; Li, Peng; Wu, Xinhong; Hou, Xiangyang] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Grassland Res, Hohhot 010010, Peoples R China; [Liu, Pengtao] Ecol & Agrimeteorol Ctr Inner Mongolia, Hohhot 010051, Peoples R China; [Yao, Guozheng] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Ecol & Environm Sci, Hohhot 010018, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Grassland Research, CAAS; Inner Mongolia Agricultural University","Hou, XY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Grassland Res, Hohhot 010010, Peoples R China.",houxy16@126.com,,,"National Key Basis Research Program of China [2014CB138806]; Important National Natural Science Foundation of China [70933004]; Basic Research Expenses Special Funds of the Central Public Welfare Scientific Research Institutes [1610332014028]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71103185, 71311120089]; Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia [2014BS0331]",National Key Basis Research Program of China; Important National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Basic Research Expenses Special Funds of the Central Public Welfare Scientific Research Institutes; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia,"We thank the editors and two anonymous reviewers of The Rangeland Journal for their thoughtful comments, which helped in improving the manuscripts.

Future climate change predictions agree that changes in rainfall, temperature, and seasonality will impact Ethiopia with dramatic consequences. When, where, and how these changes will transpire has not been adequately addressed. The objective of our study was to model how projected climate change scenarios will spatially and temporally impact cereal production, a dietary staple for millions of Ethiopians. We used Maxent software fit with crop data collected from household surveys and bioclimatic variables from the WorldClim database to develop spatially explicit models of crop production in Ethiopia. Our results were extrapolated to three climate change projections (i.e., Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis, Hadley Centre Coupled Model v3, and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization), each having two emission scenarios. Model evaluations indicated that our results had strong predictability for all four cereal crops with area under the curve values of 0.79, 0.81, 0.79, and 0.83 for teff, maize, sorghum, and barley, respectively. As expected, bioclimatic variables related to rainfall were the greatest predictors for all four cereal crops. All models showed similar decreasing spatial trends in cereal production. In addition, there were geographic shifts in land suitability which need to be accounted for when assessing overall vulnerability to climate change. The ability to adapt to climate change will be critical for Ethiopia's agricultural system and food security. Spatially explicit models will be vital for developing early warning systems, adaptive strategies, and policy to minimize the negative impacts of climate change on food production.","[Evangelista, Paul; Young, Nicholas; Burnett, Jonathan] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80524 USA",Colorado State University,"Evangelista, P (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, B254 NESB, Ft Collins, CO 80524 USA.",paulevan@nrel.colostate.edu,"Evangelista, Paul/D-2315-2016",,Murulle Foundation; Project Mercy,Murulle Foundation; Project Mercy,"The authors would like to thank The Murulle Foundation and Project Mercy for research support; particularly, Ato Bete Demeke for initiating this important project.

Central to the exercise of government in this manner, we argue, are climate change experiments'- purposive interventions in urban socio-technical systems designed to respond to the imperatives of mitigating and adapting to climate change in the city. Drawing on three different concepts - of governance experiments, socio-technical experiments, and strategic experiments - we first develop a framework for understanding the nature and dynamics of urban climate change experiments. We use this conceptual analysis to frame a scoping study of the global dimensions of urban climate change experimentation in a database of 627 urban climate change experiments in 100 global cities. The analysis charts when and where these experiments occur, the relationship between the social and technical aspects of experimentation and the governance of urban climate change experimentation, including the actors involved in their governing and the extent to which new political spaces for experimentation are emerging in the contemporary city. We find that experiments serve to create new forms of political space within the city, as public and private authority blur, and are primarily enacted through forms of technical intervention in infrastructure networks, drawing attention to the importance of such sites in urban climate politics. These findings point to an emerging research agenda on urban climate change experiments that needs to engage with the diversity of experimentation in different urban contexts, how they are conducted in practice and their impacts and implications for urban governance and urban life.","[Bulkeley, Harriet] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Broto, Vanesa Castan] UCL, Bartlett Fac Built Environm, Dev Planning Unit, London WC1H 9EZ, England",Durham University; University of London; University College London,"Bulkeley, H (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",h.a.bulkeley@durham.ac.uk,"Broto, Vanesa Castan/AAF-4485-2021; Bulkeley, Harriet/Y-3348-2019",,ESRC [ES/F037163/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F037163/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,54,544,551,9,197,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-2754,1475-5661,,T I BRIT GEOGR,Trans.

Currently, dairy production has become vulnerable due to climate variability. The main objective of this study is to investigate dairy farmers' perceptions and adaptation strategies towards climate variability and change in West Africa. Individual interviews and focus group discussions were conducted among 900 dairy farmers. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to assess dairy farmers' perception of climate change. Multiple correspondence analysis and hierarchical clustering on principal component analysis were used to access the adaptation strategies of dairy farmers. The results revealed that dairy farmers perceived a decrease in the length of the rainy season and the annual rainfall but an increase in the length of the dry season and the annual temperature that affect their activities. Dairy farmers that fed the cattle mainly with natural pastures, crop residues, and agroindustrial by-products in Benin, Burkina Faso, and Niger, used as climate change adaptation strategies, transhumance in the wetland. They also used animal manure to improve fodder quality and plants to improve milk production and milk conservation. They sold milk or produced local cheese with the remaining unsold milk. Dairy farmers that mainly invested in fodder production and conservation in the climate zones of Mali, sold milk produced to dairies and cheese production units; used plants to improve milk production, pasteurization for milk conservation, and veterinary service for animal care. This study provided relevant information for West African policymakers in designing appropriate policies and programs to assist dairy farmers to improve milk production under climate variability and change.","[Montcho, Marthe; Padonou, Elie Antoine; Sinsin, Brice] Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Agron Sci, Lab Appl Ecol, Calavi, Benin; [Montcho, Marthe] Natl Univ Agr, Sch Anim Husb & Livestock Prod Syst, Ketou, Benin; [Padonou, Elie Antoine] Natl Univ Agr, Sch Trop Forestry, Ketou, Benin; [Montcho, Marlise] Carnegie Mellon Univ Africa, Dept Stat & Data Sci, Kigali, Rwanda; [Mutua, Meshack Nzesei] African Acad Sci, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Abomey Calavi,"Montcho, M (corresponding author), Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Agron Sci, Lab Appl Ecol, Calavi, Benin.;Montcho, M (corresponding author), Natl Univ Agr, Sch Anim Husb & Livestock Prod Syst, Ketou, Benin.",marlisemontchol@gmail.com; nzeseimutua@gmail.com; bsinsin@gmail.com,"Padonou, Elie Antoine/AFS-3719-2022","Padonou, Elie Antoine/0000-0002-5712-2557; MONTCHO, Marthe/0000-0003-0213-3651",Climate Research for Development (CR4D) Postdoctoral Fellowship [CR4D-19-12]; United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DfID) Weather and Climate Information Services for Africa (WISER) programme; African Climate Policy Center (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA),Climate Research for Development (CR4D) Postdoctoral Fellowship; United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DfID) Weather and Climate Information Services for Africa (WISER) programme; African Climate Policy Center (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA),This work was supported through the Climate Research for Development (CR4D) Postdoctoral Fellowship (CR4D-19-12#) implemented by the African Academy of Sciences (AAS) in partnership with the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DfID) Weather and Climate Information Services for Africa (WISER) programme and the African Climate Policy Center (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA).

Green infrastructure provides a wide range of environmental, social, cultural, climate change adaptation, and mitigation benefits. However, for green infrastructure to do so, it needs to be integrated into national policy and city-planning strategies in ways that recognize its value and importance. Consequently, consistency and coherence between policy sectors and levels is essential. The more prominent urban green infrastructure is in national level policy, the easier it will be to ensure coherence and consistency between sectors and levels, as well as avoid national and local initiatives hindering each other's effectiveness. Integrating urban green infrastructure into planning processes should be a priority for all cities, but even more so for those in sub-Saharan Africa, which are undergoing rapid expansion. Here we focus on Malawi, one of the most rapidly urbanizing countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We collated and reviewed national-level and city-level policies and strategies, ranging from housing to transport to biodiversity, in order to determine, based on vertical and horizontal integration processes, whether urban greenspaces and green infrastructure have been incorporated into planning and management priorities. We found little evidence that urban greenspaces and green infrastructure are incorporated into national-level decision-making processes. In contrast, promoting and enhancing urban greenspace and green infrastructure was a priority in planning and strategy documents produced by the Lilongwe and Mzuzu City Councils. Better institutional coordination and policy coherence across national level sectors that affect urban greenspaces and green infrastructure is required if their multiple benefits are to be realized.","[Afionis, Stavros; Dallimer, Martin] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Afionis, Stavros] Cardiff Univ, Sch Law & Policy, Cardiff, Wales; [Mkwambisi, David D.] Malawi Univ Sci & Technol, MUST Inst Ind Res & Innovat, Limbe, Malawi",University of Leeds; Cardiff University,"Dallimer, M (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",m.dallimer@leeds.ac.uk,"Afionis, Stavros/AES-5062-2022","Dallimer, Martin/0000-0001-8120-3309; Afionis, Stavros/0000-0002-0434-5108",UK Government's Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/R002681/1]; NERC [NE/R002681/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Government's Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),Research was funded by the UK Government's Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under grant NE/R002681/1.,,89,4,4,6,19,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

This research aims to understand how climate variability and other stressors are impacting the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in Azamgarh district, eastern Uttar Pradesh, India. Data from 84 smallholder farmers were collected using mixed qualitative and quantitative approaches, including interview and participatory methods, informed by multiple stressor and sustainable livelihood frameworks. Results revealed that farmers are increasingly facing problems caused by the reduced duration and number of rainy days, and erratic rainfall. Anomalies in seasonal cycles (longer summers, shorter winters) seem to have altered the local climate. Farmers reported that repeated drought impacts, even in years of moderate rainfall, are adversely affecting the rice crop, challenging the formal definition of drought. Climate variability, identified as the foremost stressor, often acts as a risk multiplier for ecological (e.g., soil sodicity), socio-economic (e.g., rising costs of cultivation) and political (e.g., mismatching policies and poor extension systems) stressors. In addition to climate stresses, resource-poor marginal groups in particular experienced higher risks resulting from changes in resource management regimes. This study provides an important cue to revisit the formal definitions of normal rainfall and drought, accommodating farmers' perceptions that evenly distributed rainfall, and not total rainfall is a key determinant of crop yields. Though India has developed adaptive measures for climate change and variability, integration of farmers' perceptions of climate and other stressors into such policies can improve the resilience of smallholder farmers, who have hitherto depended largely on autonomous adaptation strategies.","[Singh, Ranjay K.; Singh, Anshuman; Kumar, Satyendra; Sheoran, Parvender; Sharma, D.

Relatively better performing RCM runs are then used to assess projected precipitation changes (for the period 2071-2099 relative to 1977-2005) over the study domain under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario. The performance of RCMs is found to be descriptor and scope specific. Overall, RCA4 (r1i1p1) forced by CNRM-CERFACS-CNRM-CM5 and MPI-M-MPI-ESM-LR, REMO2009 (r1i1p1) forced by MPI-M-MPI-ESM-LR, and RCA4 (r2i1p1) forced by MPI-M-MPI-ESM-LR emerge as the top four RCM runs. We show that an ensemble mean of the top four model runs outperforms an ensemble mean of 24 model simulations and ensemble means for all runs in an RCM. Our analysis of projections shows a reduction (increase) in mean daily precipitation for MAM(OND), an increase(decrease) in CDD(CWD) events, and a general increase in SDII and the width of the right tail of the precipitation distribution (99p-90p). An increase in SDII and 99p-90p implies a possibility of occurrence of heavy and extreme precipitation incidences by the end of the twenty-first century.

However, our understanding of the extent to which these impacts may propagate as cascades, compounding to form multiple impacts across sectors, is limited. Cascades result from interdependencies between systems and sub-systems of coupled natural and socio-economic systems in response to changes and feedback loops. The combined effects of interacting stressors may affect the ability of individuals, governments, and the private sector to adapt in time, before widespread damage occurs. We discuss the origins of cascading impacts thinking and present the results of an investigation of cascading impacts and implications in New Zealand. A participatory and collaborative approach was used through workshops and semi-structured interviews with sector informants, including engineers, local government staff, and financial risk managers and analysts from the financial services sectors. Qualitative data collection was combined with network and systems analysis to examine increased frequency of high-intensity rainfall events, sea-level rise and drought, across urban water infrastructure and the financial services, and the implications of cascading climate change impacts for governance. Results demonstrate that closer consideration of the combined effects of linked stressors can facilitate a better understanding of the scope and scale of climate change impacts. By using critical systems thinking in characterising and assessing how climate change impacts cascade across domains, we show the implications of cascades for their governance and reveal where climate change adaptation interventions might be focused. The research methods and insights into cascades provide a conceptual and practical basis for further development, which can inform the design of additional studies in other domains and jurisdictions.","[Lawrence, Judy] Victoria Univ Wellington, Climate Change Res Inst, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Blackett, Paula] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, POB 11115, Hamilton 3251, New Zealand; [Cradock-Henry, Nicholas A.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington; National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand; Landcare Research - New Zealand,"Lawrence, J (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Climate Change Res Inst, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",judy.lawrence@vuw.ac.nz; paula.blackett@niwa.co.nz; cradockhenryn@landcareresearch.co.nz,,,"New Zealand Deep South National Science Challenge Cascading climate change impacts in Aotearoa-New Zealand project through the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [CO1X1412]","New Zealand Deep South National Science Challenge Cascading climate change impacts in Aotearoa-New Zealand project through the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment","The authors were funded by the New Zealand Deep South National Science Challenge Cascading climate change impacts in Aotearoa-New Zealand project through the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Contract #CO1X1412.

These scenarios for climate change in 2050 and 2085 (compared to present-day) are intended for general use in climate change adaptation in the Netherlands. An ensemble of eight simulations with the global model EC-Earth and the regional climate model RACMO2 (run at 12 km resolution) is used. For each scenario time horizon, two target values of the global mean temperature rise are chosen based on the spread in the CMIP5 simulations. Next, the corresponding time periods in the EC-Earth/RACMO2 simulations are selected in which these target values of the global temperature rise are reached. The model output for these periods is then resampled using blocks of 5 yr periods. The rationale of resampling is that natural variations in the EC-Earth/RACMO2 ensemble are used to represent (part of the) uncertainty in the CMIP5 projections. Samples are then chosen with the aim of reconstructing the spread in seasonal temperature and precipitation changes in CMIP5 for the Netherlands. These selected samples form the basis of the scenarios. The resulting four scenarios represent 50-80% of the CMIP5 spread for summer and winter changes in seasonal means as well as a limited number of monthly statistics (warm, cold, wet and dry months). The strong point of the method-also in relation to the previous set of the climate scenarios for the Netherlands issued in 2006-is that it preserves nearly all physical inter-variable consistencies as they exist in the original model output in both space and time.","[Lenderink, G.; van den Hurk, B.

This study applied a life cycle assessment (LCA) to comparing the environmental efficiency of three means of equivalently reducing CSOs to the Bronx River (Bronx, NY, USA). Strategy 1 featured decentralized green infrastructure technologies, while grey strategies 2 and 3 detained, and detained and treated, respectively, excess flows at the end of pipe. We estimated greenhouse gas emissions (in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents [t CO2-eq]) over the construction, operation, and maintenance phases, including energy consumed at the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), carbon sequestered, and shading provided by vegetation (in the case of the green approach) over a 50-year analysis period. The study area comprised the entire drainage area contributing to New York State permitted CSO discharge points associated with the Hunts Point WWTP. The analysis was performed using a hybrid of process and economic input-output (EIO) LCA methods. The decentralized green strategy outperformed the two grey strategies in terms of this set of environmental metrics. The net emissions of the green strategy over 50 years was 19,000 t CO2-eq, whereas the grey strategies emitted 85,000 t CO2-eq (detention) and 400,000 t CO2-eq (detention and treatment). These results were significantly influenced by the emissions associated with the operation and maintenance activities required for strategies 2 and 3, and the carbon sequestered and shading provided by the vegetation in strategy 1, and suggest that watershed managers who seek to reduce CSOs and reduce carbon footprints would opt for the green approach.","[De Sousa, Maria R.

Unlike static shading, CABE systems include dynamic operations that significantly affect their performance; thus, well-informed strategies for scheduling dynamic operations should be integrated to analyze CABE performance. In this study, two conflicting objectives were pursued: minimizing cooling load and maximizing daylighting performance during the summer season in a hot and humid climate (Houston, Texas). Variables in the CABE performance optimization process were defined as dynamic operation schedules having either parametric linear or non-linear relationships between the degree of openness of the CABE model and certain weather stimuli (i.e., solar radiation). Two CABE models were tested with the PBM by integrating a parametric non-linear function that efficiently conducted the optimization process in a large search space. The outcomes of this optimization study included Pareto-front solutions such as optimal CABE performance and their dynamic operation scenarios. These optimal operation scenarios were determined based on the CABE design options available and user's desired objectives; in some cases, static scenarios were found to be superior. Ultimately, combining PBM with a MOO framework will contribute to the field of performance-based CABE design by supporting architects and engineers and facilitating better decisions through well-informed dynamic operation scenarios.","[Kim, Hyoungsub] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Design, 6000 J St,Mariposa Hall 2009,MS 6137, Sacramento, MS 95819 USA; [Clayton, Mark J.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Architecture, 3137 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",California State University System; California State University Sacramento; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Kim, H (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Design, 6000 J St,Mariposa Hall 2009,MS 6137, Sacramento, MS 95819 USA.",h.kim@csus.edu; mark-clayton@tamu.edu,,"Kim, Hyoungsub/0000-0002-9181-3714",,,,,61,29,29,7,42,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a primary school-based intervention program against heatwave and climate change in China to provide evidence for development of policies for adaptation to climate change. Methods: Two primary schools in Dongtai City, Jiangsu Province, China, were randomly selected as intervention and control schools (CTR registration number: ChiCTR2200056005). Health education was conducted at the intervention school to raise students' awareness and capability to respond to extreme heat during May to September in 2017. Knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of students and their parents at both schools were investigated by questionnaire surveys before and after intervention. The changes in KAP scores after intervention were evaluated using multivariable difference-in-difference (DID) analysis, controlling for age, sex, etc. Results: The scores of knowledge, attitude, and practice of students and their parents increased by 19.9% (95%CI: 16.3%, 23.6%) and 22.5% (95%CI: 17.8%, 27.1%); 9.60% (95%CI: 5.35%, 13.9%) and 7.22% (95%CI: 0.96%, 13.5%); and 9.94% (95%CI: 8.26%, 18.3%) and 5.22% (95%CI: 0.73%, 9.71%), respectively, after intervention. The KAP score changes of boys were slightly higher than those of girls. Older students had higher score changes than younger students. For parents, the higher the education level, the greater the score change, and change in scores was greater in females than in males. All the health education activities in the program were significantly correlated with the changes in KAP scores of primary school students after intervention, especially those curricula with interesting activities and experiential learning approaches. Conclusions: Heat and health education program in primary school was an effective approach to improve cognition and behavior for both students and their parents to better adapt to heatwaves and climate change. The successful experience can be generalized to respond to the increasing extreme weather/climate events in the context of climate change, such as heatwaves, and other emergent occasions or public health education, such as the control and prevention of COVID-19.","[Li, Yonghong; Sun, Bo; Wang, Yan; Yao, Xiaoyuan; Cheng, Yibin] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Environm Hlth, China CDC Key Lab Environm & Populat Hlth, Beijing 100021, Peoples R China; [Yang, Changlin; Zhuang, Xianghua] Dongtai Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Dongtai 224299, Peoples R China; [Huang, Liancheng] Yancheng Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Yancheng 224002, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qingqing] Jiangsu Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Nanjing 210009, Peoples R China; [Bi, Peng] Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia","Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention; National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention; Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control & Prevention; University of Adelaide","Cheng, YB (corresponding author), Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Environm Hlth, China CDC Key Lab Environm & Populat Hlth, Beijing 100021, Peoples R China.",liyonghong@nieh.chinacdc.cn; sunbo@nieh.chinacdc.cn; ycl000118@163.com; zhuang891007@163.com; huang170466733@163.com; wqq-djy@163.com; peng.bi@adelaide.edu.au; wangyan@nieh.chinacdc.cn; yaoxy@chinacdc.cn; chengyibin@nieh.chinacdc.cn,,"Li, Yonghong/0000-0001-5534-1644",Science and Technology Fundamental Resources Investigation Program [2017FY101206]; United Nations Children's Fund; National Health Commission of China; GEF/UNDP Special Climate Change Fund [PIMS3248],Science and Technology Fundamental Resources Investigation Program; United Nations Children's Fund; National Health Commission of China; GEF/UNDP Special Climate Change Fund,"This study was supported by Science and Technology Fundamental Resources Investigation Program (grant number 2017FY101206) in writing the manuscript, the joint project of United Nations Children's Fund and National Health Commission of China in design of the study and collection, analysis and interpretation of data, and the GEF/UNDP Special Climate Change Fund (PIMS3248) in design of the study.",,25,1,1,7,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

However, there are uncertainties in assessing the occurrence of heat-induced spikelet sterility (HISS) and the impact of climate change. One reason is the gap between the ambient air temperature and the panicle temperature, which determines the magnitude of HISS in field studies. To improve our understanding of this gap, we established a multi-site monitoring network (MINCERnet) to measure canopy micrometeorology and heat stress in the major rice growing regions (Sub-Saharan Africa; South, Southeast, and East Asia; and the USA). MINCERnet assessed the processes that determine panicle temperature and the resulting HISS in open fields using the same cultivars ('IR64', 'N22', and 'IR52') and a standard system (MINCER) for micrometeorological monitoring under diverse climates. By using the MINCERnet data in the canopy heat-balance model (IM(2)PACT), we confirmed that the canopy and panicle transpiration and the resulting evaporative cooling strongly affected the gap between the ambient air temperature and the panicle temperature, and that the HISS rate in open fields could be predicted accurately in diverse climates by using the mean panicle temperature during the flowering hours. The oasis effect in the broad sense, that is, evaporative cooling and the increase of relative humidity, which is nested at the various levels along the continuum from the landscape to the panicle, formed temperature and relative humidity gradients along the continuum in response to different climatic conditions. The heat-balance characteristics (i.e., a stronger evaporative cooling under drier climate conditions) suggested that the risk of HISS caused by global warming will increase more in wetter climates, where panicle temperatures tended to increase. Thus, accurate relative humidity data as well as air temperature will be required, along with spatial downscaling, to permit accurate prediction of rice heat stress and yield. HISS prediction using an approach based on the panicle temperature as input for models and monitoring of canopy micrometeorology will reduce uncertainties in rice yield prediction and the response of yield to various climate change adaptation measures.","[Yoshimoto, Mayumi; Fukuoka, Minehiko; Hasegawa, Toshihiro] Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Inst Agroenvironm Sci, 3-1-3 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan; [Tsujimoto, Yasuhiro] Japan Int Res Ctr Agr Sci, 1-1 Ohwashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058686, Japan; [Matsui, Tsutomu] Gifu Univ, Fac Appl Biol Sci, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Kobayasi, Kazuhiro] Shimane Univ, Fac Life & Environm Sci, 1060 Nishikawatsu Thou, Matsue, Shimane 6908504, Japan; [Saito, Kazuki] Africa Rice Ctr AfricaRice, 01 BP 2551, Bouake 01, Cote Ivoire; [van Oort, Pepijn A.

Awareness of climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices and access to climate-smart technologies are key factors in determining the utilization of farm and land management practices that may simultaneously decrease greenhouse gas emissions, increase the adaptive capacity of farmers, and improve food security. OBJECTIVE: Understanding how biophysical and socio-economic constraints affect the adoption of CSA practices and technologies plays an essential role in policy and intervention planning. Our objective was to identify these constraints among smallholder farmers in Taita Taveta County of Southeast Kenya across varying agro-ecological zones. METHODS: We conducted a Climate-Smart Agriculture Rapid Appraisal that consisted of four mostly genderdisaggregated smallholder farmer workshops (102 participants), a household survey (65 participants), key informant interviews (16 informants), and four transect walks. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a dissonance in the perceived awareness of CSA practices and utilization of CSA technologies between state actors and farmers. State actors emphasize lack of awareness as a barrier to adoption, while farmers express knowledgeability regarding environmental change and climate-smart practices but are confined by limitations and restrictions posed by e.g. market mechanisms, land tenure issues,and lack of resources. These restrictions include e.g. uncertainty in product prices, lack of land ownership, scarcity of arable land, and simply lack of capital or willingness to invest. Farmers are further challenged by the emergence of new pests and human-wildlife conflicts. Our research findings are based on the contextual settings of Taita Taveta County, but the results indicate that adopting CSA practices and utilizing technologies, especially in sub-Saharan regions that are heavily based on subsistence agriculture with heterogenous agro-ecological zones, require localized and gender-responsive solutions in policy formation and planning of both agricultural extension services and development interventions that take into account the agency of the farmers. SIGNIFICANCE: This study contributes to existing climate change adaptation research by increasing our un- derstanding of how physical and socio-economic constraints can affect the adoption of new farm and land management practices, and how CSA-based intervention strategies could be restructured by local stakeholders to be more inclusive.","[Autio, Antti; Johansson, Tino; Pellikka, Petri] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, Gustaf Hallstromin Katu 2, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Motaroki, Lilian] African Ctr Technol Studies ACTS, POB 45917, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Minoia, Paola] Univ Helsinki, Global Dev Studies, Unioninkatu 35, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Motaroki, Lilian] Int Inst Environm & Dev IIED, 1 Bomughloch Sq, Edinburgh EH8 9NJ, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Autio, A (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, Gustaf Hallstromin Katu 2, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",antti.j.autio@helsinki.fi,,"Autio, Antti/0000-0002-2054-4940; Minoia, Paola/0000-0003-0760-5785; Johansson, Tino Petri/0000-0002-2381-5144",Academy of Finland [318645],Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),"This research is part of the SMARTLAND-project (Environmental sensing of ecosystem services for developing climate-smart landscape framework to improve food security in East Africa) , funded by the Academy of Finland (grant no. 318645) .

Compared to approaches that examine vulnerability to a specific hazard, our analysis offers an alternative perspective that conceptualizes vulnerability to climate change as a phenomenon that is independent of any specific type of hazard but relevant to multiple hazards. Vulnerability is thus a product of structural inequality and systemic in nature. Based on two established index systems, we perform global analyses of specific phenomena-such as poverty, access to basic infrastructure services and forced migration-that influence and determine vulnerability. Our statistical and spatial analyses reveal an emerging pattern of climate vulnerability within regional clusters and shows that vulnerability is a transboundary issue, crossing political, sectorial and geographical borders and impacting shared resources. The spatial statistical hotspot analysis of vulnerability underscores that hotspots, for example of high vulnerability, state fragility, low biodiversity protection or forced migration, emerge in multi-country clusters. This aspect has often been overlooked, most attention to-date having been given to the positioning of individual countries within vulnerability rankings. In hotspots such as in the Sahel, East and Central Africa, as well as in Southern Asia and Central America, vulnerability is interwoven with high levels of state fragility, making adaptation solutions more complex. The recognition of the regional clusters and the transboundary nature of vulnerability calls for new research and action on how to strengthen transboundary approaches for vulnerability reduction, potentially enhancing prospects for successful adaptation.","[Birkmann, Joern; Feldmeyer, Daniel; McMillan, Joanna M.; Jamshed, Ali] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Spatial & Reg Planning, Pfaffenwaldring 7, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Solecki, William] CUNY Hunter Coll, 695 Pk Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Totin, Edmond] Univ Natl Agr Benin, Ecole Foresterie Trop, Ketou, Benin; [Roberts, Debra] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, Durban, South Africa; [Roberts, Debra] eThekwini Municipal, Sustainable & Resilient City Initiat Unit, Durban, South Africa; [Trisos, Christopher] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa; [Trisos, Christopher] Univ Cape Town, Ctr Stat Ecol Environm & Conservat, Cape Town, South Africa; [Boyd, Emily] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies, Lund, Sweden; [Wrathall, David] Oregon State Univ, Dept Geog Environm Sci & Marine Resource Manageme, 104 CEOAS Adm Bldg, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",University of Stuttgart; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY); University of Kwazulu Natal; University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town; Lund University; Oregon State University,"Birkmann, J (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Spatial & Reg Planning, Pfaffenwaldring 7, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",joern.birkmann@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de,"Birkmann, Joern jb/J-5736-2015","Jamshed, Ali/0000-0003-4802-1225; Totin, Edmond/0000-0003-3377-6190",,,,,95,9,9,1,10,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

Smallholders are expected to respond to rising temperatures and precipitation anomalies through on-farm management strategies and diversification into off-farm activities. However, few studies have empirically examined the relationship between climate anomalies and rural livelihoods. Our research explores the impact of climate anomalies on farmers' on and off-farm livelihood strategies, considering both annual and decadal climate exposures, the relationship between on and off-farm livelihoods, and the implications of these livelihood strategies for agricultural productivity. To examine these issues, we link gridded climate data to survey data collected in 120 communities from 850 Ugandan households and 2000 agricultural plots in 2003 and 2013. We find that smallholder livelihoods are responsive to climate exposure over both short and long time scales. Droughts decrease agricultural productivity in the short term and reduce individual livelihood diversification in the long term. Smallholders cope with higher temperatures in the short term, but in the long run, farmers struggle to adapt to above-average temperatures, which lower agricultural productivity and reduce opportunities for diversification. On and off-farm livelihood strategies also appear to operate in parallel, rather than by substituting for one another. These observations suggest that new strategies will be necessary if rural smallholders are to successfully adapt to climate change. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Integrated urban water management (IUWM) approaches, such as water sensitive urban design (WSUD), reduce the reliance on centralised potable water supply systems and provide a means for retaining water in the urban environment through stormwater harvesting and reuse. This study examines the potential for WSUD to provide cooling benefits and reduce human exposure and heat stress and thermal discomfort. A high-resolution observational field campaign, measuring surface level microclimate variables and remotely sensed land surface characteristics, was conducted in a mixed residential suburb containing WSUD in Adelaide, South Australia. Clear evidence was found that WSUD features and irrigation can reduce surface temperature (T-s) and air temperature (T-a) and improve human thermal comfort (HTC) in urban environments. The average 3 pm T-a near water bodies was found to be up to 1.8 degrees C cooler than the domain maximum. Cooling was broadly observed in the area 50 m downwind of lakes and wetlands. Design and placement of water bodies were found to affect their cooling effectiveness. HTC was improved by proximity to WSUD features, but shading and ventilation were also effective at improving thermal comfort. This study demonstrates that WSUD can be used to cool urban microclimates, while simultaneously achieving other environmental benefits, such as improved stream ecology and flood mitigation.","[Broadbent, Ashley M.; Coutts, Andrew M.; Tapper, Nigel J.] Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Broadbent, Ashley M.; Coutts, Andrew M.; Tapper, Nigel J.] Cooperat Res Ctr CRC Water Sensit Cities, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Demuzere, Matthias] Univ Ghent, Lab Hydrol & Water Management, Ghent, Belgium; [Demuzere, Matthias] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Lueven, Belgium; [Beringer, Jason] Unvers Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Broadbent, Ashley M.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Urban Climate Res Ctr, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA",Monash University; Ghent University; KU Leuven; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Broadbent, AM (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.;Broadbent, AM (corresponding author), Cooperat Res Ctr CRC Water Sensit Cities, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.;Broadbent, AM (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Urban Climate Res Ctr, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",ashley.broadbent@asu.edu,"Demuzere, Matthias/AFE-8260-2022; Demuzere, Matthias/HOF-7046-2023; Beringer, Jason/B-8528-2008","Demuzere, Matthias/0000-0003-3237-4077; Demuzere, Matthias/0000-0003-3237-4077; Broadbent, Ashley/0000-0003-1906-8112; Beringer, Jason/0000-0002-4619-8361","Cooperative Research Centre for Water Sensitive Cities; NSF Sustainability Research Network (SRN) [1444758]; NSF [EAR-1204774, SES-1520803]; Flemish regional government through a contract as a FWO (Fund for Scientific Research) post-doctoral research fellow; Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Earth Sciences [1204774] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Cooperative Research Centre for Water Sensitive Cities(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); NSF Sustainability Research Network (SRN); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Flemish regional government through a contract as a FWO (Fund for Scientific Research) post-doctoral research fellow; Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Earth Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","Ashley Broadbent was funded by the Cooperative Research Centre for Water Sensitive Cities.

The objectives of this study were to identify ditch properties that can be evaluated visually on-site and related soil erosion processes, and to define parameters requiring more intensive study and estimate these using simplified methods. The study included surveys of ditches in various soils using MADRAS (Minnesota Agricultural Ditch Research Assessment for Stability) to classify ditch status. To explain why some ditch segments were in poor condition, additional field and laboratory studies were carried out. Soil samples were taken for analysis of particle size distribution, unsaturated direct shear strength, and critical stress for erosion. The HEC-RAS data model was used for simulation of hydraulic forces acting at different flow rates. Digital maps of land use in the catchment area in different years were used to estimate changes in runoff conditions over time. MADRAS proved to be a suitable tool for rapid assessment of stability problems in ditches. The HEC-RAS simulations were a good complement to MADRAS in assessing how changes in land use affected the hydraulic load and in highlighting bottlenecks in the system. However, the hydraulic load did not adequately explain the degree of degradation in some ditch segments. Measurements of soil shear strength were a good aid to understanding existing degradation. Thus, assessment of soil erodibility and bank stability is essential in anticipating the risk of future erosion processes in ditches.","[Aviles, D.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, POB 7014, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Wesstrom, I.; Joel, A.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Soil & Environm, Uppsala, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Wesstrom, I (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, POB 7014, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",Ingrid.Wesstrom@slu.se,,"Wesstrom, Ingrid/0000-0002-9816-469X; Aviles Ribera, Daniel Bernardo/0000-0002-8282-6476",Swedish Farmers' Foundation for Agricultural Research [V1260007]; Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA),Swedish Farmers' Foundation for Agricultural Research; Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA),The authors wish to thank the Swedish Farmers' Foundation for Agricultural Research for financial support for this project (Project No. V1260007).

Design/methodology/approach - Descriptive statistical analysis and econometric models are used on household survey data collected over several years and county-level climate data. Findings - Over the past few decades, a significant share of farmers have switched the methods of groundwater access from collective tubewells to own tubewells or groundwater markets. Farmers who bought water from groundwater markets applied less water to wheat plots than those who had their own tubewells. However, wheat yield was not negatively affected. Both average climate conditions and long-term variations were found to be related to farmers' choice of methods of groundwater access for irrigation. More frequent droughts and increasingly volatile temperatures both increased the likelihood of farmers gaining groundwater irrigation from markets. Originality/value - The analysis results suggest farmers are using groundwater markets to help them adapt to climate change. Applying empirical analysis to identify the impact of the methods by which farmers access groundwater for irrigation on the amount of groundwater use and crop yield will help policy makers design reasonable adaptation policies for the NCP.","[Zhang, Lijuan; Zhang, Guangsheng] Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lijuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jinxia] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Qiuqiong] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","Shenyang Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Peking University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville","Zhang, GS (corresponding author), Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shenyang, Peoples R China.;Wang, JX (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jxwang.ccap@pku.edu.cn; gzhang@syau.edu.cn,"Zhang, Guangsheng/I-5774-2015; Zhang, Li/GWM-7501-2022","Zhang, Guangsheng/0000-0003-1482-9429; Huang, Qiuqiong/0000-0002-3354-5213",,,,,30,3,3,4,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The large amounts of data already obtained within existing monitoring programmes and large-scale international projects can be used to increase understanding of the state and potential of forest mitigation and adaptation to climate change in a polluted environment, and a major challenge now is to evaluate and integrate the presently available databases. We present a meta-database with the main goal to highlight available data and integrate the information about research and monitoring of selected European Research and Monitoring Networks (ERMNs). Depending on the selected ERMNs, the list of variables and the measurement units differ widely in the databases. As a result, activities related to the identification, evaluation and integration of the presently available databases are important for the scientific community. Furthermore, and equally important, the recognition of current knowledge gaps and future needed research is made easier. This analysis suggests that: ground-level ozone is under-investigated, although it is one of the pollutants of greatest concern to forests; in addition to CO2, long-term other greenhouse gasses (GHG) flux measurements should be carried out; there is still a need of improving links between monitoring of atmospheric changes and impacts on forests; research-oriented manipulative experiments in the forests are missing.","[Danielewska, Alina; Olejnik, Janusz; Urbaniak, Marek] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Meteorol, PL-60649 Poznan, Poland; [Clarke, Nicholas; Olejnik, Janusz] Norwegian Forest & Landscape Inst, N-1431 As, Norway; [Olejnik, Janusz] AS CR, Vvi, Global Change Res Ctr, Dept Matter & Energy Fluxes, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Hansen, Karin] IVL Swedish Environm Res Inst, SE-10031 Stockholm, Sweden; [de Vries, Wim] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lundin, Lars] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Sci & Assessment, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Tuovinen, Juha-Pekka] Finnish Meteorol Inst, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Fischer, Richard] Johann Heinrich Thunen Inst vTI, Inst World Forestry, PCC ICP Forests, D-21031 Hamburg, Germany; [Paoletti, Elena] CNR, Ist Protez Piante, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, FI, Italy",Poznan University of Life Sciences; The Norwegian Forest & Landscape Institute; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute; Wageningen University & Research; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Finnish Meteorological Institute; Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR),"Danielewska, A (corresponding author), Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Meteorol, Piatkowska 94, PL-60649 Poznan, Poland.",alinkadanie@poczta.onet.pl,"Urbaniak, Marek/E-8764-2012; Fischer, Richard/ADW-5595-2022; Forests, ICP/F-7626-2019; Paoletti, Elena/B-8974-2009; Clarke, Nicholas John/C-7056-2008; Tuovinen, Juha-Pekka/AAZ-8587-2020; Paoletti, Elena/AAS-5316-2021","Urbaniak, Marek/0000-0002-1225-9170; Paoletti, Elena/0000-0001-5324-7769; Clarke, Nicholas John/0000-0002-1588-9661; Tuovinen, Juha-Pekka/0000-0001-7857-036X; Paoletti, Elena/0000-0001-5324-7769; Olejnik, Janusz/0000-0001-5305-1045; de Vries, Wim/0000-0001-9974-0612",COST Action FP0903 [COST-STSM-ECOST-STSM-FP0903-011011-010860],COST Action FP0903(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),We acknowledge the COST Action FP0903 Climate Change and Forest Mitigation and Adaptation in a Polluted Environment.

The purpose of this study is to endogenize culture as shaped by natural-cultural feedback into individuals' decision-making processes on sustainability policy support. We present an agent-based model in which an adaptive cultural decision-rule quantifies the probability of an agent deciding to support a wildlife area policy for the Smoky Hill River Watershed (SHRW) in Kansas, USA. By using an ABM to examine the watershed as a coupled natural and human system, we learned that agents would adopt a new behavior, voting for the policy, if the cultural conditions were right, with high levels of beliefs and norms for freshwater and its biota. Our results indicate that individuals in the SHRW are not engaged in caring for fish, plants, and bird richness in their rivers and playas with few individuals supporting the policy in the naive cultural setting (8.9 % of simulated population). However, enough agents would support the policy under a lower cultural threshold (40.7 % of simulated population). Our results show that sustain ability policies need to account for the local culture to gain support, and if a policy is culturally meaningful, it does not need to be cheap. For an agricultural landscape, such as those commonly found in the Central Great Plains, this study presents new levers for policymakers on the conditions needed to help assemble popular support for sustainability policies.","[Granco, Gabriel] Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, Dept Geog & Anthropol, 3801 West Temple Ave 5-150, Pomona, CA 91768 USA; [Caldas, Marcellus] Kansas State Univ, Dept Geog, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Bergtold, Jason] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Stamm, Jessica L.

A simple random sampling technique was used to select representative farmers of the study area. In this study, interview, focus group discussion, questionnaires and site observation were employed as data collection tools. SPSS Version 20 was used for data analysis. The majority of the respondent farmers revealed that their productivity status had fluctuated patterns due to untimely rainfall and scarcity of water occasionally. The present study confirmed that choices of agricultural activities by farmers were linked with the change in climate and irregular distribution of rainfall patterns. The ecology of farmland in Sadi Chanka has been degraded critically. This work had also clearly demonstrated the existence of farmers' choices of agricultural activities, including coffee production, poultry production and productions of fruits like mango and papaya.

Green roofs mitigate urban heat islands, improve urban air quality, buffer stormwater and improve runoff quality, absorb emissions and increase the thermal efficiency of buildings. Green roofs therefore are an interesting technology for densely populated urban areas in Thailand, but still at a rather low diffusion stage. The aim of this paper thus is to identify and quantify the main factors that influence green roof adoption using a mixed-method research design. The relevant factors were (1) identified in a qualitative content analysis, (2) structured alongside two dimensions (internal/external and positive/negative factors), and (3) quantitatively assessed in an Analytical Hierarchy Process based on expert judgments. The analysis yields three main factors influencing the diffusion potential of green roofs in Thailand: While their potential to mitigate urban heat islands is the most important facilitating factor, the lack of proper subsidy schemes as well as the lack of knowledge and skilled workforce, represent major adoption barriers. In spite of the discussed challenges and issues, a light trend towards greener buildings can already be observed among planners, architects, and also on policy levels in Thailand. If the identified issues are addressed properly, green roofs eventually could become a significant contributor to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts in Thailand. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) based model ensemble projects a warming of 1.5-4.3 degrees C and an increase in precipitation by 6-14% for India under different representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for the 2080s (2071-2100) compared to the baseline period (19611990). The Indian Council of Agricultural Research through its network project on National Innovations on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) has demonstrated different land and water management interventions in the vulnerable districts of India to enhance the resilience of agriculture to climate change and variability. Rainwater harvesting and its judicious utilization through farm ponds and community tanks in rainfed districts demonstrated the ability to build resilience and also enhance cropping intensity (20-135%). Construction of temporary check dams (bori-bandhan) in high-rainfall areas brought lowland areas into cultivation which otherwise would have remained fallow due to inundation in the kharif (monsoon) season. Renovation of aahar (water reservoirs) and construction of farm ponds in Bihar ensured protective irrigation during dry spells in kharif, increasing paddy productivity by 20.7%, and also raised the groundwater level by 30 cm. Adoption of participatory integrated watershed management within a river basin perspective provides a framework for climate change adaptation through reduced runoff, increased groundwater recharge, improved crop productivity and increased carbon sequestration.

Urban greening is thought to confer manifold socio-ecological benefits upon residents in towns and cities. Yet proponents of urban greening have seldom considered how people's support for greening policies may be shaped by weather and climate. This paper reports the results of exploratory research examining public expectations of adverse weather changes and people's attitudes toward the functional benefits of urban trees and green space. Results of a questionnaire survey of 800 residents of Hong Kong indicate a positive relationship. Respondents tended to rate functional benefits as more important if they anticipated adverse weather changes in the near future, namely, rising temperatures, more tropical cyclones and prolonged rain. This subjective weather effect is more salient when these weather changes are perceived as a threat to one's daily life. We found urban greenery is assigned a higher value by individuals concerned about exposure and vulnerability to climatic stressors. Affinity for greening appears to be related to how weather and climatic variability is perceived. This observation is informed by a broader geographic perspective, which construes weather and climate as part of the spatial environment in which urban nature is apprehended and comprehended. An explanation for our findings is that increasingly volatile weather can potentially reshape urban residents' interactions with nature, based on perceived krelief and/or protection from climate-related threats.

Climate change predictions in places like the south-east of Australia and western United States suggest that wildfires may become more frequent and more intense with global climate change. Compounding this issue is progressive urban development at the pen-urban fringe (wildland-urban interface), where continued infrastructure development and demographic changes are likely to expose more people and property to this potentially disastrous natural hazard. Preparing well in advance of the wildfire season is seen as a fundamental behaviour that can both reduce community wildfire vulnerability and increase hazard resilience - it is an important element of adaptive capacity that allows people to coexist with the hazardous environment in which they live. We use household interviews and surveys to build and test a substantive model that illustrates how social cohesion influences the decision to prepare for wildfire. We demonstrate that social cohesion, particularly community characteristics like 'sense of community' and 'collective problem solving', are community-based resources that support both the adoption of mechanical preparations, and the development of cognitive abilities and capacities that reduce vulnerability and enhance resilience to wildfire. We use the results of this work to highlight opportunities to transfer techniques and approaches from natural hazards research to climate change adaptation research to explore how the impacts attributed to the social components of social-ecological systems can be mitigated more effectively.

However, there are many challenges in doing this, with asset operators often facing conflicting interests and major uncertainties about the future needs for asset performance. In the EU Interreg IV FAIR project, flood protection asset owners and operators, with scientific partners from the North Sea Region of Europe collaborated to develop practical guidance for adaptive asset management of flood protection infrastructure. The central component of this guidance is the FAIR framework, presented here. The framework combines insights and principles from ISO 55000 on asset management and ISO 14090 on climate adaptation with asset operator experiences to provide a practical guide for integration of asset management considerations within both strategic and operational contexts via a tactical handshake. This is a means to avoid the common lack of connection between strategic plans and operational practice. The applicability of the framework is illustrated with examples from Pilot Cases within the FAIR project, in which its value in terms of improved asset management and reduced costs has been demonstrated.","[Vonk, Bart] Rijkswaterstaat, POB 2232, NL-3500 GE Utrecht, Netherlands; [Klerk, Wouter Jan; den Heijer, Frank] Deltares, Boussinesqweg 1, NL-2629 HV Deltares, Netherlands; [Klerk, Wouter Jan] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Dept Hydraul Engn, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands; [Frohle, Peter; Jordan, Philipp] Hamburg Univ Technol, Inst River & Coastal Engn, Denickestr 22, D-21073 Hamburg, Germany; [Gersonius, Berry] ResilienServices, NL-2613 PN Delft, Netherlands; [den Heijer, Frank; Rijke, Jeroen] HAN Univ Appl Sci, Sustainable River Management Grp, Ruitenberglaan 26, NL-6826 CC Arnhem, Netherlands; [Ciocan, Ulf Radu] Danish Coastal Author, DK-7620 Lemvig, Denmark; [Sayers, Paul] Sayers & Partners, Watlington OX49 5PY, England; [Ashley, Richard] EcoFutures Ltd, 3 Greendale Court, Holmfirth HD9 6JW, W Yorkshire, England",Deltares; Delft University of Technology; Hamburg University of Technology,"Klerk, WJ (corresponding author), Deltares, Boussinesqweg 1, NL-2629 HV Deltares, Netherlands.;Klerk, WJ (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Dept Hydraul Engn, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands.",bart.vonk@rws.nl; wouterjan.klerk@deltares.nl; froehle@tuhh.de; berry@resiliense.nl; frank.denheijer@han.nl; philipp.jordan@tuhh.de; rci@kyst.dk; j.rijke@han.nl; paul.sayers@sayersandpartners.co.uk; r.ashley@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Frohle, Peter/0000-0002-3903-7973; Sayers, Paul/0000-0003-2160-1959; Jordan, Philipp/0000-0001-9882-4806",Interreg North Sea Region Programme [38-2-9-15]; EPSRC [EP/I029346/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Interreg North Sea Region Programme; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This research was funded by Interreg North Sea Region Programme 2014-2020, grant number 38-2-9-15 for FAIR Project.",,39,2,2,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2412-3811,,INFRASTRUCTURES-BASE,Infrastructures-Basel,DEC,2020,5,12,,,,,,,109,10.3390/infrastructures5120109,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/infrastructures5120109,,,16,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil; Transportation Science & Technology",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering; Transportation,QP2CX,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000623644600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Geographic clines in life-history traits are often recognized as adaptations to the associated transitional environments. As life-history traits evolve in response to anthropogenic processes, these geographic clines can change over time. 2. The geographic and temporal trends of reproductive traits in Japanese chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta were analysed. Data were collected from 23 rivers located between 36 degrees and 45 degrees north latitude and 136 degrees and 146 degrees east longitude from 1994 to 2010. 3. We confirmed the geographic clines of reproductive traits: relative gonad weight increased in more northeasterly locations, and females had fewer, but larger, eggs in more northeasterly locations after standardization by body size. 4. The geographic clines changed over the years. The northeastward geographic trend of increasing gonad weight became more pronounced over time. Temporal trends towards smaller but more numerous eggs were evident, especially in northeasterly locations. 5. Under natural and sexual selection, gonadal investment should be constrained by the energetic demands of the cost of migration, particularly in southwesterly locations (which are farthest from the feeding grounds), and by breeding competition during natural reproduction. In addition, females should have fewer but larger eggs owing to a constraint on growth opportunities for their offspring in more northeasterly regions of Japan, which are colder and have less available food. However, global warming may mitigate this constraint on growth opportunities in northeastern Japan by increasing river water temperatures. Moreover, we consider that relaxation of the effects of natural and sexual selection on intense breeding competition and early growth conditions has occurred through domestication selection by hatchery programmes. These may have caused temporal shifts in geographic clines. 6. We should consider several co-occurring anthropogenic impacts on natural and sexual selection when evaluating the life-history traits of organisms. For the sustainable use of biological resources, maintaining geographically adapted life-history traits during adaptation to climate change is essential. Therefore, the conservation of wild salmon populations formed by natural selection is preferable to the stocking of hatchery-reared fry.","[Hasegawa, Koh; Okamoto, Yasutaka; Morita, Kentaro] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Fisheries Resources Inst, Salmon Res Dept, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0620922, Japan; [Okamoto, Yasutaka] Fisheries Agcy, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Morita, Kentaro] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Uryu Expt Forest, Moshiri, Horokanai, Japan",Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA); Hokkaido University,"Hasegawa, K (corresponding author), Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Fisheries Resources Inst, Salmon Res Dept, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0620922, Japan.",hasegawa_koh43@fra.go.jp,"; Morita, Kentaro/G-2578-2015","Hasegawa, Koh/0000-0001-6827-8322; Morita, Kentaro/0000-0002-7803-2438",Research Council of Norway [287438],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"Research Council of Norway project Global trout, Grant/Award Number: 287438",,73,0,0,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,2688-8319,,ECOL SOLUT EVID,Ecol.

In this paper, multiple machine learning techniques, i.e., statistical downscaling model (SDSM), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), were used to downscale large-scale climatic variables simulated by the General Circulation Models (GCMs) to precipitation on a local scale. It was demonstrated in Shenzhen city, China, through multisite downscaling schemes based on projections from the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM1.2-HR), Meteorological Research Institute Earth System Model Version 2.0 (MRI-ESM2.0), and Beijing Climate Center Climate System Model (BCC-CSM2-MR). The obtained results showed that the downscaled precipitation would provide good monthly simulations against observations at 10 discrete stations. Regardless of superior performance of SVM and MLP over SDSM, the daily precipitation simulations should be further improved, and downscaling of heavy daily precipitations would be promoted by quantile mapping corrections. Due to the relatively poor simulation performance of BCC-CSM2-MR, the other two climate models were considered under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios) for ensemble precipitation projections for 2015-2100. Under the SSP1-2.6 scenario, the amounts of annual average precipitation for 10 stations were estimated to be higher relative to the historical period (2.7%-17%), and 9 out of 10 stations presented an increasing trend. However, downward trends also existed at three stations when it comes to scenarios SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5. Moreover, a significantly positive trend was found to dominate the trend changes of annual extreme daily precipitation during 2015-2050, but the detected trends at stations were greatly dependent on the downscaling techniques and climate models. Besides, the increase in daily extreme precipitations for various return periods as well as statistically different precipitation characteristics for discrete stations would further shed light on urgent demands on urban resilient strategies for climate change adaptation.","[Han, Jing-Cheng; Zheng, Wenting; Zhou, Yang] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Chem & Environm Engn, Water Sci & Environm Engn Res Ctr, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhe; Zhou, Yang; Huang, Yuefei] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Huang, Yuefei] Qinghai Univ, State Key Lab Plateau Ecol & Agr, Xining 810016, Peoples R China; [Li, Bing] Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Int Grad Sch, Water Res Ctr, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China",Shenzhen University; Tsinghua University; Qinghai University; Tsinghua University,"Huang, YF (corresponding author), Qinghai Univ, State Key Lab Plateau Ecol & Agr, Xining 810016, Peoples R China.",hanjc@szu.edu.cn; kangnt@hotmail.com; 286438379@qq.com; yzhou@szu.edu.cn; yuefeihuang@tsinghua.edu.cn; libing@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn,"Zhou, Yang/U-5398-2017; Han, Jing-Cheng/E-8433-2010","Zhou, Yang/0000-0002-8349-5090; Han, Jing-Cheng/0000-0002-4421-9683","Major Basic Research Development Program of the Science and Technology, Qinghai Province [2021-SF-A6, 2019-SF-146]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51809007]; Open Research Fund Program of State Key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering [sklhse-2021-A-02]; Water Conservancy Science and Technology Innovation Project of the Guangdong Province [2017-03]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Shenzhen University [2110822]","Major Basic Research Development Program of the Science and Technology, Qinghai Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Open Research Fund Program of State Key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering; Water Conservancy Science and Technology Innovation Project of the Guangdong Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Shenzhen University","The authors are grateful to the editors and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments that have improved the overall presentation of this paper.

It is a crucial component in risk assessment studies, both for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. In this study, we analyse patterns of vulnerability for the residential sector in a frequently hit urban area of Milan, Italy. The conceptual foundation for a quantitative assessment of the structural dimensions of vulnerability is based on the modified source-pathway-receptor-consequence model. This conceptual model is used to improve the parameterization of the flood risk analysis, describing (i) hazard scenario definitions performed by hydraulic modelling based on past event data (source estimation) and morphological features and land-use evaluation (pathway estimation) and (ii) the exposure and vulnerability assessment which consists of recognizing elements potentially at risk (receptor estimation) and event losses (consequence estimation). We characterized flood hazard intensity on the basis of variability in water depth during a recent event and spatial exposure also as a function of a building's surroundings and buildings' intrinsic characteristics as a determinant vulnerability indicator of the elements at risk. In this sense the use of a geographic scale sufficient to depict spatial differences in vulnerability allowed us to identify structural vulnerability patterns to inform depth-damage curves and calculate potential losses from mesoscale (land-use level) to microscale (building level). Results produces accurate estimates of the flood characteristics, with mean error in flood depth estimation in the range 0.2-0.3 m and provide a basis to obtain site-specific damage curves and damage mapping. Findings show that the nature of flood pathways varies spatially, is influenced by landscape characteristics and alters vulnerability spatial distribution and hazard propagation. At the mesoscale, the continuous urban fabric Urban Atlas 2018 land-use class with the occurrence of at least 80 % of soil sealing shows higher absolute damage values. At microscale, evidence demonstrated that even events with moderate magnitude in terms of flood depth in a complex urbanized area may cause more damage than one would expect.","[Taramelli, Andrea; Righini, Margherita; Gatti, Ignacio] Ist Univ Superiori Pavia IUSS, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Taramelli, Andrea] Inst Environm Protect & Res ISPRA, I-00144 Rome, Italy; [Valentini, Emiliana] Italian Natl Res Council ISP CNR, Inst Polar Sci, I-00015 Rome, Italy; [Alfieri, Lorenzo; Gabellani, Simone] CIMA Res Fdn, I-17100 Savona, Italy",Italian Institute for Environmental Protection & Research (ISPRA),"Righini, M (corresponding author), Ist Univ Superiori Pavia IUSS, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",margherita.righini@iusspavia.it,,"Valentini, Emiliana/0000-0002-4257-7858; Alfieri, Lorenzo/0000-0002-3616-386X",Fondazione CARIPLO [2017-0735],Fondazione CARIPLO(Fondazione Cariplo),"This research has been supported by EFLIP, a project funded by Fondazione CARIPLO (grant no. 2017-0735).",,74,0,0,5,5,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1561-8633,1684-9981,,NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS,Nat.

By focusing on air temperature and precipitation, the present study compares local-scale climate regimes at two sites in Central Italy (urban Rome and a peri-urban cropland 10 km west of Rome), using descriptive and inferential statistics on both variables and a drought index (the Standardized Precipitation Index, hereafter SPI) recorded over the last 60 years (1958-2017). The present work assumes the importance of urban-rural gradients shaping local-scale climate regimes and spatial variability, with differential impacts on individual variables depending on territorial background and intrinsic biophysical characteristics. Considering together precipitations and minimum/maximum air temperature at month and year scale, the analysis developed here illustrates two coexisting climatic trends at distinctive spatial scales: A general trend toward warmingspecifically influencing temperature regimesand a more specific pattern evidencing changes in local-scale climate regime along the urban gradient, with a more subtle impact on both precipitations and temperatures. Empirical results indicate that climate variability increased over the study period, outlining the low predictability of dry spells typical of Mediterranean climate especially in the drier season (spring/summer). On average, absolute annual differences between the two sites amounted to 70 mm (more rainfall in the peri-urban site) and 0.9 degrees C (higher temperature in the urban site). A similar trend toward warming was observed for air temperature in both sites. No significant trends were observed for annual and seasonal rainfalls. SPI long-term trends indicate high variability in dry spells, with more frequent (and severe) drought episodes in urban Rome. Considering together trends in temperature and precipitation, the urban heat' effect was more evident, indicating a clearer trend toward climate aridity in urban Rome. These findings support the adoption of integrated strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation in both agricultural systems and relict natural ecosystems surrounding urban areas.","[Salvati, Luca; Pignatti, Giuseppe; Pontuale, Giorgio] Council Agr Res & Econ, CREA FL, Via Valle Quist 27, I-00166 Rome, Italy; [Zambon, Ilaria; Colantoni, Andrea; Cecchini, Massimo] Tuscia Univ, Dept Agr & Forestry Sci DAFNE, Via S Camillo De Lellis Snc, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [Zambon, Ilaria] Univ Valencia, Dept Geog, Av Blasco Ibanez 13, ES-46010 Valencia, Spain; [Cividino, Sirio] Univ Udine, Dept Agr, Via Sci 206, I-33100 Udine, Italy; [Perini, Luigi] Council Agr Res & Econ, CREA AA, Via Navicella 2-4, I-00184 Rome, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Tuscia University; University of Valencia; University of Udine; Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Zambon, I (corresponding author), Tuscia Univ, Dept Agr & Forestry Sci DAFNE, Via S Camillo De Lellis Snc, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy.;Zambon, I (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Dept Geog, Av Blasco Ibanez 13, ES-46010 Valencia, Spain.",luca.salvati@crea.gov.it; ilaria.zambon@unitus.it; giuseppe.pignatti@crea.gov.it; colantoni@unitus.it; agricolturasicura@gmail.com; luigi.perini@crea.gov.it; giorgio.pontuale@crea.gov.it; cecchini@unitus.it,"Salvati, Luca/AAS-6179-2021; Cecchini, Massimo/F-3411-2012","Cecchini, Massimo/0000-0003-1407-8127; Zambon, Ilaria/0000-0001-9190-3333",,,,,107,8,8,1,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,MAY,2019,9,5,,,,,,,103,10.3390/agriculture9050103,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture9050103,,,18,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,IE8VG,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000472651000018,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is one of the largest sand-bed braided rivers in the world and every year it erodes thousand hectares of mainland floodplain, rendering tens of thousands of people landless and/or homeless. Understanding the morpho-dynamics of this river and its responses to the various drivers of morphological change that act on it is essential to improving the livelihoods of millions of floodplain dwellers in Bangladesh, especially given the threats posed by climate change. Reliable data, information and knowledge of river process are sparse and so progress in linking the impacts of multiple drivers (including neo-tectonics, earthquakes, large-scale avulsions and engineering interventions) to complex morphological responses depends on making best use of historical maps, time-series satellite images, hydro-morphological data, expert judgment and local knowledge. This paper draws on all these sources to chronicle the morphological evolution of the Jamuna River since the avulsion that created it about 200 years ago, and to establish temporal trends and spatial patterns in the changes that have characterized process-response mechanisms in this fluvial system since then. The understanding gained from these investigations then supports deeper analyses to: explain how historical migration of the river westward has produced significant contrasts between left and right (west) bank material properties; elucidate the relationships between discharge, fluvial processes, anabranch instability and floodplain erosion rates, and; identify causal links between drivers and morphological responses at a variety of time and space scales. Finally, the new knowledge generated by the analyses developed herein are combined with existing, conceptual and empirical process-response models for the Jamuna to predict possible future morphological adjustments in ways helpful in identifying appropriate strategies for climate change adaptation in Bangladesh. The enhanced knowledge gained from these historical and contemporary investigations may also be useful in assessing the impacts of natural and anthropogenic drivers on other large, braided rivers.

Previous studies focused on trends of surface area and water level of lakes in Xinjiang, but paid less attention to nonlinear change and driving mechanisms of lake areas at annual and monthly scales. To address this issue, this study used a remote-sensing Big Data cloud platform and mathematical statistical methods to investigate the change in typical lakes and its attribution in Xinjiang during 1986-2020. The results showed that: 1) there was a significant linear trend in Xinjiang lakes: except for Jili Lake, the plains lakes showed an insignificant (p > 0.1) expansion trend, while the mountain lakes showed an significant expansion trend (p < 0.01). 2) There was a significant nonlinear trend in Xinjiang lakes: most of the plains lakes showed periodicity at 14 and 21 years, however most of the mountain lakes showed periodicity at 17 and 21 years. Most of the mutation trends of plains lakes were not significant, yet the mutation trends of mountain lakes showed significant expansion. 3) Human activities were the dominant factor leading to changes in the plains lakes: among the anthropogenic factors, farmland area, GDP, and population had significant effects on lake area (p < 0.1), and lake expansion was closely related to population and farmland area. Among climatic elements, precipitation mainly affected the changes in plains lakes. 4) Climate change was the dominant factor leading to changes in mountain lakes. The effects of temperature change on mountain lakes were all significantly positive (p < 0.05). In the future, it will be necessary to build lake protection schemes that adapt to climate change and human disturbances. This study can provide an important scientific basis for the rational development and utilization of lakes in Xinjiang.","[Wang, Wenqi; Shan, Qianjuan; Wang, Zikang; Ling, Hongbo] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi, Peoples R China; [Jiao, Ayong] Shihezi Univ, Coll Water Conservancy & Architectural Engn, Shihezi, Peoples R China; [Kong, Zijie] Tianjin Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul Engn Simulat & Safety, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Kong, Zijie] Tianjin Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Deng, Xiaoya] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xinjiang Institute of Ecology & Geography, CAS; Shihezi University; Tianjin University; Tianjin University; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research","Ling, HB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi, Peoples R China.;Deng, XY (corresponding author), China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",linghb@ms.xjb.ac.cn; lily80876@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; West Light Foundation of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xinjiang Water Conservancy Science and Technology Special Fund Project;  [52179028];  [2019-XBQNXZ-A-001];  [XSKJ-2022-10],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); West Light Foundation of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Xinjiang Water Conservancy Science and Technology Special Fund Project; ; ; ,"Funding This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52179028), the West Light Foundation of Chinese Academy of Sciences (2019-XBQNXZ-A-001), and the Xinjiang Water Conservancy Science and Technology Special Fund Project (XSKJ-2022-10).",,47,0,0,6,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

The current study proposed pocket fertigation, an innovative new idea in providing irrigation water and fertilization by using a porous material in the form of a ring/disc inserted surrounding the plant's roots as an irrigation emitter equipped with a pocket /bag for storing fertilizer. The objective was to evaluate the functional design of pocket fertigation in the specific micro-climate inside the screenhouse with a combination of emitter designs and irrigation rates. The technology was implemented on an experimental field at a lab-scale melon (Cucumis melo L.) cultivation from 23 August to 25 October 2021 in one planting season. The technology was tested at six treatments of a combination of three emitter designs and two irrigation rates. The emitter design consisted of an emitter with textile coating (PT), without coating (PW), and without emitter as a control (PC). Irrigation rates were supplied at one times the evaporation rate (E) and 1.2 times the evaporation rate (1.2E). The pocket fertigation was well implemented in a combination of emitter designs and irrigation rates (PT-E, PW-E, PT-1.2E, and PW-1.2E). The proposed technology increased the averages of fruit weight and water productivity by 6.20 and 7.88%, respectively, compared to the control (PC-E and PC-1.2E). Meanwhile, the optimum emitter design of pocket fertigation was without coating (PW). It increased by 13.36% of fruit weight and 14.71% of water productivity. Thus, pocket fertigation has good prospects in the future. For further planning, the proposed technology should be implemented at the field scale.","[Arif, Chusnul; Malik, Abdul; Setiawan, Budi Indra] IPB Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kampus IPB Darmaga, Bogor 16680, Indonesia; [Wibisono, Yusuf] Brawijaya Univ, Dept Bioproc Engn, Malang 65141, Indonesia; [Nugroho, Bayu Dwi Apri] Gadjah Mada Univ, Dept Agr & Biosyst Engn, Yogyakarta 55281, Indonesia; [Saputra, Septian Fauzi Dwi] IPB Univ, Sch Vocat Sci, Civil Engn & Management, Bogor 16680, Indonesia; [Mizoguchi, Masaru] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Ardiansyah, Ardiansyah] Jenderal Soedirman Univ, Dept Agr Engn, Purwokerto 53125, Indonesia",Bogor Agricultural University; Brawijaya University; Gadjah Mada University; Bogor Agricultural University; University of Tokyo; Universitas Jenderal Soedirman,"Arif, C (corresponding author), IPB Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kampus IPB Darmaga, Bogor 16680, Indonesia.",chusnul_arif@apps.ipb.ac.id; y_wibisono@ub.ac.id; bayu.tep@ugm.ac.id; septianfauzi@apps.ipb.ac.id; malik.abede3@gmail.com; budindra@apps.ipb.ac.id; amizo@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp; ardi.plj@gmail.com,"Setiawan, Budi Indra/AEX-7360-2022; Setiawan, Budi Indra/AGE-7817-2022; Arif, Chusnul/F-5098-2011; --, Ardiansyah --/G-3093-2014","Setiawan, Budi Indra/0000-0003-3046-8248; Arif, Chusnul/0000-0002-4760-9783; --, Ardiansyah --/0000-0003-4285-5480; Saputra, Septian Fauzi Dwi/0000-0002-3056-0899",Indonesian Collaborative Research Program-WCU (World Class University) scheme by IPB University [1376/IT3.L1/PN/2021],Indonesian Collaborative Research Program-WCU (World Class University) scheme by IPB University,This research was funded by the Indonesian Collaborative Research Program-WCU (World Class University) scheme by IPB University for the 2021 fiscal year with the number 1376/IT3.L1/PN/2021 dated 23 February 2021 by the project title Developing Innovative Pocket Fertigation Technology based on Artificial Intelligence and Adaptive to Climate.,,41,1,1,4,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,JUN,2022,12,6,,,,,,,1362,10.3390/agronomy12061362,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12061362,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,2K1PC,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000816114800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, a long-term experiment (1985-2019) was conducted under different management practices combining fertilization rate (no, low and high N fertilizer, N0, N1 and N2), straw additions (no, low and high addition, S0, S1 and S2) with conservation tillage (no-tillage, NT) in the North China Plain (NCP). The Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model was firstly evaluated using the experimental data, and then applied to simulate the changes of crop yields, soil organic carbon (SOC), and N2O emissions under different management practices combined with climate change scenarios, under low and high emission scenarios of societal development pathways (SSP245 and SSP585, respectively) with climate projections from 2031 to 2100. Under the low emission scenario (SSP245), wheat yields were the highest with the NT-N1-S2 treatment (a 23% increase relative to the baseline (1981-2010)). For maize yields, the NT-N1-S1 treatment increased 46% relative to baseline under the SSP585, whereas, the yields increased less in all treatments under SSP245-2040s. The SOC was predicted to increase by 6-60% by 2100 under SSP245. Straw addition and tillage were the main factors influencing SOC. N fertilizer was the most important driver for wheat and maize yields, however, N2O emissions from soil increased with increased application of N fertilizer. Therefore, the no-tillage method under low N fertilizer and high straw addition (NT-N1-S2) is recommended to promote crop yields and substantially increase SOC under SSP245 and SSP585. Conservation agriculture practices can potentially offset crop yield reductions, increase soil quality, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the NCP, and ensure crop production to meet the growing demand for food under future climate change.

The non-stationary processes such as climate change and human activities have brought severe challenges to life, agriculture and ecology in arid areas. It is of great practical significance to study the spatiotemporal variation and non-stationary characteristics of drought in arid region for adopting the countermeasures to adapt to climate change. The traditional trend change and variation analysis method was used to study the drought change characteristics, which could not effectively identify the clustering phenomenon of drought and the spatial and temporal variation of drought in different time intervals. Therefore, the method of breaks for additive seasonal and trend (BFAST) was introduced to determine the non-stationary characteristics and spatial variation of drought. In this study, a typical inland arid area was taken as the study area, and the drought was quantified by standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The results show that: (1) the study area was prone to light drought and moderate drought, and the duration and intensity of drought events increased significantly after 1996; (2) The spatial distribution of drought frequency and drought intensity in different seasons were significantly different; (3) The results of BFAST analysis showed that there were four discontinuities in SPEI12 time series, which indicated that the drought in the study area had obvious non-stationary characteristics. Through the analysis of the breakpoint and drought change characteristics in the study area, the occurrence time of the breakpoint in the northern region had a certain periodicity, and the climate was in a state of aridity. The results of this study have important guiding significance for further understanding the non-stationary characteristics of drought in inland arid areas, and will promote the management of water resources and the protection of ecological environment.","[He, Bing; Chang, Jianxia; Wang, Yimin; Wang, Yan; Zhou, Shuai; Chen, Chen] Xian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Ecohydraul Northwest Arid Reg China, Xian 710048, Peoples R China",Xi'an University of Technology,"Chang, JX (corresponding author), Xian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Ecohydraul Northwest Arid Reg China, Xian 710048, Peoples R China.",chxiang@xaut.edu.cn,,,National Science Foundation of China [U2003204]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51879214],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the Joint Funds of the National Science Foundation of China (Grant No. U2003204) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51879214).,,47,9,9,5,47,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

Most pastoralists are finding it difficult to sustain their livelihoods, and their communities have fallen into extreme poverty. Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) approaches are increasingly acknowledged as having the potential to enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable communities. The first step is to develop an understanding of how affected communities live, their perceptions of and how they respond to climate change and the biophysical impacts of climate change in their communities. This study aims to collect this information in order to explore the use of EbA to help pastoralists adapt to climate change. We examined an isolated pastoral Himba community, to understand their perceptions, experiences and understanding of climate change and its related impacts on their livelihoods. A nested mixed-methods approach using structured interviews was employed to address the study objectives. Interview results revealed that pastoralists lack scientific knowledge of climate change, and they have no access to climate change information. Though pastoralists have coping and adaptation approaches at the community level (such as making gardens, fishing, etc.), these have become ineffective as climatic uncertainty and change persist. Furthermore, pastoralists no longer get benefits from the environment, such as food and fodder. Despite this, there are currently no biodiversity interventions at the community level to address the impacts of climate change. Pastoralists have indicated their adaptation needs, particularly the provision of water supply to grow food. This is an open avenue to explore EbA approaches, specifically ecological restoration, while still addressing the need of the pastoralists. There is an urgent need to develop new practical adaptation strategies, including restoration options that will strengthen their adaptive capacity.","[Inman, Emilia N.; Hobbs, Richard J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; [Inman, Emilia N.] Univ Namibia, Multidisciplinary Res Ctr, Windhoek, Namibia; [Tsvuura, Zivanai] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Ctr Funct Biodivers, Sch Life Sci, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa",University of Western Australia; University of Namibia; University of Kwazulu Natal,"Inman, EN (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Perth, WA, Australia.;Inman, EN (corresponding author), Univ Namibia, Multidisciplinary Res Ctr, Windhoek, Namibia.",haimbiliemilia@gmail.com,"Hobbs, Richard J/F-5883-2010; Inman, Emilia N/M-2716-2014","Hobbs, Richard J/0000-0003-4047-3147; Inman, Emilia N/0000-0002-1350-9768","Russel E.

In this study, precipitation projections from 36 downscaled General Circulation Models (GCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) enabled examination of projected changes in future precipitation for the Clear Creek watershed in Houston, Texas, USA. Precipitation from 1950 to 2099 simulated with GCM were downscaled using the Bias-Correction Spatial Disaggregation method. Ten precipitation indices that represent precipitation amount, precipitation intensity, precipitation duration, and precipitation frequency evaluated how precipitation patterns will likely change. Results show that, at the annual scale, mean precipitation will significantly decrease based on RCP8.5, or remain relatively constant based on RCP2.6. Precipitation intensity and precipitation variability, however, will likely increase. Dry periods will lengthen significantly, whereas the length of wet spells will generally remain unchanged. At the monthly scale, the amount of precipitation, precipitation intensity, precipitation frequency and the length of wet spells will likely increase in September. In contrast, precipitation will likely decrease and dry spells will lengthen in April, May, August, November, and December. This finding illustrates that the intra-annual variability in precipitation will increase. The projected changes in precipitation under RCP8.5 are generally greater compared with RCP2.6. Differences between the scenarios are more pronounced towards the end of the century. Houston has recently experienced substantial precipitation variability, including severe drought and record-breaking precipitation from Hurricane Harvey in 2017. These events are consistent with the long-term GCM projections. Findings from this study can be applied to help manage water resources and enhance adaptability to climate change.

They can address local and regional issues of resource supply while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions and water in-security, hence enabling both mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. Although they form an increasingly important part of our resource governance landscape, these interventions have received relatively little academic scrutiny to date. Utilising the concept of the 'imagined public' as a lens through which to apply an interpretive version of Douglas' cultural theory, this paper presents a novel conceptual framework to analyse the governance of such initiatives. The framework distinguishes between interventions based on assumptions about potential householder participants, 'the imagined public', which are reflected in the initiatives' design and implementation. The framework is applied to compare three initiatives located in the increasingly populous, but water-scarce, county of Kent (southeast England). The analysis reveals whether and how institutional objectives are met; it also describes the interventions' environmental and socio-political contributions, and uncovers how learning occurs between initiatives. This research suggests that whilst the target interventions differed in their assumptions, design and implementation, they all made a small contribution to more sustainable resource governance. Fundamentally, the initiatives' impact on resource consumption was limited due to a shared technorational approach and a narrow framing of their household participants. Moreover, while all three initiatives demonstrated aspects of cumulative institutional learning, the closer involvement of resource providers and a modified funding framework are suggested as a means to engender the transformative change required for achieving greater resource efficiency. The paper concludes that the proposed conceptual framework provides a useful means to analyse, map, and enhance resource efficiency initiatives. Further, it is argued that the framework also has wider application in addressing broader environmental and social governance challenges. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Adaptation to climate change is conceptually closely linked to the reduction of the risk of disasters. Based on contemporary theory in behavioural risk research, the aim was to improve the knowledge on the process of adaptation of forest management to climate change among Swedish private individual forest owners. The responses from two questionnaires from 1999 to 2004, respectively, were analysed. Adaptation of forest management to climate change by private individual forest owners in what is currently the hemiboreal bio-climatic zone of Sweden was quantified and shown to increase over the five year period. In 2004 adaptive measures had been taken on a limited fraction of the forest land owned by private individuals in three study areas located along a latitudinal gradient ranging from the nemoral to the boreal bio-climatic zones in Sweden. Adaptive measures were more frequent in two southern study areas than in a northern study area. Measures taken to adapt were similar in all three study areas, except for those strongly conditioned by the current local climate. Among forest owners who had taken measure to adapt, perceptions of much higher risk due to climate change was more frequent for the risk of damage by wind, drought, fungi, and insects than for other risk factors. Further improvement of the knowledge on how the individual forest owners' learn and perceive of climate change, its impacts on risks and options for adaptation is required to develop and successfully implement adaptive climate change policies.

China is a sizable nation with a rich climate and a diverse range of food crops that are of interest to researchers. Additionally, there is little mention of agricultural technology and farm irrigation facilities in academic research on climate change and agricultural economic growth in China. As a result, this study uses the SBM model, panel fixed effect model, and SYS-GMM model to examine the development trend of climate change and food security based on the panel data of Chinese provinces from 2000 to 2020. The study found that China has maintained an average annual growth rate of 4.3% in agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) in recent years, despite the impact of extreme weather. The average annual precipitation has a depressing influence on the TFP in agriculture, while the average annual temperature has the opposite effect. The farm irrigation facilities and agricultural technology's moderating impact is mostly shown in how well they attenuate the impact of climate change on the TFP in agriculture. Food crops have thereby improved their ability to survive natural risks and attain higher yields as a result of advancements in agricultural technology and increasing investment in contemporary farm irrigation facilities. The study's conclusions are used in the article to make the suggestion that strengthening climate change adaptation is necessary to ensure food security. The strategic policy of storing grain in technology and storing grain in the soil and the advancement of contemporary agricultural technology must be put into reality while the management system for grain reserves is being improved.","[Li, Hai; Liu, Hui] Hunan Agr Univ, Sch Econ, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China",Hunan Agricultural University,"Liu, H (corresponding author), Hunan Agr Univ, Sch Econ, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China.",liuh1220@163.com,,,Key Science Fund Project of Hunan Provincial Department of Education [18A085]; Hunan Provincial Philosophy and Social Science Fund Project [21YBA079]; Hunan Postgraduate Scientific Research Innovation Project [CX2018B403],Key Science Fund Project of Hunan Provincial Department of Education; Hunan Provincial Philosophy and Social Science Fund Project; Hunan Postgraduate Scientific Research Innovation Project,"This research was funded by the Key Science Fund Project of Hunan Provincial Department of Education, grant number 18A085; Hunan Provincial Philosophy and Social Science Fund Project, grant number 21YBA079; and Hunan Postgraduate Scientific Research Innovation Project, grant number CX2018B403.",,62,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2023,15,4,,,,,,,2889,10.3390/su15042889,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15042889,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,9L3UW,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000941478400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, we know little about incorporating ecological vulner-ability into accurate decision-making for climate change adaptation and human activities governance. This study proposes a comprehensive framework to link the Vulnerability Scoping Diagram (VSD) model, Analytic Hier-archy Process-Entropy method, hot spot and cluster analysis into ecological vulnerability assessment and man-agement in the Ziwuling Mountain Region (ZMR), a typical loessial forest landscape in arid China. There were significant spatial and temporal changes in the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity index in the ZMR from 1990 to 2017. The exposure and adaptive capacity index increased from 1990 to 2017. The subareas with a high exposure value were distributed in the north and south ZMR, and the subareas with a high adaptive capacity value were distributed in the east ZMR. The ecological vulnerability declined during the study period, with the smaller value subareas allocated in the middle and south ZMR and higher value in the north and southwest. Significant spatial clustering patterns on the hot and cold spots of ecological vulnerability existed in the ZMR. The clustering subareas of hot spots on ecological vulnerability were mainly characterized by dry steppe, less precipitation, and less vegetation coverage. The subareas of cold spots of ecological vulnerability were domi-nated by forestry and forestry-agricultural landscapes. Some suggestions and countermeasures were put forward for adaptive management and sustainability enhancement. Our results provide integrative methods linking the VSD model, AHP-entropy method, hot spot and cluster analysis to ecological vulnerability reduction and adaptive management for dryland sustainability, especially for the forest social-ecological systems in the Chinese Loess Plateau.","[Gong, Jie; Jin, Tiantian; Cao, Erjia; Wang, Shimei; Yan, Lingling] Lanzhou Univ, Key Lab Western Chinas Environm Syst, Minist Educ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University,"Gong, J (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Key Lab Western Chinas Environm Syst, Minist Educ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",jgong@lzu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [4179420015],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant numbers 4179420015) .

Observational data was retrieved from the Kelowna weather station located in the centre of the valley. Indicators and thresholds associated with climate risks and climatic suitability were identified from among previous impact assessments on grape and wine within cool climate viticultural areas. Climate change projections from Global Climate Models were retrieved from the Climate Model Inter comparison Project 5, including both medium (RCP4.5) and high (RCP8.5) Representative Concentration Pathways. Two different statistical downscaling techniques were employed, evaluated, and selected, based on their ability to reproduce historical climate conditions. Scenarios from the Statistical Down-Scaling Model were used for temperature projections while scenarios from the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium were used for precipitation projections. All the temperature variables considered demonstrated statistically significant warming trends during the historical period with continued warming projected over the course of the 21st century. Precipitation trends were less conclusive, with a wetter climate projected despite some evidence of historical drying. The results of this study demonstrate that the Okanagan Valley has already transitioned from cool to intermediate climate viticulture and may shift further into warm climate viticultural classifications. This means greater climate risks associated with heat stress but less risk due to freeze damage and frost potential. Effective climate change adaptation is of critical importance to the grape and wine industry in this region. Such planning and management strategies can ensure climate risks are minimised while capitalising on new opportunities associated with improved climatic suitability for growing more Europeans grape varieties, capable of producing higher quality wines, which often sell for greater market prices.","[Hewer, Micah J.; Gough, William A.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; University Toronto Scarborough,"Hewer, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada.",micah.hewer@utoronto.ca,,"Hewer, Micah/0000-0003-4524-8184",NSERC [RGPIN-2018-06801],NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),This research is supported by NSERC Grant #RGPIN-2018-06801.,,71,4,5,8,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

Innovative spatial and urban planning methods and procedures are required, and new approaches and instruments must be elaborated and applied in order to shift from the building scale to the urban and territorial ones. In fact, while energy saving and emission control measures are usually applied to single buildings, plants and technological systems, the urban and territorial scales are not fully considered, although energy consumption and greenhouse gases reduction are connected to the urban form and density, to activities allocation, to mobility, etc., thus involving spatial and land-use planning decisions. It is therefore urgent to overcome the divide between energy and urban planning by elaborating and using new implementation tools. In general, the usual top-down, public-led actions are no longer politically and economically viable, whereas new methods based on public-private partnerships are being progressively adopted. This is a major change, which may set new objectives for planning practices in terms of urban quality, equity, and energy efficiency. This perspective requires redefinition of the usual methods for development rights assignment, and the activation of new planning procedures based on the assessment of actions in terms of performance instead of conformance to pre-defined rules. The expected results regard a more efficient land market and better performing development (or re-development) choices. The article focuses on the Italian case and analyzes the possibility of integrating energy planning with spatial planning, the effectiveness of plan implementation mechanisms, and the prospect of integrate public-led interventions with market tools. Recent innovations in the legislative framework support the inclusion of energy saving and climate change adaptation and mitigation goals in plan implementation procedures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The findings of the study indicate that indigenous people have idea about climate change and they get this idea from different media i.e., television, FM radio, local newspaper, peer groups etc. and blame developed countries for the causes of climate change events. The findings also indicate that for adapting to climate change, local people develop their own strategies, like planting trees surrounding their houses, per-forming religious activity, rendering mutual help to each other, taking relief or financial support from others for investment, applying indigenous technology, changing occupations etc. in their community. Very few empirical studies were conducted on cultural adaption of indigenous people in climate change, so this project findings can help policy makers as well as government to formulate policy to uplift this community in near future.","[Garai, Joydeb; Ku, Hok Bun; Zhan, Yang] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Social Sci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Garai, J (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Social Sci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",garai.joydeb@gmail.com; hok.bun.ku@polyu.edu.hk; yang.zhan@polyu.edu.hk,,,,,,,29,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2666-0490,,,CURR RES ENVIRON SUS,Curr.

The caper shoots are quite typical of the south-eastern part of Spain and their consumption is usually as a side in salads. The present investigation tries to raise awareness of the nutritional value of this aerial part of the caper plant and promote higher levels of consumption of this specific part, by means of the study of different cultivars located in different geographic zones. According to the present investigation, it has been observed that the tender stems have good biochemical characteristics, providing higher nutritional value than the flower buds and caper fruits. The cultivar Modified Letter Turned CommaORI 1 & apos; located in Orihuela (Alicante) has presented the best biochemical characteristics, due to its significantly higher values in polyphenols, flavonoids, flavonols and antioxidant activity. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to encourage the consumption of caper shoots, introducing them as one more ingredient in the Mediterranean diet.

The high level of uncertainty and complexity involved in adapting to climate change suggests that heuristics would be commonly used in this context rather than more structured decision methods. Through a systematic review of 137 articles, from 2007-2017 we explore the behavioral and cognitive assumptions used to examine agricultural decision-making related to climate change among farmers in developing countries. We find a strong orientation toward modeling behavior and decision making as a rational utility-maximizing process, despite decades of research demonstrating the prevalence of simpler heuristic choice when facing uncertainty and real-world constraints. Behavioral and cognitive approaches can increase our ability to predict or explain decisions being made in this realm, particularly in terms of how we understand decision making around information processing and risk assessment. In the following review, we highlight articles that have contributed to developing a more realistic decision-making framework for studying this problem on the ground. While there is a burgeoning literature using psychological insights to examine decision making under climate uncertainty, few studies consider the prevalence of simple heuristics, the presence of cognitive biases, and the salience of climate relative to other risk factors.","[Waldman, Kurt B.; Blekking, Jordan P.] Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Todd, Peter M.] Indiana Univ, Cognit Sci Program, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Omar, Shahera; Attari, Shahzeen Z.] Indiana Univ, ONeill Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Giroux, Stacey A.] Indiana Univ, Ostrom Workshop, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Baylis, Kathy] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Evans, Tom P.] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of Arizona,"Waldman, KB (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",kbwaldman@iu.edu,,,IU Bloomington Office of the Provost; IU Bloomington Office of the Vice Provost for Research,IU Bloomington Office of the Provost; IU Bloomington Office of the Vice Provost for Research,Funding for this research is from the IU Bloomington Office of the Provost and the IU Bloomington Office of the Vice Provost for Research.,,137,10,10,2,21,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

The first is to represent the capacity for proactive adaptation: this can be termed adaptive capacity. The second is to represent the capacity for reactive or instantaneous coping: this can be termed coping capacity. Adaptive capacity helps to determine which proactive adaptation options are feasible as inputs to the models under any given pair of climate and socio-economic scenarios. Coping capacity represents the residual ability to react to conditions, and influences vulnerability under any given set of model outputs. Using the example of the CLIMSAVE Integrated Assessment Platform, we explain how these capacities can be represented in integrated assessment. We demonstrate how an index of adaptive and coping capacity can be developed using a five-capitals (human, social, manufactured, natural, financial) model of societal wealth and incorporated in integrated assessment models. We find that for very aggregate applications, but not local or sectoral applications, the same indicators can be used to simulate adaptive and coping capacity. In addition, we argue that it is generally unnecessary to account for the depletion of capacity through adaptation itself, and that natural capital can generally be omitted from capacity measures if it is already directly represented in model outputs.","[Tinch, R.] Iodine Sprl, B-1170 Brussels, Belgium; [Jaeger, J.; Omann, I.; Wesely, Julia] Sustainable Europe Res Inst, Vienna, Austria; [Harrison, P.

A key to reducing these uncertainties is improved understanding of the relative contributions of individual factors. We evaluated uncertainties for projections of climate change impacts on crop production for 94 crop-region combinations that account for the bulk of calories consumed by malnourished populations. Specifically, we focused on the relative contributions of four factors: climate model projections of future temperature and precipitation, and the sensitivities of crops to temperature and precipitation changes. Surprisingly, uncertainties related to temperature represented a greater contribution to climate change impact uncertainty than those related to precipitation for most crops and regions, and in particular the sensitivity of crop yields to temperature was a critical source of uncertainty. These findings occurred despite rainfall's important contribution to year-to-year variability in crop yields and large disagreements among global climate models over the direction of future regional rainfall changes, and reflect the large magnitude of future warming relative to historical variability. We conclude that progress in understanding crop responses to temperature and the magnitude of regional temperature changes are two of the most important needs for climate change impact assessments and adaptation efforts for agriculture.","[Lobell, David B.; Burke, Marshall B.] Stanford Univ, Program Food Secur & Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Lobell, DB (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Program Food Secur & Environm, Y2E2 Bldg MC4205,473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",dlobell@stanford.edu,,"Burke, Marshall/0000-0003-4288-5858; Lobell, David/0000-0002-5969-3476",,,,,23,240,247,5,104,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

In the Amazon region, the direct threat of deforestation and degradation is now strongly intertwined with an indirect challenge we are just beginning to understand: the possibility of substantial regional drought driven by global climate change. The Amazon region hosts more than half of the world's remaining tropical forests, and some parts have among the greatest concentrations of biodiversity found anywhere on Earth. Overall, the region is estimated to host about a quarter of all global biodiversity. It acts as one of the major 'flywheels' of global climate, transpiring water and generating clouds, affecting atmospheric circulation across continents and hemispheres, and storing substantial reserves of biomass and soil carbon. Hence, the ongoing degradation of Amazonia is a threat to local climate stability and a contributor to the global atmospheric climate change crisis. Conversely, the stabilization of Amazonian deforestation and degradation would be an opportunity for local adaptation to climate change, as well as a potential global contributor towards mitigation of climate change. However, addressing deforestation in the Amazon raises substantial challenges in policy, governance, sustainability and economic science. This paper introduces a theme issue dedicated to a multidisciplinary analysis of these challenges.","Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Malhi, Yadvinder; Roberts, J.

Other landforms are thrust-block moraine, hummocky terrain, and drumlinoid hills. We argue in agreement with geomorphological models that this landform assemblage was generated by ice-flow instability, possibly a surge, which took place in the past when the ice was thicker and the bed warmer. The surge likely occurred due to elevated pore-water pressure in a thin layer of thawed and water-saturated till that separated glacier ice from a frozen substratum. Termination may have been caused by a combination of water drainage and loss of lubricating sediment. Sedimentological investigations indicate that key landforms may be formed by weak till oozing into basal cavities and crevasses, opening in response to accelerated ice flow, and into water conduits abandoned during rearrangement of the basal water system. Today, Elisebreen may no longer have surge potential due to its diminished size. The ability to identify ice-flow instability from geomorphological criteria is important in deglaciated terrain as well as in regions where ice dynamics are adapting to climate change.

This lack of progress is due, in large part, to the fact that there is no generally accepted framework for characterizing the regional economic impacts of, and responses to, climate change. The objective of this paper is to make a start at such a framework. We divide economic impacts at a regional level into four broad categories: direct impacts on production of market goods and services; direct impacts on production of nonmarket goods and services; indirect impacts on other economic sectors within the region; and indirect impacts operating through other regions and countries. We go on to consider two modeling frameworks for responses to climate change: static, in which regional capital stocks, technologies, and public and private institutions are exogenous; and dynamic, in which these variables are endogenous. Dynamic responses in capital stocks, technologies, and institutions are likely to be the most important adaptations to climate change and its effects on ecosystems, but also the least well understood at the present time.

Decision-makers are defending the extension of large infrastructures that are low greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters, as a way to act quickly and massively without calling into question existing economic models. This situation depoliticizes these projects, masking their other ecological consequences such as their impacts on biodiversity. This article examines how promoters of these projects depoliticized its socio-technical futures while other actors re-politicized them. Using the example of the Seine Nord Europe Canal project, we show a politicization of the territorial future and a depoliticization of the environmental future. This depoliticization is based on the techno-optimist discourse promoting large-scale infrastructures as the only possible solution to the global ecological and climate crisis. It uses a selective framing of the environment that makes some elements visible and others invisible. We conducted semi-structured interviews with biodiversity stakeholders in the territories that would be impacted by the canal. Based on the concepts of environmental forms and motives, we reconstructed the environmental ontologies ignored by the dominant discourse and assembled them into three alternative scenarios. We present the method of investigation and identification of these motives and discuss the likelihood of the constructed scenarios participating in a re-politicization based on the reactions of various actors.","[Petitimbert, Remy] Univ Lille, CER APS, CNRS, UMR 8026, Lille, France; [Bouleau, Gabrielle] INRAE UMR1326 Lab Interdisciplinaire Sci Innovat, Paris, France; [Guimont, Clemence] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, CESSP, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille,"Bouleau, G (corresponding author), INRAE UMR1326 Lab Interdisciplinaire Sci Innovat, Paris, France.",gabrielle.bouleau@inrae.fr,,"Bouleau, Gabrielle/0000-0001-5732-1372",ITTECOP programme (2017-2020); French Ministry of Ecological Transition; national Agency for Ecological Transition; French Foundation for Biodiversity Research (FRB),ITTECOP programme (2017-2020); French Ministry of Ecological Transition; national Agency for Ecological Transition; French Foundation for Biodiversity Research (FRB),"The project is sponsored by the ITTECOP programme (2017-2020) co-funded by the French Ministry of Ecological Transition, the national Agency for Ecological Transition, and the French Foundation for Biodiversity Research (FRB).",,43,2,2,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2195-4194,2195-2248,,EUR J FUTURES RES,Eur.

The following article discusses the question of whether current urban planning principles still provide a suitable framework for this purpose. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to identify and quantify the main parameters of the urban planning framework regarding energy demand and energy generation of buildings. In a novel, holistic approach, passive design measures were evaluated in a joint analysis based on a case study in the city of Vienna (Austria) with respect to their impact on heating and cooling energy demand, overheating potential, daylight availability, and solar potential of new buildings. The results show that by improving the thermal insulation of the building envelope, the importance of a high compactness of the buildings to lower the heating energy demand is decreased. In addition, moderate compactness can help reduce the energy demand for space cooling and artificial lighting and increase the solar potential of the buildings. Accordingly, the results question the dogma of a high degree of compactness that still exists to some extent and indicate that changing climatic conditions also require new approaches in the urban planning process.

While scientific knowledge on climate change abounds, literature syntheses are needed to understand the multidisciplinary impacts, identify critical knowledge gaps, and assess potential management and policy responses. In this study, we systematically map and analyze the topical and spatial distribution of climate change research in the mountainous headwaters of a major transboundary watershed, the Columbia River Basin (CRB). We find that climate change research in the CRB focuses on impacts much more frequently than adaptation, while mitigation is rarely a focus. Most studies assess trends at large spatial extents, use secondary data, and make projections of climate change impacts rather than observations. The spatial distribution and thematic content of research vary across an international border, with greater concentrations of research in the USA than Canada. A general scarcity of social science research and limited interaction between social and biophysical content reinforce the need for increased collaboration between disparate disciplines. Future research focus areas should include research related to climate change adaptation and mitigation, increased integration between social and biophysical sciences, and collaborations that bridge the international border for a more unified basin-wide focus. Focusing on these new directions for research will increase the potential for science and management communities to co-produce actionable science and effective responses to climate change.","[Marshall, Adrienne M.; Link, Timothy E.] Univ Idaho, Dept Forest Rangeland & Fire Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Foard, Meghan; Cooper, Courtney M.] Univ Idaho, Water Resources Grad Program, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Edwards, Paris] USDA, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, Northwest Climate Hub, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Hirsch, Shana L.] Univ Washington, Dept Human Centered Design & Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Russell, Micah] Western Colorado Univ, Dept Environm & Sustainabil, Gunnison, CO 81231 USA",Idaho; University of Idaho; Idaho; University of Idaho; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Marshall, AM (corresponding author), Univ Idaho, Dept Forest Rangeland & Fire Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA.",adriennemarshall@uidaho.edu; mfoard@uidaho.edu; cfc5786@psu.edu; paris.edwards@usda.gov; slhirsch@uw.edu; mrussell@western.edu; tlink@uidaho.edu,"Marshall, Adrienne/AAW-1932-2021; Cooper, Courtney/HLX-1535-2023; Cooper, Courtney/AAU-4049-2021","Cooper, Courtney/0000-0002-4270-2778; Marshall, Adrienne/0000-0001-5555-2548",National Science Foundation's IGERT Program [1249400],National Science Foundation's IGERT Program,"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation's IGERT Program (Award #1249400).

The policy agenda for the natural environment includes not only biodiversity, soils and water, but also associated human benefits through agriculture, forestry, water resources, hazard alleviation, climate regulation and amenity value. To address this broad agenda, the use of comparative risk assessment is investigated with reference to statutory requirements of the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment. Risk prioritization was defined by current adaptation progress relative to risk magnitude and implementation lead times. Use of an ecosystem approach provided insights into risk interactions, but challenges remain in quantifying ecosystem services. For all risks, indirect effects and potential systemic risks were identified from land-use change, responding to both climate and socio-economic drivers, and causing increased competition for land and water resources. Adaptation strategies enhancing natural ecosystem resilience can buffer risks and sustain ecosystem services but require improved cross-sectoral coordination and recognition of dynamic change. To facilitate this, risk assessments need to be reflexive and explicitly assess decision outcomes contingent on their riskiness and adaptability, including required levels of human intervention, influence of uncertainty and ethical dimensions. More national-scale information is also required on adaptation occurring in practice and its efficacy in moderating risks.

This paper builds on a series of reports commissioned in 2012 (Water Climate Change Impacts Report Card [WCCRC], 2012) and published in a special issue of Progress in Physical Geography in 2015 that interpreted and synthesised the relevant, peer-reviewed scientific literature of climate change impacts on the UK's water environment. It aims to provide reliable, clear information about the potential impacts of climate change on hydrology and the water environment. We review new evidence since 2012 for historical and potential future changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration, river flows and groundwater levels, river and groundwater temperature/quality and, finally, aquatic ecosystems. Some new evidence exists for change in most of these hydrological components, typically in support of the spatial and temporal trends reported in WCCRC 2012. However, it remains the case that more research has been conducted on rainfall and river flows than evapotranspiration, groundwater levels, river and groundwater temperature, water quality or freshwater ecosystems. Consequently, there remains a clear disparity of robust evidence for historical and potential future change between the top and bottom of the hydroclimatological-hydroecological process chain. As was the case in WCCRC 2012, this remains a significant barrier to informed climate change adaptation in these components of the water environment.","[Garner, Grace; Hannah, David M.] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Watts, Glenn] Environm Agcy, Evidence Directorate, Bristol, Avon, England; [Watts, Glenn] Kings Coll London, London, England",University of Birmingham; University of London; King's College London,"Hannah, DM (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",d.m.hannah@bham.ac.uk,"Hannah, David M./B-9221-2015","Hannah, David M./0000-0003-1714-1240",Living with Environmental Change (LWEC) partnership,Living with Environmental Change (LWEC) partnership,This work was funded by the Living with Environmental Change (LWEC) partnership.,,111,23,23,10,86,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0309-1333,1477-0296,,PROG PHYS GEOG,Prog.

Yet direct links between macroclimate and plant distribution are difficult to demonstrate. Studies of vegetation change in the pre-Pleistocene past and invasions of pine trees in the present indicate that the effects of climate are seldom direct. Vegetation change is most often caused by changes in disturbance regime or in competitive interactions, especially at the seedling stage. We argue that population-level studies, using predictions of climate effects on productivity of different growth forms and the (limited) knowledge of climate effects on reproductive biology, offer an important alternative to predicting and coping with climate change.","JONKERSHOEK FORESTRY RES CTR, S AFRICAN FORESTRY RES INST, STELLENBOSCH 7600, SOUTH AFRICA",Council for Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - South Africa,"BOND, WJ (corresponding author), UNIV CAPE TOWN, DEPT BOT, RONDEBOSCH 7700, SOUTH AFRICA.",,"Richardson, David M/A-1495-2008; Bond, William/AAY-7631-2020","Richardson, David M/0000-0001-9574-8297; Bond, William/0000-0002-3441-2084",,,,,57,19,22,0,3,ACAD SCIENCE SOUTH AFRICA A S S AF,LYNWOOD RIDGE,"PO BOX 72135, LYNWOOD RIDGE 0040, SOUTH AFRICA",0038-2353,1996-7489,,S AFR J SCI,S.

Using energy audits data from Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC), we investigate the annual energy consumption patterns for water treatment and distribution in 78 rural Alaska communities (average population < 500 people) along with seasonal, regional, and population impacts, and water treatment/ distribution system types. Regional trends of per capita annual energy consumption are as follows: Interior > Northern > Southwest > Gulf coast > Southeast regions of Alaska. Our results indicate that the per capita energy consumption is highest during the winter and lowest during the summer. Generally, the per capita energy consumption decreases with an increasing population. The variation of per capita energy consumption based on water distribution types shows that piped circulating systems consume the most energy, followed by washeteria, piped pressure, and closed haul. At the water treatment plant, space heating and electrical motors have the highest per capita energy consumption, followed by domestic hot water, tank heating, and lighting. The findings in this work suggest that per capita energy consumption (kWh/p) for water treatment and distribution in rural Alaska is about 12-26 times higher than the national average and about two orders of magnitude higher economic costs for the same. Overall, this work sheds light on energy use for water treatment and distribution in rural Alaska and establishes a baseline that would be useful for the rural Alaska communities' adaptation to climate change efforts, specifically in planning for and designing new water systems or updating existing systems.","[Rashedin, Muradur; Aggarwal, Srijan] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Civil Geol & Environm Engn, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Johnson, Barbara] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Nat Resources & Environm, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Dev, Subhabrata] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Water & Environm Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Whitney, Erin] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Alaska Ctr Energy & Power, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Schmidt, Jennifer] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Inst Social & Econ Res, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Madden, Dustin] Alaska Native Tribal Hlth Consortium, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage; Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium,"Aggarwal, S (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Civil Geol & Environm Engn, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",saggarwal@alaska.edu,,"Dev, Subhabrata/0000-0003-0568-6868",United States National Science Foundation;  [1740075],United States National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ,"Funding This research was funded by the United States National Science Foundation, Award #1740075: ?INFEWS/T3: Cou-pling infrastructure improvements to food-energy-water system dynamics in small cold region communities: MicroFEWs.?",,53,0,0,2,2,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",,2690-0637,,ACS EST WATER,ACS ES&T Wat.,DEC 9,2022,2,12,,,,,2668,2676,,10.1021/acsestwater.2c00417,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsestwater.2c00417,,NOV 2022,9,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,8C5QA,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000891465200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Different numerical approximations of the governing equations of the hydrodynamic models have been documented, but the numerical accuracy of these models and its subsequent effects on the simulated vegetation function and dynamics have rarely been evaluated. Using different numerical solution methods (including implicit and explicit approaches) and vertical discrete grid resolutions, we evaluated the numerical performance of a plant hydrodynamic module in the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES-HYDRO version 0.1) based on single-point and global simulations. Our simulation results showed that when near-surface vertical grid spacing is coarsened (grid size >10 cm), the model significantly overestimates aboveground biomass (AGB) in most of the temperate forest locations and underestimates AGB in the boreal forest locations, as compared to a simulation with finer vertical grid spacing. Grid coarsening has a small effect on AGB in the tropical zones of Asia and South America. In particular, coarse surface grid resolution should not be used when there are large and prolonged water content differences among soil layers at depths due to long dry-season duration and/or well-drained soil or when soil evaporation is a dominant fraction of evapotranspiration. Similarly, coarse surface grid resolution should not be used when there is lithologic discontinuity along the soil depth. This information is useful for uncertainty quantification, sensitivity analysis, or the training of surrogate models to design the simulations when computational cost limits the use of ensemble simulations.","[Fang, Yilin] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Earth Syst Sci Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Leung, L.

This study aims to investigate the performance of Zarrineh Rud reservoir by implementing strategies for adaptation to climate change. Daily meteorological and hydrometric data were collected from selected stations upstream of the dam over a 26-year period (1990-2016). Using sequent peak algorithm (SPA) and with respect to the drinking and agricultural water demand, the active storage and its rule curve were simulated. Then, the optimal rule curve was procured through GA-SPA, aiming to minimize the downstream water shortage. The future climate data were downscaled using SDSM based on CanEsm2 model and under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios for near (2020-2038), middle (2039-2058), and far (2059-2076) future periods. Then, the rainfall-runoff of HBV-light model was employed to calculate reservoir inflow for the mentioned periods. Finally, in view of environmental demand, reservoir performance indices were calculated for both non-adaptive and adaptive (static and dynamic hedging rules) policies. Results showed a significant decrease in the annual reservoir inflow compared to the baseline for all future periods. The least decrease was observed in RCP2.6 (nearly 23%) for the near future, whereas the largest decrease was in RCP8 (39%) for the middle period. Simulation with the static hedging rules managed to significantly reduce the average vulnerability index (by 60%) compared to no hedging, while the dynamic hedging rules outperformed static hedging rules only by 9%. Therefore, considering the insignificant improvement in reservoir performance using dynamic rules and their complexity, static hedging rules are recommended as the better option for adaptation during climate change.","[Moghaddasi, Mahnoosh; Akhondi, Najemeh] Arak Univ, Fac Agr & Environm, Dept Water Sci & Engn, Arak, Iran; [Moghaddasi, Mahnoosh; Akhondi, Najemeh] Arak Univ, Water Inst, Dept Water Resources, Arak, Iran; [Anvari, Sedigheh] Grad Univ Adv Technol, Inst Sci & High Technol & Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Kerman, Iran",Arak University; Arak University; Graduate University of Advanced Technology,"Moghaddasi, M (corresponding author), Arak Univ, Fac Agr & Environm, Dept Water Sci & Engn, Arak, Iran.;Moghaddasi, M (corresponding author), Arak Univ, Water Inst, Dept Water Resources, Arak, Iran.",mah_moghaddasi@hotmail.com; anvari.t@Gmail.com,,"Moghaddasi, Mahnoosh/0000-0003-4933-6501",,,,,50,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

Yet, there is little systematic investigation into how international organizations can help smallholder farmers manage agricultural systems to respond to climate change. Analyzing these organization's priorities and highlighting their knowledge gaps are crucial for designing future pathways of CSA. We intend to use this article to identify overarching CSA themes that can guide large international organizations to focus their CSA agenda in the hope of achieving goals associated with food security and sustainable intensification. We specifically ask the following question: How have the key CSA topics and themes emerged in the gray literature of international organizations between 2010 and 2020? We adopted a topic modeling approach to identify how six international organizations engaged with several topics related to CSA. Following the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) approach, we identified eight topics in the documents, representing four overarching themes: gender research, weather and climate, CSA management and food security. We found that there is insufficient discussion on the issues relating to governance measures and gender mainstreaming, with a larger focus on techno-managerial measures of CSA. We conclude that research and training related to CSA must offer opportunities for marginalized and disproportionately vulnerable populations to participate and raise their voices and share innovative ideas at different levels of governance.

In the context of climate change, understanding the nature and drivers of shifts in the northern limit of paddy rice (NLPR) is crucial for adaptation strategies and food security. However, quantitative studies on the effect of climate change on paddy rice distribution shifts have not been well performed. Here, we mapped the NLPR in China using Landsat imagery from 1984 to 2013, analyzed the latitudinal and elevational dynamics of the NLPR using Fishnet analysis, and explored the factors driving the changes in rice area across the NLPR regions using a linear regression model. Our results show that between 1984 and 2013, the NLPR shifted 24.93 km northward (the greatest movement was 88.01 km occurring at approximately 133 degrees E) and elevational limits increased by 39.15 m (the greatest movement was 117.08 m occurring at approximately 129 degrees E). While socioeconomic factors (e.g. benefits, policies, irrigation, and mulch) played significant roles in rice area changes, the changes in rice area across the NLPR regions had the strongest positive association with the increase in the previous temperature, indicating that rice cultivation in the NLPR regions has moved to higher latitudes over the 30 year study period to adapt to climate change. Our study highlighted that quantifying the interactions between climate change and crop production systems can facilitate a better understanding of the human responses to changes in the growing conditions in the face of climate change and ensuring regional and global food security.","[Liang, Shefang; Wu, Wenbin; Sun, Jing; Li, Zhipeng; Sun, Xiao; Chen, Hao; Chen, Shi; Fan, Lingling; Yang, Peng] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Key Lab Agr Remote Sensing AGRIRS, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [You, Liangzhi] Int Food Policy Res Inst IFPRI, 1201 1 St,NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [You, Liangzhi] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Macro Agr Res Inst, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning, CAAS; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Huazhong Agricultural University","Yang, P (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Key Lab Agr Remote Sensing AGRIRS, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",yangpeng@caas.cn,,"YANG, PENG/0000-0002-7999-9763; Liang, Shefang/0000-0002-3453-8373","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41921001, 41871358]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFA0607401]; Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences [Y2017JC30]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Award Nos. 41921001 and 41871358), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Award No. 2019YFA0607401), and the Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Award No. Y2017JC30).",,60,7,8,10,36,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

While studies have been conducted to assess the implications of climate change on nature resorts in the global north, there is little understanding of how climate change will affect these resorts across Africa, where tourism is a significant contributor towards livelihood security for many. This study examined the evidence for and potential impacts of climate variability and change on nature-based tourism activities in the Kariba resort in Zimbabwe. A case study approach was used, with both primary and secondary data analysed using ArcGIS 10.3. Content and thematic analysis and Mann-Kendall trend analysis were also performed. The study revealed that nature-based tourism in Kariba is under threat from increased and intense droughts, likely resulting from climate change. Extreme temperatures and droughts are critical threats to biodiversity and water levels in Lake Kariba, and they undermine both certain tourist activities and destination attractiveness. Increased incidents of drought, among other factors, have likely led to a reduced hotel occupancy over the last two decades threatening tourism business viability. The paper recommends that the tourism industry in Kariba should streamline its operations, retrofit and invest in green buildings to adapt to climate change. Further studies are suggested to quantify the economic impacts of climate variability and change on flora and fauna. The results provide tourism players and other agencies with information that can support various management decisions and represent a benchmark for future monitoring of climate change in Kariba in line with the dictates of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 on climate action.","[Dube, K.] Vaal Univ Technol, Dept Ecotourism Management, Andries Potgieter Blvd, ZA-1911 Vanderbijlpark, South Africa; [Nhamo, G.] Univ South Africa, Inst Corp Citizenship, Preller St, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",Vaal University of Technology (VUT); University of South Africa,"Dube, K (corresponding author), Vaal Univ Technol, Dept Ecotourism Management, Andries Potgieter Blvd, ZA-1911 Vanderbijlpark, South Africa.",kaitanod@vut.ac.za; nhamog@unisa.ac.za,"Dube, Kaitano/I-7261-2016; Nhamo, Godwell/N-5165-2015; Dube, Kaitano/K-5533-2019","Dube, Kaitano/0000-0002-7482-3945; Nhamo, Godwell/0000-0001-5465-2168; ","EXXARO Chair for Business and Climate Change University of South Africa, South Africa","EXXARO Chair for Business and Climate Change University of South Africa, South Africa","Authors would want to appreciate the following organisation for their support EXXARO Chair for Business and Climate Change University of South Africa, South Africa for fieldwork funding, Zimbabwe Meteorological Services Department for climate data and Zambezi River Authority for availing hydrological data through Engineer Phery Mwiinga.",,52,26,26,3,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-0780,2213-0799,,J OUTDOOR REC TOUR,J.

For that, 70 actors linked to the construction and implementation of these actions were interviewed, and was utilized the policy translation and implementation approaches. The paper demonstrates that the ABC Plan construction involved a certain advance translation of the ideas from the international to the national context. Interpreted as an opportunity to re-signify the Brazilian agriculture, agribusiness actors defined a strategy in advance and attended in the COP15 with a structured policy proposal for low-carbon agriculture. Diverging of the unidirectional policy transfer, the Plan and the ABC Program resulted of a process of two-way translation from the international to the national level, strategically guided by Brazil. After being translated into the national context, the ABC Plan and Program were (re)translated during its implementation, when reaching local spaces. If the ideas of reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions were present during the ABC Plan and Program formulation, they do not find any correspondence in the interpretations and actions of street-level bureaucrats. They interpret the Program as another credit line, pointing out formal and administrative issues that discourage the policy access. It is observed, therefore, an interpretive distance between the ideas on the global scale and their translations into national and local scales.","[Chechi, Leticia] Univ Estado Santa Catarina UDESC, Ctr Ciencias Agrovet, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Grisa, Catia] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul UFRGS, Dept Interdisciplinar, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Grisa, Catia] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul UFRGS, Programas Posgrad Desenvolvimento Rural PGDR & Di, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Chechi, L (corresponding author), Univ Estado Santa Catarina UDESC, Ctr Ciencias Agrovet, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",leticiaandreachechi@gmail.com; catiagrisaufrgs@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,0,0,1,4,REVUES ORG,PARIS,"CENTRE SOCIOLOGIE ORGANISATIONS CSO SCIENCES PO-CNRS, 27 RUE SAINT-GUILLAUME, PARIS, 75007, FRANCE",1958-9212,,,CONFINS,Confins,,2020,46,,,,,,,,,10.4000/confins.31291,http://dx.doi.org/10.4000/confins.31291,,,19,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,PH2XO,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000600282500015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Measurement of the extent and distribution of shallow reef platforms by remote sensing of bathymetry enables an assessment of the relative exposure or protection of each part of an island. Fringing reefs are one of a number of physical variables relevant to the coastline's susceptibility to erosion and inundation resulting from extreme weather and conditions exacerbated by climate change and rising sea levels. In this research the extent of shallow reef platform around Lifuka Island, Tonga, was determined using a modified Stumpf band ratio method applied to Landsat 8 and high-resolution Quickbird satellite imagery, with aerial LIDAR data available for ground-truth purposes. The results indicate that both sets of satellite imagery provide a means of measuring the bathymetry to at least 15 m with a correlation (R-2) value of 0.87 for Landsat 8 and to 15 m with a correlation (R-2) value of 0.86 for Quickbird, when compared with the LIDAR survey. This article forms part of the research into the preparation of a coastal vulnerability index to inform decision-making and risk assessment for Pacific Island nations at the subisland scale. The mapping of the fringing reef by remote sensing allows its spatial distribution to be considered in the assessment of risk to coastal regions to inundation and erosion processes. Further, it demonstrates the value of freely available Landsat data for planning adaptation to climate change in developing nations at a level pertinent to local governance of villages and communities.","[Moffitt, David L.; Kumar, Lalit] Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia",University of New England,"Moffitt, DL (corresponding author), Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",dmoffit5@myune.edu.au,"Kumar, Lalit/A-6397-2011","Kumar, Lalit/0000-0002-9205-756X",,,,,71,12,12,2,20,COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION,COCONUT CREEK,"5130 NW 54TH STREET, COCONUT CREEK, FL 33073 USA",0749-0208,1551-5036,,J COASTAL RES,J.

This is mainly due to the fact that they are relevant in addressing multiple challenges associated with rural development, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, and sustainable forest management. However, there are concerns about the implications of strategic and practical steps taken in this context on forest-dependent communities. Thus, there is need to reconcile local socio-economic vulnerabilities and forest-based climate change intervention initiatives. In the current study, socio-economic factors influencing households' dependence on forest resources and associated implications on climate change interventions were investigated. Proportionate stratified random sampling was used to select 366 households from forest-based rural communities in Vhembe District of South Africa. A structured questionnaire was administered to household heads in 21 villages. The Pearson's chi-square test was used to analyse the factors that influence household dependence on forest. The effects of household socio-economic characteristics on households' forest dependence influencing factor were determined using the binary logit model. Up to 97% of the respondents depended on the forest resources predominantly because of low costs associated with using them. It was observed that socio-economic characteristics of households such as farm husbandry skills, years of residence (53-65) in the community and age of respondents (38-65) significantly (P < 0.05) influenced use of the forest resources. Thus, effectiveness and sustainability of forest-based climate change intervention initiatives can be promoted if the socio-economic conditions prevailing within households in areas next to forests are improved.","[Ofoegbu, Chidiebere; Chirwa, Paxie W.; Babalola, Folarannmi D.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Forest Sci Postgrad Programme, Pretoria, South Africa; [Francis, Joseph] Univ Venda, Inst Rural Dev, Thohoyandou, South Africa; [Babalola, Folarannmi D.] Univ Ilorin, Dept Forest Resources Management, Ilorin, Nigeria",University of Pretoria; University of Venda; University of Ilorin,"Ofoegbu, C (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Forest Sci Postgrad Programme, Pretoria, South Africa.",ofoegbu.c@gmail.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Babalola, Folaranmi D./AAD-9791-2020; Francis, Joseph/AAK-3951-2021; Ofoegbu, Chidiebere/Q-8372-2019","Babalola, Folaranmi D./0000-0002-8837-0991; Ofoegbu, Chidiebere/0000-0002-8920-9411",National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa; School of Postgraduate Forestry Programmes at the University of Pretoria in South Africa,National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa); School of Postgraduate Forestry Programmes at the University of Pretoria in South Africa,"We are indebted to the National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa and the School of Postgraduate Forestry Programmes at the University of Pretoria in South Africa for funding this study.

This paper examines this relationship in the context of households in extreme poverty in the city of Khulna, Bangladesh. It draws on a quantitative data set based on 550 household interviews in low-income and informal settlements that identified the extent of the underlying drivers of vulnerability in this setting, including very low income, inadequate shelter, poor nutritional status and limited physical assets. A series of focus groups were used to explore the ways in which physical hazards have interacted with this underlying vulnerability, as a means to understand the potential impacts of climate change on this particular group of urban residents. These outcomes include frequent water-logging, the destruction of houses and disruption to the provision of basic services. The main focus of the paper is on describing the practices of low-income urban residents in responding to climate-related shocks and stresses, placing these in a particular political context, and drawing lessons for urban policies in Bangladesh and elsewhere. A wide range of specific adaptation-related activities can be identified, which can be grouped into three main categories - individual, communal and institutional. The paper examines the extent to which institutional actions are merely coping - or whether they create the conditions in which individuals and households can strengthen their own long-term resilience. Similarly, it examines the extent to which individual and communal responses are merely coping - or whether they have the potential to generate broader political change that strengthens the position of marginalized groups in the city.","[Haque, Anika Nasra] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Dodman, David] IIED, London, England; [Dodman, David] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Hossain, Md.

Such lines may be affected in carbon partitioning, and in allocation to the sinks. We focused on 'L4080', which harbored an A. thaliana zDof (DNA-binding one zinc finger) isoform 1.3 (AtzDof1.3) gene, and which had a 2-4-fold higher starch-to-sucrose ratio in source leaves over the diel (p < 0.05). Our aim was to determine whether there were associated effects on productivity. L4080 plants were altered in nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) metabolism. The N-to-C ratio was higher in six-week-old L4080, and when treated with 1/10 N, L4080 growth was less inhibited compared to the wild-type and this was accompanied by faster root elongation (p < 0.05). The six-week-old L4080 acquired 42% more dry matter at 720 ppm CO2, compared to ambient CO2 (p < 0.05), while the wild-type (WT) remained unchanged. GC-MS-TOF data showed that L4080 source leaves were enriched in amino acids compared to the WT, and at 49 DPA, fruit had 25% greater mass, higher sucrose, and increased yield (25%; p < 0.05) compared to the WT. An Affymetrix cDNA array analysis suggested that only 0.39% of the 9000 cDNAs were altered by 1.5-fold (p < 0.01) in L4080 source leaves. C-14-labeling of fruit disks identified potential differences in 14-DPA fruit metabolism suggesting that post-transcriptional regulation was important. We conclude that AtzDof1.3 and the germplasm derived therefrom, should be investigated for their 'climate-change adaptive' potential.","[Luengwilai, Kietsuda; Yu, Jingwei; Jimenez, Randi C.; Thitisaksakul, Maysaya; Dong, Shaoyun; Beckles, Diane M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Vega, Andrea] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Engn & Sci, Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, Millennium Nucleus Dev Super Adaptable Plants MN, Santiago 7941169, Chile; [Luengwilai, Kietsuda] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Agr Kamphaeng Saen, Dept Hort Dept, Kamphaeng Saen Campus, Kamphaeng Saen 73140, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand; [Yu, Jingwei] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Life Sci, Inst Plant & Food Sci, Dept Biol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Jimenez, Randi C.] Calif Dept Food Agr, 3294 Meadowview Rd, Sacramento, CA 95832 USA; [Thitisaksakul, Maysaya] Khon Kaen Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biochem, Khon Kaen 40002, Thailand; [Dong, Shaoyun] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Vegetable & Flowers, Beijing 10008, Peoples R China","University of California System; University of California Davis; Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Kasetsart University; Southern University of Science & Technology; California Department of Food & Agriculture; Khon Kaen University; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Vegetables & Flowers, CAAS","Beckles, DM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",dmbeckles@ucdavis.edu,"Vega, Andrea/Y-1874-2019","Vega, Andrea/0000-0003-0841-5713; Thitisaksakul, Maysaya/0000-0003-1485-2610; Yu, Jingwei/0000-0003-4268-436X","UC BioSTAR, National Science Foundation [MCB 6011233]; USDA CSREES CRIS [CA-D*-PLS-7821-H]; France Berkeley Fund; Anandamahidol Foundation of Thailand; Paulden F. & Dorathea Knowles Scholarship; UC Davis Horticulture & Agronomy Graduate Group Scholarship; Henry A.

The five global climate models were used with a number of 15 experiments to assess near future water resources over the period 2026-2040. The impacts of climate change were quantified in percentages relative to a retrospective period (1986-2000). On average, the surface temperature tends to increase by 1.45, 1.48, and 1.80 degrees C under the lowest (RCP2.6), intermediate (RCP4.5), and highest (RCP8.5) CMIP5 greenhouse gas emission scenarios, respectively. Mathematical model called H08 was used, the coupling of three modules did a very good job on mimicking river discharge with high Nash-Sutcliffe and Index of Agreement. The projections of rainfall and its response to surface runoff and groundwater recharge exhibit relatively uneven distributions. The upper basin tends to face extremely heavy rainfall and taking place of serious flood, while the lower areas are expected to cope with drought. Based upon ensemble averages over the entire area, relative changes of-1.7% (-6.4%),-0.1% (-5.2%), and-2.0% (-9.3%) in the mean annual rainfall (groundwater recharge) are shown under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. This study included a groundwater recharge assessment indicating potential available groundwater use, which is considered to be a key resource for climate change adaptation. Based on these findings, implementing such an artificial groundwater recharge system is needed in order to harvest surplus water and making for coping with water stress in the dry season.","[Yoobanpot, Naphol; Pratoomchai, Weerayuth] King Mongkuts Univ Technol North Bangkok, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Bangkok, Thailand",King Mongkuts University of Technology North Bangkok,"Pratoomchai, W (corresponding author), King Mongkuts Univ Technol North Bangkok, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Bangkok, Thailand.",naphol.y@eng.kmutnb.ac.th; weerayuth.p@eng.kmutnb.ac.th,,"Pratoomchai, Weerayuth/0000-0002-9450-8395","Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok;  [ENG-64-108]","Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok; ","The authors are very pleased with and appreciate the funding provided by Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, under grant number ENG-64-108.",,32,1,1,1,1,GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA ASSOC - GT Assoc,Cluj-Napoca,"2 Prunilor Street, Cluj-Napoca, ROMANIA",1842-5135,2065-4421,,GEOGR TECH,Geogr.

It is especially critical for those who face high degrees of urban inequality in the context of an uneven state presence. This paper is an explorative and investigative study which uses Cairo as a case. The focus of the study is on mapping state and private sector efforts in mitigating climate change issues, specifically for vulnerable groups who have limited access to public services. The study adopted an investigative approach where a literature search and bibliometric mapping were used to identify the gap in knowledge in the field of architecture and urban climate change mitigation and adaptation, followed by a field survey which included conducting interviews and questionnaires with different stakeholders from the public and private sector to investigate the link between the efforts for climate change mitigation. The explorative part of the study concluded that there is a huge knowledge gap in the Middle East and in Egypt when it comes to research efforts related to climate change with a focus on the built environment. The results of the investigative part of this study revealed that-apart from already limited efforts on ground-there is no synchronization in efforts between the public and private sector. Climate change issues are still not a priority when poverty, economy, and health are still a prime concern and take precedence over climate change. There is uneven presence of public efforts for climate change adaptation and mitigation. The efforts that do exist in the public sphere are self-help unorganized work (efforts) conducted by the civil society.","[Dabaieh, Marwa] Malmo Univ, Malmo, Sweden; [Maguid, Dalya; El Mahdy, Deena] British Univ Egypt, Cairo, Egypt; [Abodeeb, Rasha] Ain Shams Univ, Cairo, Egypt",Malmo University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); British University in Egypt; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Ain Shams University,"Dabaieh, M (corresponding author), Malmo Univ, Malmo, Sweden.",Marwa.dabaieh@mau.se; dalya.maguid@gmail.com; rashaabodeeb@gmail.com; deenaelmandy@gmail.com,,"El-Mahdy, Deena/0000-0001-8755-8733",Svenska Forskningsradet Formas,Svenska Forskningsradet Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),This study was supported by Svenska Forskningsradet Formas,,76,1,1,1,6,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1015-3802,1874-6330,,URBAN FORUM,Urban Forum,MAR,2022,33,1,,,SI,,83,106,,10.1007/s12132-021-09444-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12132-021-09444-6,,OCT 2021,24,Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Urban Studies,ZZ5KZ,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000711351400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The migration of communities away from vulnerable regions is highly likely to be an adaptation strategy used in low-elevation SIDS, as the impacts of climate change are likely to result in significant loss and damage, threatening their very territorial existence. SIDS must ensure that residents relocate to less vulnerable locations and may need to consider international movement of residents. Ad hoc approaches to migration and displacement may result in increased vulnerability of residents, making the development and enforcement of comprehensive national policies that address these issues a necessity. Design/methodology/approach - Interviews with United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiators for SIDS as well as analysis of secondary data, including Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, are utilized to determine policies and mechanisms in place that focus on climate-induced migration and displacement. Findings - While climate change is acknowledged as an existential threat, few SIDS have policies or mechanisms in place to guide climate-induced migration and displacement. Potential exists for migration and displacement to be included in policies that integrate disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation along with national sustainable development plans. Regional bodies are beneficial to providing guidance to SIDS in the development of nationally appropriate frameworks to address climate-induced migration and displacement. Originality/value - Existing gaps in policies and mechanisms and challenges faced by SIDS in developing strategies to address climate-induced migration and displacement are explored. Best practices and recommendations for strategies for SIDS to address migration and displacement are provided.","[Thomas, Adelle; Benjamin, Lisa] Univ Bahamas, Nassau, Bahamas",,"Thomas, A (corresponding author), Univ Bahamas, Nassau, Bahamas.",adelle.thomas@gmail.com,,"Benjamin, Lisa/0000-0001-9696-9817; Thomas, Adelle/0000-0002-0407-2891",,,,,83,31,30,8,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

The main objective of this paper is to present a case study (Tapera da Base) within the context of the project, Climate Change and Vulnerable Populations in Brazil, which discusses the problems associated with climate adaptation and relates these to risk-reducing activities. The methodology adopted involved: identifying local development organizations, focus group, interviews, and survey among families in the most vulnerable areas. The main findings show that Tapera residents do not associate the possible increase in their vulnerability to climate dynamics. They point to areas such as education, sanitation, and social assistance, as their most important local problems; thus not including climate change. To generate genuine participation it is crucial to creating initiatives that promote a social learning space for residents to evaluate their self-state of vulnerability and possibilities of development. Therefore climate change can make sense and the responses at the community level will be created in the context that shape how climate risk is perceived, prioritized and managed.","[Bonatti, Michelle; Lana, Marcos A.; Sieber, Stefan; Eufemia, Luca] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res, Muncheberg, Germany; [Lana, Marcos A.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden; [D'Agostini, Luiz Renato; Schlindwein, Sandro Luis] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [de Vasconcelos, Ana Carolina F.] Univ Fed Campina Grande, Agr Engn Dept, Campina Grande, Brazil; [da Silva-Rosa, Teresa] Vila Velha Univ Espirito Santo UVV ES, Ctr Socioenvironm & Urban Studies, Vila Velha, ES, Brazil; [Sieber, Stefan] Humboldt Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Berlin, Germany",Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade Federal de Campina Grande; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Bonatti, M (corresponding author), Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany.",Michelle.Bonatti@zalf.de,,"Sieber, Stefan/0000-0002-4849-7277","Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI) through the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)","Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI) through the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)","The development of this research was made possible thanks to funding by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI) through the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq).",,45,5,5,0,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,SEP,2019,29,,,,,,,,100496,10.1016/j.uclim.2019.100496,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2019.100496,,,12,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,JJ3CZ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000494040100020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Optimising Change Pathways for Climate Adaptation in Spatial Planning",SUSTAINABILITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,spatial planning; climate adaptation; transition; transformation; resilience; complex adaptive systems,ADAPTIVE GOVERNANCE; RESILIENCE,"In order to incorporate climate adaptation in spatial planning change is required, because climate change impacts the way we live. This implies that spatial planning, as the arranger of the spatial organisation and layout needs to be able to support this change. Current spatial planning is not yet well equipped to play this role. In this research article three possible routes to navigate change are explored. Incremental change is seen as a slow process, which modifies the landscape only slightly. Transition is seen as a fluent change towards a new future, which is an improved version of the existing; and transformation is seen as a change towards a future that is fundamentally different from the existing. The three pathways are compared and it is concluded that transformational change offers the best perspective in dealing with uncertain, unexpected and unprecedented futures, such as developing in times of climate change. Therefore, transformation is theoretically further elaborated and it is found that a transformational change to a new system already starts at a time when the existing system still fully operates. The change to a new system (called B in this article) therefore already started and the predecessors of B already existed. These 'B-minuses' of the new system can be found through network analysis, where the most intense and connective nodes are the most likely 'B-minuses'. Alternatively B-minuses can be created through locating the areas where key-nodes and existing infrastructure can be related to existing urban functions. As illustrated in the case-study design, these principles are able to guide the design of a climate proof landscape.","[Roggema, Rob] Swinburne Univ Technol, Inst Social Res, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Roggema, Rob; van den Dobbelsteen, Andy] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; [Roggema, Rob] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Vermeend, Tim] UC Architects, NL-9712 NX Groningen, Netherlands",Swinburne University of Technology; Delft University of Technology; Wageningen University & Research,"Roggema, R (corresponding author), Swinburne Univ Technol, Inst Social Res, POB 218, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia.",rob@cittaideale.eu; timvermeend@ucarchitects.com; a.a.j.f.vandendobbelsteen@tudelft.nl,,,Dutch 'Climate Changes Spatial Planning' programme,Dutch 'Climate Changes Spatial Planning' programme,"This research was made possible by the contribution of the Dutch Ministry of Housing, Spatial Affairs and the Environment and by support of the Dutch 'Climate Changes Spatial Planning' programme.",,52,44,45,1,59,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2012,4,10,,,,,2525,2549,,10.3390/su4102525,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su4102525,,,25,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,213GJ,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000324043100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although, respective developing economies have dedicated action plans to mitigate or adapt to these adverse effects, financing for these strategies may be lacking or national governments may not commit financial resources to actualizing these strategies. Using a Budget Analysis and Climate Budget Tagging framework, the paper evaluates the financial resources the Nigerian government has committed to its adaptation strategies as stipulated in the 2011 National Adaptation Strategy and Plan of Action on Climate Change (NASPA - CCN). The study found out among others that, government expenditure on climate change tends to be more of mitigation than adaptation. In addition, adaptation programs targeted at the industry, commerce, telecommunications and transport sector are most neglected among other sectors highlighted as priority sectors in the NASPA - CCN policy. Lastly, we did not find any substantial evidence to support the argument for progressive achievements in financial resources allocated to adaptation programs in the budget. We recommended the need for simultaneously priorities both mitigation and adaptation programs, inculcate adaptation programs in future development plans and leaning towards international financing options during recessions and periods of low revenues.","[Onyimadu, Chukwuemeka Onyebuchi] Natl Assembly, Natl Inst Legislat & Democrat Studies, Abuja, Nigeria; [Uche, Daniel Sunday] Michael Okpara Univ Agr Umudike, Abia, Nigeria",,"Onyimadu, CO (corresponding author), Natl Assembly, Natl Inst Legislat & Democrat Studies, Abuja, Nigeria.",onyimaduchukwuemeka@yahoo.com,,,,,,,60,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8807,,,CLIM SERV,Clim.

The research used a content analysis of the annual reports of 43 companies that represented four DSE sectors. To quantify the level of environmental risk disclosure reporting practiced by corporations in their annual reports, the authors established the ERDIPCI for the pharmaceutical and chemical industry, the ERDITI for the tannery industry, the ERDITeI for the telecommunications industry, and the ERDIPPI for the paper and printing industry. Similarly, the machine learning clustering algorithm, k-means clustering, is used to cluster the companies based on the completion of different environmental indices. It is observed that from four sectors, the highest number of companies from the pharmaceutical and chemical industry disclosed environmental risk disclosures, and the lowest number of companies was from the tannery industry, followed by the telecommunications and the paper and printing industries. The enterprises differ significantly in their environmental risk disclosures, and the overall scenarios of the environmental reporting practices by companies in Bangladesh are quite poor. It also shows that among the 43 companies, a limited number of enterprises are placed first. The majority of the businesses are in the midst of a cluster that reflects the increasing order of indices fulfillment. This paper provided a few specific proposals to the relevant authorities in order to establish a regularity framework in which all the firms listed on the DSE in Bangladesh will be expected to address environmental risk disclosures and conservation actions in their annual reports towards adaptation to climate change and achieving environmental sustainability.","[Uddin, Mohammad Main; Rashid, Md Mamunar] Hajee Mohammad Danesh Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Accounting, Dinajpur 5200, Bangladesh; [Hasan, Mahmudul] Hajee Mohammad Danesh Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Dinajpur 5200, Bangladesh; [Hossain, Md Alamgir] Hajee Mohammad Danesh Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Management, Dinajpur 5200, Bangladesh; [Fang, Yuantao] Shanghai Lixin Univ Accounting & Finance, Dept Finance, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China",Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting & Finance,"Fang, YT (corresponding author), Shanghai Lixin Univ Accounting & Finance, Dept Finance, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China.",20190060@lixin.edu.cn,"YUANTAO, FANG/AHI-4330-2022; Hossain, Md.

Hydropower is a renewable, low-emission source of electricity baseload available throughout much of the world as an alternative to electricity conventionally provided by thermal combustion of fossil fuels; however, the global hydropower sector as it stands relies upon surface water flows of substantial and predictable volume. This makes it vulnerable to climate change. The impact of climate change on the hydropower sector is difficult to predict, and not globally uniform. It might be positive, negative, or inconsequential depending upon the local timing and magnitude of changes, reservoir size, allocation priority, and the energy market. The secondary effects of climate change on glacier lake outbursts floods, landslides, and sediment load are poorly understood. In addition, when planning hydropower projects for the future, attention must be given to the greenhouse gas contribution of the impounded waters behind storage dams, and the impact of dams on water temperature. In the past decade, sovereign nations and international development agencies worldwide have evaluated the potential of hydropower as a cost-effective, clean, sustainable option for baseload electricity supply. There is therefore a crucial need to assess the opportunities and risks hydropower poses across a wide range of potential future climate conditions. This review paper conducts a global survey of the literature on the effect of climate change on hydropower and identifies room for improvement in current approaches to evaluation of the net benefits of hydropower projects under climate change.

Migration is one way for people to adapt to these coastal changes, but presents an enormous policy challenge given the number of people affected. Knowledge about the relationship between SLR-related hazards and migration is therefore important to allow for anticipatory policymaking. In recent years, an increasing number of empirical studies have investigated, using survey or census data, how SLR-related hazards including flooding, salinization, and erosion together with non-environmental factors influence migration behavior. In this article, we provide a systematic literature review of this empirical work. Our review findings indicate that flooding is not necessarily associated with increased migration. Severe flood events even tend to decrease long-term migration in developing countries, although more research is needed to better understand the underpinnings of this finding. Salinization and erosion do generally lead to migration, but the number of studies is sparse. Several non-environmental factors including wealth and place attachment influence migration alongside SLR-related hazards. Based on the review, we propose a research agenda by outlining knowledge gaps and promising avenues for future research on this topic. Promising research avenues include using behavioral experiments to investigate migration behavior under future SLR scenarios, studying migration among other adaptation strategies, and complementing empirical research with dynamic migration modeling. We conclude that more empirical research on the SLR-migration nexus is needed to properly understand and anticipate the complex dynamics of migration under SLR, and to design adequate policy responses.

J,"Sharifi, A",,,,"Sharifi, Ayyoob",,,Trade-offs and conflicts between urban climate change mitigation and adaptation measures: A literature review,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,,English,Review,,,,,,Climate change; Mitigation; Adaptation; Conflict; Trade-off; Interaction,LOW-CARBON; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; CO-BENEFITS; SYNERGIES; RESILIENT; CITY; CONSUMPTION; INTEGRATION; TRANSPORT; FRAMEWORK,"Many cities around the world are increasingly developing plans and policies for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. These plans and policies are often focused on either mitigation or adaptation. This dichotomized approach can be problematic and result in trade-offs. In other words, efforts aimed at enhancing mitigation (adaptation) may hinder achieving adaptation (mitigation) objectives. Additionally, conflicts may arise as there might be inconsistencies between some mitigation and adaptation measures. Since trade-offs and conflicts between adaptation and mitigation measures can undermine effectiveness and efficiency of municipal activities, efforts should be made to avoid or minimize them. This study aims to provide a better understanding of potential trade-offs and conflicts through reviewing literature on the interactions between urban adaptation and mitigation measures. This is done through bibliographic analysis and detailed content analyses of selected papers. Results of this review show that research on trade-offs and conflict has gained traction since the publication of the fourth assessment report of The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. However, there is still a lack of empirical studies. In particular, limited research exists on the Global South cities. Also, according to the findings, existing research is mainly focused on trade-offs associated with measures related to energy, land use, transport, water, building, green infrastructure, and waste sectors. It is found that mitigation measures may have negative impacts on adaptation by increasing exposure to risks such as the urban heat island effect and flooding and/or by eroding livelihood options of poor and marginalized groups and causing equity concerns. In contrast, adaptation measures may increase greenhouse gas emissions by, among other things, reducing efficiency and increasing energy demand. It is discussed that integrated assessment frameworks should be utilized to deal with trade-offs and conflicts. Finally, some recommendations for better uptake of integrated frameworks are provided.

Further development of approaches which are participatory and embedded in an understanding of the importance of symbiotic relationships between sociocultural and ecological systems is particularly important. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is one such method that is gaining recognition and momentum in areas where developing nations face converging pressures and drivers of change. EbA methodologies to date, are often ill-defined in an urban context and lack consideration of future social and ecological scenarios however. In response, this paper describes a methodology for developing urban EbA projects in a small island developing nation context. The methodology was developed and applied by a multi-disciplinary team working under the auspices of the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP). The application of this methodology in Port Vila, Vanuatu indicated: i) the needs of local people must be at the forefront of project planning, requiring a participatory design process; ii) EbA solutions development must be multidisciplinary and iterative; iii) appropriate quantitative and qualitative data is vital as a basis for EbA project development, requiring adequate time for data gathering; iv) urban and coastal EbA projects must be developed holistically, recognising socio-ecological systems that extend beyond the urban area itself; v) the complex overlapping landscape of governmental and international aid financed projects must inform the development of new EbA projects; vi) potential monetary and non-monetary benefits, costs and risks across multiple factors must be carefully assessed in EbA project development; and vii) project implementation requires ongoing engagement and a readiness to adapt to on-the-ground realities.","[Zari, Maibritt Pedersen; Gual, Carles Martinez-Almoyna; Rastandeh, Amin] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Architecture, Wellington, New Zealand; [Blaschke, Paul M.; Jackson, Bethanna; Maxwell, Deborah; Renwick, James; Archie, Kelli M.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Komugabe-Dixson, Aimee] Minist Primary Ind, Fisheries New Zealand, Wellington, New Zealand; [Livesey, Chris] Chris Livesey Consulting, Wellington, New Zealand; [Loubser, David I.] Ekos, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Weaver, Sean] Blaschke & Rutherford Environm Consultants, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington; Victoria University Wellington,"Zari, MP (corresponding author), CBD, POB 600, Wellington 6011, New Zealand.",maibritt.pedersen@vuw.ac.nz,,"Archie, Kelli/0000-0001-9348-8073; Livesey, Chris/0000-0003-0523-2022; Pedersen Zari, Maibritt/0000-0003-4664-7558","Bundesministerium fur Umwelt, Naturschutz und nukleare Sicherheit of the German Federal Government","Bundesministerium fur Umwelt, Naturschutz und nukleare Sicherheit of the German Federal Government","We wish to acknowledge the following people for their helpful assistance at various stages: H.

Our premise is that action for sustainability originates with passionate individuals who lead action at the local level. We present our analysis of a walking sensory ethnography conducted in 2012 undertaken as part of exploratory research on adaptation to climate change in the coastal town of Dunbar, Scotland. We sought to understand the complex, embodied and sensorial ways in which places, and our experiences of connection to places, are constituted. The starting point for our discussion is the recognition of the intricate, deeply entangled relations between the human and nonhuman world that have historically been obscured by western understandings of a pristine nature set apart from the world of human culture. Building on literature under the umbrella of Anthropocene feminisms, we suggest that a visceral approach as conceptualised in the work of Hayes-Conroy and Hayes-Conroy (2008) and Hayes-Conroy and Martin (2010) offers embodied knowledge as a radically relational view of the world that allows an entry into the ways in which the micro-scale of the body intersects with the global scale of political praxis. Our detailed discussion of one of our research participants provides an example as to how this individual came to feel connected through a shared sense of consciousness with the human and non-human. In this exploration, we found possibilities in thinking beyond the otherwise paralysing narratives of anthropogenic climate change. Our argument is that this focus brings to the fore the transformative capacity of viscera, emotional and affective responses to anthropogenic climate change, and that these are integral to hope, albeit this is a hope that needs to consider capacity and vulnerability in new ways.","[Duffy, Michelle] Univ Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia; [Gallagher, Michael] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Waitt, Gordon] Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",University of Newcastle; Manchester Metropolitan University; University of Wollongong,"Duffy, M (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia.",Michelle.Duffy@newcastle.edu.au; M.Gallagher@mmu.ac.uk; gwaitt@uow.edu.au,"Duffy, Michelle/E-1623-2019","Duffy, Michelle/0000-0002-9749-0311; Gallagher, Michael/0000-0002-3858-0130",2012 Monash (Gippsland) Small Grant Research Support Scheme,2012 Monash (Gippsland) Small Grant Research Support Scheme,Funding for the project was made available through 2012 Monash (Gippsland) Small Grant Research Support Scheme.,,51,5,5,3,24,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0016-7185,1872-9398,,GEOFORUM,Geoforum,NOV,2019,106,,,,,,378,384,,10.1016/j.geoforum.2018.09.005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2018.09.005,,,7,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,JM6SC,,Green Accepted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000496340900038,View Full Record in Web of Science

Environmental consequences include increased temperature, excess precipitation in some areas and droughts in others, extreme weather events, and increased sea level. These consequences adversely affect agricultural production, access to safe water, and worker productivity, and, by inundating land or making land uninhabitable and uncultivatable, will force many people to become environmental refugees. Adverse health effects caused by climate change include heat-related disorders, vector-borne diseases, foodborne and waterborne diseases, respiratory and allergic disorders, malnutrition, collective violence, and mental health problems. These environmental and health consequences threaten civil and political rights and economic, social, and cultural rights, including rights to life, access to safe food and water, health, security, shelter, and culture. On a national or local level, those people who are most vulnerable to the adverse environmental and health consequences of climate change include poor people, members of minority groups, women, children, older people, people with chronic diseases and disabilities, those residing in areas with a high prevalence of climate-related diseases, and workers exposed to extreme heat or increased weather variability. On a global level, there is much inequity, with low-income countries, which produce the least greenhouse gases (GHGs), being more adversely affected by climate change than high-income countries, which produce substantially higher amounts of GHGs yet are less immediately affected. In addition, low-income countries have far less capability to adapt to climate change than high-income countries. Adaptation and mitigation measures to address climate change needed to protect human society must also be planned to protect human rights, promote social justice, and avoid creating new problems or exacerbating existing problems for vulnerable populations.","[Levy, Barry S.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth & Community Med, Sherborn, MA 01770 USA; [Patz, Jonathan A.] Univ Wisconsin, Global Hlth Inst, Nelson Inst, Madison, WI USA; [Patz, Jonathan A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Madison, WI USA",Massachusetts Department of Public Health; Tufts University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Levy, BS (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth & Community Med, Sherborn, MA 01770 USA.",blevy@igc.org,,,,,,,122,158,161,19,164,UBIQUITY PRESS LTD,LONDON,"2N, 6 OSBORNE ST, LONDON, E1 6TD, ENGLAND",2214-9996,,,ANN GLOB HEALTH,Ann.

A 2-year field study (2019/20 and 2020/21 growing seasons) was carried out to evaluate the effect of sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.) living mulch management on maize (Zea mays L.) production. Three sunn hemp planting periods were simultaneous with maize planting (P1), V15 maize growth stage (P2), and R1 maize growth stage (P3) and three densities 16.1 plants m(-2) (D1-low), 32.1 plants m(-2) (D2-medium), and 48.1 plants m(-2) (D3-high). The intercrop components were planted in a split-plot treatment arrangement as an additive series with three replications and laid out in a randomized complete block design under the in-field rainwater harvesting (IRWH) technique. The growing season conditions revealed significant differences in rainfall distribution. Therefore, the planting period had highly significant (p < 0.001) effects on sunn hemp biomass, with an LSD value of 610.2 kg ha(-1), showing that the highest was obtained in P2 (2636.7 kg ha(-1)) compared to P3 (811.3 kg ha(-1)). However, the P3 treatment resulted in maize grain yield penalty, with yields as follows: P3 (2775.2 kg ha(-1)), sole maize (3263.8 kg ha(-1)), P2 (3281.9 kg ha(-1)), and P1 (3287.8 kg ha(-1)). P2 yielded a significantly (p < 0.05) high-income equivalent ratio of 2.09, indicating a 109% advantage for increasing farmers' income by integrating sunn hemp under the no-till area of IRWH. P1 and P2 sunn hemp planting periods are viable options for smallholder farmers in summer rainfall regions to improve economic benefits.","[Dzvene, Admire R.; Tesfuhuney, Weldermichael; Walker, Sue; Ceronio, Gert] Univ Free State, Dept Soil Crop & Climate Sci, Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Walker, Sue] Agr Res Council Nat Resources & Engn NRE, Pretoria, South Africa",University of the Free State,"Dzvene, AR (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Dept Soil Crop & Climate Sci, Bloemfontein, South Africa.",dzvenea@gmail.com,,,Water Research Commission (WRC); National Research Fund (NRF); Food and Beverages Manufacturing Sector Education and Training Authority (FoodBev SETA),Water Research Commission (WRC); National Research Fund (NRF)(National Research Foundation of Korea); Food and Beverages Manufacturing Sector Education and Training Authority (FoodBev SETA),"The authors are grateful to Mr. Elias Yokwane, Department of Soil, Crop, and Climate Sciences, University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, for technical assistance during field trials.

Upscaling restoration efforts requires funding, and therefore evidence of the benefits of restoration is needed. This study aims to contribute towards addressing these gaps by: (1) bolstering the evidence base of the water-related impacts of investment into ecological restoration by improving the methods of predicting the streamflow impacts of alien tree clearing; and (2) exploring the potential size of the variability in catchment responses at a fine-scale (60x60 m) in one particular region by comparing four different neighbouring catchments. We model the im-pacts on streamflow in four strategic water providing catchments using the fully-distributed MIKE-SHE modelling tool. We find that the benefits of clearing mature infestations of alien trees, such as pines, from naturally tree-less ecosystems can increase available surface water resources by 15.1 to 29.5%. Clearing riparian invasions is predicted to have a 1.7 times greater impact compared to terrestrial (non-riparian) invasions. The largest modelled impact of restoration on streamflow is on the mid to low flows, and this impact is greater in dry years relative to wet years. The findings are novel in that they shed light on the types of spatial uncertainties that can be expected in modelled gains, with implications for generalisation. These findings are important for leveraging investment to upscale restoration efforts in water scarce regions, as they suggest improved water security during the dry season and droughts. Upscaling efforts is essential if the degradation of ecosystems globally is to be prevented, halted and reversed, as proposed by the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.","[Rebelo, Alanna J.; Esler, Karen J.] Stellenbosch Univ, Conservat Ecol & Entomol, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Rebelo, Alanna J.] Agr Res Council, Inst Soil Climate & Water Nat Resources & Engn, Pretoria, South Africa; [Holden, Petra B.; Cullis, James D.

While different forms of drought exist, their severity and extent are dependent on critical points of onset. Understanding these onsets is crucial for water, food and energy security, as well as to develop climate change adaptation strategies. This study used the JAMS/J2000 hydrological model to detect agricultural drought using the Soil Moisture Deficit Index (SMDI). The Berg River catchment in Mediterranean South Africa was used as the pilot study area, which experienced a severe drought between 2015 and 2018 and where meteorological drought progressed into agricultural drought that resulted in significant crop reductions and job losses within the agricultural sector. To combat the effects of meteorological shortfalls, water resource management opted to curb agricultural reservoir releases, forcing farmers to rely on groundwater. Modelling results illustrated the importance of detecting headwater stress within the catchment, where in 2015/2017 headwater areas were affected for the first time over the 35-year simulation. Furthermore, regional changes to the groundwater system, during which severe to extremely severe SMDI values (-3 to -4) were simulated, is postulated to be caused by wide-spread groundwater overuse resulting in a 47% reduction in winter (JJA) anda 68% reduction in spring (SON) streamflow. Immediate streamflow reductions were observed, illustrating the low resilience of these systems to meteorological and agricultural droughts, as well as the impacts of water use behavioural changes. By using SMDI in conjunction with a well constrained hydrological model, crucial drought onset triggers can be detected as well as tipping points regarding water use behaviour. As climate change drives an increase in the occurrence of meteorological droughts in many parts of the world, understanding the advance of severe long-term effects is important for the development of effective adaption strategies to promote water, food and energy security.","[Watson, Andrew] Stellenbosch Univ, Water Inst, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [Miller, Jodie] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [Kunne, Annika; Kralisch, Sven] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Geog, Loebdergraben 32, D-07743 Jena, Germany",Stellenbosch University; Stellenbosch University; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Watson, A (corresponding author), Stellenbosch Univ, Water Inst, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",awatson@sun.ac.za,,"Watson, Andrew/0000-0001-5998-6933",Division for Research Development (DRD) of Stellenbosch University; DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service - BMBF (The FederalMinistry of Education and Research)); National Research Foundation of South Africa [118830],Division for Research Development (DRD) of Stellenbosch University; DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service - BMBF (The FederalMinistry of Education and Research)); National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa),"The authors would like to thank the Division for Research Development (DRD) of Stellenbosch University (Stellenbosch University Subcommittee B postdoctoral grant administered through the DRD) and DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service: sponsored by BMBF (The FederalMinistry of Education and Research)) for funding support.

Daily rainfall data from 44 recording stations were used to define total rainfall amounts and 12 extreme event indices for three wet seasons and annual time scale. Mann-Kendall's trend test and Sen's slope estimator were used to determine trends and rates of change, respectively. Results showed the emergence of different trend signals across seasons and over space in the study area. Trend tests for total rainfall amount and extreme indices for annual and March-May season show a global significant downward tendency. However, the number of wet and dry days, maximum consecutive wet and dry spells and wet day rainfall intensity for the annual time scale show mixed significant upward and downward tendencies, while trends for the number of dry days and maximum consecutive dry spells showed a global significant increasing trend for the March-May season across the study area. On the other hand, mixed global significant upward and downward tendencies were found in all rainfall indices for the June-September season over the northern part of the study area. Different from the two wet seasons, the trend test for the September-November wet season in the southern part of the study area shows an increasing tendency, although only few of the upward trends were statistically significant. In contrast, the number of dry days and maximum dry spell length for this season reveal decreasing trends at most of the stations. Empirical evidences generated in rainfall trends using dense gauging stations provide useful information to develop spatially relevant climate change adaptation and climate risk management plans.","[Degefu, Mekonnen Adnew] Debre Markos Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, POB 269, Debre Markos, Ethiopia; [Tadesse, Yonas] Dire Dawa Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, POB 1362, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia; [Bewket, Woldeamlak] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Degefu, MA (corresponding author), Debre Markos Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, POB 269, Debre Markos, Ethiopia.",mekonnenadnew@yahoo.com; tadesse.yonas@gmail.com; woldeamlak.bewket@aau.edu.et,"Degefu, Mekonnen Adnew/GRR-6199-2022","Degefu, Mekonnen Adnew/0000-0001-6316-7543",Dire Dawa University,Dire Dawa University,This study was funded by the Dire Dawa University.

It embraces both complementary and contradictory approaches and perspectives for dealing with newer sustainability challenges in the context of old and persistent social problems. In this article we suggest a combined approach called social fields and natural systems. It builds on field theory and systems thinking and can assist sustainability scientists and others in integrating the best available knowledge from the natural sciences with that from the social sciences. The approach is preferable, we argue, to the various scientific efforts to integrate theories and frameworks that are rooted in incompatible ontologies and epistemologies. In that respect, this article is a critique of approaches that take the integration of the social and natural sciences for granted. At the same time it is an attempt to build a promising alternative. The theoretical and methodological pluralism that we suggest here, holistic pluralism, is one way to overcome incommensurability between the natural and the social sciences while avoiding functionalism, technological and environmental determinism, and over-reliance on rational choice theory. In addition, it is a basis for generating better understandings and problem solving capacity for sustainability challenges. We make three contributions. First, we identify important reasons for the incommensurability between the social and natural sciences, and propose remedies for overcoming some of the difficulties in integrative research. Second, we show how sustainability science will benefit from drawing more deeply on-and thus more adequately incorporate-social science understandings of society and the social, including field theory. Third, we illustrate the suggested approach of social fields and natural systems in two examples that are highly relevant for both sustainability science and sustainability itself, one on climate change adaptation and one on geoengineering.","[Olsson, Lennart; Jerneck, Anne] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies, LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Olsson, L (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies, LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden.",,,,Swedish Research Council Formas through the Linnaeus grants: Lund University Centre of Excellence for integration of Social and Natural Dimensions of Sustainability (LUCID) [259-2008-1718],Swedish Research Council Formas through the Linnaeus grants: Lund University Centre of Excellence for integration of Social and Natural Dimensions of Sustainability (LUCID),"This research was undertaken within the interdisciplinary LUCID project (2008-2018) funded by the Swedish Research Council Formas through the Linnaeus grants: Lund University Centre of Excellence for integration of Social and Natural Dimensions of Sustainability (LUCID) (259-2008-1718).

Building in optionality can help to create flood risk-management strategies that are robust to a range of possible future conditions. Real options analysis has therefore been attracting increasing attention as an approach to climate change-adaptation decision making, and in particular for adapting flood-protection infrastructure to the uncertain impacts of climate change. Here, a methodology is presented for analyzing real options in flood risk management, which considers the joint effects of uncertainties in socioeconomic drivers of floodplain vulnerability as well as the uncertain effects of climate change on future flood frequency. Decision makers at future time steps in the sequential decision problem are taken to be rational optimizers who benefit from improved information about these two uncertain factors, compared with the present day. The sensitivity of two archetypical flood risk-management decisions to uncertainty, both in future river flows and to socioeconomic change, is demonstrated. In the first, a flood protection dike can be built with a widened base, providing the option to heighten it at a later date, or it can be built to a fixed height with no further options apart from costly reconstruction. In the second problem, a portion of undeveloped, flood-prone land separates an existing development from the river. A decision can be made to purchase the land and forgo development. A real options analysis is used to identify the circumstances in which it is cost beneficial to purchase the land, which depends on the value of existing assets exposed to flooding and how that value would change were development to take place.

Like many other mediterranean-climate ecosystems across the globe, the Central Valley has been subject to a burgeoning human population and expansion and intensification of agricultural and urban development that have impacted wildlife habitats. Future effects of urban development, changes in water supply management, and precipitation and air temperature related to global climate change on area of waterbird habitat in the Central Valley are uncertain, yet potentially substantial. Therefore, we modeled area of waterbird habitats for 17 climate, urbanization, water supply management, and wetland restoration scenarios for years 2006-2099 using a water resources and scenario modeling framework. Planned wetland restoration largely compensated for adverse effects of climate, urbanization, and water supply management changes on habitat areas through 2065, but fell short thereafter for all except one scenario. Projected habitat reductions due to climate models were more frequent and greater than under the recent historical climate and their magnitude increased through time. After 2065, area of waterbird habitat in all scenarios that included severe warmer, drier climate was projected to be >15% less than in the existing landscape most years. The greatest reduction in waterbird habitat occurred in scenarios that combined warmer, drier climate and plausible water supply management options affecting priority and delivery of water available for waterbird habitats. This scenario modeling addresses the complexity and uncertainties in the Central Valley landscape, use and management of related water supplies, and climate to inform waterbird habitat conservation and other resource management planning. Results indicate that increased wetland restoration and additional conservation and climate change adaptation strategies may be warranted to maintain habitat adequate to support waterbirds in the Central Valley.","[Matchett, Elliott L.; Fleskes, Joseph P.] US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Dixon, CA 95620 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Matchett, EL (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Dixon, CA 95620 USA.",ematchett@usgs.gov,,,"California Landscape Conservation Cooperative, Central Valley Joint Venture, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service [80250-A-H100]; Delta Waterfowl Foundation [2671]; California Department of Fish and Wildlife; U.S. Geological Survey-Western Ecological Research Center","California Landscape Conservation Cooperative, Central Valley Joint Venture, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; Delta Waterfowl Foundation; California Department of Fish and Wildlife; U.S. Geological Survey-Western Ecological Research Center(United States Geological Survey)","The California Landscape Conservation Cooperative, Central Valley Joint Venture, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (URLs: http://californialcc.org/, http://www.centralvalleyjointrenture.org/, http://fws.gov/; grant number 80250-A-H100; funding acquired by JPF), Delta Waterfowl Foundation (URL: littp://www.deltawaterfowl.org/; grant number 2671; funding acquired by JPF), California Department of Fish and Wildlife (URL: https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/), and U.S. Geological Survey-Western Ecological Research Center (URL: https://www.werc.usgs.gov/) provided funding or in-kind support for this project.

This has led to an increasing development of urban green infrastructure. Among those nature-based solutions, green wall systems have been receiving a growing attention, being a passive technology with their ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to climate change, improve air quality and reduce the heat island effect in urban environments. Despite that growing interest in studying the functions and features of such green systems, and the various types of living walls nowadays available, most studies evaluate their energy efficiency and performance only during the use phase. This study aimed to assess the overall environmental performances of two types of green walls in a life cycle perspective, considering the embodied energy, greenhouse gas emissions, materials and energy consumption, and embodied carbon. After collecting inventory data related to all components and processes of each system, a life cycle assessment with cradle to gate approach has been performed to compare the performances of a felt-based system without organic growth medium and a system based on plastic modules with organic growth medium. The main impacts have been detected in the production stage and materials used in systems structure. By comparing the results achieved in the 16 impact categories analyzed, the felt-based system showed the highest overall impact, with the use of fertilizers and aluminum components playing a crucial part. Polypropylene used to produce the panels, water used for plant irrigation and potting soil composition are the main environmental impact contributors in the plastic based system. The results pointed out the importance of accurate choice of materials for the design and production of green walls.","[Reyhani, Milad; Santolini, Enrica; Torreggiani, Daniele; Tassinari, Patrizia] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr & Food Sci, Agr Engn DISTAL, Viale Fanin 48, I-40127 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Santolini, E (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dept Agr & Food Sci, Agr Engn DISTAL, Viale Fanin 48, I-40127 Bologna, Italy.",enrica.santolini2@unibo.it,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","santolini, enrica/0000-0002-3493-1546; Reyhani, Milad/0000-0002-6583-5696",,,,,52,1,1,7,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

The trend and interannual variation of precipitation-use efficiency (PUE) response to climatic factors provide a theoretical foundation for understanding how Eurasian grasslands adapt to climate change. However, the long-term trends and regulating factors of PUE in Eurasian grasslands at the continental scale are still unclear. Here, we integrated long-term Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling System (GIMMS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), field surveys of aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and meteorological datasets during 1982-2015 to reveal the temporal variations and controls of PUE in Eurasian grasslands. We found that there was an overall uptrend of PUE (3 x 10-3 g C m- 2 mm- 1/10 yr) in Eurasian grasslands. The greatest increasing trends of PUE was found in forest steppe at the rate of 13 x 10-3 g C m- 2 mm- 1/10 yr, while greatest decreasing trend presented in alpine steppe at the rate of -2.6 x 10-3 g C m- 2 mm- 1/10 yr. The PUE showed linearly decreasing patterns with precipitation at the biome and continental scales, while it was uncorrelated with temperature at the continental scale and showed diverse patterns of linear increase, concavedown and no correlation with temperature for different biomes. The temporal variation of PUE was mainly controlled by precipitation in Eurasian grasslands. This result further revealed that climatic factors shaped the temporal pattern of PUE by the cascading effects networks of climatic factors (precipitation and temperature) vapor pressure deficit (VPD) - leaf area index (LAI) - ANPP - PUE (CVLP-CENet). This study identified the longterm trends, interannual variations and controls of PUE in Eurasian grasslands over the past three decades, and provided crucial insights into understanding grassland ecosystems dynamics and response to climate change.","[Zhang, Tianyou; Chen, Zhi; Zhang, Weikang; Yang, Meng; Wang, Qiufeng; Han, Lang; Li, Wenhua; Yu, Guirui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, 11A Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tianyou; Chen, Zhi; Yang, Meng; Wang, Qiufeng; Han, Lang; Yu, Guirui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Jiao, Cuicui] Sichuan Univ Sci & Engn, Coll Econ, Yibin 644000, Peoples R China; [Fu, Zheng] Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Sun, Zhongyi] Hainan Univ, Coll Ecol & Environm, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Sichuan University of Science & Engineering; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Hainan University","Yu, GR (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, 11A Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",yugr@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Fu, Zheng/M-5805-2017; zhang, tian/GZK-6001-2022","Fu, Zheng/0000-0001-7627-8824; ","National Key Research and Develop-ment Program of China [2016YFA0600104]; National Natural Sci-ence Foundation of China [41991234, 31800406]; International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [121311KYSB20170004]",National Key Research and Develop-ment Program of China; National Natural Sci-ence Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences,"This study was supported by National Key Research and Develop-ment Program of China (No. 2016YFA0600104) , National Natural Sci-ence Foundation of China (No. 41991234, 31800406) , and International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. 121311KYSB20170004) .",,51,2,2,21,69,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

This study used a weather preference index (WPI) as an indicator to evaluate the CCI on weather conditions in China under different scenarios from 2025 to 2100. First, we analyzed the change in the WPI in China from 1971 to 2013. Then, we estimated the trends in the WPI in China from 2025 to 2100 under different representative concentration pathways (RCPs) based on global climate models. We found that China's weather conditions improved from 1971 to 2013, as the national average WPI increased from 1.34 to 1.59 with a change rate of 0.03 per decade (0.03/10 a). Under all climate change scenarios, the weather conditions in China will deteriorate. The change rates of the WPI will be -0.19/10 a similar to - 0.01/10 a. The number of people experiencing deteriorated weather conditions will be 0.71 billion similar to 1.22 billion, accounting for 53.28% similar to 91.58% of the total population in China. We also found that the area of the regions with deteriorated weather conditions under all three climate change scenarios will be 2.34 million km(2), accounting for 24.31% of China's total land area. At the same time, as the emissions concentrations increase from RCP2.6 to RCP8.5, the area of the regions with severely deteriorated weather conditions in China will increase from 0 to 3.27 million km(2). Therefore, we suggest that China needs to implement effective measures to address climate change in the future and focus on the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change in regions with deteriorated weather conditions.","[Fang, Zihang; Liu, Zhifeng; He, Chunyang; Tu, Mengzhao; Zhao, Rui; Lu, Wenlu] Beijing Normal Univ, Ctr Human Environm Syst Sustainabil CHESS, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Fang, Zihang; Liu, Zhifeng; He, Chunyang; Tu, Mengzhao; Zhao, Rui; Lu, Wenlu] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Sch Nat Resources, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University,"He, CY (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Ctr Human Environm Syst Sustainabil CHESS, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;He, CY (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Sch Nat Resources, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",hcy@bnu.edu.cn,,"liu, zhifeng/0000-0001-5124-9824; Liu, Zhifeng/0000-0002-4087-0743","National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFA0607203]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41871185, 41971270]; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology, China","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology, China","We want to express our respect and gratitude to the anonymous reviewers and editors for their professional comments and suggestions.

Typically, eutrophication abatement has proven a more recalcitrant challenge than anticipated, with ecosystem improvements only recently beginning to emerge or falling short of goals. Reduction in nutrient loads has come mainly from advanced treatment of wastewaters and has lagged targets set for diffuse agricultural sources. Synthesis of the major campaigns-varying in terms of physical settings, ecosystem characteristics, nutrient sources, socio-economic drivers, and governance-identified barriers inhibiting eutrophication abatement and potential bridges to overcome them. Actionable science can be advanced by: application of the well-established and emerging knowledge and experience around the globe, client-responsive strategic research, and timely and conclusive adjudication of scientific controversies. More accountable governance requires: enduring engagement of high-level officials of the responsible governments; effective communication of the causes, risks and benefits to the public and stakeholders; quantitative and accountable allocation of responsibility for nutrient load reductions; and binding requirements, as opposed to simply voluntary actions. Effective reduction in nutrient loads requires: reduction strategies for both nitrogen and phosphorus; inclusion of actions that reduce atmospheric emissions of nitrogen in addition to direct inputs to waterways; efficacious regulations; public subsidies based on performance; limitations on biofuel production that increases nutrient loads; and enhancing the sinks and losses for legacy nutrients retained in soils and groundwater. Outcomes must be measured and strategies appropriately adjusted through: sustained monitoring of essential indicators and processes, the use of multiple models, truly adaptive management, and cautious interventions within the coastal ecosystem. The changing climate must be taken into account by reassessing achievable future conditions and seeking alternatives for mitigating and adapting to climate change that also reduce nutrient loads.","[Boesch, Donald F.] Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science,"Boesch, DF (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA.",boesch@umces.edu,,"Boesch, Donald/0000-0002-8154-133X",,,,,157,79,82,27,94,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

Then, taking the NPP of the potential vegetation in average climate conditions during 1986-2005 as the basis for evaluation, this study examined whether the potential vegetation adapts to climate change or not. Meanwhile, the degree of inadaptability was evaluated. Finally, the NPP vulnerability of the potential vegetation was evaluated by synthesizing the frequency and degrees of inadaptability to climate change. In the past 55 years, the NPP of desert ecosystems in the south of the Tianshan Mountains and grassland ecosystems in the north of China and in western Tibetan Plateau was prone to the effect of climate change. The NPP of most forest ecosystems was not prone to the influence of climate change. The low NPP vulnerability to climate change of the evergreen broad-leaved and coniferous forests was observed. Furthermore, the NPP of the desert ecosystems in the north of the Tianshan Mountains and grassland ecosystems in the central and eastern Tibetan Plateau also had low vulnerability to climate change. In the next 35 years, the NPP vulnerability to climate change would reduce the forest-steppe in the Songliao Plain, the deciduous broad-leaved forests in the warm temperate zone, and the alpine steppe in the central and western Tibetan Plateau. The NPP vulnerability would significantly increase of the temperate desert in the Junggar Basin and the alpine desert in the Kunlun Mountains. The NPP vulnerability of the subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests would also increase. The area of the regions with increased vulnerability would account for 27.5% of China.","[Yuan, Quanzhi; Ren, Ping] Sichuan Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Land Resources Evaluat & Monitoring South, Chengdu 610068, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Quanzhi; Ren, Ping] Sichuan Normal Univ, Inst Geog & Resources Sci, Chengdu 610101, Peoples R China; [Wu, Shaohong; Dai, Erfu; Zhao, Dongsheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wu, Shaohong; Dai, Erfu; Zhao, Dongsheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xueru] Chongqing Jiaotong Univ, Chongqing 400074, Peoples R China","Sichuan Normal University; Sichuan Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chongqing Jiaotong University","Wu, SH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Wu, SH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",yuanqz@sicnu.edu.cn; wush@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Dai, Erfu/A-1680-2013",,"Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China [41530749]; Science and Technology Project of Sichuan Provincial Department of Education [15ZB0023]; Youth Projects of National Natural Science Foundation of China [41301196, 41501202]; Chongqing Foundation and Advanced Research Project [cstc2014jcyjA0808]",Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Project of Sichuan Provincial Department of Education; Youth Projects of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chongqing Foundation and Advanced Research Project,"Foundation: Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China, No.41530749; Science and Technology Project of Sichuan Provincial Department of Education, No.15ZB0023; Youth Projects of National Natural Science Foundation of China, No.41301196, No.41501202; Chongqing Foundation and Advanced Research Project, No.cstc2014jcyjA0808",,31,21,32,13,105,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1009-637X,1861-9568,,J GEOGR SCI,J.

As explorers, implementers, testers and promoters of such adaptations, farmers and extension services have to be involved in the design process of adapted farming systems. However, the complexity of most design approaches produced by research (e.g. computer-model-based) keeps them outside the core of this process. Here we present a game called forage rummy developed to engage farmers and extension services in being the main players in livestock system design and evaluation. It relies on a number of boundary objects developed upon the conversion of scientific knowledge into more usable forms of support. These are a player-friendly game board based on a conceptual model of a livestock system on which flattened wooden sticks marked with year-round forage production and animal feeding requirements have to be assembled with the support of a computerized support system. Playing the game thus consists of repeated cycles of design of livestock systems adapted to scenarios of the agricultural production context and evaluation of their biophysical and organizational feasibility. An application to designing dairy systems adapted to climate change by 2050 is presented. As the first example of a game-based approach for farming system design, forage rummy proves to be useful in stimulating discussion, reflective and interactive analysis and learning about farming systems, their management and the scope for their adaptation. This is attributed to the researchers' effort to offer transparent and easily-usable forms of support to the design process. We conclude that the learning stimulated by the game could potentially lead to more consistent and concerted action between researchers, extension services and farmers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The geographical characteristics of the BRB feature eight major sub-basins or watersheds consisting of Libmanan-Pulantuna, Ragay Hills, Thiris, Naga-Yabo, Pawili River, Waras-Lalo, Naporog, and Quinali. The study applied the combination of the participatory tools and the Climate Risk Vulnerability Assessment (CRVA) framework to gather information on local climate vulnerabilities and contexts. Briefly, the CRVA employed geospatial modeling and utilized several indicators which are presumed to affect vulnerability including exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity which were aggregated to provide an index of vulnerability. This enabled us to identify areas of exposure and vulnerability and pointed areas of greatest need for strengthened adaptive capacity and risk management. Our findings revealed that vulnerability in the BRB was perceived to be relatively prevalent and that typhoons, flooding, and drought were identified to contribute significant impacts to rural livelihood. Furthermore, our findings in the CRVA suggested significant regional differences in vulnerability in the BRB. The majority of the towns in the central and northwestern portions of the BRB will largely experience increased vulnerability, particularly, in the Thiris sub-basin including some parts of Ragay Hills, Waras-Lalo, and the northwestern Libmanan-Pulantuna sub-basins. On the contrary, the entire Quinali region on the south is revealed to have the lowest vulnerability index. The clear policy implication of these accounts will be on how to mobilize developmental thrusts in both areas of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation at the sub-national level to reinforce local-based climate priority setting in adaptation interventions and policies.","[Laureta, Ricky P.] Partido State Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Camarines Sur 4422, Goa, Philippines; [Regalado, Ric Ryan H.] Univ Philippines, Coll Sci, Quezon City 1101, Philippines; [De la Cruz, Ermar B.] Dept Agr, Monitoring & Evaluat Div, Reg Field Off 5, Pili 4418, Camarines Sur, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman,"Laureta, RP (corresponding author), Partido State Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Camarines Sur 4422, Goa, Philippines.",da5.bicolriverproject@parsu.edu.ph,"Regalado, Ric Ryan/V-6614-2018","Regalado, Ric Ryan/0000-0003-1577-1687; Laureta, Ricky/0000-0002-5727-3849",Republic of the Philippines Department of Agriculture-Regional Field Office 5 (DA-RFO 5),Republic of the Philippines Department of Agriculture-Regional Field Office 5 (DA-RFO 5),"Funding was supported by the Republic of the Philippines Department of Agriculture-Regional Field Office 5 (DA-RFO 5) under Rice Program.

However, in the Saudi context, the availability of GSs across cities and their perceived role in climate change mitigations and adaptation strategies remain unexplored. This study aimed to examine the per capita availability of GSs in the Jeddah megacity in Saudi Arabia, and their role in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. This study assessed the per capita availability of GS in Jeddah city using GIS techniques, and a questionnaire survey (online and an onsite) was conducted to assess the GSs users' perception of the role of GSs on climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. Non-parametric tests were also used to find differences in roles based on socio-demographic attributes. The findings of the study revealed that: (i) the per capita availability of GS in Jeddah is relatively low in comparison to international organization recommendations (such as World Health Organization and European Union). As per the survey result, it was reported that GSs play crucial role for climate change mitigation such as temperature regulation, reduction in heat stress, enhancement outdoor thermal comfort, and the maintenance of air quality. More than 85% of the total respondents agreed with the very high importance of GSs for climate change mitigation. More than 80% of respondents in the city highly agreed with climate change adaptation strategies such as the enhancement of accessibility to GSs, ecosystem-based protection of GSs, and the improvement of per capita availability of GSs. The findings of the study will be very helpful to planners and policymakers in implementing nature-based solutions to reduce vulnerability to climate change in Jeddah city, and particularly other cities in a desert environment.","[Maghrabi, Ahmad; Alyamani, Abdulelah; Addas, Abdullah] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Architecture & Planning, Landscape Architecture Dept, POB 80210, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia",King Abdulaziz University,"Maghrabi, A (corresponding author), King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Architecture & Planning, Landscape Architecture Dept, POB 80210, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.",aamaghrabi@kau.edu.sa; aalyamani0060@stu.kau.edu.sa; aaddas@kau.edu.sa,"Addas, Abdullah/U-7798-2018","Addas, Abdullah/0000-0003-3674-758X",Science and Technology Unit-King Abdulaziz University-Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [UE-41-116],Science and Technology Unit-King Abdulaziz University-Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,This project was funded by Science and Technology Unit-King Abdulaziz UniversityKingdom of Saudi Arabia-award number UE-41-116.,,86,4,4,4,34,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,MAY,2021,12,5,,,,,,,629,10.3390/f12050629,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f12050629,,,16,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Forestry,SH1VT,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000653924000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Evacuation and sheltering are commonly used strategies for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation, but may negatively affect mental health of internally displaced persons (IDPs). Recently, Chinese governments have developed planned settlements providing integrated and intensive health services and environmental interventions to reduce immediate disastrous impacts and support the mental health of IDPs. Methods. Here we selected 69 planned shelters by stratified sampling to describe the implemented interventions conducted in Anhui Province of China after the 2016 severe floods, and we used standardized psychological scales to survey the intervention group (IDP who lived in these planned shelters) and the matched control group (victims living in their homes). Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between social-demographic characteristics, flooding exposure, environmental conditions and the psychological diseases. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to compare their prevalence of psychological diseases, and to identify its influencing factors though comparing multiple interventions. Finally, the structural equation modeling was used to identify their influencing pathways. Results. Compared with the control group, the intervention group had a significantly lower risk of anxiety (OR = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.18-0.71), depression (OR = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.19-0.68) and post-traumatic stress disorder (OR = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.15-0.56). Environmental interventions providing clean water, safe food, environmental hygiene, risk communication and sufficient accommodation had a protective effect (standardized indirect effect = -0.153, p < 0.01) on the risk of psychological problems, mediating the negative effect caused by displacement and sheltering. Conclusions. How planned shelters were used to achieve better mental health outcomes in Anhui could inform other flood-prone areas to mitigate psychological vulnerability of IDPs.","[Zhong, Shuang; Pang, Minghui] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Govt, Ctr Chinese Publ Adm Res, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Shuang; Huang, Cunrui] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Ho, Hung Chak] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Jegasothy, Edward] Univ Sydney, Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Clayton, Susan] Coll Wooster, Dept Psychol, Wooster, OH 44691 USA; [Wang, Zhe] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Publ Hlth Emergency Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Cunrui] China Meteorol Adm, Shanghai Typhoon Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Huang, Cunrui] Shanghai Meteorol Serv, Shanghai Key Lab Meteorol & Hlth, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Huang, Cunrui] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; University of Hong Kong; University of Sydney; College of Wooster; Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention; China Meteorological Administration; Zhengzhou University,"Wang, Z (corresponding author), Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Publ Hlth Emergency Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wangzhe@chinacdc.cn; huangcr@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"Huang, Cunrui/ABI-3312-2020; ho, Hung Chak/W-3320-2017",", Zhong/0000-0002-2834-9875; ho, Hung Chak/0000-0002-6505-3504","National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFA0606200]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71774179, 71503146]; Government Reform and Construction of key base of Ministry of Education [16JJD630011]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Government Reform and Construction of key base of Ministry of Education,"This study was supported by the grants from National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFA0606200), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71774179;71503146) and Government Reform and Construction of key base of Ministry of Education (16JJD630011).",,35,4,4,4,30,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

However, the extent to which the variation in crop growth can be accounted for by the variability in climate variables or by management adaptations remains unclear. Based on daily weather data and management information at six stations, we constructed three sets of simulation experiments using the Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES)-Wheat model. This allowed quantifying the responses of wheat yield and water use efficiency (yield/evapotranspiration, WUE) to climate change and nitrogen (N) fertilization for the period 1981 to 2008 in the North China Plain. Our results indicated that the simulated median values of the wheat yield/WUE decreased (2.62% to 14.26%)/(1.58% to 9.33%) with increasing temperature (T), increased (0.17% to 6.81%)/(0.70% to 4.55%) with elevated CO2 concentration, and changed little with decreasing precipitation in 15 simulation experiments of individual climate variables. Under the combined changes in temperature, N fertilization (T/N), and CO2 concentration, the effects of changes in T/N fertilization on wheat yields and WUE were stronger than the effects of change in CO2 concentration. Interactions between T and CO2 concentration, N fertilization and CO2 concentration appear to play very significant roles in wheat yield. Our study suggests that proper N fertilizer application, changing crop establishment dates, and cultivating new cultivars could be efficient measures for food production prediction and climate change adaptation in the North China Plain. A main result of this work is therefore that proper N application, shifts in crop establishment dates, and the cultivation of new high-temperature tolerant wheat cultivars could contribute safeguarding food security in China, and globally.","[Liu, Yujie; Chen, Qiaomin; Tan, Qinghua] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Chen, Qiaomin; Tan, Qinghua] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Liu, YJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",liuyujie@igsnrr.ac.cn,,"Chen, Qiaomin/0000-0003-0628-8896; Liu, Yujie/0000-0002-0751-6857","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41671037, 41301091]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association, CAS [2016049]; Program for Kezhen Excellent Talents in IGSNRR, CAS [2017RC101]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS [QYZDB-SSW-DQC005]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association, CAS; Program for Kezhen Excellent Talents in IGSNRR, CAS; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41671037, 41301091); the Youth Innovation Promotion Association, CAS (Grant No. 2016049); Program for Kezhen Excellent Talents in IGSNRR, CAS (Grant No.2017RC101); and the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS (QYZDB-SSW-DQC005).

However, the quality, consistency and completeness of different disaster databases are highly variable. Even though such variation critically influences the outcome of any study, comparative analyses of different databases are still rare to date. Furthermore, there is an unequal geographic distribution of current disaster trend studies, with developing countries being underrepresented. Here, we analyze three different disaster databases in the developing-country context of Peru: a global database (Emergency Events Database: EM-DAT), a multinational Latin American database (DesInventar) and a national database (Peruvian National Information System for the Prevention of Disasters: SINPAD). The analysis is performed across three dimensions: (1) spatial scales, from local to regional (provincial) and national scale; (2) timescales, from single events to decadal trends; and (3) disaster categories and metrics, including the number of single disaster event occurrence, or people killed and affected. Results show limited changes in disaster occurrence in the Cusco and Apurimac regions in southern Peru over the past four decades but strong positive trends in people affected at the national scale. We furthermore found large variations of the disaster metrics studied over different spatial and temporal scales, depending on the disaster database analyzed. We conclude and recommend that the type, method and source of documentation should be carefully evaluated for any analysis of disaster databases; reporting criteria should be improved and documentation efforts strengthened.","[Huggel, C.; Raissig, A.; Salzmann, N.] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Raissig, A.] Geotest AG, CH-3052 Zollikofen, Switzerland; [Rohrer, M.] Meteodat, CH-8005 Zurich, Switzerland; [Romero, G.; Diaz, A.] PREDES Ctr Estudios & Prevenc Desastres, Lima, Peru",University of Zurich,"Huggel, C (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",christian.huggel@geo.uzh.ch,"Salzmann, Nadine/AAE-4752-2021","Huggel, Christian/0000-0001-9299-2665; Salzmann, Nadine/0000-0001-5876-7624; Rohrer, Mario/0000-0002-5311-383X",Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC); Swiss Federal Office for the Environment; World Bank; Andean Community of Nations,Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC); Swiss Federal Office for the Environment; World Bank(The World Bank India); Andean Community of Nations,"This study was conducted within the Peruvian-Swiss Programme on Climate Change Adaptation (PACC), funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).

The results, based on choice experiments and assessed through a latent class model, highlight a general interest of the regional farmers toward the biodiversity-based adaptation programme for coping with climate change. In particular, three classes of respondents were identified: (i) farmers operating on the whole regional territory and willing to cultivate up to 50% of their farm area with up to two landraces and compensation in line with the aid set by the regional rural programme; (ii) winegrowers of the intensive rural areas and willing to cultivate up to 25% of their farm with up to two landraces and a compensation greater than 200% compared to the aid of the regional rural programme; (iii) farmers operating in the intermediate rural areas and willing to cultivate up to 50% of their farm with up to three landraces and a compensation greater than 50% compared to the aid of the regional rural programme. Policymakers should calibrate adaption actions depending on rural areas, since economic, social, cultural, behavioural and cognitive barriers, as well as structural characteristics of farms, impact the farmers' attitudes toward measures aimed at coping with climate change.","[Sardaro, Ruggiero; Faccilongo, Nicola; Conto, Francesco; La Sala, Piermichele] Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, I-71121 Foggia, Italy",University of Foggia,"Sardaro, R (corresponding author), Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, I-71121 Foggia, Italy.",ruggiero.sardaro@unifg.it; nicola.faccilongo@unifg.it; francesco.conto@unifg.it; piermichele.lasala@unifg.it,"Sardaro, Ruggiero/K-5893-2017; LA SALA, PIERMICHELE/U-2214-2017","Sardaro, Ruggiero/0000-0001-8250-1914; LA SALA, PIERMICHELE/0000-0003-2081-8013",5 x 1000 IRPEF funds,5 x 1000 IRPEF funds,"Published with a contribution from 5 x 1000 IRPEF funds in favour of the University of Foggia, in memory of Gianluca Montel.",,87,5,5,4,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2021,13,11,,,,,,,5977,10.3390/su13115977,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13115977,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,SR0XQ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000660769500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, GRI's incorporation into existing, racialized infrastructure systems of urban development, regeneration and finance has raised questions about the socio-cultural impacts and justice dimensions of recent directions in climate adaptation planning and urbanism. While critical scholars highlight the exclusion of historically marginalized residents, this paper's analysis of the impacts of GRI-driven planning for sense of belonging reveals a complex and multi-faceted experience of gentrification and displacement in the racialized, settler colonial city. Drawing on insights from civic actors about their lived experience of green and climate resilient projects in Boston, Massachusetts, we develop a novel understanding of belonging, which entails degrees of (mis)belonging. Our analysis uncovers three pathways by which climate urbanism shapes belonging into various alienated, subordinated, assimilated and emancipated forms, and reveals the kinds of political subjects and socio-cultural relations that emerge from the lived experience of climate adaptation projects. More broadly, this study sheds light on how less visible placemaking practices and alternative modes of addressing socio-climate vulnerability contribute to climate justice and injustice dynamics.","[Shokry, Galia] Kean Univ, Union, NJ USA; [Shokry, Galia; Anguelovski, Isabelle] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain; [Connolly, James J.

Through narratives of key informants connected to the community's climate change agenda, this research explores primary climate stressors and the nature of adaptation policy integration. Findings suggests that while Homer is experiencing a variety of climate change impacts, adaptation remains a low priority for city officials.

The risk is determined by the hazard probability and the vulnerability of infrastructure elements. The hazard does not have integral indicators, but is determined by separate spatial and temporal characteristics. The spatial characteristics include the ground's physical and cryolithological features that are linked with the history of the permafrost. The temporal characteristics are associated with the future evolution of the climate and anthropogenic pressures. The geocryological monitoring content and geocryological forecasting are interdependent and should be implemented together. The adaptation recommendations are based on the analytical algorithms and use the results of permafrost monitoring and permafrost state forecasting.

Research on the impact of climate change on the sustainability of farmers' livelihoods could provide a scientific basis for enhancing farmers' adaptability to climate change, reducing farmers' livelihood vulnerability, and promoting the formulation of governmental adaptation strategies. Although studies have assessed the impact of climate change on the sustainability of farmers' livelihoods, their analysis units have been aggregated. Therefore, this study was grouped based on geographical location (north and south regions), and then an additional grouping was conducted according to the internal economic factors of each region. Using data from China's labor-force dynamic survey as our sample, this study measured the sustainable livelihood in agricultural households. This research provided a method to quantify the sustainability of farmers' livelihoods based on measurements of poverty vulnerability. Additionally, using the annual average temperature as the core explanatory variable to describe climate change, this study evaluated the impact and heterogeneity of climate change on the sustainability of farmers' livelihoods and replaced the annual average temperature with the normalized vegetation index to conduct a robustness test. The empirical study showed that the average annual temperature significantly decreased the sustainability of farmers' livelihoods. The average annual temperature change had a greater impact on farmers in the southern provinces as compared to those in the north. Southern coastal regions, eastern coastal regions, the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and the northeast regions were the key areas of concern. Finally, considering the current risk vulnerability of farmers, we concluded that crop breeding should be oriented to the trend of climate change, farmers' risk prevention awareness should be increased, financial tools should be enhanced to mitigate the impact of meteorological disasters, an appropriate sustainability developmental evaluation index should be implemented, and the construction of agrometeorological disaster prevention and mitigation infrastructure should be advanced.","[Peng, Yating; Liu, Bo; Zhou, Mengliang] Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Econ, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China",Hunan Agricultural University,"Liu, B (corresponding author), Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Econ, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China.",yating_peng@stu.hunau.edu.cn; liubo@hunau.edu.cn; zml@hunau.edu.cn,,,"Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation Youth Project [2020JJ5263, 2020JJ5092]; 2021 Hunan Graduate Scientific Research Innovation Project [QL20210164]; Scientific Research Fund of Hunan Provincial Education Department [19A234]",Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation Youth Project; 2021 Hunan Graduate Scientific Research Innovation Project; Scientific Research Fund of Hunan Provincial Education Department(Hunan Provincial Education Department),"This research was funded by [Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation Youth Project] grant number [2020JJ5263], [2020JJ5092], [2021 Hunan Graduate Scientific Research Innovation Project] grant number [QL20210164], and funded by [A Project Supported bDy Scientific Research Fund of Hunan Provincial Education Department] grant number [19A234].",,60,2,2,10,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2022,14,12,,,,,,,7262,10.3390/su14127262,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14127262,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,2L1MG,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000816785700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The reverse of these services is a potential hazard in the form of flash flooding, for which human society has various management strategies. These strategies prove to be increasingly necessary in the context of increased anthropic pressure on the floodable areas. One of these strategies, Strategic Flood Management (SFM), a continuous cycle of planning, acting, monitoring, reviewing and adapting, seems to have better chances to succeed than other previous strategies, in the context of the Digital-Era Governance (DEG). These derive, among others, from the technological and methodological advantages of DEG. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) stand out among the most revolutionary tools for data acquisition and processing of data in the last decade, both in qualitative and quantitative terms. In this context, this study presents a hybrid risk assessment methodology for buildings in case of floods. The methodology is based on detailed information on the terrestrial surface-digital surface model (DSM) and measurements of the last historical flash flood level (occurred on 20 June 2012)-that enabled post-flood peak discharge estimation. Based on this methodology, two other parameters were calculated together with water height (depth): shear stress and velocity. These calculations enabled the modelling of the hazard and risk map, taking into account the objective value of buildings. The two components were integrated in a portal available for the authorities and inhabitants. Both the methodology and the portal are perfectible, but the value of this material consists of the detailing and replicability potential of the data that can be made available to administration and local community. Conceptually, the following are relevant (a) the framing of the SFM concept in the DEG framework and (b) the possibility to highlight the involvement and contribution of the citizens in mapping the risks and their adaptation to climate changes. The subsequent version of the portal is thus improved by further contributions and the participatory approach of the citizens.","[Bilasco, Stefan; Hognogi, Gheorghe-Gavrila; Rosca, Sanda; Iuliu, Vescan; Fodorean, Ioan] Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Geog, Cluj Napoca 400006, Romania; [Bilasco, Stefan] Romanian Acad, Cluj Napoca Subsidiary Geog Sect, Cluj Napoca 400015, Romania; [Hognogi, Gheorghe-Gavrila; Pop, Ana-Maria] Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Geog, Ctr Reg Geog, Cluj Napoca 400006, Romania; [Marian-Potra, Alexandra-Camelia] West Univ Timisoara, Fac Biol Chem & Geog, Dept Geog, Timisoara 300223, Romania; [Sestras, Paul] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Fac Civil Engn, Cluj Napoca 400020, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Romanian Academy of Sciences; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; West University of Timisoara; Technical University of Cluj Napoca,"Bilasco, S (corresponding author), Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Geog, Cluj Napoca 400006, Romania.;Bilasco, S (corresponding author), Romanian Acad, Cluj Napoca Subsidiary Geog Sect, Cluj Napoca 400015, Romania.",stefan.bilasco@ubbcluj.ro; gheorghe.hognogi@ubbcluj.ro; sanda.rosca@ubbcluj.ro; ana-maria.pop@ubbcluj.ro; iuliu.vescan@ubbcluj.ro; ioaniodorean@ubbcluj.ro; alexandra.potra@e-uvt.ro; psestras@mail.utcluj.ro,"Rosca, Sanda/ABC-1897-2020; Pop, Ana-Maria/U-8931-2017; Sestras, Paul/E-1357-2019; Marian-Potra, Alexandra-Camelia/AAB-4595-2021; Stefan, Bilasco/C-8891-2014; Hognogi, Gheorghe-Gavrila/U-8928-2017; Fodorean, Ioan/C-3620-2015","Rosca, Sanda/0000-0003-0394-152X; Sestras, Paul/0000-0002-8554-0924; Marian-Potra, Alexandra-Camelia/0000-0002-9191-681X; Stefan, Bilasco/0000-0002-7633-6390; Hognogi, Gheorghe-Gavrila/0000-0001-6206-5895; Fodorean, Ioan/0000-0002-1849-9327; Pop, Ana-Maria/0000-0001-9958-1391",European Social Fund through the Operational Program for Human Capital [POCU/380/6/13/123866]; Bolyai University,European Social Fund through the Operational Program for Human Capital; Bolyai University,"This paper has received financial support through the project Entrepreneurship for innovation through doctoral and postdoctoral research: POCU/380/6/13/123866, a project co-financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Program for Human Capital 2014-2020, and the present work has received financial support through the 2021-2022 Development Fund of the Babes, -Bolyai University.",,123,4,4,12,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,MAY,2022,14,10,,,,,,,2481,10.3390/rs14102481,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14102481,,,25,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,1Q1KF,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000802454900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

At times, the unilateral decision taken by one country can increase the risk of negative effect on the riparian countries and if the impact is felt strongly by the other country, it can lead to international tension between them. This study examines the impact of climate change on hydrology between a shared river which is Wangchu river in Bhutan and Raidak river in India. The river is mainly used to produce hydropower in the two largest hydropower plants on which the majority of Bhutan's economic development depends and is mainly used for agriculture in India. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used for future flow simulation. Future climate was projected for near future (NF) from 2025-2050 and far future (FF) from 2074-2099 using an ensemble of three regional climate models (ACCESS, CNRM-CM5 and MPI-ESM-LR) for two RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways), RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenario. The ensemble results indicated that, in future, the study area would become warmer with temperature increase of 1.5 degrees C under RCP 4.5 and 3.6 degrees C under RCP 8.5. However, as per RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, rainfall over the study area is projected to decrease by 1.90% and 1.38% respectively. As a consequence of the projected decrease in rainfall, the flow in river is projected to decrease by 5.77% under RCP 4.5 and 4.73% under RCP 8.5. Overall, the results indicated that the degree of hydrological change is expected to be higher, particularly for low flows in both Wangchu and Raidak River. Since transboundary water is a shared for economic growth, climate change adaptation and opportunities should also be considered by both the nations for better water management.","[Zam, Phub] Druk Green Power Corp, Thimphu, Bhutan; [Zam, Phub; Shrestha, Sangam; Budhathoki, Aakanchya] Asian Inst Technol, Water Engn & Management, Sch Engn & Technol, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand",Asian Institute of Technology,"Shrestha, S (corresponding author), Asian Inst Technol, Water Engn & Management, Sch Engn & Technol, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand.",sangam@ait.ac.th,,"Shrestha, Sangam/0000-0002-4972-3969",Asian Institute of Technology (AIT); Thai Pipe Industry Co.

However, education's co-influencing effect along with family and society was unclear. This study investigated a three-year disaster education program conducted in schools in Sichuan Province, China. Method: In three pilot counties, we used stratified duster sampling in 2016 and 2018 to separately survey the risk perceptions of 2,105 children (baseline) and 1710 children (post-intervention), respectively, aged 8-12, in 45 primary schools. The Ordinary Least Squares Regression and Propensity Score Matching Method (PSM) were used to assess the effectiveness of classroom education, propaganda poster, professional guidance, social education (television, radio, friends, and internet), and risk-related parent-child interactions. Interaction items and Structure Equation Model (SEM) were performed to identify their co-influencing mechanisms. Finally, the intervention effect was assessed by categorizing different levels of parent-child interactions and left-behind status. Result: The classroom education (Coeff = 0.040; P < 0.05), propaganda poster (Coeff = 0.024; P < 0.05), and professional guidance (Coeff = 0.016; P < 0.1) had significantly positive effects on children's flood risk perception. But these effects were found to be underestimated using PSM. Interaction effects between disaster education and parent-child interaction were statistically significant, and parent-child interaction was a moderating factor for improving risk perception (standardized indirect effect = 0.055, p < 0.001). Additionally, the mean score of risk perception increased by 118% in 2018 compared with the baseline. It was found that the higher the level of risk-related parent-child interaction, the higher the mean scores of risk perception (Coeff = 0.055; P < 0.001) irrespective whether they are left-behind children. Conclusion: To improve disaster resilience and climate change adaptation, risk-related parent-child interaction should be considered in disaster education, which is an effective way to promote children's risk perceptions.

Simulations considered include those performed with six RCMs driven by the National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis II product for the 1981-2000 period and those driven by four Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) for the current 1971-2000 and future 2041-2070 periods (i.e. a total of 11 current-to-future period simulation pairs). A regional frequency analysis approach was used to develop 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, and 50-year return values of precipitation extremes from NCEP and AOGCM-driven current and future period simulations that respectively were used to study the performance of RCMs and projected changes for selected return values at regional, grid-cell and local scales. Performance errors due to internal dynamics and physics of RCMs studied for the 1981-2000 period reveal considerable variation in the performance of the RCMs. However, the performance errors were found to be much smaller for RCM ensemble averages than for individual RCMs. Projected changes in future climate to selected regional return values of short-duration (e.g. 15- and 30-min) precipitation extremes and for longer return periods (e.g. 50-year) were found to be mostly larger than those to the longer duration (e.g. 24- and 48-h) extremes and short return periods (e.g. 2-year). Overall, projected changes in precipitation extremes were larger for southeastern regions followed by southern and northern regions and smaller for southwestern and western regions of the study area. The changes to return values were also found to be statistically significant for the majority of the RCM-AOGCM simulation pairs. These projections might be useful as a key input for the future planning of urban drainage infrastructure and development of strategic climate change adaptation measures.","[Masud, M. B.; Khaliq, M.

However, few reliable continental-scale modeling tools are available to account for both water and carbon dynamics. The objective of this study was to test a monthly water and carbon balance model, the Water Supply Stress Index (WaSSI) model, for potential application in addressing the influences of drought on NFs ecosystem services across the conterminous United States (CONUS). The performance of the WaSSI model was comprehensively assessed with measured streamflow (Q) at 72 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gauging stations, and satellite-based estimates of watershed evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary productivity (GPP) for 170 National Forest and Grassland (NFs). Across the 72 USGS watersheds, the WaSSI model generally captured the spatial variability of multi-year mean annual and monthly Q and annual ET as evaluated by Correlation Coefficient (R = 0.71-1.0), Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NS = 0.31-1.00), and normalized Root Mean Squared Error (0.06-0.48). The modeled ET and GPP by WaSSI agreed well with the remote sensing-based estimates for multi-year annual and monthly means for all the NFs. However, there were systemic discrepancies in GPP between our simulations and the satellite-based estimates on a yearly and monthly scale, suggesting uncertainties in GPP estimates in all methods (i.e., remote sensing and modeling). Overall, our assessments suggested that the WaSSI model had the capability to reconstruct the long-term forest watershed water and carbon balances at a broad scale. This model evaluation study provides a foundation for model applications in understanding the impacts of climate change and variability (e.g., droughts) on NFs ecosystem service functions.

We explored location-specific CSA practices and strategies for adoption in two communities (Zango and Kofa) in the North-Western Nigerian drylands. Design/methodology/approach: Mixed methods design was employed with thirty smallholders per community selected from a baseline study of 220 smallholders from the two study communities. Smallholders were engaged in a farmer participatory learning and action (PLA) on CSA adoption for resilience. Impacts of PLA were evaluated six months post-implementation and barriers for adoption explored. Findings: Pre- and post-PLA training indicated a change in confidence to adopt some CSA practices. Both communities showed greater confidence (p < .05) related to solving climate-related problems and the use of fertiliser. Communities differed in relation to other factors: Kofa exhibited improved confidence (71.4%) in solving water challenges while Zango showed greater confidence (76%) in relation to solving environmental problems. We found gender-responsive CSA promote women participation in farming. Practical implications: A deep understanding of the underlying reasoning behind non-adoption of CSA practices could support future climate resilience policies, and the lead-farmer extension model could reduce extension agent-farmer ratio. Theoretical implications: Identification of climate-smart agriculture practices and their adoption confirms the benefit of participatory learning for transformation, in this case, empowerment of smallholders, including women, to adapt to climate change in a wider sub-Saharan Africa context. Originality/value: This study explores PLA application in supporting the uptake of CSA practices for resilience and advancement of lead-farmer extension for reducing extension agent-farmer ratio.

J,"Morris, GP",,,,"Morris, George P.",,,Ecological public health and climate change policy,PERSPECTIVES IN PUBLIC HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,ecological; public health; climate; systems,,"The fact that health and disease are products of a complex interaction of factors has long been recognized in public health circles. More recently, the term 'ecological public health' has been used to characterize an era underpinned by the paradigm that, when it comes to health and well-being, 'everything matters'. The challenge for policy makers is one of navigating this complexity to deliver better health and greater equality in health. Recent work in Scotland has been concerned to develop a strategic approach to environment and health. This seeks to embrace complexity within that agenda and recognize a more subtle relationship between health and place but remain practical and relevant to a more traditional hazard-focused environmental health approach. The Good Places, Better Health initiative is underpinned by a new problem-framing approach using a conceptual model developed for that purpose. This requires consideration of a wider social, behavioural etc, context. The approach is also used to configure the core systems of the strategy which gather relevant intelligence, subject it to a process of evaluation and direct its outputs to a broad policy constituency extending beyond health and environment. This paper highlights that an approach, conceived and developed to deliver better health and greater equality in health through action on physical environment, also speaks to a wider public health agenda. Specifically it offers a way to help bridge a gap between paradigm and policy in public health. The author considers that with development, a systems-based approach with close attention to problem-framing/situational modelling may prove useful in orchestrating what is a necessarily complex policy response to mitigate and adapt to climate change.","NHS Hlth Scotland, Glasgow G2 2AF, Lanark, Scotland",,"Morris, GP (corresponding author), NHS Hlth Scotland, Elphinstone House,65 W Regent St, Glasgow G2 2AF, Lanark, Scotland.",george.morris@health.scot.nhs.uk,,,,,,,17,18,19,1,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1757-9139,1757-9147,,PERSPECT PUBLIC HEAL,Perspect.

At a recent workshop entitled 'Using climate data in ecological research' held at the UK Met Office, ecologists and climate scientists came together to discuss the robust analysis of climate data in ecology. The discussions identified three common pitfalls encountered by ecologists: 1) selection of inappropriate spatial resolutions for analysis; 2) improper use of publically available data or code; and 3) insufficient representation of the uncertainties behind the adopted approach. Here, we discuss how these pitfalls can be avoided, before suggesting ways that both ecology and climate science can move forward. Our main recommendation is that ecologists and climate scientists collaborate more closely, on grant proposals and scientific publications, and informally through online media and workshops. More sharing of data and code (e.g. via online repositories), lessons and guidance would help to reconcile differing approaches to the robust handling of data. We call on ecologists to think critically about which aspects of the climate are relevant to their study system, and to acknowledge and actively explore uncertainty in all types of climate data. And we call on climate scientists to make simple estimates of uncertainty available to the wider research community. Through steps such as these, we will improve our ability to robustly attribute observed ecological changes to climate or other factors, while providing the sort of influential, comprehensive analyses that efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change so urgently require. Climate is a key driver of ecological patterns and processes, and as such has been the subject of huge research effort over a number of decades. Yet although the literature on the subject is vast, ecologists still succumb to a number of common pitfalls when analysing climate data. In this paper we share some of the lessons and techniques for avoiding these pitfalls, before suggesting some better ways forward, namely: more collaboration, more communication, and more sharing of data and code. By working more closely together, ecologists and climatologists will generate outputs that are far more useful and tractable for society.","[Suggitt, Andrew J.; Platts, Philip J.; Hill, Jane K.] Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Suggitt, Andrew J.; Maclean, Ilya M.
