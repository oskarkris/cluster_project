The broad aims of climate change adaptation policies are to reduce vulnerability and increase the adaptive capacity and resilience of ecosystems to climate change impacts. There are a range of adaptation policy options relevant to aquatic systems, and many of these measures can be 'mainstreamed' or incorporated into existing conservation and resource management frameworks. This article evaluates adaptation policy options and the constraints on policy implementation for freshwater and estuarine ecosystems in the coastal floodplains of tropical Queensland. Many of these aquatic systems are in a degraded condition and are vulnerable to the compounded impacts of climate change and other stressors. The analysis suggests that statutory planning schemes, water resource planning and protected area frameworks provide limited scope to address the more severe threats to these systems from rising sea levels, extreme cyclones, floods and droughts. In many locations, the effectiveness of adaptation policies is constrained by existing land uses and competing demands from communities and industry sectors. To prevent further widespread loss of habitat may require the development and implementation of new policies that prioritise adaptation management for freshwater and estuarine ecosystems.","Griffith Univ, Ctr Governance & Publ Policy, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Boer, H (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Ctr Governance & Publ Policy, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",henry.boer@student.griffith.edu.au,"McLean, Laurence JA/C-7367-2014","Boer, Henry/0000-0002-3007-1358",,,,,47,10,10,0,39,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1448-6563,2159-5356,,AUSTRALAS J ENV MAN,Australas.

We implement these measures using coupled, site-specific ecosystem and economic simulation models. This modeling approach has two key features needed to study the response of agricultural production systems to climate change: it represents adaptation as an endogenous, non-marginal economic response to climate change; and it provides the capability to represent the spatial variability in bio-physical and economic conditions that interact with adaptive responses. We apply this approach to the dryland grain production systems of the Northern Plains region of the United States. The results support the hypothesis that the most adverse impacts on net returns distributions tend to occur in the areas with the poorest resource endowments and when mitigating effects of CO2 fertilization and adaptation are absent. We find that relative and absolute measures of vulnerability depend on complex interactions between climate change, CO2 level, adaptation, and economic conditions such as relative output prices. The relationship between relative vulnerability and resource endowments varies with assumptions about climate change, adaptation, and economic conditions. Vulnerability measured with respect to an absolute threshold is inversely related to resource endowments in all cases investigated.","Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources Sci, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; Colorado State University,"Antle, JM (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, POB 172920, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",jantle@montana.edu,"Paustian, Keith H/L-7593-2016","capalbo, susan/0000-0002-6552-2673",,,,,34,59,62,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Using GIS and content analysis, we examine the relationship between the site of contemporary buyout programs and neighborhoods surveyed in the 1930s by the Home Owners' Loan Corpora-tion (HOLC). To evaluate whether buyout programs are more likely to occur in redlined neighborhoods, we identify the spatial patterns and associations between these two policies. We find that the majority of FEMA-funded buyouts occurring in HOLC-surveyed cities were located outside of graded zones; yet for the buyouts occurring in the graded historic urban core, the majority were located in redlined districts. We then consider how the language used to de-scribe each neighborhood by the HOLC characterizes amenity and hazard and how these descriptions influenced later policy interventions. Using buyouts and HOLC as an example, we engage the color-evasive policy literature to argue for climate adoption policies that recognize the racialized history that has produced unequal vulnerabilities to hazards rather than relying on buyouts as a technical solution to climate change. Moving past recognition towards an agenda of action, we contend that co-production of knowledge is essential to inform environmental-decision mak-ing and that the sustainability research community and its allied fields must center environmental justice frameworks for equitable climate adaptation.","[Zavar, Elyse] Univ North Texas, Dept Emergency Management & Disaster Sci, 410 Ave C, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Fischer, Lauren Ames] Univ North Texas, Dept Publ Adm, Urban Planning & Policy, 410 Ave C, Denton, TX 76203 USA",University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton,"Zavar, E (corresponding author), Univ North Texas, Dept Emergency Management & Disaster Sci, 410 Ave C, Denton, TX 76203 USA.",Elyse.Zavar@unt.edu; Lauren.Fischer@unt.edu,,"Fischer, Lauren Ames/0000-0003-1506-4915",,,,,117,3,3,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2666-0490,,,CURR RES ENVIRON SUS,Curr.

Systemic frameworks and process-driven approaches in contemporary Landscape Architecture discipline can become a powerful tool for harnessing unprecedented solidarity for climate actions across fields. However, landscape expertise is still largely ignored or marginalized in real-life climate discourse dominated by policymakers, scientists, and engineers. This study addresses this gap in understanding landscape expertise through design research projects over the past two decades. The article theorizes a body of landscape architecture projects in the past two decades, and proposes three terms-spatialize, synthesize, and speculate-for describing the landscape expertise in multidisciplinary, comprehensive climate adaptation projects. Spatialize refers to landscape architects' capacity to construct knowledge through strategically displaying data through critical cartography. Synthesize is the ability to envision multispecies entanglement by combining cultural, ecological, historical, biological, and political lenses through material practices. Speculate means to understand landscape design as a long-term practice with repeated operations, and, thus, to design is to deploy a speculative framework that generates knowledge through practice.","[Zhang Zihao] CUNY City Coll, Bernard & Ann Spitzer Sch Architecture, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Zhang Shurui] WXY Architecture & Urban Design, New York, NY 10007 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY),"Zhang, ZH (corresponding author), 141 Convent Ave, New York, NY 10031 USA.",zzhang@ccny.cuny.edu,,,,,,,28,0,0,4,4,HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS,BEIJING,"CHAOYANG DIST, 4, HUIXINDONGJIE, FUSHENG BLDG, BEIJING 100029, PEOPLES R CHINA",2096-336X,2095-5413,,LANDSC ARCHIT FRONT,Landsc.

To discuss the model of urban ecological life, this paper focused on Satoyama landscapes and reviewed academic articles on the existing cases of Satoyama conservation by urban residents in the Greater Tokyo Area. We analyzed activities performed by participants, benefits to participants, and targeted and achieved ecosystems. Several findings were obtained from the review of published literature. First, the participants were mainly elderly men aged 60 years or older, who were not necessarily local people and who were motivated mostly by the need to conserve nature and improve their health. People with intellectual disabilities also enjoyed the benefits of Satoyama woodland management. Second, participants tended to recognize benefits in terms of health promotion, social cohesion, recreation, and resource utilization, rather than landscape and biodiversity conservation. Third, there were different directions of Satoyama conservation from the perspectives of nature and humans. The broader ecosystem beyond each site was not necessarily considered in Satoyama conservation. These findings show the potential of, and the necessity for, attracting other urban residents by including various activities that consist of not only vegetation conservation but also communal events based on different preferences. There is also a need for balancing environmental and socio-economic perspectives, and the targeted ecosystem should be further explored in collaboration with experts in ecology and landscape planning to make urban ecological life feasible.","[Shimpo, Naomi] Univ Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan; [Shimpo, Naomi] Univ Hyogo, 954-2 Nojimatokiwa, Awaji, Hyogo 6561726, Japan",University of Tsukuba,"Shimpo, N (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan.;Shimpo, N (corresponding author), Univ Hyogo, 954-2 Nojimatokiwa, Awaji, Hyogo 6561726, Japan.",naomi_shimpo@awaji.ac.jp,,"Shimpo, Naomi/0000-0001-5271-6797",,,,,65,2,2,6,12,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1860-1871,1860-188X,,LANDSC ECOL ENG,Landsc.

Being a cool-season crop, lettuce is particularly vulnerable to heat stress. To adapt to climate change, this study was conducted to evaluate the performance of leaf lettuce genotypes for heat tolerance by growing them in different locations within California that differ in temperatures during the growing season. Fifteen green leaf and 21 red leaf lettuce genotypes were selected to evaluate their performance under these environments. These genotypes were planted in March and May in Five Points (San Joaquin Valley) and El Centro (Imperial Valley) and in June 2012 in Salinas (Salinas Valley). The results suggest that lettuce planting can be extended from January to March beyond the normal growing seasons in San Joaquin and Imperial Valleys, where yield may be higher than in the Salinas Valley. The further delay in planting date from March to May in Five Points and El Centro resulted in reduction of yield and an increase in susceptibility to bolting and heat-related disorders such as tipburn and leaf desiccation in most genotypes. The susceptibility to these disorders depends on the genotype and the temperature during lettuce growth and maturation. However, heat-tolerant leaf lettuce genotypes adapted to these regions were identified. Results of this research should be useful for the development of heat-tolerant lettuce cultivars and for extending the growing season in warmer but lower land cost areas to reduce production costs.","[Lafta, Abbas; Mou, Beiquan] ARS, USDA, 1636 East Alisal St, Salinas, CA 93905 USA; [Turini, Thomas] Univ Calif Cooperat Extens, 1720 South Maple Ave, Fresno, CA 93702 USA; [Sandoya, German V.] Univ Florida, EREC IFAS, 3200 E Palm Beach Rd, Belle Glade, FL 33430 USA; [Turini, Thomas] Univ Calif Cooperat Extens, 550 East Shaw Ave, Fresno, CA 93710 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of California System; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of California System,"Mou, B (corresponding author), ARS, USDA, 1636 East Alisal St, Salinas, CA 93905 USA.",beiquan.mou@ars.usda.gov,"Sandoya, German/AAU-1559-2020; Sandoya, German/ABB-8863-2020","Sandoya, German/0000-0002-4532-1364",California Department of Food and Agriculture Specialty Crop Block Grant Program [SCB10042],California Department of Food and Agriculture Specialty Crop Block Grant Program,"The technical assistance of Jeffrey Gunderson, Rafael Solorio, Dave Milligan, and Javier Mora is greatly appreciated.

The current projected climatic change is likely to have a great impact among food-insecure and poor populations due to the projected effects on food availability, water resources, and health, as well as accessibility to infrastructural services, which is minimal, if not lacking completely, among vulnerable and poor households. This article discusses livelihoods and ways of reducing vulnerability to climate change-related disasters to increase adaptation to future impacts of climate change in Nyando and similar medium potential areas of Kenya, where major impacts are expected. The study used both primary and secondary data; used various sampling techniques; and employed analytical techniques such as multiple correlation and regression analysis, stepwise multiple regression analysis, principal components analysis, factor analysis, and cluster analysis. The findings of this research revealed that in terms of food security, poverty was the main contributor to food insecurity, although climate complicated the issue, with the health of the farmer and her experience emerging as the most important in the fight against food insecurity among smallholder farmers. As part of the conclusion, it was recommended that to deal with food insecurity and poverty, policies must emphasize increased food production using suitable environmental conservation techniques to adapt to climate change while also encouraging sustainable livelihood systems.","Univ Nairobi, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Nairobi 00100, Kenya",University of Nairobi,"Oluoko-Odingo, AA (corresponding author), Univ Nairobi, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, POB 30197, Nairobi 00100, Kenya.",aaodingo@yahoo.com,,,,,,,65,36,36,1,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-5608,1467-8306,,ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR,Ann.

Wildlife agency decision makers collectively shape how wildlife conservation unfolds in North America, but their perspectives are generally absent in the literature. Challenges including climate change, conservation funding models, and wildlife disease make understanding how wildlife decision makers view the future of wildlife conservation essential. We interviewed 48 directors and supervisory board members of wildlife agencies in the southeast United States from July 2019 to January 2020 to gauge their assessment of future conservation challenges and preferred response strategies. Declining agency relevancy and insufficient funding were the 2 most commonly identified challenges, while climate change was rarely mentioned as an issue because decision makers believed it was a relatively slow-moving background condition. Decision makers described improving relevance through education and outreach as their primary response to conservation challenges. Our results suggest that climate change-informed wildlife management may benefit from a 2-pronged approach. First, we suggest decision makers should be informed about the challenges posed by climate change, and second, existing efforts to promote diversity among constituents should include engaging groups who support tackling the threat climate change poses to wildlife conservation. Increasing the priority given to climate change adaptation efforts in wildlife agencies will likely require future research to discern which approaches can most improve the perceived salience of climate change to decision makers.","[Jewell, Kathryn; Peterson, M.

As a low-lying country located on a large river delta, it is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Its vulnerable position is one of the reasons why the country (and several of its cities) is a leading player in climate change-related initiatives. Although some of the policy responses to climate change are based on water management tasks that predate all climate change debates, a range of new responses involving both adaptation and mitigation have been developed at the national and local levels in the Netherlands. Recent shifts in policy have been accompanied by the emergence of a new underlying concept - the concept of resilience. This paper has two main areas of investigation. First, it examines the shifts in emphasis on climate change adaptation and mitigation in urban planning, water management and climate change strategies. Second, it studies the origins and nature of the concept of urban resilience and the way in which the notion has permeated national and local policy in the Netherlands. The city of Rotterdam is used to illustrate the situation at the local level. The paper reveals shifting emphases on adaptation and mitigation over time and across different policy documents as well as a range of interpretations of the concept of resilience.","Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Stead, D (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Delft, Netherlands.",d.stead@tudelft.nl,"Stead, Dominic/O-8029-2014","Stead, Dominic/0000-0002-8198-785X",URBAN-NET funding scheme under the EU's Sixth Framework European Research Area Network (ERA-NET) initiative,URBAN-NET funding scheme under the EU's Sixth Framework European Research Area Network (ERA-NET) initiative,"Much of this paper is based on analysis carried out for a collaborative research project entitled 'Sustainable Land Use Policies for Resilient Cities (SUPER-CITIES)' supported by the URBAN-NET funding scheme under the EU's Sixth Framework European Research Area Network (ERA-NET) initiative.

A database of 4161 maize accessions was used to characterize altitudinal and climatic conditions where the 42 maize races grow, yielding ecological descriptors for each race. Using the geographical coordinates of the collection sites of each accession, their climatic conditions were characterized using the geographic information system IDRISI and a national environmental information system. Analyses of variance and cluster analyses of the racial ecological descriptors were performed to determine possible environmental groupings of the races. We found a very high level of variation among and within Mexican maize races for climate adaptation and ecological descriptors. The general overall climatic ranges for maize were 0 to 2900 m of altitude, 11.3 to 26.6 degrees C annual mean temperature, 12.0 to 29.1 degrees C growing season mean temperature, 426 to 4245 mm annual rainfall, 400 to 3555 mm growing season rainfall, and 12.46 to 12.98 h mean growing season day-length. These climatic ranges of maize surpass those from its closest relative, teosinte (Z. mays ssp. parviglumis litis and Doebley), indicating that maize has evolved adaptability beyond the environmental range in which ancestral maize was first domesticated.","[Ruiz Corral, Jose Ariel] Univ Guadalajara, Inst Nacl Invest Forestales Agrcolas & Pecuarias, Guadalajara 44660, Jalisco, Mexico; [Puga, Noe Duran; Sanchez Gonzalez, Jose de Jesus; Parra, Jose Ron; Gonzalez Eguiarte, Diego Raymundo] Univ Guadalajara, Ctr Univ Ciencias Biol & Agropecuarias, Zapopan 45110, Jalisco, Mexico; [Holland, J.

However, it is unclear if and how these types of collaborative knowledge production result in tangible impacts. Drawing from a 6-year evaluation, this article investigates the outcomes and contributions of ten collaborative research projects supported by a federally funded climate research program in the US Southwest. Based on a series of narratives that outline researchers' objectives, anticipated outcomes are compared to those that emerged over a 6-year period. Results indicate several contributions that the program has made toward raising awareness about climate issues in the US Southwest, increasing capacity to adapt to climate change and climate variability, and building lasting individual and institutional collaborative relationships. However, researchers sometimes envision direct applications of their work, such as informing policy, planning, and decision-making, to be different than what occurred within the 6-year timeframe. Further exploration of these results reveals implicit assumptions in understanding how scientific information translates into use. This article offers insight into how researchers envision their impact, the management and development of a mission-oriented research program, and the use of evaluation to understand how collaborative research contributes to societal and environmental change.","[Owen, Gigi] Univ Arizona, Climate Assessment Southwest, ENR2 Bldg,POB 210137, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona,"Owen, G (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Climate Assessment Southwest, ENR2 Bldg,POB 210137, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",gigi@arizona.edu,,"Owen, Gigi/0000-0001-9480-236X",,,,,70,0,0,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0958-2029,1471-5449,,RES EVALUAT,Res.

Consequently, an increasing number of households are adopting labour migration as a livelihood strategy to diversify incomes, spread risks, and meet aspirations. Under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA) initiative, four research consortia have investigated migration patterns and their inherent linkages to adaptation to climate change in climate hotspots. This article synthesizes key findings in regional context of South Asia. Recent Findings The synthesis suggests that in climate-sensitive hotspots, migration is an important livelihood diversification strategy and a response to various risks, including climate change. Typically, one or more household members, often young men, migrated internally or internationally to work in predominantly informal sectors. Remittances helped spatially diversify household income, spread risks, and insure against external stressors. The outcomes of migration are often influenced by who moves, where to, and what capacities they possess. Migration was found to help improve household adaptive capacity, albeit in a limited capacity. Migration was mainly used as a response to risk and uncertainty, but with potential to have positive adaptation co-benefits.","[Maharjan, Amina] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, Khumaltar, Lalitpur, Nepal; [de Campos, Ricardo Safra] Univ Exeter, Global Syst Inst, Exeter, Devon, England; [Singh, Chandni; Srinivas, Arjun] Indian Inst Human Settlements, Bengaluru, India; [Das, Shouvik; Ghosh, Tuhin] Jadavpur Univ, Kolkata, India; [Bhuiyan, Mohammad Rashed Alam] Univ Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Ishaq, Sultan] Pakistan Agr Res Council PARK, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Umar, Muhammad Awais] SDPI, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Dilshad, Tanzina] BCAS, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Shrestha, Krity] Pract Act, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Bhadwal, Suruchi] TERI, New Delhi, India; [Suckall, Natalie] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England; [Vincent, Katharine] Kulima Integrated Dev Solut Pty Ltd, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa",University of Exeter; Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS); Jadavpur University; University of Dhaka; University of Southampton,"Maharjan, A (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, Khumaltar, Lalitpur, Nepal.",amina.maharjan@icimod.org; R.Safra-De-Campos@exeter.ac.uk; csingh@iihs.ac.in; geo.shk@gmail.com; asrinivas@iihs.ac.in; rashedalam@du.ac.bd; sultan.iq11@gmail.com; awais@sdpi.org; tanzina.dilshad@gmail.com; krity.shrestha89@gmail.com; suruchib@teri.res.in; tuhin_ghosh@yahoo.com; N.R.Suckall@soton.ac.uk; katharine@kulima.com,"Vincent, Katharine/L-5669-2019; Singh, Chandni/H-8384-2019","Vincent, Katharine/0000-0003-3152-1522; Singh, Chandni/0000-0001-6842-6735; Umar, Muhammad/0000-0002-2897-8815",,,,,106,35,35,5,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2198-6061,,,CURR CLIM CHANGE REP,Curr.

In the first scheme of its kind in the Thames basin, this paper describes how natural flood management (NFM) is being piloted in the Littlestock Brook tributary of the Evenlode catchment. This 5-year scheme (2016-2021) explores the delivery mechanisms and assesses the effectiveness of NFM measures to reduce flood risk in Milton-under-Wychwood, improve water quality and create habitat. It has secured 640 pound 000 from Environment Agency programmes, the Thames Regional Flood and Coastal Committee, other partners and landowners. In 2018, ten field corner bunds were created with a combined storage capacity of 26 000 m(3). Woody dams in the brook divert high flows into these flood storage areas. Critical to success is integrated delivery through the Evenlode Catchment Partnership and engagement of the local community. Catchment partnerships deliver a range of environmental, social and economic benefits, and directly support many of the ambitions under the government's 25-Year Environment Plan and the Water Framework Directive. Collaborative working with Thames Water, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, consultants and academics has enabled the project to utilise existing delivery mechanisms and to model and monitor the effectiveness of NFM.","[Old, Joanne; McKnight, David] Environm Agcy, Wallingford, Oxon, England; [Bennett, Richard] Wild Oxfordshire, Abingdon, Oxon, England; [Grzybek, Roland] Thames Reg Flood & Coastal Comm, London, England",,"Old, J (corresponding author), Environm Agcy, Wallingford, Oxon, England.",joanne.old@environment-agency.gov.uk,,,"Environment Agency, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Atkins and Hydraulics Research Wallingford in the monitoring and modelling programmes; Robert Oates at the Thames Regional Flood and Coastal Committee","Environment Agency, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Atkins and Hydraulics Research Wallingford in the monitoring and modelling programmes; Robert Oates at the Thames Regional Flood and Coastal Committee","The authors would like to acknowledge the invaluable contributions of all the partner organisations in the Evenlode Catchment Partnership, in particular Vaughan Lewis (Windrush AEC Ltd), David Gasca (Atkins), Hilary Phillips, Anne Miller and Ann Berkeley (Wild Oxfordshire), Laurence King (West Oxfordshire District Council), Sophie Edwards and Helena Soteriou (Thames Water) and Sharon Williams (Wychwood Project); the time, patience and enthusiasm of the landowners and communities (Milton Parish Council, Bruern Estate and Honeydale Farm) notably David Astor, Matt Childs and Chris Trotman; the support of the Environment Agency, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Atkins and Hydraulics Research Wallingford in the monitoring and modelling programmes; and Robert Oates at the Thames Regional Flood and Coastal Committee members for their initial investment and ongoing financial support for this lowland pilot scheme.",,0,3,3,1,29,ICE PUBLISHING,WESTMINISTER,"INST CIVIL ENGINEERS, 1 GREAT GEORGE ST, WESTMINISTER SW 1P 3AA, ENGLAND",1478-4629,1751-7680,,P I CIVIL ENG-ENG SU,Proc.

Climate change threatens to have wide-ranging impacts on ecosystems and presents enormous challenges for conventional modes of socioeconomic governance. Against this backdrop, the last few years have seen the consolidation of a body of legal rules and principles organised around the central problems of mittigating and adapting to climate change. The new climate change law spans from international to local levels of governance, and encompasses the activities of a wide range of actors including governments, businesses and non-governmental environmental groups. This article surveys the scope of the new discipline of climate change law providing a synopsis of its primary component areas. It also elaborates the main challenges climate change law is likely to face as its development proceeds apace, such as coping with internationalisation of the greenhouse problem, ensuring that avenues for widespread participation in climate change regulation exist, and integrating governance and regulatory frameworks, across political and disciplinary boundaries. How climate change last, responds to this last challenge, in particular, is likely to be determinative of its effectiveness and cohesiveness as a body of law for dealing with the broad predicted impacts of global warming.","[Peel, Jacqueline] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Peel, Jacqueline] Univ Sydney, United States Studies Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Sydney,"Peel, J (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",,"Peel, Jacqueline/K-3605-2019","Peel, Jacqueline/0000-0002-2880-169X",,,,,33,34,35,0,7,MELBOURNE UNIV LAW REVIEW ASSOC,VICTORIA,"UNIV MELBOURNE LAW SCH, VICTORIA, 3010, AUSTRALIA",0025-8938,1839-3810,,MELB UNIV LAW REV,Melb.

Despite its appealing attributes, farmers' up-take of the system is slow in temperate regions. This study aims to contribute to scaling-up agroforestry through a case study in Hungary and to help to design productive alley cropping systems. We investigated which tree planting pattern of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) results in the most productive alley cropping system when intercropped with triticale (x Triticosecale W.) by statistically analysing the yields of the intercrop and of the trees in nine different layouts and by calculating land equivalent ratios (LER). There was significant difference between the treatments both in triticale and black locust yields. The more trees planted on a hectare, the higher the volume of the stand, and the less yield of triticale was observed, although the latter correlation was weak and in some cases the triticale was more productive between the trees compared with sole crop control. Eight out of nine treatments had favourable LER (0.94-1.35) when the trees were five years old. Black locust and triticale seem to be a good combination for productive alley cropping systems.","[Honfy, Veronika; Keseru, Zsolt; Raso, Janos; Abri, Tamas] Univ Sopron, Forest Res Inst, Dept Plantat Forestry, Farkassziget 3, H-4150 Puspokladany, Hungary; [Podor, Zoltan] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Fac Informat, Pazmany Peter Str 1-C, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Borovics, Attila] Univ Sopron, Forest Res Inst, Dept Tree Breeding, Varkerulet 30-A, H-9400 Sarvar, Hungary",Eotvos Lorand University,"Honfy, V (corresponding author), Univ Sopron, Forest Res Inst, Dept Plantat Forestry, Farkassziget 3, H-4150 Puspokladany, Hungary.",honfy.veronika@uni-sopron.hu,,"Keseru, Zsolt/0000-0003-1123-8447; Abri, Tamas/0000-0002-0317-0975",,,,,34,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2223-7747,,PLANTS-BASEL,Plants-Basel,FEB,2023,12,3,,,,,,,595,10.3390/plants12030595,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants12030595,,,19,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,8U7UH,36771678,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000930151700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Because the majority of these systems are in deltaic areas, integrated river basin management (water and sediment discharge) is a must in the design of such pathways. Rising sea levels will tend to gradually flood coastal lagoons and marshes unless there is enough sediment supplied to compensate for the increasing deficit. Although the relationship between climate change and Mediterranean coastal storms is weak or non-existent, their impacts are expected to grow in the context of SLR and coastal squeezing. For example, the most affected Ebro Delta coastal stretches during the Gloria storm (January 2020), one of the most intense ever recorded in the Mediterranean, were those where the beach was narrower and weaker. Hard engineering solutions, such as the construction of dykes, as a protection measure against marine storms are not sustainable under scenarios of climate change and energy scarcity. A management approach based on soft engineering coastal defences and nature-based solutions is the most cost-effective and sustainable in the long run. The adequacy of implementing this kind of solution along the Mediterranean coast is discussed.","[Ibanez, Carles; Caiola, Nuno] Climate Resilience Ctr CRC, Amposta, Spain; [Ibanez, Carles; Caiola, Nuno] Technol Ctr Catalonia EURECAT, Dept Climate Change, Amposta, Spain",,"Ibanez, C (corresponding author), Climate Resilience Ctr CRC, Amposta, Spain.;Ibanez, C (corresponding author), Technol Ctr Catalonia EURECAT, Dept Climate Change, Amposta, Spain.",carles.ibanez@eurecat.org,"; Caiola, Nuno/A-5694-2008","Ibanez, Carles/0000-0002-7091-5527; Caiola, Nuno/0000-0003-2692-2954",European Union [101037097],European Union(European Commission),Funding was provided by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement number 101037097 (project REST-COAST).,,58,1,1,11,27,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1323-1650,1448-6059,,MAR FRESHWATER RES,Mar.

This paper analyses how farmers consider (1) treated wastewater to face water scarcity risk and (2) CW as mechanisms to face agricultural water pollution in a climate change adaptation context. A survey about climate change perception and adaptation measures was answered by 177 farmers from two irrigation communities near El Hondo coastal wetland and the Santa Pola saltmarshes, both perceived as natural-constructed systems in Alicante, southern Spain. Results highlighted how, even with poor-quality standards, treated wastewater is considered a non-riskier measure and more reliable option when addressing climate change impacts. Overall, physical water harvesting (such as CWs) is the favorite choice when investing in water technologies, being perceived as the best option for users of treated wastewater and those concerned about water quality standards. Consequently, CWs were recognized as mechanisms to increase water supply and reduce water pollution. Policy-makers and water managers can use these learnings from farmers' experience to identify the main barriers and benefits of using treated wastewater and CWs to address water scarcity and water pollution risks.","[Ricart, Sandra; Rico-Amoros, Antonio M.] Univ Alicante, Interuniv Inst Geog, Water & Terr Res Grp, Alicante 03690, Spain; [Ricart, Sandra] Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Environm Intelligence Global Change Lab, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Rico-Amoros, Antonio M.] Univ Alicante, Dept Reg Geog Anal & Phys Geog, Alicante 03690, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; Polytechnic University of Milan; Universitat d'Alacant,"Ricart, S (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Interuniv Inst Geog, Water & Terr Res Grp, Alicante 03690, Spain.;Ricart, S (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Environm Intelligence Global Change Lab, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",sandra.ricart@ua.es; am.rico@ua.es,"Casadevall, Sandra Ricart/H-4222-2016; Rico, Antonio/H-2464-2015","Casadevall, Sandra Ricart/0000-0002-5065-0074; Rico, Antonio/0000-0002-9997-1186","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [FJCI-2015-24346]; Interuniversity Institute of Geography, University of Alicante [I-PI-88-18]","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Interuniversity Institute of Geography, University of Alicante","This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Juan de la Cierva postdoctoral research fellow, grant number FJCI-2015-24346) and by the Interuniversity Institute of Geography, University of Alicante (grant number I-PI-88-18), both awarded to the first author.",,83,0,0,2,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2021,13,17,,,,,,,2431,10.3390/w13172431,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13172431,,,21,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,UO1IH,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000694455300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In IH-LANS, a hybrid (statistical-numerical) deep-water propagation module and a data-assimilated shoreline evolution model are coupled. Longshore and cross-shore processes are integrated together with the effects of man-made interventions. For every simulation, shoreline changes in response to time varying wave conditions and water levels are evaluated while reducing calibration uncertainty by means of an extended Kalman filter that allows to assimilate shoreline observations. To test model performance, IH-LANS is applied to a highly anthropized 40 km stretch located along the Spanish Mediterranean coast. The model is run during the period 1990-2020 using high space-time resolution climate data and satellite-derived shorelines in order to calibrate the free parameters and validate model outputs. Shoreline evolution is successfully represented (<10 m of root mean square error, RMSE) while accounting for the effects of nourishments and the construction and removal of groynes, seawalls and breakwaters over time. The efficiency of the model makes IH-LANS a powerful tool for coastal management and climate change adaptation.","[Alvarez-Cuesta, M.; Toimil, A.; Losada, I.

In 2018, the country enacted the Act of Climate Change Adaptation to formulate plans at national and local levels. The government has suggested the use of nature-based solutions (NBSs) across the country to address the increased risk of natural disasters. This study employs scenario analysis to examine the effectiveness of NBSs for the mitigation of flood risk and their implications on the provision of ecosystem services (ESs). Shiga prefecture in Japan enacted its own ordinance in 2015. This ordinance considers existing land use and building regulations to mitigate flood risk. The quantitative analysis assumes nine scenarios up to the year 2050, combining the current policy of Shiga and our original assumption of advance policy options to evaluate the future flood risk and ES. The analysis revealed that land use management can partially mitigate the flood risk by banning new residences and relocating residential land from flood-prone areas to safer areas and converting residential land into forest and paddy fields. It also suggests that both flood risk mitigation and provision of ESs can be further improved if local governments introduce a residence growth management strategy.","[Huang, Wanhui; Hashimoto, Shizuka; Yoshida, Takehito; Saito, Osamu; Taki, Kentaro] Res Inst Humanity & Nat, Kyoto 6032305, Japan; [Hashimoto, Shizuka] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Yoshida, Takehito] Univ Tokyo, Dept Gen Syst Studies, Tokyo 1538902, Japan; [Saito, Osamu] Inst Global Environm Strategies, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan; [Taki, Kentaro] Univ Shiga Prefecture, Hikone 5228533, Japan",Research Institute for Humanity & Nature (RIHN); University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo; University Shiga Prefecture,"Huang, WH (corresponding author), Res Inst Humanity & Nat, Kyoto 6032305, Japan.",huang.wanhui@chikyu.ac.jp; ahash@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp; ty@chikyu.ac.jp; o-saito@iges.or.jp; taki.k@ses.usp.ac.jp,"Yoshida, Takehito/ABB-2490-2020","Yoshida, Takehito/0000-0001-9178-3634","Research Institute for Humanity and Nature [14200103]; Ministry of the Environment, Japan [S-15]; Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research, JSPS KAKENHI [JP18K18274, CRRP2018-03MY]","Research Institute for Humanity and Nature; Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research, JSPS KAKENHI","This research was supported by the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature (RIHN : a constituent member of NIHU) Project No. 14200103, the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S-15) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan and CRRP201803MYHashimoto by the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research, JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP18K18274.",,95,6,6,10,38,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0416,,,ECOSYST SERV,Ecosyst.

Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) can mitigate the impacts of climate change, build resilience and tackle environmental degradation thereby supporting the targets set by the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework. Despite these benefits, EbA is still rarely implemented in practice. To better understand the barriers to implementation, this research examines policy-makers' perceptions of EbA, using an extended version of Protection Motivation Theory as an analytical framework. Through semi-structured interviews with policy-makers at regional and provincial level in Central Vietnam, it was found that EbA is generally considered a promising response option, mainly due to its multiple ecosystem-service benefits. The demand for EbA measures was largely driven by the perceived consequences of natural hazards and climate change. Insufficient perceived response efficacy and time-lags in effectiveness for disaster risk reduction were identified as key impediments for implementation. Pilot projects and capacity building on EbA are important means to overcome these perceptual barriers. This paper contributes to bridging the knowledge-gap on political decision-making regarding EbA and can, thereby, promote its mainstreaming into policy plans.","[Pham, My] CSRD, Hue City, Vietnam; [Matthews, Nathanial] Global Resilience Partnership, Stockholm, Sweden; [Bubeck, Philip] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Potsdam, Germany",Stockholm University; University of Potsdam,"Pham, M (corresponding author), CSRD, Hue City, Vietnam.",sabina.wolf@gmx.net,"Bubeck, Philip/ABA-2750-2020","Bubeck, Philip/0000-0001-5163-5290",Global Resilience Partnership Water Window through the Water Window project's Resil-Nam Coastal and ResilNam Urban - Z Zurich Foundation,Global Resilience Partnership Water Window through the Water Window project's Resil-Nam Coastal and ResilNam Urban - Z Zurich Foundation,This work was supported by funding received from the Global Resilience Partnership Water Window through the Water Window project's Resil-Nam Coastal and ResilNam Urban as funded by the Z Zurich Foundation.,,131,6,7,4,45,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

However, there is mounting evidence that adaptation and vulnerability are linked, such that ostensibly adaptive responses can have negative consequences and augment people's vulnerability. We analyzed several climate change responses at various scales and developed a typology of five discrete but related modes by which the vulnerability of already vulnerable populations is being [re]produced. Crucially, this work suggests that for at least one of these modes, the vulnerability of other groups is perversely inverted, such that relatively secure populations perceive themselves to be at risk. The cases we present illustrate that people's vulnerability is being used against them, or put another way, is being weaponized-exacerbating their precarity by excluding them from much needed and due assistance, while directing resources instead to bolstering the well-being of those already well-positioned to respond to climate threats. Our typology provides a theoretical intervention by illustrating how climate vulnerability and security are co-produced, as well as a practical tool to help decision makers to adopt more just and equitable climate policies.","[Thomas, Kimberley Anh] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Warner, Benjamin P.] Univ New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; University of New Mexico,"Thomas, KA (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Geog & Urban Studies, 308 Gladfelter Hall,1115 Polett Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",kimthomas@temple.edu,,"Thomas, Kimberley/0000-0002-9600-385X",,,,,128,50,51,5,30,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

More than 100 years of high-quality rainfall data from 53 rainfall stations were analyzed using robust statistical techniques. The results are presented according to the eight South Australian natural resource management regions. Increasing annual rainfall trends were observed for the Arid Lands, Alinytjara Wilinara and Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges regions whereas decreasing trends were found for the Murray Darling Basin, Eyre Peninsula and South East regions. Both upward and downward trends were identified in the Northern and Yorke region. Seasonally, austral spring and summer rainfalls exhibited increasing trends in most of the regions whereas autumn and winter rainfalls showed decreasing trends. Most of the rainfall step changes were observed to happen in the 1960s and 1970s. The study also includes a discussion on possible mechanisms of South Australian rainfall variability and changes that may have links to the observed trends and step changes.","[Chowdhury, Rezaul K.] United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Beecham, Simon] Univ S Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Mawson Lakes, SA, Australia; [Boland, John; Piantadosi, Julia] Univ S Australia, Sch Informat Technol & Math Sci, Mawson Lakes, SA, Australia",United Arab Emirates University; University of South Australia; University of South Australia,"Chowdhury, RK (corresponding author), United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates.",RezaulKabir@uaeu.ac.ae,"Beecham, Simon C/M-1544-2016; Boland, John W/B-3046-2008","Beecham, Simon C/0000-0002-9884-3852; Boland, John W/0000-0003-1132-7589; Chowdhury, Rezaul/0000-0003-1631-9748",Goyder Institute for Water Research,Goyder Institute for Water Research,This research was funded by the Goyder Institute for Water Research as part of the project: Development of an agreed set of climate projections for South Australia (http://www.goyderinstitute.org/programs/climate/index.php).

Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) represent an opportunity to align environmental and resilience goals, at a time of strained budgets in a global context and when short-term needs may run counter to long-term goals. In Europe, NbS fit the mandates of major EU environmental and climate change policies by restoring biodiversity and enhancing climate-resilience and carbon sequestration. Previous studies have compiled scientific evidence about hydro-meteorological hazards for the use of NbS. However, their implementation at scale is still lacking. As the knowledge and experience with NbS for adaptation to natural hazards and climate change increases, it becomes more important to draw lessons learned and insights for replicating and scaling up NbS, especially in coastal areas where their implementation is still limited compared to other environments. This study analyzed NbS case studies across European coastal and estuarine areas to draw key lessons, understand better the current status of implementation, and identify key challenges and gaps. From a total of 59 NbS case studies associated with flooding, erosion and biodiversity loss, results show an increase in NbS implementation since 1990s, but most rapidly between 2005 and 2015. Most of the case studies are hybrid solutions employing wetlands, predominantly located in the United Kingdom (UK) and the Netherlands. Funding of NbS is largely from public sources, and rarely come from a single or a private source. Three-quarters of the case studies reported monitoring activities, but more than half did not disclose quantitative results related to effectiveness against flooding and/or erosion. The need to improve coastal defenses was indicated as the main motivation for NbS implementation over traditional structures, while sustainability was the most mentioned additional reason. Although a variety of co-benefits and lessons learned was identified, clearer descriptions and enhanced details of such information are required. There is a need for tools and strategies to expand knowledge sharing of lessons learned to enable further replication of successful cases in other areas.","[Moraes, Roberta P.

An experiment shows this frame works by reducing persuasion knowledge and increasing perceived behavioral control, resulting in science skeptics being significantly more likely to intend to take action, engage with the news, and agree with the story's perspective. This effect is moderated by science skepticism, with adaptive frames working significantly better on the very people the news media are not reaching.

Yet, few studies have investigated how past design assumptions influence potential mitigation and adaptation actions. This paper evaluates adaptation pathways for wastewater management in California and addresses two questions. First, are wastewater facilities experiencing challenges from mismatches in design flow values and current rates of influent flow? Second, what, if any, adaptation actions are underway or planned? To answer these questions, we compiled historical literature and conducted surveys and interviews with wastewater system managers. Approximately half of respondents indicated that they are experiencing challenges associated with changing water use rates. Aging systems have implemented many types of mitigation and adaptation actions, including operational changes, chemical additions, and facility rebuilds. California's wastewater industry is largely pursuing an incremental adaptation pathway to manage drought and climate change.

Adaptation practices emerging at the farm scale have potentially harmful outcomes that can erode the agricultural sustainability. So far, farm scale decision-making on adaptation measures is scarcely studied, and a thorough assessment of risk perceptions underlying adaptation decision-making is required in the Nordic context to inform adaptation policy planning. In this qualitative case study, the climate risk perceptions of Nordic farmers and agricultural extension officers are examined. As a result, a typology of risk responses is presented, showing three dominant patterns within highly dynamic and contextual adaptation processes at farm scale: risk aversive, opportunity-seeking and experimental. The typology represents the variation within adaptation processes that further stress the need for participatory adaptation policy development in agriculture.","[Kayhko, Janina] Univ Helsinki, Ecosyst & Environm Res Programme, POB 65,Viikinkaari 1,4403, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Kayhko, Janina] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, POB 65,Viikinkaari 1 4403, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Kayhko, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Ecosyst & Environm Res Programme, POB 65,Viikinkaari 1,4403, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.;Kayhko, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, POB 65,Viikinkaari 1 4403, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",janina.kayhko@helsinki.fi,"Käyhkö, Janina/AAW-6163-2021","Käyhkö, Janina/0000-0003-0904-5857",,,,,76,5,5,1,26,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1473-5903,1747-762X,,INT J AGR SUSTAIN,Int.

Nevertheless, this article argues that the concepts used to describe urban adaptation are a part of the history of urban planning. Consequently, climate change should not be seen as a new phenomenon disconnected from this past. By means of a historically contextualized conceptual discussion and a review of urban planning instruments used to address climate change in Chile, the article argues that climate change has been central to urban planning and that the emphasis on climate change is no more than a reaffirmation of this connection built on the concept of 'urban risk'. It concludes that an integrated and historically contextualized approach based on urban risk should form the basis to the response within the framework of the National Climate Change Adaptation Policy (2014) in conjunction with the National Urban Development Policy (2014).","[Barton, Jonathan R.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Estudios Urbanos & Terr, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Barton, JR (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Estudios Urbanos & Terr, Santiago, Chile.",jbarton@uc.cl; firarrazava@uc.cl,"Barton, Jonathan/E-8512-2011","Barton, Jonathan/0000-0001-6250-8684; Irarrazaval, Felipe/0000-0002-8402-9526",,,,,60,7,11,1,20,"PONTIFICA UNIV CATOLICA CHILE, INST GEOGRAFIA",SANTIAGO,"AV VICUNA MACKENNA 4860, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0718-3402,,,REV GEOGR NORTE GD,Rev.

The objective of this research was to study the drivers for and barriers to biogas technology implementation in the country. As the research involved different types of stakeholders related to biogas production, the outcome provides clarity about the factors influencing the profusion of biogas production in Bangladesh. The outcome of the study identifies poor research and development, lack of coordination among stakeholders, an immature biogas market, lack of awareness and no feed-in tariff policy as the main barriers. In the case of drivers, the motivation of producing biogas as an efficient way of using waste, the availability of local experts, the attractiveness of a growing renewable energy market and the contribution of biogas technology in adaptation to climate change were found to be the most important factors. The study's outcomes are found to be similar to other studies from developing countries with similar socio-economic status. In accordance with the important drivers and barriers identified in this study, recommendations for increasing the diffusion of biogas in Bangladesh are also presented at the end of the article.","[Hasan, A.

This study looked at whether public understanding and acceptance of smart-growth policies could be improved if citizens were provided with timely, accessible visualizations about why and how such policies can help reduce energy use. This paper reviews two public-engagement workshops that utilized a collaborative touch table combined with three-dimensional visualizations and metrics that were updated in real time. Working both individually and collaboratively on an urban-design task, all participants improved the smart growth and energy-related performance of the study areas via their solutions in the first workshop, but they did not all further improve the energy-related performance of the areas after receiving additional energy knowledge and metrics in a follow-up workshop.

The livelihoods of the Tuareg of Illizi are finely tuned to climate variability as reflected in changes reported in the cadence of events in their ecological calendar (marked by cyclical climatic and religious events). Participants reported rain and temperature irregularities and severe drought events, which have impacted their pastoral and semi-pastoral livelihoods. These reports are aligned with scientifically measured climate observations and predictions. Paradoxically, although participants recall with detail the climatic disasters that happened in the region over the last century, the Tuareg do not explicitly report decadal trends in the frequency of extreme events. The differential perception of climate change impacts across scales can have important implications for undertaking climate change adaptation measures.","[Miara, M.

Community-based resource management approaches may ameliorate tragedy of the commons effects. Here we use a randomized evaluation in Namibia's communal rangelands to study a comprehensive four-year program to support community-based rangeland and cattle management. We find that the program led to persistent and large improvements for eight of thirteen indices of social and behavioral outcomes. Effects on rangeland health, cattle productivity and household economics, however, were either negative or nil. Positive impacts on community resource management may have been offset by communities' inability to control grazing by non-participating herds and inhibited by an unresponsive rangeland sub-system. This juxtaposition, in which measurable improvements in community resource management did not translate into better outcomes for households or rangeland health, demonstrates the fragility of the causal pathway from program implementation to intended socioeconomic and environmental outcomes. It also points to challenges for improving climate change-adaptation strategies. A four-year program to support community rangeland management in Namibia led to improved resource governance but had no effect on environmental and economic outcomes, which suggests alternative policies are needed to combat environmental degradation.","[Coppock, D.

This study examines how local contextual environmental factors contribute to individual choices for adapting to water scarcity in three locations in central Spain. The study evaluates citizens' choices by audience segmentation and explore the role of geographical location in segments' engagement with adaptation and adaptation measure preference. The results of the analysis of the effect of local experience support the findings of other studies that suggest that local experience is linked to risk perception but does not necessarily drive adaptive behaviour. The results suggest that respondents from most degraded areas show a higher local risk perception, but do not show homogeneous commitment to adaptation. The results also indicate differences over adaptation measure preferences across locations. Respondents of less degraded areas have a lower risk perception and show individualistic responses as compared to respondents in water stressed communities. These results highlight the relevance of local experience-driven risk perception in support to adaptation actions.

Our understanding of the challenges, needs, and opportunities for climate change adaptation has advanced significantly in recent years yet remains limited. Research has identified and theorized key determinants of adaptive capacity and barriers to adaptation, and more recently begun to track adaptation in practice. Despite this, there is negligible research investigating whether and indeed if adaptive capacity is translating into actual adaptation action. Here we test whether theorized determinants of adaptive capacity are associated with adaptation policy outcomes at the national level for 117 nations. We show that institutional capacity, in particular measures of good governance, are the strongest predictors of national adaptation policy. Adaptation at the national level is limited in countries with poor governance, and in the absence of good governance other presumed determinants of adaptive capacity show limited effect on adaptation. Our results highlight the critical importance of institutional good governance as a prerequisite for national adaptation. Other elements of theorized adaptive capacity are unlikely to be sufficient, effective, or present at the national level where national institutions and governance are poor.","[Berrang-Ford, Lea; Ford, James D.; Lesnikowski, Alexandra; Poutiainen, Carolyn] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [Barrera, Magda; Heymann, S.

It notes the importance for urban areas of an effective rural adaptation agenda especially in maintaining the productivity and functioning of rural systems. It highlights the importance of today's infrastructure investments, taking into account climate changes, given the long lifespan of most infrastructure, and the importance of urban management engaging with changing risk profiles. One important part of this is the need to connect official adaptation initiatives to the much-improved natural hazard risk assessment, management and mitigation capacity that responded to major disasters.

However, they are increasingly experiencing issues with water availability and access due to precipitation pattern changes associated with climate change. In 2016, the Dry Farming Collaborative (DFC) was developed as a participatory model for facilitating research, social networks, and resource-sharing among agricultural stakeholders to test the efficacy of dry farming as an adaptation strategy. Dry farming differs from irrigated cropping systems in that growers do not irrigate their fields and instead utilize a suite of practices to conserve soil moisture from winter rains for summer crop growth. To better understand how to meaningfully engage stake-holders in participatory climate adaptation research, this study explored how the participatory process facilitated the adoption of dry farming as a climate adaptation strategy among participants. Drawing on interviews with 20 DFC participants, including farmers, gardeners, and researchers, results indicate that the integration and use of different knowledge systems within the participatory research process made it easier for participants to integrate dry farming into their operational contexts. Processes designed to encourage interactions and information-sharing between participants and nonhierarchical researcher-grower relationships facilitated the exchange of these knowledge systems among participants, thus providing them with the trusted and salient information they needed to adopt new practices. Results indicate that these features could be useful for enacting future participatory climate research projects that lead to the adoption of effective adaptation strategies.","[Parks, Melissa] Oregon State Univ, 2250 SW Jefferson Way Waldo 126, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Roesch-McNally, Gabrielle] USDA, Northwest Climate Hub, Corvallis, OR USA; [Roesch-McNally, Gabrielle] Amer Farmland Trust, Women Land Initiat, Washington, DC USA; [Garrett, Amy] Oregon State Univ Extens Serv, Small Farms Program, Corvallis, OR USA",Oregon State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Oregon State University,"Parks, M (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, 2250 SW Jefferson Way Waldo 126, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",parksinel@oregonstate.edu; groeschracnally@farmland.org; amy.garrett@oregonstate.edu,,,U.S. Department of Agriculture Northwest Climate Hub grant [17-JV-11261944-072],U.S. Department of Agriculture Northwest Climate Hub grant,This study was funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Northwest Climate Hub grant #17-JV-11261944-072.,,33,2,2,3,9,LYSON CENTER CIVIC AGRICULTURE & FOOD SYSTEMS,ITHACA,"295 HOOK PL, ITHACA, NY 14850 USA",2152-0798,2152-0801,,J AGRIC FOOD SYST CO,J.

Through analysis of articles from two newspapers, we suggest that attention to greenery and heat tends to reflect immediate weather or planning considerations, and that there is a persistent perception of greenspace as a barrier to economic development. Broad-based, durable rationales extending beyond climate adaptation benefits may be required to sustain support for greenspace planning in Taipei. There is also a need to raise decision makers' awareness of the specific actions required to realize cooling benefits via greening. We argue that the Taipei case demonstrates the potential for policy messaging based on greenspace functions to attain cross-sectoral buy-in for greenspace development or preservation, but that planners and policymakers must ensure that consensus-based governance actually delivers cooling benefits to citizens. Our results also indicate that greenspace planning policy could more explicitly address community-level greening specifically targeted at cooling or other climate adaptation challenges.","[Mabon, Leslie] Robert Gordon Univ, Sch Appl Social Studies, Garthdee Rd, Aberdeen AB10 7QG, Scotland; [Shih, Wan-Yu] Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Disaster Management, Taipei, Taiwan",Robert Gordon University; Ming Chuan University,"Mabon, L (corresponding author), Robert Gordon Univ, Sch Appl Social Studies, Garthdee Rd, Aberdeen AB10 7QG, Scotland.",l.j.mabon@rgu.ac; shih@mail.mcu.edu.tw,,"Shih, Wan-Yu/0000-0003-4427-492X; Mabon, Leslie/0000-0003-2646-6119",,,,,79,8,8,4,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,1746-0301,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

In this review, we synthesize information on changes in climate and hydrologic processes during the past century for the Great Basin and Columbia Plateau and discuss future projections for the 21st century. We develop midcentury projections of temperature and climate for the Great Basin and Columbia Plateau at timescales relevant to managers (2020-2050) and discuss concepts and strategies for adapting to the projected changes. For the instrumented record in the Great Basin and Columbia Plateau (1985-2011), a temperature increase of 0.7 -1.4 degrees C has been documented, but changes in precipitation have been relatively minor with no clear trends. Climate projections for 2020-2050 indicate that temperatures will continue to increase, especially in winter and during the night. Precipitation is more difficult to project, and estimates range from an 11% decrease to 25% increase depending on location. Recent records indicate that the Great Basin and Columbia Plateau are becoming more arid, a trend that is projected to continue. Droughts are likely to become more frequent and last longer, invasive annual grasses are likely to continue to expand, and the duration and severity of wildfire seasons are likely to increase. Climate projections can help in developing adaptive management strategies for actual or expected changes in climate. Strategies include reducing the risks of nonnative invasive plant spread and wildfires that result in undesirable transitions, planning for drought, and where necessary, facilitating the transition of populations, communities, and ecosystems to new climatic conditions. A proactive approach to planning for and adapting to climate change is needed, and publicly available Internet-based resources on climate data and planning strategies are available to help meet that need.

The engagement of involved agents critically depends on their perception that the burdens and benefits of collective action are distributed fairly. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), which inform climate policies, focus on the minimization of costs and the maximization of overall utility, but they rarely pay sufficient attention to how costs and benefits are distributed among agents. Consequently, some agents may perceive the resultant model-based policy recommendations as unfair. In this paper, we propose how to adjust the objectives optimized within IAMs so as to derive policy recommendations that can plausibly be presented to agents as fair. We review approaches to aggregating the utilities of multiple agents into fairness-relevant social rankings of outcomes, analyze features of these rankings, and associate with them collections of properties that a model's objective function must have to operationalize each of these rankings within the model. Moreover, for each considered ranking, we propose a selection of specific objective functions that can conveniently be used for generating this ranking in a model. Maximizing these objective functions within existing IAMs allows exploring and identifying climate polices to which multiple agents may be willing to commit.","[Zebrowski, Piotr; Dieckmann, Ulf; Braennstroem, Ake; Franklin, Oskar; Rovenskaya, Elena] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Dieckmann, Ulf] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol Grad Univ OIST, Complex Sci & Evolut Unit, Onna 9040495, Japan; [Dieckmann, Ulf] Grad Univ Adv Studies Sokendai, Dept Evolutionary Studies Biosyst, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400193, Japan; [Braennstroem, Ake] Umea Univ, Dept Math & Math Stat, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Rovenskaya, Elena] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Computat Math & Cybernet, Moscow 119991, Russia",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Okinawa Institute of Science & Technology Graduate University; Graduate University for Advanced Studies - Japan; Umea University; Lomonosov Moscow State University,"Zebrowski, P (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",zebrowsk@iiasa.ac.at; dieckmann@iiasa.ac.at; brnstrom@iiasa.ac.at; franklin@iiasa.ac.at; rovenska@iiasa.ac.at,"Rovenskaya, Elena/CAF-1378-2022","Franklin, Oskar/0000-0002-0376-4140; Brannstrom, Ake/0000-0001-9862-816X; Zebrowski, Piotr/0000-0001-5283-8049",European Union [820989],European Union(European Commission),"U.D. gratefully acknowledges funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 820989 for the project COMFORT Our common future ocean in the Earth system-quantifying coupled cycles of carbon, oxygen, and nutrients for determining and achieving safe operating spaces with respect to tipping points (the work reflects only the authors' view; the European Commission and their executive agency are not responsible for any use that may be made of the information the work contains.)",,50,2,2,3,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2022,14,7,,,,,,,3737,10.3390/su14073737,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14073737,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0M2OY,,"Green Published, Green Accepted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000782001200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is achieved via increased land and water use efficiency, water and energy savings, and improved water productivity with considerable scope to improve agricultural resilience. In this context, the prioritization of a location-specific portfolio of smart AWM practices to make the right investment decisions is very important. We present two distinct and complementary approaches to prioritize AWM practices in this paper: one follows stakeholder analysis to build a prioritized portfolio of climate-smart AWM practices and the other employs a simple water balance-based approach to prioritize interventions. The way forward in mainstreaming and scaling out context-specific climate-smart AWM interventions is also discussed with a focus on capacity building, water management extension services, and the mobilization of resources through the convergence of institutions and co-financing from relevant development schemes.","[Sikka, Alok K.; Alam, Mohammad Faiz; Mandave, Vidya] Int Water Management Inst IWMI, Delhi, India",CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI),"Sikka, AK (corresponding author), Int Water Management Inst, New Delhi, India.",a.sikka@cgiar.org,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Alam, Mohammad Faiz/0000-0002-5600-6108",,,,,82,3,3,4,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1531-0353,1531-0361,,IRRIG DRAIN,Irrig.

For over 30 years, the Society for the Protection of Prespa (SPP), a locally based NGO representing an international constituency, has successfully used the obligations, goals and objectives laid out by the Ramsar Convention. The SPP has led broader alliances, implementing and coordinating conservation action, initially on the Greek side and later at basin level, through an integrated ecosystem approach, multiparticipatory decision-making processes and transboundary collaboration. It has achieved substantial benefits for waterbird populations, especially pelicans, engaged in community-based resource management approaches and drawn support, mainly from international donors, to achieve progress in the wise use of the wetland. The established decision-making mechanisms in Greek Prespa, the long-term monitoring data on the wetland ecosystem and the operation of transboundary collaboration networks are also expected to contribute towards addressing ongoing challenges, such as eutrophication and adaptation to climate change.","[Catsadorakis, Giorgos; Roumeliotou, Vivi; Koutseri, Irene; Malakou, Myrsini] Agios Germanos, Soc Protect Prespa, GR-53150 Florina, Greece",,"Catsadorakis, G (corresponding author), Agios Germanos, Soc Protect Prespa, GR-53150 Florina, Greece.",catsadorakis@spp.gr,,"Catsadorakis, Giorgos/0000-0002-8590-5858",,,,,41,3,3,0,0,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1323-1650,1448-6059,,MAR FRESHWATER RES,Mar.

The result of the analyses showed that though the 2012 flood did not significantly affect the per capita expenditure of all the surveyed households, it may have significantly decreased the per capita expenditure of households located in the flood affected areas and were heavily dependent on agriculture for their income. More so, the effects were not uniform across the households as the result showed that the effects were more on female-headed households compared to male-headed households, and more on households that had no access to credit compared to those that had access to credit. These lead to the recommendation that efforts should be made to integrate adaptation to climate change into poverty alleviation/eradication programmes in the country by ensuring that farmers prone to flood and other extreme climate-related disasters have access to finance. They should also be trained on how to build resilience, adaptive, anticipatory and absorptive capacity to climate change, giving priority to female-headed household that earn their living from agriculture.","[Urama, Nathaniel E.; Eboh, Eric C.; Onyekuru, Anthony] Univ Nigeria, Dept Agr Econ, Nsukka, Nigeria; [Urama, Nathaniel E.] African Heritage Inst, Dept Econ, Enugu, Nigeria",University of Nigeria,"Urama, NE (corresponding author), Univ Nigeria, Dept Agr Econ, Nsukka, Nigeria.;Urama, NE (corresponding author), African Heritage Inst, Dept Econ, Enugu, Nigeria.",nathaniel.urama@unn.edu.ng,,"Urama, Nathaniel E./0000-0002-1688-5291","Climate Analytics GmbH, Berlin, Germany","Climate Analytics GmbH, Berlin, Germany","The authors wish to acknowledge Climate Analytics GmbH, Berlin, Germany as the sponsor of the project.

Effective mitigation in agriculture and adaptation to climate change requires identification of size and structure of emission from this sector not only at national and regional level, but also locally. Therefore, we are the first to estimate the size of the carbon footprint from agriculture and present its statistical analyses and spatial distribution for all Polish communes (LAU level 2). We propose a solution that can be successfully applied using almost exclusively data available in public statistics. The annual value of the carbon footprint from agriculture in Polish communes varies from 0.01 to 289.48 thousand Mg CO(2)eq, with a mean value of 13.85 thousand Mg CO(2)eq and a standard deviation of 14.96 thousand Mg CO(2)eq. The intensive animal production concentrated in the central, northern and northeastern parts of Poland means that the communes located in these areas are characterized by high emissions from enteric fermentation and animal faeces. The communes with large areas of organic soils and former State Agricultural Farm are characterized by high GHG emissions from agricultural land use. The obtained results should facilitate the planning and prioritisation of measures to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture.","[Wisniewski, Pawel; Kistowski, Mariusz] Univ Gdansk, Dept Phys Geog & Environm Management, Bazynskiego 4, PL-80309 Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk,"Wisniewski, P (corresponding author), Univ Gdansk, Dept Phys Geog & Environm Management, Bazynskiego 4, PL-80309 Gdansk, Poland.",p.wisniewski@ug.edu.pl,"Wiśniewski, Paweł/A-4853-2015","Wiśniewski, Paweł/0000-0002-3445-2000; Kistowski, Mariusz/0000-0003-3464-2450",,,,,44,7,7,1,5,PARLAR SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS (P S P),FREISING,"ANGERSTR. 12, 85354 FREISING, GERMANY",1018-4619,1610-2304,,FRESEN ENVIRON BULL,Fresenius Environ.

This paper explores how adaptation strategies are adopted by small-holders in sub-Saharan Africa as a function of their adaptive capacity. The latter is characterised by five types of capital: natural, physical, financial, human, and social. We use responses from farm households in sub-Saharan Africa dating from 1536 obtained by Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS). This data provides information on the adoption of adaptation practices during the study period as well as information with which we develop indicators for the five types of capital. The results suggest that all the five types of capital positively influence adoption of adaptation practices. Human and social capital both displayed a positive and significant effect on the uptake of most adaptation practices. This finding suggests that the effect of less tangible kinds of capital such as knowledge, individual perceptions, farmers' networks and access to information may be stronger than normally assumed. Directing more development policies towards enhancing human and social capital may therefore be more cost-effective than further investments into physical and financial capital, and could help in overcoming social barriers to adaptation to climate change.","[Garcia de Jalon, Silvestre; Neumann, Marc B.] Basque Ctr Climate Change, Leioa 48940, Spain; [Iglesias, Ana] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Agr Econ, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Neumann, Marc B.] Ikerbasque, Basque Fdn Sci, Bilbao, Spain",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Basque Foundation for Science,"de Jalon, SG (corresponding author), Basque Ctr Climate Change, Leioa 48940, Spain.",silvestre.garciadejalon@bc3research.org,"Neumann, Marc B/B-5553-2008; Iglesias, Ana/AEN-3261-2022","Neumann, Marc B/0000-0002-4801-3279; IGLESIAS, ANA/0000-0002-3183-6658; Garcia de Jalon, Silvestre/0000-0001-9824-9020",Ramon y Cajal Fellowship of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain [RYC-2013-13628],Ramon y Cajal Fellowship of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain,Marc B.

Therefore, risk management in the UWC benefits from an integrated approach to incorporate the interdependencies between elements. The water cycle safety plan (WCSP) provides a common risk management framework for stakeholders in the UWC. It is based on the water safety plan (WSP) approach for water supply and incorporates the latest developments in risk management approaches, such as ISO 31 000: 2009 and ISO Guide 73: 2009. Apart from protection of public health, the WCSP also addresses public safety and protection of the environment. The proposed WCSP is divided into nine steps including stakeholders' commitment and team assembling, establishment of scope of the plan, characterisation of water systems, identification of risks, risk analysis and evaluation, selection of risk reduction measures, development of protocols for communication, monitoring and review. The WCSP approach was developed in the PREPARED project with a focus on UWC adaptation to climate change but can be applied in a broader context. This preventive and systematic risk approach supports decisions on adaptive measures and strategies for the whole UWC based on the best available knowledge.","[Almeida, M.

Such a synthesis is required not only for environmental researchers but also for policy makers. The key question is the broad picture at major regional and continental levels. Some interesting conclusions for this survey are emerging. For example, the review shows increased variance of precipitation everywhere. Consistent with this finding, we observe that wet areas become wetter, and dry and and areas become more so. In addition, the following general changing pattern is emerging: (a) increased precipitation in high latitudes (Northern Hemisphere); (b) reductions in precipitation in China, Australia and the Small Island States in the Pacific; and (c) increased variance in equatorial regions. The changes in the major ocean currents also appear to be affecting precipitation patterns. For example, increased intensity and frequency of El Nino and ENSO seem associated with evidence of an observed dipole pattern affecting Africa and Asia, although this time series is too short so far. But the changing pattern calls for renewed efforts at adaptation to climate change, as the changing precipitation pattern will also affect the regional availability of food supply.

DP was estimated for each irrigation event from precipitation, irrigation input, runoff, change in soil water storage, and evapotranspiration data for both fields. Both fields exhibited positive, statistically significant relationships between DP and total water applied (TWA), where one field exhibited positive, statistically significant relationships between DP and groundwater level fluctuation (GWLF) and between GWLF and total water applied. In 2021, total DP on Field 1 was 739 mm, where 68% of irrigation water applied contributed to DP. Field 2's total DP was 1249 mm, where 81% of irrigation water applied contributed to DP.

The last three fire seasons worldwide, dotted by extreme fire behavior and megafire events, highlighted the need for a shifting mentality towards a novel and integrated fire management framework, flexible, adaptive, and responsive to the changing environmental and societal conditions. In this context, the pandemic outbreak added other elements of concern due to its impacts on fire management. The health crisis shined also a spotlight on the government's capacity to manage interconnected risks and anticipatory risk management and the urgent need to change the dominating paradigm in fire policy and management. Based on the review of several proposed approaches framing the impelling fire management perspectives, from the socio-ecological systems to the fire resilience concepts, here we provide a new systemic fire management framework. The approach integrates the multiple perspectives in fire management (multi-level, multi-actor, cross-sectoral and multi-purpose) in four pillars: (i) disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation connection; (ii) community engagement support; (iii) adaptive management towards system resilience; (iv) and adaptive governance. The approach aims to contribute to go beyond the short term and sectoral governance toward a more sustainable long term perspective, promoting a multifunctional, fire-resistant, and resilient mosaic landscape based on sustainable development processes.","[Bacciu, Valentina; Sirca, Costantino; Spano, Donatella] Fdn Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, IAFES Div, Via De Nicola 9, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Bacciu, Valentina] CNR, Inst BioEcon CNR IBE, Traversa La Crucca 3, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Sirca, Costantino; Spano, Donatella] Univ Sassari, Dipartimento Agr, Viale Italia 39, I-07100 Sassari, Italy",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); University of Sassari,"Bacciu, V (corresponding author), Fdn Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, IAFES Div, Via De Nicola 9, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",valentina.bacciu@cmcc.it,,,,,,,103,3,3,3,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Recent literature explores the link between geographical proximity and the adoption and diffusion of climate change adaptation policies. However, it has generally focused on a restricted set of developed countries and focused on the diffusion of policy instrument rather than the outcome of the policies. In this paper, we argue that domestic intensity of adoption of renewable energy technologies is likely to be affected by the adoption pattern in neighbouring countries. Additionally, this effect is likely to be stronger when important trade partners are intensive adopters of renewable energies. To test these hypotheses, we construct an index that captures a distance-weighted measure of intensity of renewable energies in other countries and apply a fixed effects framework to a panel of up to 116 countries over the (1980-2012) period. Our results confirm the existence of a geographic spill-over effect on the intensity of adoption of renewable energy technologies. Moreover, this effect is stronger when intensive adopters of renewable energies are also important trading partners, highlighting the relevance of trade channel as a potential catalyst of the diffusion of renewable energies across countries.","[Fadly, Dalia] Philipps Univ Marburg, Ctr Near & Middle Eastern Studies CNMS, Deutschhausstr 12, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Fadly, Dalia] Cairo Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Cairo, Egypt; [Fontes, Francisco] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Agr Dev Econ Div ESA, Policy Analyst Monitoring & Analyzing Food & Agr, Rome, Italy; [Fontes, Francisco] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England",Philipps University Marburg; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Fadly, D (corresponding author), Philipps Univ Marburg, Ctr Near & Middle Eastern Studies CNMS, Deutschhausstr 12, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.",dalia.fadly@staff.uni-marburg.de; francisco.pereirafontes@fao.org,,"Fadly, Dalia/0000-0003-1052-8100",U.K. Economics and Social Research Council (ESRC),U.K. Economics and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors would like to thank participants at the European Association for Environmental and Resource Economists conference, Athens, June 2017 for their useful comments and suggestions on earlier version of the paper.

In this connection, this paper also investigates based on published knowledge and the perceptions of stakeholders the awareness of nature conservation measures as climate-change adaptation and possibly ways of improvement. In order to address these issues, additionally to an in-depth literature review, 16 experts working in Vienna in the field of either nature conservation or climate protection were interviewed. The transcriptions of these interviews were then used in a qualitative content analysis. The findings show that the vast majority of the interviewed stakeholders see EU climate policy and nature conservation policy separately. Further-more, the implementation of EU climate and nature conservation policy in Vienna is indicated as a learning by doing process. There the currently limited cooperation between stakeholders can be improved. Our study also finds that the awareness of different stakeholder groups of the possibility to use nature conservation as a measure against climate change is limited. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Billions in ODA have been allocated to fisheries to support nutrition and livelihoods worldwide. Yet, from 2010 to 2015, fisheries allocations decreased by > 30%, while grants for non-fisheries sectors increased by > 13%. Globally, grants for climate change adaptation and mitigation fell for fisheries, while rapidly increasing in sectors like agriculture and forestry. In Oceania, a region highly dependent on fisheries for food security and particularly vulnerable to climate change, disbursements fell by 44%. Grants for fisheries research, education and training fell in absolute numbers, and as a proportion of total ODA to fisheries. These findings are out of alignment with recent international commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (2015), The Future We Want (2012), and relevant Aichi Targets (2010). Risk aversion among donors; redirection of climate finance into other sectors; and allocation decisions based on factors unrelated to fisheries are identified as contributing to observed findings. Increasing the volume of fisheries-related ODA and better aligning it with international commitments could bring substantial co-benefits and contribute to the sustainable use of marine ecosystems, support sustainable trade and economic opportunities, increase adaptive capacity, and foster human well-being.","[Blasiak, Robert] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, S-11418 Stockholm, Sweden; [Blasiak, Robert] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Wabnitz, Colette C.

This paper examines the depoliticisation of climate change adaptation in Kenya, a country which has been recently praised as a developing country with a progressive adaptation policy. Using examples from fieldwork in Kenya, it focusses on Kenya's recently adopted National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS), and argues that Kenya's adaptation discourse is driven by particular imaginaries, specifically: adaptation as a 'universal apocalypse', and adaptation as a technical-economic problem. These function as deliberate anti-political strategies, aimed at obscuring the highly charged realities of adaptation. For Kenya's current political elite adaptation is predominantly a matter of reducing the perceived risks to economic growth, and enhancing opportunities to gain revenue from international funding sources. This is achieved through a discursive construction of a particular vision of adaptation, and against a backdrop of a capitalist strategy for growth. The paper concludes that a critical and political interpretation of the NCCRS and similar adaptation strategies is necessary to keep equity and justice at the centre of the climate debate, and to dispel the myth of adaptation policy making as a rational and disinterested process.","Univ Edinburgh, Inst Geog, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Symons, K (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Geog, Drummond St, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland.",k.symons@sms.ed.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,11,11,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1470-2541,1751-665X,,SCOT GEOGR J,Scott.

The case studies reveal important lessons about how local context shapes the process of adaptation; in these cases, adaptation to rising and changing water demand under a regime of increasingly limited supply in a semi-arid region. Both case studies represent examples of water meter implementation, specifically volume-based pricing in a residential area and as a compliance tool in a mainly farming district. While the initiative was successful in the residential setting, agricultural metering met with stiff resistance. These cases suggest many factors shape the character of the adaptation process, including: interpretation of the signal relative to context, newness of the approach, consumer values, and local and provincial political agendas. Although context has been explored in resource management circles, thus far climate change adaptation research has not adequately discussed the embeddedness of adaptation. In other words, how context matters and what aspects of context, unrelated to climate change, could encourage or thwart the act of adapting. This study is a simple illustration of the potential drivers, barriers and enabling factors that have influenced the adaptation process of water management decisions in the Okanagan.","Univ British Columbia, Sustainable Dev Res Initat, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada; Univ Oxford, Said Bus Sch, James Martin Inst Sci & Civilizat, Oxford OX1 1HP, England",University of British Columbia; University of Oxford,"Shepherd, P (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Sustainable Dev Res Initat, 1924 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",,,,,,,,33,21,21,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Previous studies often used PNV patterns as a reference; however, they ignored PNV ecological functions, impeding the establishment of function-oriented vegetation protection and restoration plans. To address this issue, this study used Loess Plateau of China as a case study to propose an ecological function-oriented vegetation protection and restoration framework based on PNV patterns and ecological functions. The results showed that PNV patterns, ecological functions, and their synergistic and trade-off relationships represented distinct spatial differences that would be largely influenced by climate change. This suggested that vegetation protection and restoration should be adapted to climate change. The protection and potential restoration regions for actual forest and grass were detected based on the stable PNV regions. Approximately 34.5%-41.4% of actual forest and 81.2%-82.3% of actual grass should be protected. Further, 13.9%-16.2% of actual forest and 14.7%-15.2% of actual grass have the potential to be restored to grass and forest, respectively, and lastly, the priority regions of forest and grass protection and potential restoration were determined according to a composite ecological functions index. Moreover, forest protection should be prioritized, followed by forest potential restoration, grass potential restoration, and grass protection. These results would be conducive to forest and grass protection and restoration of the Loess Plateau. The proposed framework is applicable to other regions of the world for developing vegetation protection and restoration strategies.","[Han, Qinggong; Zhang, Jishen; Shi, Xinjie; Zhou, Daquan] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Ding, Yongxia] Baoji Univ Arts & Sci, Coll Geog & Environm, Shaanxi Key Lab Disasters Monitoring & Mech Simula, Baoji 721013, Peoples R China; [Peng, Shouzhang] Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess Pl, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Peng, Shouzhang] Inst Soil & Water Conservat, 26 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Northwest A&F University - China; Baoji University of Arts & Sciences; Northwest A&F University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS","Peng, SZ (corresponding author), Inst Soil & Water Conservat, 26 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",szp@nwafu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Key R & D project of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province;  [42077451];  [2020BCF01001];  [2020JQ-418],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key R & D project of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province); ; ; ,"Acknowledgements This work was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42077451) , Key R & D project of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Grant (2020BCF01001) , and Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province (2020JQ-418) .

China has implemented a series of strategies, measures and actions to cope with climate change, which has promoted industrial transformation and human resource adjustment in China's state-owned forest areas. However, little is known about the role of current human resource allocation in adaptation to climate change in the state-owned forest farm of China. To address these gaps, this study calculated the current situation of human resource structure and the contribution rate of three industries to the allocation of human resources and the evaluation model of coordinated fitness to the climate changes in key state-owned forest farms. The results show that: (1) The current situation of talent in key state-owned forest areas shows a shortage of total amount, a shortage of high-level and highly educated talents, and aging of talents. (2) The coefficient of structural deviation increased and the coefficient of structural-change synergy kept decreasing, indicating that the coordination between human resource allocation and industrial structure in key state-owned forest areas nowadays is only at the intermediate level of synergistic fitness. The paper highlights the trained-professional human resource and the industrial structure changes in the context of climate change as the main limited factors for the key state-owned forest farms of China. Increasing the education investment for climate change and the economic income for the employees are suggested to be promoted for policy makers in future.","[Deng, Xiaofang; Li, Junkui; Su, Lijuan; Zhao, Shan] Natl Acad Forestry & Grassland Adm China, Beijing 102600, Peoples R China; [Jin, Shaofei] Minjiang Univ, Dept Geog, Fuzhou 350108, Peoples R China",Minjiang University,"Li, JK (corresponding author), Natl Acad Forestry & Grassland Adm China, Beijing 102600, Peoples R China.;Jin, SF (corresponding author), Minjiang Univ, Dept Geog, Fuzhou 350108, Peoples R China.",lgyxshqk@163.com; jinsf@tea.ac.cn,,,"Minjiang University [32304307]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China [2022J011140]; Project of Central Leading Local Fujian Mental Health Human-Computer Interaction Technology Research Center [2020L3024]","Minjiang University; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); Project of Central Leading Local Fujian Mental Health Human-Computer Interaction Technology Research Center","This research was funded by the start-up funding of Minjiang University (32304307), the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China (Grant No. 2022J011140), and Project of Central Leading Local Fujian Mental Health Human-Computer Interaction Technology Research Center (2020L3024).",,35,2,2,5,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2022,14,15,,,,,,,9667,10.3390/su14159667,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14159667,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,3R8LQ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000839158000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ocean-based mitigation actions could contribute 12% of the emissions reductions required by 2030 to keep warming to less than 1.5 oC but, because substantial warming is already locked in, extensive adaptation action is also needed. Here, as part of the Future Seas project, we use a foresighting/hindcasting technique to describe two scenarios for 2030 in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation for ocean systems. The business-as-usual future is expected if current trends continue, while an alternative future could be realised if society were to effectively use available data and knowledge to push as far as possible towards achieving the UN SDGs. We identify three drivers that differentiate between these alternative futures: (i) appetite for climate action, (ii) handling extreme events, and (iii) climate interventions. Actions that could navigate towards the optimistic, sustainable and technically achievable future include: proactive creation and enhancement of economic incentives for mitigation and adaptation; supporting the proliferation of local initiatives to spur a global transformation; enhancing proactive coastal adaptation management; investing in research to support adaptation to emerging risks; deploying marine-based renewable energy; deploying marine-based negative emissions technologies; developing and assessing solar radiation management approaches; and deploying appropriate solar radiation management approaches to help safeguard critical ecosystems.","[Trebilco, Rowan; Hobday, Alistair J.; Melbourne-Thomas, Jess] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Trebilco, Rowan; Fleming, Aysha; Hobday, Alistair J.; Melbourne-Thomas, Jess; McDonald, Jan; McCormack, Phillipa C.; Bax, Narissa; Corney, Stuart P.; Dutra, Leo X.

However, and despite the actual growing of environment-related social movements, a kind of inertia still prevails in the social climate of our society. The media should play a key role in promoting, among common individuals, the adoption of new and more sustainable practices. However, it is argued that the media seems to be failing to effectively address the climate crisis. As such, this study aims to identify the main weaknesses of climate change media communication to further discuss possible opportunities of communication improvements. For that, 1609 news articles published between 2017 and 2018 in five European countries were analyzed in-depth, through quantitative content analysis. The news' general characteristics, specifically reported themes, and the specificities of actors' discourses were taken into account for the analysis. It was verified that the European media tends to report climate change by using distant (e.g., future-focused) and outcome (e.g., threatening messages) framings, based on non-resilient, scientific, and political narratives, whilst overlooking the role of civil society on adapting to climate change. These results demonstrate that instead of promoting society's climate action, the media may be contributing to a widespread social apathy about the climate and the disengagement of individuals regarding environment-related matters. Evidence-based forms of improving the media's communication on climate change will be further discussed.","[Tavares, Alexandre O.] Univ Coimbra, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Earth Sci, Ctr Social Studies, P-3030790 Coimbra, Portugal; [Areia, Neide P.] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies, Colegio S Jeronimo, Apartado 3087, P-3000995 Coimbra, Portugal; [Mellett, Sinead] Athlone Inst Technol, Biosci Res Inst, Dublin Rd, Athlone N37 HD68, Westmeath, Ireland; [James, Julia; Berthoumieu, Jean-Francois] Assoc Climatol Moyenne Garonne, F-47310 Estillac, France; [Intrigliolo, Diego S.] Ctr Edafol & Biol Aplicada Segura CEBAS CSIC, Dept Riego, Campus Univ Espinardo,POB 164, Murcia 30100, Spain; [Couldrick, Laurence B.] Westcountry Rivers Trust, Rain Charm House,Kyl Cober Parc, Stoke Climsland PL17 8PY, Cornwall, England",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra; Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro de Edafologia y Biologia Aplicada del Segura (CEBAS); University of Murcia,"Areia, NP (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies, Colegio S Jeronimo, Apartado 3087, P-3000995 Coimbra, Portugal.",atavares@ci.uc.pt; neideareia@ces.uc.pt; smellett@ait.ie; juliajames.riskaquasoil@orange.fr; dintri@cebas.csic.es; laurence@wrt.org.uk; acmg@acmg.asso.fr,"; Tavares, Alexandre/M-4168-2014","James, Julia/0000-0002-1985-2348; Mellett, Sinead/0000-0002-3498-981X; Couldrick, Laurence/0000-0002-0385-1914; Tavares, Alexandre/0000-0003-1621-6183; Areia, Neide/0000-0002-5636-4562",project Risk-AquaSoil -Atlantic Risk Management Plan in water and soil - European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the INTERREG Atlantic Area Programme [EAPA_272/2016],project Risk-AquaSoil -Atlantic Risk Management Plan in water and soil - European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the INTERREG Atlantic Area Programme,"This study is part of the project Risk-AquaSoil -Atlantic Risk Management Plan in water and soil, co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the INTERREG Atlantic Area Programme, reference EAPA_272/2016.",,44,4,5,9,26,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2020,12,20,,,,,,,8300,10.3390/su12208300,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12208300,,,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OI1TH,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000583069400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For Uruguay, studying the vulnerability and adaptive responses of vineyards to climate change and climate variability is relevant due to its winegrowing region's economic importance and cultural heritage. Winegrowers and technical advisors were interviewed to evaluate their perceptions of climate change, vulnerability of their vineyards and how to adapt them. The main results showed that winegrowers had a clear perception of annual climate variability. The respondents highlighted the extreme climate events that had occurred over the previous few years and 71% of them believed that they had increased in frequency. Despite the perception of increase in climate variability in the region, they did not associate it with climate change. Overall, 43% of respondents agreed that changes in certain viticulture practices in recent years could have been due to climate change, especially those related to the preventive use of pesticides. The respondents identified climate risks that resulted in bad years for yield and quality (increase in extreme events (e.g., storms, hail), decrease in cold units in winter (i.e., temperatures <0 degrees C), increase in hot hours (i.e., >35 degrees C), increase in precipitation during the growing season and ripening period) as well as their impacts on vineyards. An adaptation matrix was developed from the viticulture practices that the winegrowers used in response to climate variability. Medium- and long-term adaptive responses to climate change can be based on the knowledge of winegrowers and their advisors.","[Fourment, Mercedes; Ferrer, Milka] Univ Republ Oriental Uruguay, Fac Agron, Av E Garzon 780, Montevideo 12900, Uruguay; [Barbeau, Gerard] UVV INRA Angers, 42 Rue Georges Morel, F-49071 Beaucouze, France; [Quenol, Herve] Univ Rennes 2, UMR6554 LETG CNRS, Pl Recteur Henri le Moal, F-35043 Rennes, France","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; INRAE; Universite de Rennes; Universite Rennes 2","Fourment, M (corresponding author), Univ Republ Oriental Uruguay, Fac Agron, Av E Garzon 780, Montevideo 12900, Uruguay.",mfourment@fagro.edu.uy,"Quenol, Herve/O-7939-2014","Quenol, Herve/0000-0002-5562-2232; Fourment, Mercedes/0000-0003-0288-0737",Postgraduate Academic Commission of the University of the Republic (2012-2014); National Agency for Investigation and Innovation doctoral scholarships [POS_NAC_2014_1_102864],Postgraduate Academic Commission of the University of the Republic (2012-2014); National Agency for Investigation and Innovation doctoral scholarships,"The authors gratefully thank each of the winegrowers and advisors that participated in the interviews, for giving their selfless opinion, their experience and valuable time.

Synthesizing the recent findings in this field helps advance landscape ecology and sustainability science in the face of climate change. Objectives To review and synthesize mesoscale modeling-based studies examining the impact of LUCC on climate, and to identify research gaps and future research directions. Methods We adopted a systematic review procedure to identify and analyze relevant literature obtained from the Web of Science spanning Jan 1990-Nov 2018. Results The number of publications per year increased from about 5 before 2008 to as large as 25 thereafter. About 60% of the case studies were focused on China and the US. Urbanization and agricultural development exerted a stronger influence on temperature than other LUCC modifications, with temperature changes generally between 1 and 2 degrees C. The climate effect of forest loss and urbanization illustrated location-dependency, as similar landscape changes in different latitudes showed climate effects of opposite sign. Extensive irrigation and dam construction increased precipitation, while the impact of urbanization and forest cover change on precipitation was inconclusive (positive, neutral, and negative). Conclusions Understanding landscape and climate change interactions is essential for studying the ecology and sustainability of regional landscapes. Future research needs to: (1) understand climate effects resulting from land management change, (2) investigate climate change impacts on human health as induced or mediated by landscape changes, and (3) develop sustainable landscapes that can mitigate and adapt to climate change.","[Cao, Qian] Shandong Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Ecol & Biodivers, Qingdao 266237, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yupeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Urban Environm, Key Lab Urban Environm & Hlth, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yupeng] Xiamen Key Lab Urban Metab, Xiamen 361021, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Georgescu, Matei] Arizona State Univ, Urban Climate Res Ctr, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Wu, Jianguo] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Wu, Jianguo] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Wu, Jianguo] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Processes & Resource, CHESS, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China","Shandong University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Urban Environment, CAS; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Beijing Normal University","Liu, YP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Urban Environm, Key Lab Urban Environm & Hlth, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China.",ypliu@iue.ac.cn,"CAS, KLUEH/T-5743-2019; Wu, Jianguo/G-6267-2010","Wu, Jianguo/0000-0002-1182-3024; Liu, Yupeng/0000-0003-4050-2868; Cao, Qian/0000-0002-0580-7407","Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology through the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41801179, 41801222]; National Basic Research Program of China [2014CB954303]; NSF Sustainability Research Network [1444758]; Urban Water Innovation Network; NSF [SES-1520803]",Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology through the National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); NSF Sustainability Research Network; Urban Water Innovation Network; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This study was jointly supported by the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology through the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41801179 and 41801222) and the National Basic Research Program of China (2014CB954303).

Measures to address climate change include both mitigation to reduce emissions and adaptation to climate change impacts. Prior to the Paris Conference of Parties 21 in 2015, few low-income countries had made extensive progress on either mitigation or adaptation. Ethiopia's Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) policy, introduced in 2011, stands out as an unusual example in its scope to reduce future emissions while also promoting adaptation through economic development. The formation of Ethiopia's CRGE between 2011 and 2014 demonstrates how a low-income country can rapidly develop a comprehensive policy for climate change using green growth. A case from the Rift Valley, however, illuminates the challenges facing government efforts to have its climate policy reach its predominantly rural population. Using multiple methods of key informant interviews, analysis of policy documents, and survey data collected during three years of study, 2012-2014, the data suggest a confluence of factors contributed to the design and emergence of Ethiopia's climate policy, notably Ethiopia's institutional autonomy and capacity. Despite being at the global forefront of climate policy for low-income countries, the reach of the Ethiopian state to implement programmes in the rural sector remains limited. Ultimately, Ethiopia is a bellwether for the combined mitigation and adaptation policy responses needed in many low-income countries to promote sustainable development in the face of climate change.","[Paul, Christopher John] North Carolina Cent Univ, Publ Adm, Durham, NC 27707 USA; [Weinthal, Erika] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA",University of North Carolina; North Carolina Central University; Duke University,"Paul, CJ (corresponding author), North Carolina Cent Univ, Publ Adm, Durham, NC 27707 USA.",cpaul5@nccu.edu,,"Paul, Christopher/0000-0001-6096-044X",United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Conflict Management and Mitigation grant [AID-OAA-A-12-00068]; American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID),United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Conflict Management and Mitigation grant(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),This paper was completed with support from a United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Conflict Management and Mitigation grant (#AID-OAA-A-12-00068).

Stop or even reverse these trends represents as much unavoidable solutions for enhancing concrete long-term adaptation to climate change, whatever the end-century warming scenario. Using the case study of Reunion Island (Indian Ocean), we emphasize four major drivers of the recent coastal trajectory of vulnerability, i.e. changes in human-built assets, shoreline position, natural buffers' characteristics, and the extent of coastal protection structures. Together, these drivers highlight the need for controlling the urbanisation process to reduce the anthropogenic pressures exerted on morphological-ecological systems, restoring the buffering function of the latter, and moving towards a less hard structure-dependent coastal defence strategy. Such a shift in coastal management however supposes some radical changes in the way coastal development strategies consider environmental issues (hazards, resources and services). Here we bring empirical material showing that neither Reunion Island decision-makers are keen to drive such radical changes, nor the population is ready to accept potentially constraining policies that will have benefits only in the future. We conclude on the need for further advancing the design of adaptation pathways that build on the implementation of context-specific unavoidable solutions, and thus that seriously consider limiting the risk of maladaptation as a baseline strategy.","[Magnan, Alexandre K.] Sci Po, Inst Sustainable Dev & Int Relat, 27 Rue St Guillaume, F-75007 Paris, France; [Magnan, Alexandre K.; Duvat, Virginie K.

This study explored the role of crop diversity in farmers' adaptation actions in eight Aymara communities on the northern Bolivian Altiplano. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, including multifactor analysis and a community resilience self-assessment, we investigated how farmers' use of diversity in adaptation is related to their perceptions of crop and variety tolerances and other environmental, social, and economic factors. Few crops and varieties were perceived as tolerant to increasingly intense and unpredictable drought, frost, hail, and pest and disease outbreaks. Some local crops and varieties were perceived as vulnerable to emerging conditions (e.g. oca, papalisa, isao), whereas bitter potatoes and wild relatives of quinoa and caahua were perceived as highly stress tolerant and provide food in harsh periods. A total 19% of households surveyed (N = 193) had introduced new crops or varieties-often disease resistant or early maturing-as an adaptive action. Introduction of commercial crops was a common adaptation action, reflecting farmers' response to warming temperatures and changing economic opportunities, but greater sensitivity of the introduced crops may cause maladaptation. Despite intensification of cropping systems, households continue to maintain a median four potato varieties with different tolerance traits, yet this risk management practice was not perceived as adaptation. Strengthening resilience will require a combination of actions, including maintaining and expanding crop portfolios and restoring soil and ecosystem health, using both traditional and innovative approaches.","[Meldrum, Gennifer; Gruberg, Helga; Padulosi, Stefano] Biovers Int, Via Tre Denari 472-A, I-00054 Maccarese, Fiumicino, Italy; [Mijatovic, Dunja; Gruberg, Helga] Platform Agrobiodivers Res, Via Tre Denari 472-A, I-00054 Maccarese, Fiumicino, Italy; [Rojas, Wilfredo; Flores, Juana; Pinto, Milton] Fdn PROINPA, Calle Americo Vespucio 538,Piso 3, La Paz, Bolivia; [Mamani, Grover] CARE, Pasaje Jauregui 2248, La Paz, Bolivia; [Condori, Eleuterio] Comunidad Corpa, Cetha Tupac Katari, La Paz, Bolivia; [Hilaquita, David] Samaritans Purse, Calle 17 Monsenor Felipe Lopez 8190, La Paz, Bolivia",Alliance; Bioversity International,"Meldrum, G (corresponding author), Biovers Int, Via Tre Denari 472-A, I-00054 Maccarese, Fiumicino, Italy.",g.meldrum@cgiar.org,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Gruberg, Helga/P-6316-2017","Gruberg, Helga/0000-0003-1723-6549",International Fund for Agricultural Development; CGIAR Research Programme on Climate Change Agriculture and Food Security; Christensen Fund,International Fund for Agricultural Development; CGIAR Research Programme on Climate Change Agriculture and Food Security(CGIAR); Christensen Fund,"The authors are grateful for the farmers' time and participation in the household surveys and focus groups in the eight study communities.

However, the cost of these efforts can have important implications for budgets that already face pressures from diverse areas such as unfunded pensions and growing health care costs. In this work, the current level of spending on climate-related activities at the state level are evaluated and policy recommendations are developed to improve financial management practices as they relate to climate risk. An examination of state budgets reveals that climate mitigation and adaptation activities represent less than 1% of spending in most states. The data collection highlights the obstacles to collecting accurate spending data and the lack of budgetary and accounting procedures in place. More importantly, the difficulty in benchmarking these activities poses challenges for the analysis of state-level policies as well as planning and modelling future climate-related spending. Other policy contexts, including public pensions and infrastructure, can provide guidance on budgetary and accounting tools that may help states prepare for and more efficiently manage climate-related expenditures.Key policy insights Climate change mitigation and adaptation will require substantial investments across many levels of government on a wide range of activities.Currently, US states are not clearly demarcating climate expenditures, hindering the identification of climate-related budgetary risks.In the absence of guidelines, these longer term fiscal outlays may remain chronically underfunded in favour of more near-term spending priorities.Establishing appropriate financial management and data collection practices is important for more sophisticated cost-effectiveness and policy analyses.","[Gilmore, Elisabeth A.] Clark Univ, Dept Int Dev Community & Environm, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [St Clair, Travis] Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Clark University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Gilmore, EA (corresponding author), Clark Univ, Dept Int Dev Community & Environm, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",gilmore@clarku.edu,"Gilmore, Elisabeth/HLQ-7712-2023",,School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland,School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland,We thank the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland for the funding that supported the research assistance for this effort.,,44,13,13,6,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Second, the study investigates the impact of the perception of climatic stress on the operators' and spouses' intra-household adaptation strategies (farm and household financial strategies). Design/methodology/approach - The study uses household survey data from Vietnam's Mekong Delta. The study uses probit and negative binomial count data approaches to evaluate the empirical model. Findings - Results confirm the existence of intra-household gender differences in the adaptation strategies. The authors found that although spouses perceive climatic stress, they are less likely to adapt to such stresses when it comes farming enterprise, but more likely to adapt to household financial strategies. In contrast, farm operators, in the presence of climatic stresses, undertake both farm and household finance adaptation strategies. Practical implications - Investment in climate smart agriculture can help households in managing climatic stresses. Originality/value - A farmer in Asia, and Vietnam in particular, faces significant risks from climatic changes. In Vietnam, agriculture is easily affected by natural disasters and climatic changes. This study provides insights into the perception of climatic changes by operators and spouses in Vietnam's Mekong Delta. Perceived changes in the climate have a greater impact on women because they typically lack the necessary tools to adapt to climate change. The current findings could be useful in managing climatic risk in Vietnam's Mekong Delta and be helpful to policymakers in designing risk management strategies in response to climatic changes.","[Mishra, Ashok K.] Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, WP Carey Sch Business, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA; [Pede, Valerian O.] Int Rice Res Inst, Social Sci Div, Manila, Philippines",Arizona State University; CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI),"Mishra, AK (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, WP Carey Sch Business, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA.",Ashok.k.mishra@asu.edu,,,Kemper and Ethel Marley Foundation,Kemper and Ethel Marley Foundation,"This work was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.

Supporting policy interventions have been put forward at European and national levels to support innovation and development of bio-based products and services. This study asks whether suggested policy interventions reflect the needs of stakeholders and examines how these needs vary between European regions. This consultation was performed through an online survey of 447 experts actively involved in bio-based research, industry, and governance across Europe. The majority of responses received were from stakeholders in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK which are examined in greater depth. Climate change was clearly an important driver for bio-based innovation as 86% of the respondents considered climate change to be a significant threat. There were clear differences between regions but also areas of consensus between stakeholders across the European regions surveyed. In particular there was consensus regarding the need for improved access to financial support and the need to ensure continuity of policy. The need to build investor confidence through demonstration of bio-based technologies, the provision of greater clarity regarding best conversion routes for specific feedstocks, and the need to promote a culture of industrial symbiosis were also regarded as important interventions.

Design/methodology/approach - Six focus groups explored consumer responses to measures to intended to mitigate the emissions from, and adapt to the impacts of climate change. These included: meat reduction, greater reliance on seasonal British food, meal replacement tablets, laboratory grown meat, communal eating houses, genetically modified food and food waste. Practice theory provided the lens to interpret the changes to meanings, competences and materials associated with food consumption. Findings - Changes that could be assimilated within existing competencies were viewed more positively, with lack of competence a key barrier to accommodating change. At present, climate change and sustainability do not influence purchasing decisions. Policy measures delivering multiple benefits (win-wins), of which environmental performance may be one, stand an improved chance of establishing more sustainable practices than those focusing exclusively on environmental drivers. Originality/value - Awareness of the role of sustainable food systems in the context of anthropogenic climate change is growing. Whilst scientific and technological research explores methods for reducing emissions and building resilience in food supply chains to changes in climate, there is comparatively little study of how consumers perceive these proposed solutions.

From these deposits, two different sedimentary sequences have been identified, with.(i) a first sedimentation stage characteristic of an obstructed valley controlled by contrasted seasonal flows during a dryer and cooler climate than at present, and (ii) on top of this unit a more recent sequence of alluvial terraces that were emplaced during a wetter and warmer context allowing the development and stabilisation of the rainforest. Palynological data and their comparison with a database at the East African regional scale have proven that the first rapid sedimentation stage started around 40,000 BP and might have ended abruptly around 14,000 BP. This process has been then followed by a natural embanking stage of the alluvial corridor. These different terraces have been dated thanks to a series of proxies: the discovery of a Stenoece animal remains in the upper part of a terrace confirmed the palaeo-origin of the sequence; a bone harpoon with typical manufacturing characteristics that indicated a human settlement around 9,000 BP on another terrace; and the tufa deposits provided a maximum age for the terraces below 7,000 years. This multi-proxy approach, therefore, provides an interesting series of benchmarks for the development of the palaeoenvironment in Northern Rwanda and is of high importance for the reconstruction of the river bio-geomorphological adaptation to climatic changes.","[Wassmer, Patrick] Univ Paris 01, CNRS, UMR 8591, PRES HESAM,Lab Geog Phys, F-92195 Meudon, France; [Wassmer, Patrick] Univ Strasbourg, Fac Geog & Amenagement, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; [Schwartz, Dominique] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, LIVE, UMR 7362, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; [Gomez, Christopher] Univ Canterbury, Coll Sci, Dept Geog, Nat Hazards Res Ctr, Canterbury, New Zealand; [Ward, Stephen] Univ Canterbury, Coll Sci, Dept Geog, Canterbury, New Zealand; [Barrere, Pierre] Univ Michel Montaigne, Inst Geog Louis Papy, Bordeaux 3, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; University of Canterbury; University of Canterbury; Universite Bordeaux-Montaigne,"Wassmer, P (corresponding author), Univ Paris 01, CNRS, UMR 8591, PRES HESAM,Lab Geog Phys, 1 Pl Aristide Briand, F-92195 Meudon, France.",wassmerpat@aol.com,"Gomez, Christopher/Q-8402-2019","Gomez, Christopher/0000-0002-1738-2434",,,,,31,2,2,0,4,COMITATO GLACIOLOGICO ITALIANO,TORINO,"VIA VALPERGA CALUSO 35, TORINO, 10125, ITALY",0391-9838,,,GEOGR FIS DIN QUAT,Geogr.

It potentially the biggest global health threat of the 21(st) century.(1) It is predicted to have wide-ranging impacts upon human mental health and well-being, through changes and challenges to people's environment, socioeconomic structures and physical security. Even the most conservative estimates of the health impacts are extremely alarming. Increasingly, the causes of poor human health and environmental damage are related. This implies that there are common solutions. For example, there are co-benefits to human health and biodiversity from mitigating and adapting to climate change (e.g. promoting active transport and reducing car use reduces CO(2) emissions, benefits our environment and reduces morbidity and mortality associated with a sedentary lifestyle). This article outlines how climate change impacts upon mental health and well-being. It introduces ecological concepts, applies these to public health and outlines their implications in transforming the way that we prioritize and deliver public health in order to promote both environmental and human health. Evidence, from psychology and neuroscience, suggests that the perception of being disconnected from our inner selves, from each other and from our environment has contributed to poor mental and physical health. We argue that we must transform the way we understand mental health and well-being and integrate it into action against climate change.

However, climatological changes can result in sudden shifts in these important ecosystems. For example, marked increases in precipitation in the last few decades have resulted in a widespread shift in wetlands across the Prairie Pothole Region to a new ecohydrological state. We used multiproxy analyses (diatom community composition and invertebrate stable isotopes) of Pb-210-dated sediment cores from two adjacent, but morphologically and hydrologically different, prairie-pothole wetlands to assess the effects of hydroclimatic variability on these wetland ecosystems. Our results provide evidence that the recent ecohydrological shift in the region's wetlands is unprecedented over the past ca. 178 yr. Oxygen stable isotopes in chironomid head capsules provide a record of paleohydrology changes. The most recent sediments (i.e., those deposited after the state shift) from both wetlands revealed novel changes in diatom communities that differed greatly from earlier community compositions. In addition, a depleted signal in deuterium and C-13 carbon stable isotopes observed in chironomid head capsules and Daphnia ephippia, respectively, after 1993 is likely related to an increase in methane production in these wetlands. Our study highlights the importance of considering basin morphometry including whether a wetland has an overflow point, and multiple biological indicators to study climate-change influences on freshwater ecosystems. Research using these techniques can lead to an improved understanding of recent ecosystem shifts, an understanding that will be essential for future climate-change adaptation and mitigation in this ecologically important region.","[Hu, Kui; Sweetman, Jon N.] North Dakota State Univ, Dept Biol Sci & Environm, Fargo, ND 58105 USA; [Hu, Kui; Sweetman, Jon N.] North Dakota State Univ, Conservat Sci Program, Fargo, ND 58105 USA; [Mushet, David M.] US Geol Survey, Northern Prairie Wildlife Res Ctr, Jamestown, ND USA; [Sweetman, Jon N.] Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo; North Dakota State University Fargo; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Hu, K (corresponding author), North Dakota State Univ, Dept Biol Sci & Environm, Fargo, ND 58105 USA.;Hu, K (corresponding author), North Dakota State Univ, Conservat Sci Program, Fargo, ND 58105 USA.",kui.hu@ndsu.edu,,,"U.S. Geological Survey, Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center under the Great Plains Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit Agreement [G16AC00003]; U.S. Geological Survey [G16AP00075]","U.S. Geological Survey, Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center under the Great Plains Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit Agreement; U.S. Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey)","Funding for this research was provided by the U.S. Geological Survey, Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center under the Great Plains Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit Agreement G16AC00003, and U.S. Geological Survey under the Cooperative Agreement No. G16AP00075 for North Dakota Water Resource Research Institution Fellowship.

This is particularly related to the labour market, which may witness significant changes. Empirically, this issue has until now received limited attention. The links between poverty and climate change are explored mainly through the lenses of climate change adaptation, or via the effects of rising energy prices on the purchasing power of poor households. We aim to address this gap by using results from a simulation of the global energy transition required to meet the 2-degree target, and compare this to a 6-degree baseline scenario. The simulation with a multi-regional input-output model finds that, overall, this transition results in a small net job increase of 0.3% globally, with cross-country heterogeneity. We complement this macro-level analysis with cross-country household data to draw implications of the effects on poverty through labour market outcomes. The few job losses will be concentrated in specific industries, while new jobs will be created in industries that currently witness relatively high in-work poverty rates, such as construction. We show that high in-work poverty in the industries of interest, and especially in middle-income countries, is often associated with low skills and an insufficient reach of social protection mechanisms. We conclude that green transitions must ensure that the jobs created are indeed decent including fair wages, adequate working conditions, sufficient social protection measures, and accessible to the vulnerable and poorest households.","[Malerba, Daniele] German Dev Inst, Transformat Econ & Social Syst, Bonn, Germany; [Wiebe, Kirsten S.] SINTEF, Sustainable Energy Technol, Trondheim, Norway",Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE); SINTEF,"Malerba, D (corresponding author), German Dev Inst, Transformat Econ & Social Syst, Bonn, Germany.",daniele.malerba@die-gdi.de,,"Wiebe, Kirsten Svenja/0000-0003-3105-4194","Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), through the Project Wachstum, Umwelt, Ungleichheit: Governance zur Umsetzung der Agenda 2030","Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), through the Project Wachstum, Umwelt, Ungleichheit: Governance zur Umsetzung der Agenda 2030","The work for this paper has benefitted from funding received from the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), through the Project Wachstum, Umwelt, Ungleichheit: Governance zur Umsetzung der Agenda 2030.

Yet there is limited understanding of impacts across U.S. cities, with varying population sizes, and between different climates. This study sought to examine the daily utilization of police and fire department services, during hot days in 23 U.S. cities representing six climate zones using relative risk (RR) and time series analyses of daily police and fire department incidents. The warm season analyses utilized three temperature metrics: daily maximum temperature (T-MAX), daily maximum heat index (HIMAX), and the preceding daily minimum temperature (T-MIN). Across these cities, the RR of police department incidents on days where T-MAX was at or above the 95th percentile significantly increased within a range from 3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3%, 6.3%) to 57% (95% CI: 24.5%, 89.7%), compared with a nonhot day. At the same temperature thresholds, the RR of fire department dispatches increased from 6% (95% CI: 3.0%, 8.6%) to 18% (95% CI: 15.2%, 21.6%). These results remained consistent across temperature metrics and consecutive days of extreme heat. The estimated effects of daily maximum temperature, daily maximum heat index, and daily minimum temperature were nonlinear for police and fire department incidents across all cities. These findings inform climate change adaptation strategies, preparing budgets and personnel for emergency agencies to ensure resilience as periods of extreme heat increase in frequency, severity, and duration.","[Williams, Augusta; McDonogh-Wong, Larissa; Spengler, John D.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Williams, Augusta; McDonogh-Wong, Larissa] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Climate Hlth & Global Environm, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

To authenticate this claim, a survey was conducted in six districts of Bhutan, representing low- , mid- and high-altitude regions of the country from March to May, 2019. Based on the current research, we present farmers' perceptions of climate change and its impacts on agricultural production, including the different coping strategies prevalent in rural communities. The study found that the farmers were well aware of climate change, although perceptions varied among the respondents. For most of the farmers, climate change meant unpredictable weather (79%), less or no rain (70%) and drying of irrigation sources (55%). Some farmers referred to climate change as the emergence of diseases and pests (45%), high-intensity rains (30%), less or no snow (24%) and shorter winter (11%). These climate change impacts were assessed to be responsible for 10-20% crop damages, resulting in crop losses to the tune of 8079-16,159 t and 7202-14,405 t for rice and maize, respectively. This is likely to affect the already low domestic food production of the country. Additionally, the study has successfully captured information on climate change adaptation strategies applied by the farmers. The most commonly observed ones were: the use of plant protection chemicals, improved varieties, increasing frequency of irrigation, land fallowing, off-farm works and improved management practices. Findings such as these are important towards the identification and formulation of an integrated sustainable and climate-proof farming support system.","[Chhogyel, N.; Kumar, L.; Hasan, Md K.] Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; [Chhogyel, N.] Minist Agr & Forests, Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Dept Agr, Wangdue Phodrang, Bhutan; [Bajgai, Y.] Minist Agr & Forests, Natl Potato Program, Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Dept Agr, Thimphu, Bhutan; [Hasan, Md K.] Patuakhali Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Rural Dev, Dumki 8602, Patuakhali, Bangladesh",University of New England,"Chhogyel, N (corresponding author), Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.;Chhogyel, N (corresponding author), Minist Agr & Forests, Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Dept Agr, Wangdue Phodrang, Bhutan.",nchhogye@myune.edu.au,"Hasan, Prof Dr Md Kamrul/U-8711-2019; Bajgai, Yadunath/ABF-4536-2021; hasan, kamrul/HGV-0910-2022; Chhogyel, Ngawang/AAH-8766-2021","Hasan, Prof Dr Md Kamrul/0000-0003-3567-2854; Bajgai, Yadunath/0000-0001-9822-2581; Chhogyel, Ngawang/0000-0002-1735-0651","University of New England, Armidale (NSW) in Australia","University of New England, Armidale (NSW) in Australia","The authors thank the extension officers of the Department of Agriculture, MoAF in Bhutan who were based at Wangdue, Punakha, Paro, Tsirang, Sarpang and Samtse for helping in data collection works.

Can Tho's policymakers are faced with tackling these challenges but lack the necessary tools and funds to properly address the situation. The study aims to develop a set of indicators to assess the degree of climate change vulnerability so that policymakers can determine which of Can Tho's districts are most in need of attention, and then propose the best options for climate change adaptation activities. Design/methodology/approach The indicators, including quantifications of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, were categorized in three tiers, from 1 to 3, to reflect their importance with regard to the situation. The higher tier indicators comprised a number of lower tier indicators, which were developed based on real-life, practical situations at the local level. Findings The results showed that the Thoi Lai District, with a vulnerability indicator estimated at 0.59, is more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change than other districts because of its lower adaptive capacity and higher sensitivity. In contrast, Ninh Kieu District's climate change indicator of 0.24 demonstrates it has higher resilience to climate change impacts. Originality/value This study showed that the set of indicators developed provides a promising approach for supporting local policymakers in Can Tho to actively respond to climate change-related challenges, and that this approach has the potential to be upscaled for other cities in Vietnam.","[Huong Lan Thi Huynh; Trang Minh Dao] Vietnam Inst Meteorol Hydrol & Climate Change, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Anh Tien Do] Vietnam Inst Meteorol Hydrol & Climate Change, Climate Change Res Ctr, Hanoi, Vietnam",,"Huynh, HLT (corresponding author), Vietnam Inst Meteorol Hydrol & Climate Change, Hanoi, Vietnam.",huynhlanhuong@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,12,12,6,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Raw climate model data include systematic biases that affect the CCS of high-impact variables such as daily precipitation and wind speed. This paper presents a novel, general, and extensible analytical theory of the effect of these biases on the CCS of the distribution mean and quantiles. The theory reveals that misrepresented model intensities and probability of nonzero (positive) events have the potential to distort raw model CCS estimates. We test the analytical description in a challenging application of bias correction and downscaling to daily precipitation over alpine terrain, where the output of 15 regional climate models (RCMs) is reduced to local weather stations. The theoretically predicted CCS modification well approximates the modification by the bias correction method, even for the station-RCM combinations with the largest absolute modifications. These results demonstrate that the CCS modification by bias correction is a direct consequence of removing model biases. Therefore, provided that application of intensity-dependent bias correction is scientifically appropriate, the CCS modification should be a desirable effect. The analytical theory can be used as a tool to 1) detect model biases with high potential to distort the CCS and 2) efficiently generate novel, improved CCS datasets. The latter are highly relevant for the development of appropriate climate change adaptation, mitigation, and resilience strategies. Future research needs to focus on developing process-based bias corrections that depend on simulated intensities rather than preserving the raw model CCS.","[Ivanov, Martin Aleksandrov; Luterbacher, Juerg] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Geog Climatol Climate Dynam & Climate Change, Giessen, Germany; [Luterbacher, Juerg] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Ctr Int Dev & Environm Res, Giessen, Germany; [Kotlarski, Sven] Swiss Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol, Zurich, Switzerland",Justus Liebig University Giessen; Justus Liebig University Giessen; Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss),"Ivanov, MA (corresponding author), Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Geog Climatol Climate Dynam & Climate Change, Giessen, Germany.",martin.ivanov@geogr.uni-giessen.de,,"Luterbacher, Juerg/0000-0002-8569-0973; Ivanov, Martin/0000-0002-2816-343X","German Research Foundation [LU 1608/5-2]; Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation SERI [C12.0089]","German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation SERI","The R language and environment for statistical computing (R Core Team 2016) was used to perform the quantile mapping bias correction and to create the figures.

Appropriate coping strategies for smallholder farmers depend on an accurate description of the effects of agro-ecological and farmers' socio-economic factors on climate change. A total of 182 structured questionnaires were administered to determine socio-economic factors affecting smallholder farmers' perceptions of impacts of climate change on beef production in Malawi. Male heads had a higher perception of having increased cattle feed intake and decreased mortality than female heads suggesting that the former had better control and access to animal feed and health resources. Young farmers had a greater perception of experiencing decreases in cattle water supply than adults implying that they lacked experience required to cope with water scarcity. More educated household heads had a higher perception of experiencing decreased tick loads and increased cattle sales than less educated household heads as they are posited to have increased knowledge of parasite control and understanding of market dynamics and expected to make better marketing decisions. High-income farmers had a lower perception of having decreased rangeland biomass and growth rates than low-income farmers indicating that they had capital to acquire resources required to improve rangeland and cattle production. Gender, age, education and income level were the major socio-economic factors that influenced farmers' perceptions of impact of climate change on beef production.

Assisted migration is a climate change adaptation strategy that is associated with risks regarding transfer distance. Thermal time models can provide information about the synchronization of regeneration with seasons and the implications for assisted migration. Climate change may prevent trees from adapting or migrating fast enough to track their climatic envelopes. Assisted migration facilitates gene flow by sourcing pre-adapted provenances usually from southerly regions representative of future climates. The aims were to develop thermal time models for the germination and shoot emergence of two provenances of Quercus robur and to predict the impact of assisted migration on the synchronization of regeneration with seasons. Using cumulative germination (radicle emergence) and shoot emergence data from a laboratory experiment, thermal time models were developed for the seedling emergence of Q. robur. Thermal time parameters were then used with climatic data to predict the timing of germination and shoot emergence for English and Italian provenances in southern England. The thermal time parameters were lower for germination than shoot emergence, resulting in their temporal separation. For Italian acorns, base temperature was lower, but thermal time required was higher for germination and shoot emergence compared to English acorns indicating local adaptation. Predictions suggest little difference in the timing of germination and shoot emergence for the two provenances in the future climate of southern England (2080s). Q. robur has a robust regeneration mechanism where the thermal time parameters constrain germination and shoot emergence to safe windows and thereby ensure synchronization with seasons.","[McCartan, Shelagh A.; Jinks, Richard L.] Ctr Sustainable Forestry & Climate Change, Forest Res, Surrey, England; [Barsoum, Nadia] Ctr Ecosyst Soc & Biosecur, Forest Res, Surrey, England; [McCartan, Shelagh A.] Alice Holt Lodge, Forest Res, Farnham GU10 4LH, Surrey, England",,"McCartan, SA (corresponding author), Alice Holt Lodge, Forest Res, Farnham GU10 4LH, Surrey, England.",shelagh.mccartan@forestry.gsi.gov.uk; richard.jinks@forestry.gsi.gov.uk; nadia.barsoum@forestry.gsi.gov.uk,,,Forestry Commission; European Union [090316 016-FR MULTIFOR]; National Forest Company (NFC),Forestry Commission; European Union(European Commission); National Forest Company (NFC),This project benefitted from matched funding from the Forestry Commission and the European Union (European Regional Development Fund ERDF) within the framework of the European INTERREG IV A 2 Mers Seas Zeeen Cross-border Cooperation Programme 2007-2013 (Project 090316 016-FR MULTIFOR: Management of Multi-Functional Forests) and also funding from the National Forest Company (NFC),,36,11,11,4,35,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

Associations between soil organic C and short-range order minerals like the iron hydroxide ferrihydrite contribute substantially to C sequestration, but little is known about how these associations respond to changes in temperature. We investigated the effects of temperature (7, 25, and 45 degrees C) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) source and fraction on DOM sorption to ferrihydrite-coated sand in continuous flow and batch systems at circumneutral pH. Our findings demonstrate a positive relationship between temperature and adsorption, especially between 25 and 45 degrees C. For aquatic DOM, desorption also increased appreciably with temperature, whereas desorption of peat and soil DOM was less sensitive. More aquatic DOM adsorbed compared with soil DOM at all temperatures, but flow studies revealed that aquatic DOM also desorbed at higher rates. Modeling of DOM breakthrough curves using the advection-diffusion equation with a modified Freundlich isotherm suggested the partition coefficient increased over time. Specific ultraviolet absorbance values of initial column effluents were low, suggesting that aromatic-rich compounds preferentially adsorbed to the mineral surface. Our results indicate that some circumstances may favor the accumulation of DOM on iron mineral surfaces as temperature increases, potentially removing organic substrates from the accessible dissolved C pool.

The various impacts of climate change pose significant risks to Pacific Island communities and people's livelihoods. A community consists of different groups of people and requires contributions from all members to build community resilience to the impacts of climate change. The Indigenous Fijian (iTaukei) women have skills, knowledge, and unique local and traditional experience that can increase the resilience of the community, however, their voice is not often heard in a patriarchal community. An understanding of gender roles in a community is essential for adaptation to climate change. Fijian communities exhibit elaborate social support system and traditional practices that demonstrate high level of dynamism and institutional support in the community's response to risks. Using semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and participant observations, the study investigated the enabling and inhibiting factors that affect the ability of iTaukei women to contribute to building community resilience. The findings from the study identified that the village women contribute significantly to three key areas of community resilience, particularly social resilience, economic resilience and ecological resilience. The findings also indicated that women face barriers that prevent them from contributing to decision-making on issues related to climate change resilience in the community. The study recommends interventions that are culturally accepted and that also support the role of women in decision-making, while promoting their participation in various climate change forums in the community.","[Singh, Priyatma] Univ Fiji, Sch Sci & Technol, Lautoka, Fiji; [Tabe, Tammy; Martin, Tess] Univ South Pacific, Pacific Ctr Environm & Sustainable Dev, Lautoka, Fiji",University of the South Pacific,"Singh, P (corresponding author), Univ Fiji, Saweni, Lautoka, Fiji.",priyatmas@unifiji.ac.fj; tammy.tabe@usp.ac.fj; tesskmartin@gmail.com,,,,,,,63,8,8,11,29,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0277-5395,1879-243X,,WOMEN STUD INT FORUM,Women Stud.

Catastrophe Thresholds from Covid to Climate,SOCIOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR SOCIOLOGICAL DEBATE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Social theory; sociology of risk; critical security studies; resilience; environ-mental security,EARTH SYSTEM; PREPAREDNESS; SECURITY; WORLD,"This article analyses thresholds of catastrophe guiding measures to fight the Covid-19 pan-demic and climate change. It argues that in both cases thresholds express the proposed interaction between the security technologies of prevention and preparedness. Preventive measures are supposed to slow down the infection dynamic and the rise of global tem-peratures, so that strategies of preparedness are able to cope with the remaining adversi-ties: effectively treating patients and successfully adapting to climate change. The trans-gression of the catastrophe threshold thus marks the point when crisis dynamics become uncontrollable. The goal is to prevent the unpreparable and to prepare for the unavoid-able. A moral economy of life underpins this rationality by providing a backstop against an excess of biopolitical elasticity in setting the threshold. The paper contributes to de-bates in security studies and the sociology of risk by showing how prevention and pre-paredness, which are often assumed to be opposing rationalities, come to operate in the same security assemblages. In addition, the paper criticizes the ways in which the focus on the catastrophe threshold silences death and suffering below the threshold and fails to provide guidance for situations when the threshold is already breeched. Considering the advanced state and the peculiar temporality of the climate crisis, the paper analyzes a shift from ???pre??? (preparedeness, prevention) to ???re??? (carbon removal, ecological remediation and reparation) in the contemporary politics of environmental security.","[Folkers, Andreas] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Inst Sociol, Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Folkers, A (corresponding author), Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Inst Sociol, Giessen, Germany.",Andreas.Folkers@sowi.uni-giessen.de,,,,,,,90,2,1,0,0,"UNIV BOLOGNA, DEPT ARTS",Bologna,"Via Zamboni, 33, Bologna, ITALY",,1971-8853,,SOCIOLOGICA,SOCIOLOGICA,,2021,15,3,,,,,85,106,,10.6092/issn.1971-8853/13564,http://dx.doi.org/10.6092/issn.1971-8853/13564,,,22,Sociology,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Sociology,5L4CK,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000870362100007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Numerous benefits of biotechnologies are documented; however, implementation is controversial and continues to face technical, biophysical and societal barriers. The longer history of agricultural biotechnology holds potential lessons for emerging proposals in forestry, and vice versa. Using a systematic review and content analysis of the scholarly literature in agriculture and forestry (235 articles) between 1989 and 2017, we compare these two sectors in terms of justifications for the use of biotechnologies, barriers to and recommendations for implementation, and types of evidence considered. The primary benefit of biotechnologies identified in the agricultural literature is food security, whereas forest productivity and adaptation to climate change are the most common motivating justifications in a forest context. We find a relatively greater emphasis in the forestry lit-erature on regulatory and legal barriers. Both fields emphasize recommendations to address barriers related to lack of knowledge and governance processes despite relatively less emphasis on these items as identified bar-riers. Relatively few (32%) forestry articles were informed by insights from the social sciences and humanities as compared with 51% of those in agriculture. We discuss the implications of anticipated public opposition to tree biotechnology and associated perceptions of risk unique to trees. We also discuss biotechnology governance dilemmas within an upstream approach, highlighting the need for meaningful ways of involving stakeholders, rights holders and different publics at the earliest possible stage of the implementation of biotechnologies.","[Pelai, Ricardo; Hagerman, Shannon M.; Kozak, Robert] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Pelai, R (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",ricardo.pelai@alumni.ubc.ca; Shannon.hagerman@ubc.ca; rob.kozak@ubc.ca,,"Pelai, Ricardo/0000-0002-1724-0655",Genome Canada [241REF]; Genome BC,Genome Canada(Genome Canada); Genome BC,"We would like to thank the three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on earlier versions of this article.

However, significant gaps exist in provision of climate information that effectively addresses the needs of farmers and pastoralists. Most farmers and pastoralists, therefore, rely on indigenous knowledge (IK), where local indicators and experiences are used to observe and forecast weather conditions. While IK-based forecasting is inbuilt and established in many communities in East Africa, coordinated research and systematic documentation of IK for weather forecasting, including accuracy and reliability of IK is largely lacking. This paper documents and synthesizes existing IK for weather forecasting in East Africa using case studies from Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Uganda. The results show that farmers and pastoralists use a combination of meteorological, biological, and astrological indicators to forecast local weather conditions. IK weather forecasting is, therefore, crucial in supporting efforts to improve access to climate information in East Africa, especially in resource-poor and vulnerable communities. The paper draws valuable lessons on how farmers and pastoralists in East Africa use IK weather forecasts for making crop and livestock production decisions and demonstrates that the trust and willingness to apply scientific forecasts by farmers and pastoralists is likely to increase when integrated with IK. Therefore, a systematic documentation of IK, and a framework for integrating IK and scientific weather forecasting from national meteorological agencies can improve accuracy, uptake, and use of weather forecasts.","[Radeny, Maren; Recha, John] Int Livestock Res Inst, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change, Agr & Food Secur Program, Nairobi, Kenya; [Desalegn, Ayal] Addis Ababa Univ, Ctr Food Secur Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Mubiru, Drake] Natl Agr Res Labs, Soils Environm & Agrometeorol Unit, Kawanda, Uganda; [Kyazze, Florence] Makerere Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Kampala, Uganda; [Mahoo, Henry] Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Agr Engn & Land Planning, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Kimeli, Philip] Rift Valley Water Works Dev Agcy, Nakuru, Kenya; [Solomon, Dawit] ILRI, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change, Agr & Food Secur Program, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Addis Ababa University; Makerere University; Sokoine University of Agriculture; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Radeny, M (corresponding author), Int Livestock Res Inst, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change, Agr & Food Secur Program, Nairobi, Kenya.",m.radeny@cgiar.org,"Ayal, Desalegn Yayeh/AAG-3042-2021","Ayal, Desalegn Y/0000-0001-8966-2673; Recha, John/0000-0002-1146-7197",CGIAR Trust Fund,CGIAR Trust Fund(CGIAR),"This work was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from CGIAR Trust Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.

A principal way this will occur is through weather index insurance (WII), a type of insurance that pays out according to estimated losses rather than actual ones. In this paper, I examine one WII product that has been for sale in St. Lucia since May 2013, called the Livelihood Protection Policy, which has been discussed as a model WII product for InsuResilience. This article is based on twelve months of fieldwork conducted in St. Lucia, interviewing people involved in the design, implementation, and distribution of LPP, and actual and potential purchasers of LPP. In this article, I argue that LPP's design as a microinsurance product that can be purchased by any St. Lucian no matter their livelihood has made it largely undesirable because it does not fit anyone's needs well. This occurs for two main reasons. First, rather than primarily being used to help low-income St. Lucians adapt to climate change, LPP was used to test out how an abstract index insurance product can be sold without directly subsidizing the premiums of policyholders. Second, by not being designed for particular livelihoods, LPP suffers from not addressing hazards, such as drought, that many St. Lucians are highly exposed to, and from not compensating policyholders at meaningful wind and rainfall thresholds.","[Knudson, Chris] Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Clark University,"Knudson, C (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Inst Environm, 1064 E Lowell St, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",chrisknudson@email.arizona.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [1434089]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, an Albert, Norma and Howard Geller '77 Endowed Research Award; Clark University; American Association of Geographers Specialty Groups: Human Dimensions of Global Change; Cultural and Political Ecology","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, an Albert, Norma and Howard Geller '77 Endowed Research Award; Clark University; American Association of Geographers Specialty Groups: Human Dimensions of Global Change; Cultural and Political Ecology","Thank you to the people who generously gave their time and expertise as interviewees.

The authors analyzed the policy evolution from a disaster management to a risk management approach, using as a case study four agricultural droughts that impacted Uruguay's livestock sector in the last three decades. A transdisciplinary team of researchers, extension workers, and policy makers agreed on a common conceptual framework for the interpretation of past droughts and policies. The evidence presented shows that the set of actions implemented at different levels when facing droughts were mainly reactive in the past but later evolved to a more integral risk management approach. A greater interinstitutional integration and a decreasing gap between science and policy were identified during the period of study. Social and political learning enabled a vision of proactive management and promoted effective adaptive measures. While the government of Uruguay explicitly incorporated the issue of adaptation to climate change into its agenda, research institutions also fostered the creation of interdisciplinary study groups on this topic, resulting in new stages of learning. The recent changes in public policies, institutional governance, and academic research have contributed to enhance the adaptive capacity of the agricultural sector to climate variability, and in particular to drought. This study confirms the relevance of and need to work within a transdisciplinary framework to effectively address the different social learning dimensions, particularly those concerning the adaptation to global change.","[Cruz, G.; Picasso, V.] Univ Republica, Fac Agron, Dept Sistemas Ambientales, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Baethgen, W.] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Palisades, NY USA; [Bartaburu, D.; Morales, H.] Inst Plan Agr, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Bidegain, M.] Inst Uruguayo Meteorol, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Gimenez, A.; Tiscornia, G.] Inst Nacl Invest Agr, Unidad Agroclima & Sistemas Informac, Canelones, Uruguay; [Methol, M.] Minist Ganaderia Agr & Pesca, Oficina Programac & Polit Agr, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Picasso, V.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Agron, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Podesta, G.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Meteorol & Phys Oceanog, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Taddei, R.] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Terra, R.] Univ Republica, Fac Ingn, Inst Mecan Fluidos & Ingn Ambiental, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Vinocur, M.] Agrometeorol Univ Nacl Rio Cuarto, Fac Agron & Vet, Dept Ecol Agr, Cordoba, Argentina","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Columbia University; Instituto Nacional de Investigacion Agropecuaria Uruguay (INIA); University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Miami; Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP); Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Picasso, V (corresponding author), Univ Republica, Fac Agron, Dept Sistemas Ambientales, Montevideo, Uruguay.;Picasso, V (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Agron, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",picassorisso@wisc.edu,"PICASSO, VALENTIN/F-9336-2010; Baethgen, Walter/B-6610-2009; Taddei, Renzo/I-9090-2012; Podestá, Guillermo P/L-7100-2015; Tiscornia, Guadalupe/Z-1474-2019","PICASSO, VALENTIN/0000-0002-4989-6317; Taddei, Renzo/0000-0002-9935-6183; Podestá, Guillermo P/0000-0002-4909-0567; Tiscornia, Guadalupe/0000-0002-6650-651X","Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) [CRN3106]; U.S. National Science Foundation [GEO-1128040, 1211613]; Scientific Research Commission (CSIC) from Universidad de la Republica (UdelaR; Uruguay); Directorate For Geosciences [1211613] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Scientific Research Commission (CSIC) from Universidad de la Republica (UdelaR; Uruguay); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"This work was carried out with the aid of a grant from the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) CRN3106, which is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant GEO-1128040), and the support of the Scientific Research Commission (CSIC) from Universidad de la Republica (UdelaR; Uruguay).

Data were collected from interviews with 598 rice farmers in Dong Thap, Soc Trang and Long An provinces in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. These provinces were identified respectively as highly, moderately and mildly vulnerable to climate change. Multi-group structural equation modelling was employed. There are some differences regarding factors that influence farmers' adaptation intentions and the magnitude of the diverse influences across the three provinces. Perceived risks of climate change and perceived influences of the increases in electricity, water and fuel prices significantly influence farmers' adaptation intentions only in Long An. Soc Trang farmers are significantly influenced by the pressures from other people in adaptation intentions. Denial of climate change risk, wishful thinking and fatalism significantly affect farmers' adaptation intentions in both Dong Thap and Long An. The perceived effectiveness of adaptive measures is important to adaptation intentions in all provinces. Thus, vulnerability levels do matter to factors affecting farmers' intentions to adapt. However, the influences of these factors on adaptation intention are not significantly different across the three regions. This may imply a minor difference in the vulnerability levels of the three regions. Local farmers are either not aware of their vulnerability levels; or vulnerability is not an important factor guiding farmers' adaptation intentions. Some policy implications are drawn for formulating more effective adaptation strategies.","[Le Dang, Hoa] Nong Lam Univ, Fac Econ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Le Dang, Hoa; Nuberg, Ian] Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Urrbrae, Australia; [Li, Elton] Knowledge Exchange Australia, Aberfoyle Pk, Aberfoyle Pk, Australia; [Bruwer, Johan] Univ South Australia, Sch Mkt, North Terrace, Australia; [Bruwer, Johan] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Psychol, Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia",Nong Lam University; University of Adelaide; University of South Australia; Charles Sturt University,"Le Dang, H (corresponding author), Nong Lam Univ, Fac Econ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.;Le Dang, H (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Urrbrae, Australia.",danglehoa@hcmuaf.edu.vn,"; Bruwer, Johan/L-1280-2013","Nuberg, Ian/0000-0003-1942-1190; Bruwer, Johan/0000-0001-7568-605X; Dang, Hoa Le/0000-0002-5943-9515","AusAID; School of Agriculture, Food and Wine; University of Adelaide","AusAID(Australian Aid (AusAID)); School of Agriculture, Food and Wine; University of Adelaide","This paper is part of a PhD research at the University of Adelaide.

Here we ask what changes in the occurrence of extreme hydrologic conditions can be expected by the end of the century for the important water-generating, mountainous basins of the Southwestern United States, namely the Sierra Nevada and Upper Colorado River Basins. The extreme conditions considered are very high flows, low flows, and elevated stream temperature as derived from historic and future simulations using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model and downscaled output from a General Circulation Model ensemble. Results indicate noteworthy differences in the frequency changes of extremes based on geographic region, season, elevation, and stream size. We found wide-spread increases in the occurrence of stream flows exceeding 150% of historic monthly averages for winter by the end of the century, and extensive increases in the occurrence of both extreme low flows (representing <50% of historic monthly averages), and elevated stream temperatures (>3 degrees C of monthly averages) during the summer months, with some basins expecting extreme conditions 90-100% of the time by the end of the century.

At the end of 2011, when such reports were ever present, the International Panel on Climate Change published a draft report on extreme weather and climate change adaptation. This report itself was covered in the news and illustrated with images. Some of these depicted extreme weather', in particular with relation to floods, droughts and heat waves, hurricanes and ice/sea-level rise. For this article, these images were studied using visual thematic analysis, with a focus on examining the way they may symbolise certain emotional responses, such as compassion, fear, guilt, vulnerability, helpless, courage or resilience. Climate change communicators have examined the way that evoking such emotions in verbal communication can lead to engagement or disengagements with the topic of climate change. However, while researchers have also become increasingly interested in climate change images, they have not yet studied them with respect to symbolising certain emotions. Various typologies of images have been proposed in the past, distinguishing, for example, between human and natural impact images or iconic and geographically specific images. The images studied here do not neatly map onto these distinctions. They symbolise human suffering and loss and they are sometimes geographically and socially distinctive, but they are also iconic of climate change and they are symbols of its natural impacts. They all, to some extent, symbolise helplessness and may thus lead to disengagement rather than engagement with the issue of climate change.","[Nerlich, Brigitte] Univ Nottingham, Sch Sociol & Social Policy, Inst Sci & Soc, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Jaspal, Rusi] De Montfort Univ, Sch Appl Social Sci, Fac Hlth & Life Sci, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England",University of Nottingham; De Montfort University,"Nerlich, B (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Sociol & Social Policy, Inst Sci & Soc, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",brigitte.nerlich@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Nerlich, Brigitte/0000-0001-6617-7827; Jaspal, Rusi/0000-0002-8463-9519",ESRC [ES/I014926/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I014926/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,45,30,32,2,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-5431,1470-1189,,SCI CULT-UK,Sci.

Climate change is expected to exert impacts on the forest and its ability to provide FEGS. Thus, human livelihoods that depend on these FEGS are intricately vulnerable to climate impacts. Using the livelihood strategies of the two main forest indigenous groups; the Bantus and Pygmies, of the high forest zone of southern Cameroon; this paper examines the nature and pattern of their vulnerability to different climate risks as well as highlights how place of settlement in the forest contributes to the vulnerability of people in forest systems. Forests provide different capitals as FEGS and make direct and indirect contributions to livelihoods which are exploited differently by the two indigenous groups. The results show that vulnerability of forest communities is structured by lifestyle, culture and the livelihood strategies employed which are largely shaped by the place of settlement in the forest. The Pygmies living within the forests are engaged in nomadic gathering and foraging of non-timber forest resources. The Bantus prefer forest margins and are mostly preoccupied with sedentary farming, using the forest as additional livelihood opportunity. The contrasting lifestyles have implications on their vulnerability and adaptation to climate impacts which need to be taken into considerations in planning and implementation of national climate change adaptation strategies.","[Nkem, Johnson N.] UNDP, Nairobi, Kenya; [Somorin, Olufunso A.; Jum, Cyprian; Bele, Youssoufa M.; Sonwa, Denis J.] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Somorin, Olufunso A.] Wageningen Univ, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Idinoba, Monica E.] African Union Commiss, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); Wageningen University & Research; African Union (AU),"Nkem, JN (corresponding author), UNDP, Nairobi, Kenya.",johnson.nkem@undp.org,,,Canadian International Development Research Center (IDRC); UK Department for International Development (DFID) through the African Climate Change Adaptation (ACCA) Programme,Canadian International Development Research Center (IDRC); UK Department for International Development (DFID) through the African Climate Change Adaptation (ACCA) Programme,"We are grateful to Ednah Zvinavashe and Carolyn H.

The climateprediction.net experiment provides large ensembles of transient climate series from 1920 to 2080. We use 246 transient climate series in the CATCHMOD rainfall-run-off model to develop large ensembles of plausible river flows for the River Itchen. This transient ensemble allows the exploration of how flows may change through the twenty-first century, and demonstrates the range of possible consequences for freshwater ecosystems, based on invertebrate community impacts. Hydrological modelling of flow sequences including abstraction allows the continued effectiveness of river support from groundwater to be assessed. A new environmental impact matrix considers the response of the freshwater ecosystem in the Itchen, concentrating particularly on macro-invertebrates. Through the century increasing numbers of models fail the flow targets, with a minority of models suggesting flows that would lead to irreversible change to the invertebrate community. The large ensemble provides a richer picture of the range of possible change, allowing managers to explore a range of different responses. The approach used is illustrative, but demonstrates that large ensembles may be of great value in improving the understanding of the possible impact of climate change, provided that they can be communicated effectively to decision-makers.","[Fung, Fai; Lopez, Ana; New, Mark] Univ Oxford, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Watts, Glenn; Orr, Harriet G.; Extence, Chris] Environm Agcy England & Wales, Bristol BS1 5AH, Avon, England; [Lopez, Ana] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst, London WC2A 2AE, England; [New, Mark] Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [New, Mark] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Fung, F (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Sch Geog & Environm, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",fai.fung@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"New, Mark/A-7684-2008; Orr, Harriet/AAP-2665-2020; Watts, Glenn/H-1255-2011","New, Mark/0000-0001-6082-8879; Orr, Harriet/0000-0001-5021-1074; Fung, Fai/0000-0003-4367-151X",Environment Agency Science Project [SC050045]; Tyndall Centre for Climate Change; EPSRC [EP/G061157/1] Funding Source: UKRI; ESRC [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/G061157/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Environment Agency Science Project; Tyndall Centre for Climate Change; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"We thank Nick Faull, Tolu Aina and Milo Thurston for their support in obtaining the CPDN data and various members of staff at the Environment Agency of England and Wales for offering their time and views through the project.

Given vital character of water, its availability should not be only an explanatory variable in adaptation; but an issue subject to socio-physical explanations on how farmers adapt to declining water stocks. Instead of studying if farmers relying on groundwater adapt to status quo or projected climate conditions, a step forward is suggested in order to connect adaptation with sustainability. Water extraction caps compliance were used to test cooperation. Limits to aquifer withdrawals are operationalized via remaining time and quantities of water. Quantitative data were drawn from 668 experimental rounds, in framed field experiments implemented in dry regions in ten communities exposed to climate variability in Colombia. Empirical results suggest that socio-physical setting better explain the adoption of cooperative decisions. Intertemporal preferences on water allocations and physical variables have dissimilar marginal effects on cooperation. The deeper the water well is, the less the probabilities to cooperate in water conservation. Notwithstanding, the effect is dissimilar according to the remaining time for exhaustion of aquifer systems. Marginal effect is a step forward from using averages for water planning. If a groundwater management plan is put in place, the marginal characteristics of well-depths and residual time of aquifer existence, has implications for the successfulness of management strategies, which in turn have implications for long-term plans of water use efficiency as stated in Sustainable Development Goals.","[Asprilla Echeverria, John M.] Erasmus Univ, Sch Social & Behav Sci, Mandeville Bldg,T1715, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Asprilla Echeverria, John M.] Ctr Res & Innovat Water Sustainabil & Circular Ec, AnfiBIO Sirculab, San Martin De Loba, Colombia",Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Echeverria, JMA (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Sch Social & Behav Sci, Mandeville Bldg,T1715, Rotterdam, Netherlands.;Echeverria, JMA (corresponding author), Ctr Res & Innovat Water Sustainabil & Circular Ec, AnfiBIO Sirculab, San Martin De Loba, Colombia.",jasprilla@javeriana.edu.co,,,,,,,72,1,1,3,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-801X,,,GROUNDWATER SUST DEV,Groundwater Sustain.

At its June 2021 plenary session, Parliament adopted a position on the EU's 2030 Biodiversity Strategy: Bringing Nature back into our lives to ensure that the world's ecosystems are protected, restored, and resilient by 2050. Parliament wants the EU to become a leader, guaranteeing that 30% of its territory will be in natural areas by 2030 and taking biodiversity into account in all its policies. Climate change is one of the most important threats to humanity and it will increasingly matter how we manage our existence and development. Climate stabilization, as provided for in the Paris Agreement, requires mitigation and adaptation measures to reduce the impact of climate change and increase the resilience of essential ecosystem services. In the wetland environment, the degradation and loss of wet habitats, especially carbon-capturing ecosystems, results in an unprecedented loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Blue carbon is the carbon stored in wetlands, coastal and marine ecosystems, which represent significant carbon sinks. Indeed, they sequester carbon in its organic form and store it for thousands of years. Moreover, blue carbon ecosystems provide a wide range of ecosystem services that underpin livelihoods and support adaptation to climate change. However, despite the importance of the ecosystem services provided, these habitats are disappearing at an alarming rate.","[Nichersu, Iulian; Livanov, Oliver; Bratfanof, Edward; Balaican, Dragos] Danube Delta Natl Inst R&D, 165 Babadag St, Tulcea, Romania; [Negrei, Castel] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Nichersu, I (corresponding author), Danube Delta Natl Inst R&D, 165 Babadag St, Tulcea, Romania.",nichersu_iulian.nichersu@ddni.ro,,,,,,,23,0,0,1,1,UNIV AGRONOMIC SCIENCES & VETERINARY MEDICINE BUCHAREST - USAMV,BUCHAREST,"59 MARASTI BOULEVARD, DISTRICT 1, BUCHAREST, 011464, ROMANIA",2285-6064,,,SCI PAP-SER-E-LAND R,Sci.

Exposure is an important risk factor for health and can lead to increased risk of a variety of diseases. This study investigated the association between pregnant women's levels of heavy and essential metals and the birth outcomes of the newborn child. This cross-sectional study is part of the ACCEPT birth cohort (Adaption to Climate Change, Environmental Pollution, and dietary Transition) and included 509 pregnant Inuit women 18 years of age. Data were collected in five Greenlandic regions during 2010-2015. Population characteristics and birth outcomes were obtained from medical records and midwives, respectively, and blood samples were analyzed for 13 metals. Statistical analysis included one-way ANOVA, Spearman's rho, and multiple linear and logistic regression analyses. The proportion of current smokers was 35.8%. The levels of cadmium, chromium, and nickel were higher compared to reported normal ranges. Significant regional differences were observed for several metals, smoking, and parity. Cadmium and copper were significantly inversely related to birth outcomes. Heavy metals in maternal blood can adversely influence fetal development and growth in a dose-response relationship. Diet and lifestyle factors are important sources of toxic heavy metals and deviant levels of essential metals. The high frequency of smokers in early pregnancy is of concern, and prenatal exposure to heavy metals and other environmental contaminants in the Greenlandic Inuit needs further research.","[Bank-Nielsen, Per I.; Long, Manhai; Bonefeld-Jorgensen, Eva C.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Ctr Arctic Hlth & Mol Epidemiol, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Bonefeld-Jorgensen, Eva C.] Univ Greenland, Greenland Ctr Hlth Res, Nuuk 3900, Greenland",Aarhus University,"Bonefeld-Jorgensen, EC (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Ctr Arctic Hlth & Mol Epidemiol, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.;Bonefeld-Jorgensen, EC (corresponding author), Univ Greenland, Greenland Ctr Hlth Res, Nuuk 3900, Greenland.",pbn@ph.au.dk; ml@ph.au.dk; ebj@ph.au.dk,,"Long, Manhai/0000-0002-4517-1829","Danish Environmental Protection Agency [MST-112-00225]; Aarhus University, Denmark","Danish Environmental Protection Agency; Aarhus University, Denmark","This research was funded by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency, grant number (MST-112-00225), and the APC was funded by Aarhus University, Denmark.

Place-based communication of climate change may catalyze action by making climate change more personally relevant. However, there is no one general public, so communication efforts can unintentionally polarize beliefs. This study aims to fill the gap in knowledge about how and why different audiences respond to place-based climate change communication, which could aid climate change communication efforts and climate scientists. Results from an experimental survey of 655 Californians and follow-up interviews indicate that prior climate change beliefs influence the effectiveness of place-based climate change communication. In particular, those who were already concerned'' about climate change, as classified by the Six Americas, were the only group to show a significant response to an intervention. This study also finds no difference in willingness to adapt to climate change between local and global framings. However, those exposed to a local framing were more likely to take personal-scale adaptation actions, while those exposed to a global framing were more likely to take policy-scale adaptation actions. These results, and the theories of place attachment and psychological distance, suggest that place-based communication may only be applicable for certain audiences (e.g., the concerned) and when the scale of the intervention matches the scale of action.","[Halperin, Abby; Walton, Peter] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Halperin, A (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.",abbyhalperin@gmail.com,,,University of Oxford's Kellogg College; University of Oxford's Environmental Change Institute,University of Oxford's Kellogg College; University of Oxford's Environmental Change Institute,"We appreciate the excellent guidance and feedback from Graham Gottlieb at Climate Central, Amy Simon at Goodwin Simon Strategic Research, and three anonymous reviewers.

A new dispositions-based approach was adapted in order to analyse human interactions with environmental hazards and applied to the case of Hombori village in north-eastern Mali. This article explores how the population and political stakeholders perceive, live with and respond to the increasing scarcity of water. It also explores how their current vulnerability and ability to cope with variations in available water resources indicate future adaptability to climate shocks. On the one hand, this research shows how the population copes with variations in water resource availability: the population's socio-spatial organisation explains the inhabitants' exposure to this problem and some of the factors affecting vulnerability, the elderly and women being the hardest hit. The water issue is generally managed on a day-to-day basis and considered a big problem only in the dry season, thus lowering any incentive for self-protection. The main two variables that could explain this kind of risk management are the conflicting local governance and current social rules. On the other hand, the discussion of results, based on a conceptual model of social responses, explains why these current social dispositions to cope with and even address the water scarcity issue do not guarantee future adaptability to climate change.","[Becerra, Sylvia; Gangneron, Fabrice] Observ Midi Pyrenees, GET CNRS IRD UPS, 14 Ave Edouard Belin, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Saqalli, Mehdi] Univ Toulouse 2, CNRS, GEODE, 5 Allees Antonio Machado, F-31058 Toulouse 9, France; [Dia, Amadou Hamath] Univ Ziguinchor, Ziguinchor, Senegal",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite de Toulouse - Jean Jaures,"Becerra, S (corresponding author), Observ Midi Pyrenees, GET CNRS IRD UPS, 14 Ave Edouard Belin, F-31400 Toulouse, France.",sylvia.becerra@get.omp.eu; mehdi.saqalli@univ-tlse2.fr; fabrice.gangneron@get.obs-mip.fr; hamathdia@gmail.com,,"Saqalli, Mehdi/0000-0001-5405-466X; BECERRA, Sylvia/0000-0003-1054-6616",European Union; French National Research Agency (ANR),European Union(European Commission); French National Research Agency (ANR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"This work was performed within the framework of two projects: 1-the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses project (AMMA), funded by a number of agencies from France, the UK, the US and Africa, with a major financial contribution from the European Union Sixth Framework Research Programme (http://www.amma-eu.org/), and 2-The Elevage CLImat Societe (ECLIS) project, funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR).",,48,7,8,1,25,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

A promising development to address these declines is technical change regarding groundwater substitutes such as desalination and wastewater recycling. However, because these technologies are energy intensive, optimal implementation also depends on future energy price trends. We provide an operational model for the case of reverse-osmosis seawater desalination. In an application to the Pearl Harbor Aquifer in Hawaii, we find that allowing the cost of desalination to increase at an average annual rate of 2.4% over the next century results in a substantially steeper efficiency price path for water. The higher prices decrease optimal groundwater extraction and induce a slower head drawdown over a longer period of time, thereby delaying the transition to desalination by over 30 years. Because the rise in energy costs exacerbates efficiency losses from under-pricing, any delay in implementing efficiency pricing will cause either a greater future increase in prices or the need for rationing. Reforming prices sooner rather than later may be more politically feasible, given that consumers may be more amenable to a gradual rise in prices today than a sudden doubling or tripling of prices ten years from now. Using this as a foundation, we outline a research agenda for extending the framework to other groundwater substitutes and for adapting to climate change.","[Roumasset, James] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Roumasset, James] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Univ Hawaii, Econ Res Org, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Wada, Christopher A.] Univ Hawaii, Econ Res Org, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System,"Wada, CA (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, Econ Res Org, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",cawada@hawaii.edu,"Wada, Christopher/I-8105-2016","Wada, Christopher/0000-0002-4916-9769",United States Geological Survey through the University of Hawaii at Manoa Water Resources Research Center [2012HI361B],United States Geological Survey through the University of Hawaii at Manoa Water Resources Research Center,This research was supported in part by the United States Geological Survey Grant No. 2012HI361B through the University of Hawaii at Manoa Water Resources Research Center.,,21,2,2,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Beyond expected positive or negative impact assessment, there is a need to explore adaptation options for arable cropping systems. Involvement of farmers in the cropping system design process allows tailoring locally relevant and innovative adaptation options while taking into account interactions between crop management choices. In southwestern France, we devised and applied a participatory methodology of cropping system conception adapted to the climate change context. This method is based on prototyping methods as well as the vulnerability concept, and follows three successive steps: presentation of exposure, assessment of crop sensitivity during individual interviews with farmers, and conception of crop system adaptations during collective workshops. The proposed cropping systems differ according to access to water resources for irrigation of farmers. Non-or hardly irrigating farmers considered their current cropping systems to be already adapted to climate change, and focused on improving their efficiency using already known management practices. They did not feel endangered by the future climate scenario. Irrigating farmers were inclined to substitute sensitive crops or even redesign their cropping systems. Nevertheless, they had difficulty to distance themselves from current cropping choices and economical or technical constraints. Proposed cropping systems were thus not very disruptive compared to current practices. This work can be supplemented through assessments of cropping system sustainability and performance according to water and thermal stress.","[Willaume, Magali; Rollin, Audrey] Univ Toulouse, INPT ENSAT, UMR AGIR 1248, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Willaume, Magali; Rollin, Audrey] INRA, UMR AGIR 1248, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Casagrande, Marion] Univ Lyon, ISARA Lyon, Unite SCAB, F-69364 Lyon 07, France",Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; INRAE; ISARA,"Willaume, M (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, INPT ENSAT, UMR AGIR 1248, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",magali.willaume@ensat.fr; a-rollin@hotmail.fr; mcasagrande@isara.fr,,"Willaume, Magali/0000-0003-0800-9176","UMT-Eau; INRA, Arvalis-institut du vegetal and CETIOM","UMT-Eau; INRA, Arvalis-institut du vegetal and CETIOM","The authors gratefully acknowledge the funding from UMT-Eau, a joint research and development unit (INRA, Arvalis-institut du vegetal and CETIOM) working on tools and methods for better agricultural quantitative water management.

This article explores double exposure to climatic and globalization processes for the U.S.-Mexico border region, where rapid urbanization, industrialization, and agricultural intensification result in vulnerability to water scarcity as the primary climate change concern. For portions of the western border within the North American monsoon climate regime, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects temperature increases of 2 to 4 degrees C by midcentury and up to 3 to 5 degrees C by 2100, with possible decreases of 5 to 8 percent in precipitation. Like the climate and water drivers themselves, proposed societal responses can also be regionalized across borders. Nevertheless, binational responses are confronted by a complex institutional landscape. The coproduction of science and policy must be situated in the context of competing institutional jurisdictions and legitimacy claims. Adaptation to climate change is conventionally understood as more difficult at international borders, yet regionalizing adaptive responses could also potentially increase resilience. We assess three cases of transboundary collaboration in the Arizona-Sonora region based on specific indicators that contribute importantly to building adaptive capacity. We conclude that three key factors can increase resilience over the long term: shared social learning, the formation of binational communities of practice among water managers or disaster-relief planners, and the coproduction of climate knowledge.","[Wilder, Margaret] Univ Arizona, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Scott, Christopher A.] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Pineda Pablos, Nicolas] El Colegio de Sonora, Hermosillo 83000, Sonora, Mexico; [Garfin, Gregg M.] Univ Arizona, Inst Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Garfin, Gregg M.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [McEvoy, Jamie] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona,"Wilder, M (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",mwilder@email.arizona.edu; cascott@email.arizona.edu; npineda@colson.edu.mx; rvarady@email.arizona.edu; gmgarfin@email.arizona.edu; jmcevoy@email.arizona.edu,"Varady, Robert/AAN-2292-2020","Garfin, Gregg/0000-0002-2760-132X; Scott, Christopher A./0000-0002-6767-0450; Varady, Robert/0000-0002-3521-9649",,,,,40,71,72,0,58,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-5608,1467-8306,,ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR,Ann.

In this context, the study examined farmers' perception of climate change effects, the extent of their use of adaptation strategies and the constraints they face. To fulfil these objectives, the study used both quantitative and qualitative data. For quantitative data, 347 farm household heads were surveyed from multiple agro-ecological zones in Bangladesh, applying a four-stage sampling technique. Focus group discussion (FGD) and key informant interview (KII) were used to gather qualitative data. Household survey and Problem Confrontation Index (PCI) were employed for quantitative data. The multi-method approach was used to maximise reliability of the findings. The results revealed that about one-third of the farmers (32%) were low adaptation strategy users, and only 8% were high adaptation users. However, the majority (86%) believed that climate change is a risk to desired crop production. The multi-method (PCI, FGD and KII) approach was applied to identify the major problems in expanding adaptation capacity, such as a shortage of farm inputs, lack of knowledge on adaptation practices, lack of credit facilities, shortage of land and inadequacy of flood and saline tolerant varieties. The results could contribute to decision and policy making to minimise the barriers to adaptation. Moreover, future researchers can benefit from the methodology applied to identify the barriers to climate change adaptation.","[Kabir, Muhammad Humayun; Hossain, Kh Zulfikar] Sher E Bangla Agr Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Informat Syst, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh; [Azad, Md Javed] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Tan, Mou Leong] Univ Sains Malaysia, Geog Sect, Gelugor, Malaysia",Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University (SAU); University of Sydney; Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Kabir, MH (corresponding author), Sher E Bangla Agr Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Informat Syst, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh.",mhumayunsau@gmail.com,"Tan, Mou Leong/N-4678-2017","Tan, Mou Leong/0000-0003-3939-0336","University Grants Commission (UGC), Bangladesh","University Grants Commission (UGC), Bangladesh(University Grants Commission, India)","The study carried out with the financial assistance of the University Grants Commission (UGC), Bangladesh.",,68,0,0,9,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

The reproducibility and lower environmental impacts of bioenergy have attracted increasing attention in the debate. This research investigates the potentials of growing rapeseed in winter fallow fields across the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) to serve the goal of boosting bioenergy production and improving edible oil security in China. It first quantifies the extent of winter fallow fields in the Basin and identifies the accurate starting and ending dates of the fallowing at the grid-cell level. It then matches the fallowing periods with the growing period grid-by-grid and assesses the current and future potentials of rapeseed production across the matched grid-cells in the region. The assessments take into consideration of climate change adaptations on sowing dates and on the choice of varieties with suitable growth cycle length. Finally, by coupling the Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZ) model and CHINAGRO-II economic model, this research simulates economically meaningful levels of rapeseeds production and trade for 2020 and 2030. A 60% realization of the production potential would increase total rapeseed supply by 9.1 million tons, reduce China's rapeseed import to zero and further reduce soybean import by 8.1 million tons in 2020. In 2030, the import of rapeseed would be reduced from 15 million tons under baseline to 7.3 million tons.","[Tian, Zhan; Liu, Junguo] Southern Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Ji, Yinghao] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Sci & Management Climate Change, I-30123 Venice, Italy; [Xu, Hanqing] East China Normal Univ, Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Huanguang] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Sun, Laixiang; Zhong, Honglin] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Sun, Laixiang; Zhong, Honglin] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria",Southern University of Science & Technology; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; East China Normal University; Renmin University of China; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Qiu, HG (corresponding author), Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.;Sun, LX (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.;Sun, LX (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",hgqiu@ruc.edu.cn; lsun123@umd.edu,"Sun, Laixiang/ABB-2622-2021; Liu, Junguo/B-3021-2012","Sun, Laixiang/0000-0002-7784-7942; Liu, Junguo/0000-0002-5745-6311; Tian, Zhan/0000-0002-4520-0036; Zhong, Honglin/0000-0003-1236-6037","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673290, 51711520318, 71761147004, 71861147002, 41671113, 41371110]; High-level Special Funding of the Southern University of Science and Technology [G02296302, G02296402]; China Meteorological Administration [CCSF201330, CCSF201112]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); High-level Special Funding of the Southern University of Science and Technology; China Meteorological Administration,"The authors thank Professor Xinliang Xu at the Institute of Geographical Sciences & Natural Resources Research in Chinese Academy of Science for data sharing.

Many studies have characterized farmers' climate risk perceptions or farming practices, but few have evaluated the in situ decision-making processes that link (or fail to link) risk perceptions to adaptive behaviors. Here, we use a novel methodology to reveal patterns in climate-sensitive decision-making by commercial grain farmers in South Africa. We structure, linguistically code, and statistically analyze causal relationships described in 30 mental models interviews. We show that farmers' framing of weather and climate risks strongly predicts their adoption of conservation agriculture (CA)-climate-resilient best practices that reduce shorter-term financial and weather risks and longer-term agronomic risks. These farmers describe weather and climate risks using six exhaustive and mutually exclusive languages: agricultural, cognitive, economic, emotional, political, and survival. The prevalence of agricultural and economic language only weakly predicts CA practice, whereas emotional and farm survival language strongly limits CA adoption. The framing of weather risks in terms of farm survival impedes adaptations that are likely to improve such survival in the longer term. But this survival framing is not necessarily indicative of farmers' current economic circumstances. It represents a consequential mindset rather than a financial state and it may go undetected in more conventional studies relying on direct survey or interview questions.","[Findlater, Kieran M.; Satterfield, Terre; Kandlikar, Milind] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, 429-2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Findlater, Kieran M.] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Geol Sci Bldg,Level 6,13 Lib Rd, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa; [Donner, Simon D.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, 1984 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of Cape Town; University of British Columbia,"Findlater, KM (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, 429-2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.;Findlater, KM (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Geol Sci Bldg,Level 6,13 Lib Rd, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa.",k.findlater@alumni.ubc.ca,,"Findlater, Kieran/0000-0002-6818-5588",,,,,46,18,18,2,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

This is especially so where a large percentage of the global supply is grown in a single geographical region. Fortunately, there is often considerable spatial heterogeneity in the vulnerability to climate change within affected regions, implying that local production losses could be compensated through intensification and expansion of production elsewhere. However, this requires that site-level actions are integrated into a regional approach to climate change adaptation. We discuss here such a regional approach for cocoa in West Africa, where 70 % of global cocoa supply originates. On the basis of a statistical model of relative climatic suitability calibrated on West African cocoa farming areas and average climate projections for the 2030s and 2050s of, respectively, 15 and 19 Global Circulation Models, we divide the region into three adaptation zones: (i) a little affected zone permitting intensification and/or expansion of cocoa farming; (ii) a moderately affected zone requiring diversification and agronomic adjustments of farming practices; and (iii) a severely affected zone with need for progressive crop change. We argue that for tropical agricultural commodities, larger-scale adaptation planning that attempts to balance production trends across countries and regions could help reduce negative impacts of climate change on regional economies and global commodity supplies, despite the institutional challenges that this integration may pose.","[Schroth, Goetz] CP 513, BR-68109971 Santarem, Para, Brazil; [Laederach, Peter; Martinez-Valle, Armando Isaac; Bunn, Christian] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Managua, Nicaragua; [Bunn, Christian] Humboldt Univ, Dept Agr Econ, D-10115 Berlin, Germany",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Schroth, G (corresponding author), CP 513, BR-68109971 Santarem, Para, Brazil.",Goetz.schroth@gmail.com,"Bunn, Christian/AAE-9504-2019","Bunn, Christian/0000-0003-2175-8745; Laderach, Peter/0000-0001-8708-6318",,,,,56,24,25,0,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Despite this, factors that influence smallholder farmers' climate change perceptions have not yet been adequately studied. As many of the smallholder farmers live in regions where climate change is predicted to have the most negative impact, their climate change perception is of particular interest. In this study, based on data collected from Ethiopian smallholder farmers, we assessed farmers' perceptions and anticipations of past and future climate change. Furthermore, the factors influencing farmers' climate change perceptions and the relation between farmers' perceptions and available public climate information were assessed. Our findings revealed that a majority of respondents perceive warming temperatures and decreasing rainfall trends that correspond with the local meteorological record. Farmers' perceptions about the past climate did not always reflect their anticipations about the future. A substantial number of farmers' anticipations of future climate were less consistent with climate model projections. The recursive bivariate probit models employed to explore factors affecting different categories of climate change perceptions illustrate statistical significance for explanatory variables including location, gender, age, education, soil fertility status, climate change information, and access to credit services. The findings contribute to the literature by providing evidence not just on farmers' past climate perceptions but also on future climate anticipations. The identified factors help policy makers to provide targeted extension and advisory services to enrich climate change understanding and support appropriate farm-level climate change adaptations.","[Habtemariam, Lemlem Teklegiorgis; Kassa, Getachew Abate; Heissenhuber, Alois] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Agr Prod & Resource Econ, Alte Akad 14, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Gandorfer, Markus] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Econ Hort & Landscaping, Alte Akad 16, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich,"Habtemariam, LT (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Chair Agr Prod & Resource Econ, Alte Akad 14, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",leliamsal@yahoo.com,,"Gandorfer, Markus/0000-0002-0624-153X",Katholischer Akademischer Auslander-Dienst (KAAD); Technische Universitat Munchen,Katholischer Akademischer Auslander-Dienst (KAAD); Technische Universitat Munchen,"The first author has received a scholarship from Katholischer Akademischer Auslander-Dienst (KAAD) and the Laura Bassi award from Technische Universitat Munchen for PhD study.

Climate change may stress these interdependencies, together referred to as the energy-water nexus, by reducing water availability for hydropower generation and by increasing irrigation and electricity demand for groundwater pumping, among other feedbacks. Further, many climate adaptation measures to augment water supplies-such as water recycling and desalination-are energy-intensive. However, water and electricity system climate vulnerabilities and adaptations are often studied in isolation, without considering how multiple interactive risks may compound. This paper reviews the fragmented literature and develops a generalized framework for understanding these implications of climate change on the energy-water nexus. We apply this framework in a case study to quantify end-century direct climate impacts on California's water and electricity resources and estimate the magnitude of the indirect cross-sectoral feedback of electricity demand from various water adaptation strategies. Our results show that increased space cooling demand and decreased hydropower generation are the most significant direct climate change impacts on California's electricity sector by end-century. In California's water sector, climate change impacts directly on surface water availability exceed demand changes, but have considerable uncertainty, both in direction and magnitude. Additionally, we find that the energy demands of water sector climate adaptations could significantly affect California's future electricity system needs. If the worst-case water shortage occurs under climate change, water-conserving adaptation measures can provide large energy savings co-benefits, but other energy-intensive water adaptations may double the direct impacts of climate change on the state's electricity resource requirement. These results highlight the value of coordinated adaptation planning between the energy and water sectors to achieve mutually beneficial solutions for climate resilience.","[Szinai, Julia K.; Jones, Andrew D.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Szinai, Julia K.; Kammen, Daniel M.; Jones, Andrew D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Deshmukh, Ranjit] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Environm Studies, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Kammen, Daniel M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Goldman Sch Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Szinai, JK (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Szinai, JK (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jszinai@berkeley.edu; rdeshmukh@ucsb.edu; kammen@berkeley.edu; adjones@lbl.gov,"Jones, Andrew/AHH-1227-2022; Szinai, Julia/AAG-2759-2020; Jones, Andrew D/M-4363-2013","Jones, Andrew/0000-0002-1913-7870; Szinai, Julia/0000-0003-2030-3642; Jones, Andrew D/0000-0002-1913-7870; Deshmukh, Ranjit/0000-0002-5593-675X","National Science Foundation [DGE-1633740]; Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Climate and Environmental Science Division, of the U S Department of Energy as part of the HyperFACETS Project [DE-AC02-05CH11231, DE-SC0016605]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Climate and Environmental Science Division, of the U S Department of Energy as part of the HyperFACETS Project","This material is based upon work supported by (1) the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DGE-1633740, 'Innovations in Food, Energy, Water Systems' (InFEWS) and (2) by the Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Climate and Environmental Science Division, of the U S Department of Energy under contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231 as part of the HyperFACETS Project, 'A framework for improving analysis and modeling of Earth system and intersectoral dynamics at regional scales' (award No. DE-SC0016605).",,155,10,10,5,38,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

In mountain SES there is a paradox between high community capacity to cope with extremes, and governance structures and processes that constrain that capacity from being realised. Climate adaptation that maintains livelihoods and supply of ecosystem services can catalyse this innate adaptive capacity if new adaptive governance arrangements can be created. Using the French Alps as a case study, we outline a participative framework for transformative adaptation that links adaptive capacity and governance to provide social innovation and ecosystem-based adaptation solutions for mountain SES. Grassland management was the main entry point for adaptation: bundles of adaptation services supplied by the landscape mosaic of biodiverse grassland types can maintain agricultural production and tourism and facilitate income diversification. Deliberate management for core adaptation services like resilient fodder production, erosion control, shade or aesthetic value generates co-benefits for future transformation ability. People activate bundles of adaptation services along adaptation pathways and realise benefits via co-production with other forms of capital including traditional knowledge or social networks. Common and distinctive adaptation services in each pathway create options for transformation if barriers from interactions between values and rules across scales can be overcome. For example conserving mown terraces which is a critical adaptation nexus reflects a complex interplay of values, markets and governance instruments from local to European scales. We conclude that increasing stakeholders capacity to mobilise adaptation services is critical for empowering them to implement adaptation to global change.","[Lavorel, Sandra; Gabillet, Marine; Devaux, Caroline] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Colloff, Matthew J.] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Linnaeus Way, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Locatelli, Bruno] Univ Montpellier, Cirad, F-34098 Montpellier, France; [Locatelli, Bruno] Cifor, Lima 15024, Peru; [Gorddard, Russell] CSIRO Land & Water, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Prober, Suzanne M.] CSIRO Land & Water, Private Bag 5, Wembley, WA 6913, Australia; [Laforgue, Denis] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, LLSETI, F-73000 Chambery, France; [Peyrache-Gadeau, Veronique] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, CNRS, EDYTEM, F-73000 Chambery, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; Australian National University; CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Lavorel, S (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38000 Grenoble, France.",sandra.lavorel@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr,"Locatelli, Bruno/C-9957-2009; Prober, Suzanne/G-6465-2010","Locatelli, Bruno/0000-0003-2983-1644; Prober, Suzanne/0000-0002-6518-239X","French Agence Nationale pour la Recherche [ANR-12-EBID-004-01, ANR-16-CE93-0008-01, ANR-10-LABX-50-01, ANR-15-IDEX-02]; CSIRO Visiting Scientist Program",French Agence Nationale pour la Recherche(French National Research Agency (ANR)); CSIRO Visiting Scientist Program,"This work was funded by French Agence Nationale pour la Recherche BiodivERsA REGARDS (ANR-12-EBID-004-01), MtnPaths (ANR-16-CE93-0008-01), Labex Item (ANR-10-LABX-50-01) and Investissements d'Avenir CDP Trajectories (ANR-15-IDEX-02).

The aggravating non-stationarity under the changing environment rocked this foundation. The hedging theory is one of the options for adaptive operation based on hydrological forecasts, which can provide a practical tool for optimal reservoir operation under a changing environment. However, the connections between hedging theory and rule curves are not clear. This paper establishes the linkage of rule curves and hedging theory by analyzing three fundamental problems surrounding the design of conventional rule curves, namely the law and design of water supply rule curves, the determination of flood control storage, and the division of refill and drawdown circle. The general interpretation of the conventional water supply rule curves with hedging theory is conducted. Both the theoretical analyses and the Danjiangkou Reservoir case study reveal that, based on the historical records, the rule curves can be interpreted as a specific expression of hedging theory. This intrinsic linkage allows us to propose a more general and scientific method of updating rule curves in the context of non-stationarity. On this basis, the rule-curve-based climate adaptation strategies are figured out using hedging theory. This research is helpful for practical adaptive operation of reservoirs in the changing environment.","[Wan, Wenhua; Zhao, Jianshi; Wang, Jiabiao] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Zhao, JS (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",meviolet@126.com; zhaojianshi@tsinghua.edu.cn; waterwhu@foxmail.com,"Zhao, Jianshi/J-6962-2017; Zhao, Jianshi/AGP-0072-2022; wan, wenhua/P-9624-2017","Zhao, Jianshi/0000-0001-9789-8555; wan, wenhua/0000-0002-1356-0467","Key Technologies Research and Development Program [2017YFC0404403, 2016YFC0401302, 2016YFC0402203]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [91747208, 5171102044, 51579129]",Key Technologies Research and Development Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by the Key Technologies Research and Development Program (2017YFC0404403, 2016YFC0401302, 2016YFC0402203) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (91747208, 5171102044, 51579129).",,50,7,7,5,23,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR 1,2019,11,7,,,,,,,1827,10.3390/su11071827,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11071827,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HW2WV,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000466551600004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adaptation theory and practice have begun to focus on change agents, people who can help catalyse this change, but it is poorly understood why some people are better able to influence positive systemic change or how climate adaptation projects cultivate and assist them in doing so. This paper synthesises insights on good practice for intervention design and implementation from a wide range of intervention literature domains, including health, education and international development. It identifies a distilled set of individual and collective change agent characteristics and competencies, grouped into five interconnecting themes: values, learning approaches, efficacy, roles and entrepreneurial tendencies. Nine core competencies are identified as important for enabling change, clustered into three themes: being good with people, learning or mastery skills, and adaptation competencies. The review also collates insights about how best to cultivate an agent's capacity for catalysing change, with a particular focus on the potential for enabling climate adaptation through research for development. Initial insights suggest that capacity building needs to be more than developing new technical knowledge and skills; it should also focus on developing the necessary competencies for enabling change in intervention teams and potential change agents. These insights provide the basis for testing what combinations of change agent characteristics and competencies are most effective in different contexts, improving project and program design to cultivate change agents, and achieving systemic change.","[Meharg, S.] CSIRO Land & Water, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Meharg, S (corresponding author), CSIRO Land & Water, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",Seona.Meharg@csiro.au,,,CSIRO; Australian National University,CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); Australian National University(Australian National University),"I am most grateful for the support I received from my supervisors (Lorrae Van Kerkhoff, Mark Stafford Smith, James Butler and James Pittock) and from my organisation CSIRO while completing my PhD at the Australian National University, which enabled the ideas for this paper.

Urban and peri-urban food production can be among nature-based strategies planned for improving urban food security, reducing emissions, and climate adaptation. Co-operative governance, strategic planning, and accountable institutions are needed to support urban agriculture (UA), in the face of climate risks, unplanned urban development, the gendered nature of food provision, and the inability of urban farmers to self-organize toward optimal market and land access outcomes. Using a case study approach guided by qualitative content analysis with information derived from web analysis, we apply the Institutional Analysis and Development Framework to analyze underlying governance factors for UA in three selected Sub-Saharan African cities. Our three case cities of Kampala, Tamale and Cape Town reveal that UA is beginning to receive policy attention toward food security, and recognition for generating environmental, ecological, health, and human well-being benefits. Literature from specific cities however does not yet signal a local awareness and policy thrust regarding the associated and pertinent climate adaptation benefits of urban agriculture. We therefore recommend trans-disciplinary, locally-led, planning-based, and multi-sectoral approaches, involving a range of stakeholders toward recognizing and achieving the climate adaptation, environmental (ecologically restorative) and food security benefits of pursuing urban agriculture. This signals a larger role for the practice in sustainability discourse and SDGs 2 and 11, scaling out and up across large, medium and small towns, and cities of Sub-Saharan Africa.","[Merino, Mariana Vidal; Gajjar, Sumetee Pahwa; Subedi, Aasha; Polgar, Ana; Van den Hoof, Catherine] PlanAdapt, Berlin, Germany",,"Gajjar, SP (corresponding author), PlanAdapt, Berlin, Germany.",s.pahwagajjar@plan-adapt.org,,"Van den Hoof, Catherine/0000-0001-6277-494X",,,,,94,1,1,3,13,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

To evaluate the relevant articles, the authors used the search term climate-smart agriculture amidst climate change to enhance agricultural production (CSA-CCAP) to find studies published between 2009 and March 2022 using innovative bibliometric techniques. One hundred and sixteen published papers in BibTeX format were downloaded for further analysis. The most successful selected CSA approaches in Africa, such as in the Congo Basin forest, including sustainable land management practices, water-efficient maize hybrids, and others, aim to counteract climate change with signs of 200 percent output gains. The findings showed an annual growth rate of about 19%, demonstrating that research on CSA-CCAP expanded over time during the study period. Nonetheless, the research output on CSA-CCAP varied, with 2021 accounting for 30%, followed by 2020 with 16% as of March 2022. The study concluded that boosting agricultural productivity in the face of climate change may be accomplished through CSA to end hunger, eradicate poverty, and improve people's well-being.","[Okolie, Collins C.; Danso-Abbeam, Gideon; Ogundeji, Abiodun A.] Univ Free State, Disaster Management Training & Educ Ctr Afr, POB 339, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Danso-Abbeam, Gideon] Univ Dev Studies, Dept Agribusiness, POB TL 1882, Tamale, Ghana; [Groupson-Paul, Okechukwu] Alex Ekweme Fed Univ Ndufu Alike Ikwo, POB 1010, Abakaliki, Ebonyi, Nigeria",University of the Free State; University for Development Studies,"Ogundeji, AA (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Disaster Management Training & Educ Ctr Afr, POB 339, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa.",ogundejiaa@ufs.ac.za,,"Ogundeji, Abiodun Akintunde/0000-0001-7356-5668",,,,,114,1,1,10,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,JAN,2023,12,1,,,,,,,50,10.3390/land12010050,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land12010050,,,23,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,7Z2GC,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000915381000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Its special focus is to investigate the impact of the Global Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU) on gender-sensitive responses to climate change in oil host communities in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach This paper adopts a survey research technique aimed at gathering information from a representative sample of the population, as it is essentially cross-sectional, describing and interpreting the current situation. A total of 1,200 rural women were sampled across the Niger Delta region. Findings The results from the use of a combined propensity score matching and logit model indicate a significant relationship between GMoU model and women, gender and climate change in the Niger Delta, Nigeria. Practical implications This implies that CSR of a multinational oil companies is a critical factor in the need for gender-sensitive responses to the effect of climate change. Social implications It suggests that, for adaptation to climate change effects, understanding gender dimensions and taking gender responsive steps be incorporated into GMoU policies and action plans of multinational enterprises. Originality/value This research contributes to gender debate in climate change from a CSR perspective in developing countries and rationale for demands for social projects by host communities. It concludes that business has an obligation to help in solving problems of public concern.","[Uduji, Joseph Ikechukwu] Univ Nigeria, Fac Business Adm, Dept Mkt, Enugu Campus, Nsukka, Nigeria; [Okolo-Obasi, Nduka Elda Nduka] Univ Nigeria, Inst Dev Studies, Enugu Campus, Nsukka, Nigeria",University of Nigeria; University of Nigeria,"Uduji, JI (corresponding author), Univ Nigeria, Fac Business Adm, Dept Mkt, Enugu Campus, Nsukka, Nigeria.",joseph.uduji@gmail.com,,,,,,,59,3,3,2,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2041-2568,2041-2576,,J GLOB RESPONSIB,J.

This includes cost-benefit analysis for large infrastructure projects such as coastal protection. A couple of studies have investigated stability of stated preferences over varying time periods. However, less evidence is available for temporal stability of stated preferences for (dis)amenities in uncertain times, i.e., times that are characterized by larger degrees of uncertainty regarding the (near) future. Using a choice experiment on coastal adaptation to climate change, this paper examines the test-retest reliability of individual preferences and resulting welfare estimates over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic. We do so by surveying the same respondents at two points in time five months apart during the ongoing pandemic. Using a latent class model, we find similar preference heterogeneity patterns but different class sizes. While the welfare measure of an adaptation scenario that focuses on safety increases across survey waves, scenarios that centre on recreation or nature have decreasing welfare effects. This suggests that individuals set other priorities in uncertain times.(c) 2022 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

Sometimes, however, adaptation to climate change may consume energy, threatening efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Examples are numerous, and include the use of air conditioning or water desalination. Nevertheless, no clear view exists on how energy demand globally can be impacted by climate change. In this paper we systematically map existing evidence on how and to what extent adaptation responses to climate change may impact energy demand. The literature is large, fast-growing and spans several disciplines, but we identify several research gaps. First, the literature focuses almost exclusively on heating and cooling demand, while overlooking other potential sectors. It also focuses heavily on a few world regions, while local specific climate and socio-economic conditions may highly influence the impacts, and focuses largely on average demand, while often disregarding peak energy demand. Finally, and most importantly, only a handful of papers-most of them with a specific geographical scope-consider that different adaptation possibilities may lead to different impacts on energy demand, which is an important prerequisite if the impact of adaptation on energy demand is to be lowered and maladaptation to be avoided. The reviewed papers study for the most part similar options, and most adaptation possibilities are conversely studied by just one or two papers.","[Viguie, V.; Juhel, S.; Ben-Ari, T.; Giraudet, L.

This reflective essay begins by delineating three international agreements (the Sustainable Development Goals, New Urban Agenda, and Milan Urban Food Policy Pact) that provide a broad policy environment within which food systems governance might be situated. It then encourages consideration not only of megacities around the globe, but also of the approximately 2 billion people that live in towns and small- or midsized cities (encompassing about 27% of the world's population) (Berdegue, Proctor, & Cazzuffi, 2014). It notes that integration of food systems thinking must enhance urban-rural linkages in mutually supportive ways, echoing recent calls from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO, 2019) and UN-Habitat (2018). It reflects on ways policies and governance might better articulate across scale and argues that deep adaptation to climate change must frame all work moving forward. Finally, it examines how food systems thinking and social innovation are critical to urban resilience and must be prioritized in policymaking rather than included as an afterthought.

The construction or reinforcement of levees can attract more assets and people in flood-prone area, thereby increasing the potential flood damage when levees eventually fail. Moreover, structural protection measures can generate a sense of complacency, which can reduce preparedness, thereby increasing flood mortality rates. We explore these phenomena in the Jamuna River floodplain in Bangladesh. In this study area, different levels of flood protection have co-existed alongside each other since the 1960s, with a levee being constructed only on the right bank and its maintenance being assured only in certain places. Primary and secondary data on population density, human settlements, and flood fatalities were collected to carry out a comparative analysis of two urban areas and two rural areas with different flood protection levels. We found that the higher the level of flood protection, the higher the increase of population density over the past decades as well as the number of assets exposed to flooding. Our results also show that flood mortality rates associated with the 2017 flooding in Bangladesh were lower in the areas with lower protection level. This empirical analysis of the unintended consequences of structural flood protection is relevant for the making of sustainable policies of disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climate change in rapidly changing environments.","[Ferdous, Md Ruknul] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Social & Behav Sci, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Ferdous, Md Ruknul; Di Baldassarre, Giuliano; Wesselink, Anna] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Dept Integrated Water Syst & Governance, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands; [Di Baldassarre, Giuliano] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Di Baldassarre, Giuliano] CNDS, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Brandimarte, Luigia] KTH, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",University of Amsterdam; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; Uppsala University; Centre of Natural Hazards & Disaster Science (CNDS); Royal Institute of Technology,"Di Baldassarre, G (corresponding author), IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Dept Integrated Water Syst & Governance, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands.;Di Baldassarre, G (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.;Di Baldassarre, G (corresponding author), CNDS, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",m.ferdous@un-ihe.org; giuliano.dibaldassarre@geo.uu.se; luigia.brandimarte@abe.kth.se; a.wesselink@un-ihe.org,"Ferdous, Ruknul/AAQ-8025-2020; Di Baldassarre, Giuliano/C-7304-2009","Di Baldassarre, Giuliano/0000-0002-8180-4996",Uppsala University,Uppsala University,Open access funding provided by Uppsala University.,,51,18,18,5,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

To achieve this, a dynamic bioeconomic model and model-based scenarios are considered, in which the stock's growth function depends on the sea surface temperature. The model is empirically calibrated for the French Guiana shrimp fishery using time series collected over the period 1993-2009. Three fishing effort strategies are then compared under two contrasted IPCC climate scenarios (RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6). A first harvesting strategy maintains the Status Quo in terms of fishing effort. A more ecologically-oriented strategy based on the closure of the fishery is also considered. A third strategy, which relates to Maximum Economic Yield (MEY), is based on the optimisation of the net present value derived from fishing. The results first show that 'Status Quo' fishing intensity combined with global warming leads to the collapse of the fishery in the long run. Secondly, it turns out that the Closure strategy preserves stock viability especially under the optimistic climate scenario. Thirdly, the MEY strategy makes it possible to satisfy bioeconomic performances requirements with positive stock and profit, once again, especially under the optimistic warming scenario. Consequently, MEY emerges as a relevant bioeconomic strategy in terms of adaptation to climate change but only in connection with climate change mitigation.","[Diop, Bassirou] CNRS French Natl Ctr Sci Res, LEEISA, UMRS 3456, BP 477, Cayenne 9733, French Guiana; [Sanz, Nicolas] Univ French Guiana, UMRS 3456, LEEISA, Campus Troubiran,BP 20792, Cayenne 97337, French Guiana; [Junior Duplan, Yves Jamont] Univ French Guiana, Campus Troubiran,BP 20792, Cayenne 97337, French Guiana; [Guene, El Hadji Mama] IPR, Rennes, France; [Blanchard, Fabian] Ifremer French Res Inst Exploitat Sea, LEEISA, UMRS 3456, BP 477, Cayenne 97331, French Guiana; [Pereau, Jean-Christophe; Doyen, Luc] Univ Bordeaux, GREThA CNRS French Natl Ctr Sci Res, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France",Ifremer; Ifremer; Universite de Rennes; Ifremer; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux,"Diop, B (corresponding author), CNRS French Natl Ctr Sci Res, LEEISA, UMRS 3456, BP 477, Cayenne 9733, French Guiana.",diop.bassirou@gmail.com,"Doyen, Luc/GXH-3424-2022; Diop, Bassirou Masseck/AAI-2760-2020","Doyen, Luc/0000-0001-8272-6187; Diop, Bassirou Masseck/0000-0001-5361-7336; Blanchard, Fabian/0000-0001-8496-877X; pereau, jean christophe/0000-0003-0761-6994",Belmont Forum [ANR-14-JPF1-0003]; VOGUE; ECOPE (PIG CNRS); OYAMAR (FEDER); ACROSS [ANR-14-CE03-0001],Belmont Forum; VOGUE; ECOPE (PIG CNRS); OYAMAR (FEDER); ACROSS,"This work was carried out with financial support from the Belmont Forum through its funding of the SEAVIEW network (ANR-14-JPF1-0003), as well as from the VOGUE, ECOPE (PIG CNRS), OYAMAR (FEDER), and ACROSS (ANR-14-CE03-0001) research projects.",,55,12,12,3,41,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

These models tend to neglect the impact on vulnerability of local relationships that include political and economic power structures. We use social network analysis to examine the connectivity and positions of vulnerable rural households and their capacity to adapt. We collected empirical data from a community of 58 smallholders in upper west Ghana on external relations with 'local actors' that are independent, operate beyond the community yet have direct relations with the community. These connections provide important resources and knowledge to build adaptive capacity that would not be generated from within the community. Our results highlight that certain external relations expose households to knowledge and other forms of capital, which in turn strengthen their ability to access and mobilise resources to respond to environmental change. However, not all external relations offer equal opportunities, which results in a stratified community and variation in the households' capacity to adapt. The network approach also identifies points where local actors can link communities and households to remote agencies crucial for planning and implementing effective adaptation.

Availability of information, vulnerability of ecological and socio-economic systems, and uncertainties associated with climate change, as well as the interacting non-climatic changes, influence selection of the adaptation approach. Resource assessments are opportunities to develop strategic information that could be used to identify and link adaptation strategies across planning levels. Within a National Forest, planning must incorporate the opportunity to identify vulnerabilities to climate change as well as incorporate approaches that allow management adjustments as the effects of climate change become apparent. The nature of environmental variability, the inevitability of novelty and surprise, and the range of management objectives and situations across the National Forest System implies that no single approach will fit all situations. A toolbox of management options would include practices focused on forestalling climate change effects by building resistance and resilience into current ecosystems, and on managing for change by enabling plants, animals, and ecosystems to adapt to climate change. Better and more widespread implementation of already known practices that reduce the impact of existing stressors represents an important no regrets strategy. These management opportunities will require agency consideration of its adaptive capacity, and ways to overcome potential barriers to these adaptation options.","[Joyce, Linda A.] USFS Rocky Mt Res Stn, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Blate, Geoffrey M.] Chulalongkorn Univ, WWF Greater Mekong Programme, Policy Off, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [McNulty, Steven G.] USFS So Res Stn, So Global Change Program, Raleigh, NC 27606 USA; [Millar, Constance I.] USFS Pacific SW Res Stn, Sierra Nevada Res Ctr, Albany, CA 94710 USA; [Moser, Susanne] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Moser, Susanne] Susanne Moser Res & Consulting, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Neilson, Ronald P.] US Forest Serv, Pacific NW Res Stn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Peterson, David L.] USFS Pacific Wildland Fire Sci Lab, Seattle, WA 98103 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Chulalongkorn University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Joyce, LA (corresponding author), USFS Rocky Mt Res Stn, 240 W Prospect, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA.",ljoyce@fs.fed.us,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","McNulty, Steven/0000-0003-4518-5646",US Forest Service; AAAS Science & Technology Policy; U.S. EPA,US Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); AAAS Science & Technology Policy; U.S. EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"We thank the US Climate Change Science Program and the Lead Authors of Science and Assessment Product 4.4, Susan Julius and Jordan West and the three anonymous reviewers.

The potential of visual communication to accelerate social learning and motivate implementation of the substantial policy, technological, and life-style changes needed, has begun to be recognised. In particular, realistic landscape visualisations may offer special advantages in rapidly advancing peoples' awareness of climate change and possibly affecting behaviour and policy, by bringing certain possible consequences of climate change home to people in a compelling manner. However, few such applications are yet in use, the theoretical basis for the effectiveness of visualisations in this role has not been clearly established, and there are ethical concerns elicited by adopting a persuasive approach which deliberately engages the emotions with visual imagery. These questions and policy implications are discussed in the context of a theoretical framework on the effects of landscape visualisation on a spectrum of responses to climate change information, drawing in part on evidence from other applications of landscape visualisation. The author concludes that the persuasive use of visualisations, together with other approaches, may be effective, is justified, and could be vital in helping communicate climate change effectively, given ethical standards based on disclosure, drama, and defensibility.

We examine the semi-arid Seewinkel region in Austria and explore interactions between climatic, agronomic, hydrological, and socio-economic conditions and processes to provide policy advice. The assessment is conducted with a spatially explicit integrated modeling framework to analyze impacts on land and irrigation water use, land management, and net benefits of agricultural production. The model results show that with imposed groundwater restrictions for irrigation, land use shifts from irrigated vineyards to mostly rainfed cropland with declining regional net benefits of agricultural production. The direction of change is similar for a DRY, SIMILAR, and WET climate scenario, while the magnitude differs. We estimate that an increase of the marginal value of groundwater extraction for irrigation by 0.1 (sic)/m(3) results in an average decrease in groundwater extraction volumes by 17.2 Mm(3) in DRY, 6.3 Mm(3) in SIMILAR, and 6.4 Mm(3) in WET. Furthermore, regional net benefits of agricultural production decrease by 3.4 M(sic) in DRY and SIMILAR, and by 1.6 M(sic) in WET, on average. Our assessment highlights that efficient groundwater policies can help to sustain groundwater availability in semi-arid regions, particularly under climate change.","[Mitter, Hermine; Schmid, Erwin] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Inst Sustainable Econ Dev, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Mitter, H (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Inst Sustainable Econ Dev, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",hermine.mitter@boku.ac.at,"Schmid, Erwin/Z-1946-2019","Schmid, Erwin/0000-0003-4783-9666","project Climate Services for the Water-Energy-Land-Food Nexus (CLISWELN) - ERA4CS; Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research (BMBWF); Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) [863470]; European Union; research project Variability of Groundwater Recharge and its Implication for Sustainable Land Use in Austria (RechAUT) - Austrian Academy of Sciences (OAW) within the Earth System Sciences Initiative; The University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (BOKU)","project Climate Services for the Water-Energy-Land-Food Nexus (CLISWELN) - ERA4CS; Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research (BMBWF); Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG); European Union(European Commission); research project Variability of Groundwater Recharge and its Implication for Sustainable Land Use in Austria (RechAUT) - Austrian Academy of Sciences (OAW) within the Earth System Sciences Initiative; The University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (BOKU)","This research was supported by the project Climate Services for the Water-Energy-Land-Food Nexus (CLISWELN) funded by ERA4CS.

Large amounts of earth observations from space have been collected over the last five decades and while most of the measurements have not been designed specifically for monitoring urban areas, an increasing number of these observations is being used for understanding the growth rates of cities and their environmental impacts. Here we reviewed the existing tools available from satellite remote sensing to study urban contribution to climate change, which could be used for monitoring the progress of climate change mitigation strategies at the city level. We described earth observations that are suitable for measuring and monitoring urban population, extent, and structure; urban emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants; urban energy consumption; and extent, intensity, and effects on surrounding regions, including nearby water bodies, of urban heat islands. We compared the observations available and obtainable from space with the measurements desirable for monitoring. Despite considerable progress in monitoring urban extent, structure, heat island intensity, and air pollution from space, many limitations and uncertainties still need to be resolved. We emphasize that some important variables, such as population density and urban energy consumption, cannot be suitably measured from space with available observations.","[Milesi, Cristina] CropSnap LLC, Sunnyvale, CA 94087 USA; [Milesi, Cristina] Foothill Coll, Los Altos Hills, CA 94022 USA; [Churkina, Galina] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Milesi, C (corresponding author), CropSnap LLC, Sunnyvale, CA 94087 USA.;Milesi, C (corresponding author), Foothill Coll, Los Altos Hills, CA 94022 USA.",cmilesi@cropsnap.com; galina@churkina.org,,,Laudes Foundation,Laudes Foundation,G.C. acknowledges the support of the Laudes Foundation while working on this study.

Yet, the participation of local firms is still lacking, and little is known about the conditions potentially influencing firms' adaptation decisions and mechanisms that might encourage private sector engagement. We address this gap with an empirical analysis of the willingness of manufacturing small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to participate financially in collective flood adaptation in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), a hotspot of future climate change risk. Using scenario-based field experiments, we shed light on internal and external conditions that influence potential investments in collective initiatives and explain what role SMEs can play in flood adaptation. We find that direct impacts of floods, perceived self-responsibility, and strong local ties motivate firms to participate in collective adaptation, whereas government support, sufficient financial resources, and previously implemented flood protection strategies reduce the necessity to act collectively. Here, opportunity costs and the handling of other business risks play a decisive role in investment decisions. This study shows that although private sector engagement appears to be a promising approach, it is not a panacea. Collective initiatives on flood adaptation need formal guidance and should involve local business networks and partnerships to give voice to the needs and capacities of SMEs, but such initiatives should not overstretch firms' responsibilities.","[Leitold, Roxana; Revilla Diez, Javier] Univ Cologne, Inst Geog, Cologne, Germany; [Tran, Van] Univ Econ & Law, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Tran, Van] Vietnam Natl Univ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",University of Cologne; VNUHCM - University of Economics & Law; Vietnam National University Hochiminh City,"Leitold, R (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Geog, Cologne, Germany.",r.leitold@uni-koeln.de,"Revilla Diez, Javier/J-2392-2019","Revilla Diez, Javier/0000-0003-2065-1380; Leitold, Roxana/0000-0002-2946-6774; Tran, Van Quang/0000-0002-5407-5038","Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LZ1703D]; University of Economics and Law, Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Projekt DEAL","Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); University of Economics and Law, Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Projekt DEAL","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

Urban heat islands have been shown to increase thermal discomfort, which increases heat stress and heat-related diseases. In Kuwait, a hyper-arid desert climate, most of the population lives in urban and suburban areas. In this study, we characterized the spatial distribution of land surface temperatures and investigated the presence of urban heat and cool effects in Kuwait. We used historical Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra satellite 8-day composite land surface temperature (LST) from 2001 to 2017. We calculated the average LSTs of the urban/suburban governorates and compared them to the average LSTs of the rural and barren lands. We repeated the analysis for daytime and nighttime LST. During the day, the temperature difference (urban/suburban minus versus governorates) was -1.1 degrees C (95% CI; -1.2, -1.00, p < 0.001) indicating a daytime urban cool island. At night, the temperature difference (urban/suburban versus rural governorates) became 3.6 degrees C (95% CI; 3.5, 3.7, p < 0.001) indicating a nighttime urban heat island. In light of rising temperatures in Kuwait, this work can inform climate change adaptation efforts in the country including urban planning policies, but also has the potential to improve temperature exposure assessment for future population health studies.","[Alahmad, Barrak; Tomasso, Linda Powers; James, Peter; Koutrakis, Petros] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Alahmad, Barrak] Kuwait Univ, Fac Publ Hlth, Environm & Occupat Hlth Dept, Kuwait 24923, Kuwait; [Al-Hemoud, Ali] Kuwait Inst Sci Res, Environm & Life Sci Res Ctr, Kuwait 24885, Kuwait; [James, Peter] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Populat Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [James, Peter] Harvard Pilgrim Hlth Care Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

In order to aid decision making in terms of prioritising adaptation action or allocating resources for adaptation measures, both scholars and policy makers emphasise the need for comprehensive and spatially explicit vulnerability studies. Adaptive capacity is not only an important part of vulnerability assessments, it also underlies and enables the governing of adaptation activities, thus making it an issue relevant to policy. Hence, the assessment of adaptive capacity gives decision makers on international, national and regional level important information to develop adaptation policy. Drawing on current vulnerability and adaptive capacity studies, the objective of this paper is to present a framework that structures adaptive capacity assessments based on science-policy interaction, discussing the objectives of the assessment, the methodology and the use of results. The framework is applied to two examples: a pan-European assessment of adaptive capacity and an assessment of the adaptive capacity of the tourism sector in the European Alps, both on the regional level. The main findings show how decisions related to methodology can influence the use of results in decision making. In conclusion, this paper contributes to the literature by arguing that more attention needs to be paid to assessment design in order to better support the mobilisation of adaptive capacity for adaptation.","[Juhola, Sirkku] Aalto Univ, Dept Real Estate Planning & Geoinformat, Espoo 00076, Finland; [Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Kruse, Sylvia] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Aalto University; University of Helsinki; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Juhola, S (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Dept Real Estate Planning & Geoinformat, POB 12200, Espoo 00076, Finland.",sirkku.juhola@aalto.fi; sylvia.kruse@wsl.ch,"Kruse, Sylvia/E-7096-2014; Juhola, Sirkku/GVS-5485-2022","Juhola, Sirkku/0000-0003-0095-2282",ESPON; COST Action [IS0802]; Aalto University,ESPON; COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)); Aalto University,"The authors thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments.

Indeed, mitigative and adaptive capacities only represent the potential to achieve the ultimate goals of greenhouse gas and vulnerability reduction. This paper builds on previous explorations of barriers to identify powerful levers by which action can be triggered and sustained at the local level through the study of three municipalities in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada. The necessity of an explicitly articulated high-level directive, leadership that stimulates an organizational culture of innovation and collaboration, and the 'institutionalization' of climate change response measures within standard operating procedures emerged as crucial enablers of action. Addressing a lack of technical, financial, or human resources is less a matter of creating more capacity than of facilitating the effective use of existing resources. This facilitation depends most fundamentally on re-working the path dependent institutional structures, organizational culture and policy-making procedures that have characterized the unsuccessful patterns of climate change policy development in the past. The ultimate goal is to contribute to the ongoing efforts to adapt institutions to the complex and uncertain futures associated with a changing climate, while simultaneously embedding broader sustainability goals in long-range strategic planning.

Vulnerability assessments identify and characterize who and what are sensitive to climatic risks and why, characterize adaptive capacity and its determinants, and identify opportunities for adaptation. This paper examines the importance of case study and analogue methodologies in vulnerability research, reviews the historical evolution of the two methodologies in the HDCC field, and identifies ways in which they can be used to increase our understanding of vulnerability. Case studies involve in-depth place-based research that focuses on a particular exposure unit (e. g., community, industry, etc.) to characterize vulnerability and its determinants. Temporal analogues use past and present experiences and responses to climatic variability, change and extremes to provide insights for vulnerability to climate change; spatial analogues involve conducting research in one region and identifying parallels to how another region might be affected by climate change. Vulnerability research that uses case studies and analogues can help to develop an understanding of the determinants of vulnerability and how they interact, and identify opportunities to reduce vulnerability and enhance adaptive capacity to current and future climate risks. This information can assist policy makers in developing adaptation plans and to mainstream climate change adaptation into other policy-and decision-making processes. (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Regional differences in microbiome composition and associated phytopathogens need to be considered. However, most empirical studies on differences in the crop microbiome focused on soil communities, with insufficient attention to the phyllosphere. In this study, we focused on wheat ears in three regions in northeastern Germany (Magdeburger Borde (MBB), Muncheberger Sander (MSA), Uckermarkisches Hugelland (UKH)) with different yield potentials, soil, and climatic conditions. To gain insight into the fungal community at different sites, we used a metabarcoding approach (ITS-NGS). Further, we examined the diversity and abundance of Fusarium and Alternaria using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. For each region, the prevalence of different orders rich in phytopathogenic fungi was determined: Sporidiobolales in MBB, Capnodiales and Pleosporales in MSA, and Hypocreales in UKH were identified as taxonomic biomarkers. Additionally, F. graminearum was found predominantly in UKH, whereas F. poae was more abundant in the other two regions. Environmental filters seem to be strong drivers of these differences, but we also discuss the possible effects of dispersal and interaction filters. Our results can guide shifting cultivation regions to be selected in the future concerning their phytopathogenic infection potential.","[Hoffmann, Annika; Lewin, Simon; Verch, Gernot; Mueller, Marina E.

Much has been written about the physiological consequences of climate change for older individuals, particularly the dangers of increased incidence of severe heat. Less is known about how older people's residential settings moderate their exposure to climate stressors, their particular sensitivities to the effects of climate change, or their capacities to respond to extreme events or adapt to long-term environmental changes. Drawing on literature in English, with a focus on work relevant to the United States, we examine how the housing, neighborhood, and urban or rural contexts in which older people live shape their experiences of climate change, moderating their exposure to risks related to climate change, sensitivity to those events and trends, and their capacities to adapt and recover. Older people face multiple life changes, making prioritizing climate readiness more challenging. They are also diverse, with different vulnerabilities and perceptions of risks and the ability to manage them. This paper lays out an agenda where additional research can inform policy and planning efforts aimed at reducing older individuals' risk and building the capacity to adapt to climate change. The agenda includes understanding specific vulnerabilities and how older people and their housing providers are already responding.","[Molinsky, Jennifer] Harvard Univ, Joint Ctr Housing Studies, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Forsyth, Ann] Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Design, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Harvard University,"Molinsky, J (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Joint Ctr Housing Studies, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jennifer_molinsky@harvard.edu,,"Molinsky, Jennifer/0000-0002-4245-3142",Center for Green Buildings at Harvard University,Center for Green Buildings at Harvard University,This work was supported by the Center for Green Buildings at Harvard University.,,118,0,0,9,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1051-1482,2152-050X,,HOUS POLICY DEBATE,Hous.

The response, adaptation, and feedback of tree growth in forest ecosystems to global warming and CO2 enrichment are urgent scientific issues. Intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) is an important indicator for understanding forest ecosystem adaptability to climate change and CO2 enrichment. In this study, tree-ring width, tree-ring stable carbon isotope ratio (delta C-13), and iWUE of P. tabulaeformis Carr. were established. Climate response analysis showed that temperature was the main limiting factor affecting radial tree growth and that relative humidity significantly affected the stable carbon isotope fractionation of tree rings. During 1645-2011, the iWUE increased by 27.1%. The responses of iWUE to climate factors and atmospheric CO2 concentrations (C-a) showed that the long-term variation in iWUE was affected by C-a, which could explain 69% of iWUE variation, and temperature was the main factor causing iWUE interannual variation. The ecosystem of P. tabulaeformis showed a positive response to rising C-a, as its carbon sequestration capacity increased. In response to global warming and CO2 enrichment, rising C-a promoted increases in iWUE but ultimately failed to offset the negative impact of warming on tree growth in the study area.","[Ren, Meng; Liu, Yu; Cai, Qiufang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Earth Environm, State Key Lab Loess & Quaternary Geol, Xian 710061, Peoples R China; [Ren, Meng] Xian Inst Innovat Earth Environm Res, Xian 710061, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yu] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Quaternary Sci & Global Change, Xian 710061, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yu; Li, Qiang; Song, Huiming; Sun, Changfeng] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Human Settlements & Civil Engn, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yu; Cai, Qiufang] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Earth Environment, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xi'an Jiaotong University; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology","Liu, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Earth Environm, State Key Lab Loess & Quaternary Geol, Xian 710061, Peoples R China.;Liu, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Quaternary Sci & Global Change, Xian 710061, Peoples R China.;Liu, Y (corresponding author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Human Settlements & Civil Engn, Xian 710049, Peoples R China.;Liu, Y (corresponding author), Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China.",renmeng@ieecas.cn; liuyu@loess.llqg.ac.cn; liqiang@ieecas.cn; songhm@ieecas.cn; caiqf@ieecas.cn; suncf@ieecas.cn,"Sun, Changfeng/X-2375-2019","Sun, Changfeng/0000-0001-8648-8120; cai, qiu fang/0000-0003-2964-6553; Li, Qiang/0000-0001-7763-8115","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41630531, U1803245, 32061123008]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB40000000]; State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Institute of Earth Environment, CAS [SKLLQG2022]; 2nd Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0101]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Institute of Earth Environment, CAS(Chinese Academy of Sciences); 2nd Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.

Due to path dependencies, perennial crop farmers often face a confined set of adaptation options. This paper explores the potential for index-based weather insurance for cocoa as an example of a perennial crop. The paper presents empirical findings on determinants of interest in index insurance based on a sample of 313 cocoa farming households in Ghana. Further, results of key informant interviews with representatives relevant for the planning and implementation of index insurance are presented. A key finding on the demand side is that more than 90% of the sampled cocoa farmers are interested in index insurance. The main determinants for interest were ownership of the cocoa farm, access to extension services, and age of the cocoa farm. For the supply side, main findings are that while stakeholders showed a general appreciation of the conceptual benefits of index insurance, a plethora of disadvantages and obstacles relating to insurance implementation were mentioned ranging from insufficient data and infrastructure, over low profitability, to wrong perceptions of insurance among farmers. The paper concludes that structural changes to the cocoa economy are necessary to address these impediments in the long run.","[Afriyie-Kraft, Lydia; Zabel, Astrid] Bern Univ Appl Sci, Sch Agr Forest & Food Sci, Bern, Switzerland; [Zabel, Astrid] Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, Bern, Switzerland; [Damnyag, Lawrence] CSIR, Forestry Res Inst Ghana, UP POB 63, Kumasi, Ghana",University of Bern,"Afriyie-Kraft, L (corresponding author), Bern Univ Appl Sci, Sch Agr Forest & Food Sci, Bern, Switzerland.",afriyielydia@ymail.com,,"Zabel, Astrid/0000-0002-3953-7505",African Forest Forum,African Forest Forum,"We appreciate the African Forest Forum for providing the financial support for this study.

However, the potential for evolutionary adaptation in kelp to rapid climate change is not well known. This study examined family-level variation in physiological and photosynthetic traits in the early life-cycle stages of the ecologically important Australasian kelp Ecklonia radiata and the response of E. radiata families to different temperature and light environments using a family x environment design. There was strong family-level variation in traits relating to morphology (surface area measures, branch length, branch count) and photosynthetic performance (F-v/F-m) in both haploid (gametophyte) and diploid (sporophyte) stages of the life-cycle. Additionally, the presence of family x environment interactions showed that offspring from different families respond differently to temperature and light in the branch length of male gametophytes and oogonia surface area of female gametophytes. Negative responses to high temperatures were stronger for females vs. males. Our findings suggest E. radiata may be able to respond adaptively to climate change but studies partitioning the narrow vs. broad sense components of heritable variation are needed to establish the evolutionary potential of E. radiata to adapt under climate change.","[Mabin, Christopher J.

Studies into tourism adaptation within the Swiss Alps have so far focused on the technical adaptation options of alpine stakeholders, rather than perceptions of adaptation to climate change at the operational and community level. This article investigates attitudes to adaptation in two alpine regions within Switzerland's well-established decentralized political framework, through semi-structured qualitative interviews. Stakeholders focused almost entirely on maintaining the status quo of winter tourism, through technical or marketing measures, with mixed attitudes towards climatic impacts. A matrix based on the relative internal strengths and weaknesses, external opportunities and threats of adaptation measures (a SWOT framework) was used to assess the measures and suggest how stakeholders could capitalize on the new opportunities thrown up by climate change to create a competitive advantage. A comprehensive and collaborative planning approach is vital to enable policy makers and stakeholders to maximize opportunities, minimize the adverse effects of climate change on the local economy, and develop inclusive adaptation measures that benefit the entire region in order to create more sustainable social, economic and environmental structures.","[Hill, Margot] Univ Geneva, Res Grp Climate Change & Climate Impacts, CH-1227 Geneva, Switzerland; [Wallner, Astrid] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Ctr Dev & Environm, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Furtado, Jose] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Environm Policy, London SW7 2AZ, England",University of Geneva; University of Bern; Imperial College London,"Hill, M (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Res Grp Climate Change & Climate Impacts, CH-1227 Geneva, Switzerland.",margot.hill@unige.ch,,,,,,,58,18,19,2,51,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

A total of 52 SI annual documents from ten utilities were analyzed. Six of their managers were interviewed in depth. One of the ten utilities studied was green on the parameter CA and FS. Flooding events in two utilities drove climate adaptation. The formation of an interdisciplinary group in two organizations had a major impact on their success. Two utilities focused on low-lying sites and enclosed spaces. Three believed capacity building increased their chances of success. The biggest challenge was sharing responsibility. That only 2% of municipal water and wastewater utilities are green is not the whole truth. Therefore, there should be other factors in SI that measure performance in CA and FS. To improve the results, new laws are needed to solve the problem of shared responsibility.","[Najar, Nasik] Jonkoping Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Construct Engn & Lighting Sci, POB 1026, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden; [Persson, Kenneth M.] Lund Univ, Div Water Resources Engn, POB 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Jonkoping University; Lund University,"Najar, N (corresponding author), Jonkoping Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Construct Engn & Lighting Sci, POB 1026, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden.",nasik.najar@ju.se,,"Persson, Kenneth/0000-0002-2190-7758; Najar, Nasik/0000-0002-7206-1342","Department of Civil Engineering and Lighting Science, School of Engineering, Jonkoping University","Department of Civil Engineering and Lighting Science, School of Engineering, Jonkoping University","The authors acknowledge the funding from the research program Mistra InfraMaint.

This is not a recent issue and the co-production of knowledge, that goes beyond the traditional realms of 'science speaks to power', can only fully inform adequate and robust adaptation if it incorporates more practitioners, end-users, and those working at the interface of science, policy and practice. Through a high-level analysis of authors of the IPCC's Working Group II reports and special reports of AR6, we explore the evolution of representation of practitioners in IPCC WGII author teams from AR5 to AR6 and we find that practitioner representation has increased in AR6, however this remains low. We discuss how this low representation can affect readership and the potential to inform climate adaptation practice. As the IPCC evolves and reflects on its own practices, we seek to inform this process by providing further reflection on how the IPCC outputs can continue to be policy-relevant and maintain neutrality while ensuring accesibility and usability by climate adaptation practitioners.","[Howarth, Candice] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Viner, David] CGG, Crompton Way, Crawley RH10 9QN, West Sussex, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Howarth, C (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England.",c.howarth@lse.ac.uk,,,UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES/S008381/1],UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),The authors gratefully acknowledge support from the UK Economic and Social Research Council through the Place-Based Climate Action Network (PCAN) (Ref.

This study assessed the vulnerability to climate change impacts of selected small-scale shrimp farms of Penaeus vannamei and shrimpfish market vendors in the Davao region, the Philippines, using a modified Fisheries Vulnerability Assessment Tool (FishVool). Shrimp farmers and vendors were interviewed using two separate semi-structured questionnaires. A total of thirty-nine (n = 39) shrimp farmers and forty-eight (n = 48) market vendors from various market areas within the region were interviewed. Data regarding exposure (E), sensitivity (S), and adaptive capacity (AC) were collected following the FishVool parameters with modifications. Results revealed that the overall climate change vulnerability of the shrimp farmers was medium (M), where both exposure and adaptive capacity were low (L) while sensitivity was medium (M). In addition, the shrimp market vulnerability of the various sites examined revealed medium (M) scores for markets in Pantukan, Mabini, Tagum, Maco, Lupon, Davao City, and Digos, and high (H) vulnerability scores for the markets in Panabo and Sta Cruz. Overall, the study provided a better understanding of shrimp farming in relation to climate change impacts and vulnerability and provided information for future shrimp farm management, marketing, and climate change adaptation in the region.","[Macusi, Edison D.; Aymie Albarido, Nitcel; Clapano, Misael B.] Davao Oriental State Univ DOrSU, Inst Agr & Life Sci IALS, Shrimp Vulnerabil Assessment Project, Mati City 8200, Philippines; [Santos, Mudjekeewis D.] Natl Fisheries Res Dev Inst NFRDI, 101 Mother Ignacia St, Quezon City 1008, Philippines",,"Macusi, ED (corresponding author), Davao Oriental State Univ DOrSU, Inst Agr & Life Sci IALS, Shrimp Vulnerabil Assessment Project, Mati City 8200, Philippines.",edison.macusi@dorsu.edu.ph; cutenitcel23@gmail.com; loymbc@yahoo.com; mudjiesantos@gmail.com,"Macusi, Edison/M-8235-2015","Macusi, Edison/0000-0002-9714-1074",DA-PRDP (Department of Agriculture-Philippine Rural Development Plan) through the project entitled: Vulnerability assessment of Pacific Whiteleg Shrimp,DA-PRDP (Department of Agriculture-Philippine Rural Development Plan) through the project entitled: Vulnerability assessment of Pacific Whiteleg Shrimp,The funding for this study was provided by DA-PRDP (Department of Agriculture-Philippine Rural Development Plan) through the project entitled: Vulnerability assessment of Pacific Whiteleg Shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) and associated species through the fisheries value-chain in Davao region.,,74,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2022,14,8,,,,,,,4541,10.3390/su14084541,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14084541,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0Q9TG,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000785250800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: A mixed-methods online survey, assessing broader governance constraints to climate change adaptation (CCA) for public health, was distributed to representatives of national public health associations, and societies of 82 member countries under the World Federation of Public Health Associations. Specific questions relevant to disaster risk management capacities and barriers were analyzed as part of a narrowed focus on the CCA subdomain of emergency preparedness. Results: Existence of some technology, infrastructure, and/ or human resources, necessary to develop early warning and other surveillance systems for climate-related health risks was reported by 9 out of 11 responding countries. However, 7 reported persistent limitations and/ or regional discrepancies. Most significant identified barriers to strengthening emergency preparedness at the national level included governance coordination challenges, and, in the case of many developing countries, technical, medical, and human resource shortages. Conclusions: The development of new frameworks for intersectoral governance and large-scale resource mobilization will prove crucial to ongoing efforts to strengthen national climate-health resiliency and prepare for disaster-associated health threats.","[Marcus, Hannah] Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Marcus, Hannah; Hanna, Liz] World Federat Publ Hlth Assoc, Environm Hlth Working Grp, Geneva, Switzerland; [Hanna, Liz] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Alberta; Australian National University,"Hanna, L (corresponding author), World Federat Publ Hlth Assoc, Environm Hlth Working Grp, Geneva, Switzerland.;Hanna, L (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",liz.hanna@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,10,0,0,1,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1935-7893,1938-744X,,DISASTER MED PUBLIC,Dis.

The analysis of the climatic variables shows that there are three climatic zones existing in the basin. The trend in the historic climatic variables is estimated using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and the Sen slope analysis. A discrete wavelet analysis is also performed to separate only the long period component of the signal, and its trend is also studied. A significant decreasing trend is observed in the rainfall. However, a monotonous long-term increasing trend is detected for monthly average temperatures and monthly minimum temperatures. The sequential Mann-Kendall test result shows a significant change in the climatic pattern after 1980. The rainfall effectiveness of the basin is analyzed using indices. A drought analysis is also conducted using Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) in different time scales since climatic zones 2 and 3 in the catchment are drought-prone areas in recent years. A detailed analysis on the existence of climate change in this region is conducted for the first time.

Despite wheat being the second most important staple food, any rigorous analysis of its sensitivity to climate change remains an unexplored area of research. This paper fills this gap by investigating wheat yield sensitivity to climate change over time and across climatic zones using 45-year district level panel data. Results revealed rising trends in average seasonal temperature and number of seasonal dry days and downward trends in planting and flowering stage rainfall. The rise in average temperature and number of dry days adversely affected wheat yield while greater planting and flowering stage rainfall has improved yield. Significant variations across regions and a positive trend over time were evident. The study's policy implications are explored in terms of the potential to expand wheat cultivation and its role in achieving SDG 2 regarding food security and SDG 6 concerning sustainable water management. Strengthening institutional support systems, market accessibility, science-driven climate change adaptations - including generation and dissemination of drought tolerant wheat varieties and enhancing farmers' capacity to switch from rice to wheat, constitute key areas of policy intervention critically important for achieving SDG 2 and SDG 6.","[Hasan, M.

These communities have long been the targets of urban development and 'modernisation' efforts; more recently the erasure of informal settlements from Philippine cities is being bolstered at the behest of climate change adaptation and disaster risk management (DRM) agendas. In Metro Cebu, flood management has been at the heart of DRM and broader urban development discussions, and is serving as justification for the demolition and displacement of informal settler communities in areas classed as 'danger zones'. Using Kusno's (2010) interpretation of the 'exemplary centre' as a point of departure, this paper interrogates the relationship between DRM, worlding aspirations (Roy and Ong, 2011) and market-oriented urbanisation in Cebu, and considers the socio-spatial implications of these intersecting processes for urban poor communities. Through analysing the contradictions inherent in framings of certain bodies and spaces as being 'of risk' or 'at risk' over others, I argue that the epistemologies of modernity, disaster risk and resilience endorsed and propagated by the state are facilitating processes of displacement and dispossession that serve elite commercial interests under the auspices of disaster resilience and pro-poor development.","[Ramalho, Jordana] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Ramalho, J (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",j.r.ramalho@lse.ac.uk,"Ramalho, Jordana/AAP-4315-2021","Ramalho, Jordana/0000-0003-4614-968X",ESRC Postgraduate Award [ES/J500070/1]; FORGE,ESRC Postgraduate Award; FORGE,"This paper draws on research conducted for my PhD, funded by an ESRC Postgraduate Award (ES/J500070/1) offered by the Department of Geography, London School of Economics and Political Science, for a thesis provisionally entitled: Risk, Resilience and Responsibilisation: Gendered Participation and Empowerment in Informal Settlements of Metro Cebu, the Philippines'.

Web-based access to hydrological data and nationwide modelling results can support adaptive and integrated management and learning about the flood risks on catchment scale. This can help identify cost-efficient solutions with synergy to other policy goals. The study shows how social media and digitalisation initiatives in the Nordic countries can support web-based access to historical data, real-time forecasts, and climate projections. Furthermore, the web-based access to data and model results can provide a coherent and integrated platform for stakeholder interaction and co-production for planning and decision-making that integrate hazard and risk knowledge.

Recently, many Canadian cities have started to pay attention to climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. They need policy-relevant data and analysis in these efforts. The current data mostly focuses on the consideration of greenhouse gas emissions levels rather than providing specific adaptation strategies on the urban scale. In this research, we analyze and demonstrate how street vegetation planting, albedo and urban canopy characteristics affect urban climate in a specific Canadian city, Montreal. We use ENVI-met (a three-dimensional computer model which analyzes micro-scale thermal interactions within urban environments) to calculate the sky view factor (SVF) for a 300 m x 300 m section of the city, and simulate the environmental conditions including air temperature (Ta), human weighted mean radiant temperature (MRTh-w), wind speed, and physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) at the community scale. These simulation comparisons demonstrate the effects on each environmental factor for a typical summer day and provide hints for mitigation of the urban heat island (UHI) and new urban development. The effectiveness of each UHI mitigation strategy is evaluated for providing guidelines for policy development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using multinomial logit model, I regress climate variables and other household level socioeconomic factors on crop choice. This regression result implies that crop choice is climate-sensitive. Households in the high rainfall areas choose rain-fed Aman rice as their dominant crop while farmers of low rainfall areas select irrigation based Boro rice. Using the estimated results,! simulate the impact of different climate change scenarios on crop choice and find that a shift in crop choices will take place in Bangladesh. Especially, temperature increase will upset rainfed Aman rice crop choice and make the farmers to choose irrigation based Boro, Aus and other crops. Unlike temperature, rainfall scenarios are not damaging for rain-fed rice crop choice. This paper also unveils a shortcoming of structural stability between different single cross-sectional models to simulate the effect of climate change scenarios on crop choice.

This study seeks to examine which areas are becoming warmer and experiencing drought, with a particular focus on Africa, in light of its low historical emissions but poor economic capacity for mitigation and adaptation to climate change, and Morocco, whose conditional goal, which will be achieved with foreign assistance, is rated as almost sufficient but is not yet in compliance with the Paris Agreement's goal. We also explore the consistency and sources of uncertainty in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models and analyze what changes from CMIP5-whose projections are based on the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)-to Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs)-based scenarios for CMIP6. We find that strong forcing, with no additional climate policies, is projected to raise the mean annual temperature over Morocco for the long-term period by 6.25 degrees C. All CMIP6 models agree that warming (resp. drought) will be greater over land masses and poles (resp. tropical and coastal regions) than over oceans and equatorial regions (resp. high latitudes, equatorial, and monsoon zones), but less so on the intensity of changes.","[Bouramdane, Ayat-Allah] Int Univ Rabat IUR, Higher Sch Energy Engn, Technopolis Rabat Shore Rocade Rabat Sale, Rabat 11103, Morocco",,"Bouramdane, AA (corresponding author), Int Univ Rabat IUR, Higher Sch Energy Engn, Technopolis Rabat Shore Rocade Rabat Sale, Rabat 11103, Morocco.",ayatallahbouramdane@gmail.com,,"Bouramdane, Ayat-allah/0000-0003-3613-955X",,,,,116,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2023,15,1,,,,,,,690,10.3390/su15010690,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15010690,,,32,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,7S9TS,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000911094100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

By diversifying cropping systems at several scales there is potential to decrease reliance on inputs, provide resilience to abiotic and biotic stress, enhance plant, microbe and animal biodiversity, and mitigate against climate change. In this review we highlight the research performed in Scotland over the past 5 years into the impact of the use of ecological principles in agriculture on sustainability, resilience and provision of ecosystem functions. We demonstrate that diversification of the system can enhance ecosystem functions. Soil and plant management interventions, including nature-based solutions, can also enhance soil quality and utilization of legacy nutrients. Additionally, this is facilitated by greater reliance on soil biological processes and trophic interactions. We highlight the example of intercropping with legumes to deliver sustainability through ecological principles and use legumes as an exemplar of the innovation. We conclude that there are many effective interventions that can be made to deliver resilient, sustainable, and diverse agroecosystems for crop and food production, and these may be applicable in any agroecosystem.

A concurrent mixed method research approach was undertaken. Qualitative data were obtained through five focus group discussions and a semi-structured questionnaire was used to obtain quantitative data from 208 female farmers. The chi-square test of independence analysis showed that the climate change awareness level and the adaptation measures were significantly related to the educational level and geographic location of the female farmers. Moreover, 84% of the respondents considered the national government social grant as a major means of income and not farming. Although 53% of the respondents were not aware of the term 'climate change', the female farmers confirmed having observed variance in temperature and rainfall over the years which they regarded as natural phenomena. Inadequate knowledge of climate change and limited access to credit facilities affected the respondents' capacity to adapt to climate change. The study concluded that climate change awareness level among female farmers influences their adaptation measures against climate change. The study recommends the promotion of farmer-to-farmer extension and intensification of extension services in the study area to enhance the level of awareness of climate change through physical interaction with the farmers.","[Obisesan, Michael; Chitakira, Munyaradzi] Univ South Africa, Dept Environm Sci, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Obisesan, M (corresponding author), Univ South Africa, Dept Environm Sci, Pretoria, South Africa.",mikeo2002uk@yahoo.co.uk,"Chitakira, Munyaradzi/P-7600-2019; chitakira, munyaradzi/P-1708-2017","Chitakira, Munyaradzi/0000-0002-2848-1008; chitakira, munyaradzi/0000-0002-2848-1008",,,,,37,2,2,4,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2042-1338,2042-1346,,AFR J SCI TECHNOL IN,Afr.

The aim is to focus on tourism stakeholders' values and ideas about tourism entrepreneurship, which may bring interesting new insights to the tourism and climate change research and support the industry in adaptation and mitigation processes. The data utilised in this paper consists of 19 thematic interviews conducted with nature-based tourism entrepreneurs in Finland between 2009 and 2013. Analysis of the data reveal issues concerning views on entrepreneurship in general, on the independence and individuality of the enterprises, on the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders in the processes of adaptation and on the attitudes towards innovations and actions in the changing climate. These issues, together with the rate and scale of the change, seem to affect decision-making by the enterprises, but their importance as predictors of action and behavioural intentions needs to be studied more thoroughly. Additionally, more information is required regarding the role of the surrounding social environment as a co-creator of these kinds of values. However, the study supports previous studies on entrepreneurship and its influence on survival and resilience.","[Tervo-Kankare, Kaarina] Univ Oulu, Geog Res Unit, POB 3000, Oulu 90014, Finland",University of Oulu,"Tervo-Kankare, K (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Geog Res Unit, POB 3000, Oulu 90014, Finland.",kaarina.tervo-kankare@oulu.fi,,"Tervo-Kankare, Kaarina/0000-0003-1518-794X","Academy of Finland under the FiDiPro programme 'Human-Environment Relations in the North: resource development, climate change and resilience'; Academy of Finland under the CLICHE-project (Impacts of Climate Change on Arctic Environment, Ecosystem Services and Society)","Academy of Finland under the FiDiPro programme 'Human-Environment Relations in the North: resource development, climate change and resilience'; Academy of Finland under the CLICHE-project (Impacts of Climate Change on Arctic Environment, Ecosystem Services and Society)","This paper is based on research funded by the Academy of Finland under the FiDiPro programme 'Human-Environment Relations in the North: resource development, climate change and resilience', and under the CLICHE-project (Impacts of Climate Change on Arctic Environment, Ecosystem Services and Society).

The space of knowledge flows functions as a system of networks where knowledge is transmitted around different alignments of agents in distant places. Scholars argue that the concept of urban resilience combines local and extra-local competencies to develop an inter-city system, this is a major strategy for cities to mitigate and adapt to climate change and economic recession. Little attention has been given to the role of networks in co-invention and few empirical studies have been conducted. This article provides insights into the structure of inter-city networks of co-invention by examining the relative importance of the network compared with spatial proximity in biotechnology co-patenting across 150 American cities from 1983 to 2013. Results show that the U.S. inter-city structure gradually becomes more explicit, apparent, and identifiable in the network-based system. Network proximity better defines the biotechnology co-patenting relationships among the U.S. cities compared with spatial proximity. The current inter-city networks of co-invention are mostly regional, with some national but few local ties. This structure provides a way to develop mitigation and adaptation policies for climate disasters or economic recessions.","[Lee, Der-Shiuan] Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Dev Management, Taipei 11114, Taiwan",Chinese Culture University,"Lee, DS (corresponding author), Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Dev Management, Taipei 11114, Taiwan.",ldx2@g.pccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,100,10,10,6,35,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2018,10,2,,,,,,,289,10.3390/su10020289,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10020289,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FX3BB,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000425943100014,View Full Record in Web of Science

The construction of stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) entails a series of life cycle environmental impacts but also implies avoided burdens, such as replacing urban infrastructure after flooding. The aim of this paper is to integrate flood damage prevention into the life cycle assessment (LCA) of BMPs for quantifying their net environmental impact (NEI) and environmental payback (EP) from a consequential LCA standpoint. As a case study, the application of a filter, swale and infiltration trench (FST) in a Brazilian neighborhood was assessed considering a high-intensity rainfall event. The potential avoided impacts were related to cars and sidewalks that were not destroyed due to flooding. In terms of CO(2)eq. emissions, the environmental investment related to the FST was recovered when the destruction of one car or 84 m(2) of sidewalk was prevented. The NEI of the FSTs resulted in significant impact reductions (up to 700%) with respect to not accounting for the avoided products. This approach can be implemented to any type of BMP, and more accurate estimations can be made with data for different events and different types of material damage. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, palaeohydrology and palaeoflood hydrology have demonstrated effective means to estimate the magnitude and frequency of past extremes under climate variability, as well as deterministic and probabilistic methodologies to analyse geophysical hazards. These past hydrological events may not give direct analogues for global change impacts, but many useful indicators and considerable benefits can be gained from combining research results from time periods greater than instrumented records. Three phases of palaeohydrology are proposed and a fourth phase could see significant developments using multidisciplinary research. A preliminary SWOT analysis for palaeohydrology demonstrates the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration, suggests the benefits of geomorphological research, and leads to challenges for further application of research results to management problems benefitting from a holistic approach. The nine papers in this volume, demonstrating how a range of approaches is required, are ascribed to four timescales. Although advances made have been produced in relation to particular timescales they have implications for others, and collectively they progress our understanding of hydrological extreme events research, showing that bridging timescales gives a major opportunity for palaeohydrology to contribute further to understanding global change.","[Gregory, Kenneth J.] Univ Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Herget, Juergen] Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Benito, Gerardo] CSIC, Inst Nat Resources, Madrid 28006, Spain",University of Southampton; University of Bonn; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC),"Gregory, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Univ Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",k.j.gregory@ntlworld.com; herget@giub.uni-bonn.de; benito@mncn.csic.es,"Benito, Gerardo/E-5456-2013","Benito, Gerardo/0000-0003-0724-1790",German Research Foundation [DFG HE 3006/11-1]; INQUA project Hydrological EXtreme Events in Changing Climate HEX Events [1220 P],German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); INQUA project Hydrological EXtreme Events in Changing Climate HEX Events,"The editors gratefully acknowledge the reviewers who have refereed the papers in this issue and all those who contributed to the organisation and ensured the success of the conference in Bonn in June 2014.

The reverse is more apparent than ever as greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture are tallied. The development and effective diffusion of new agricultural practices and technologies will largely shape how and how well farmers mitigate and adapt to climate change. This adaptation and mitigation potential is nowhere more pronounced than in developing countries where agricultural productivity remains low; poverty, vulnerability and food insecurity remain high; and the direct effects of climate change are expected to be especially harsh. Creating the necessary agricultural technologies and harnessing them to enable developing countries to adapt their agricultural systems to changing climate will require innovations in policy and institutions as well. Potential constraints to innovation involve both the private and public sectors in both developing and developed countries. The process of transferring agricultural innovations across agroecological and climatic zones is often subject to agronomic constraints. Often, the most binding constraints occur at the adoption stage, with several factors that potentially impede poor farmers' access to and use of new technologies. Based on discussions of these constraints, we derive six policy principles and use these principles to suggest several specific investments and policy priorities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper addresses the question: How can the inherent characteristics of institutions to stimulate the capacity of society to adapt to climate change from local through to national level be assessed? On the basis of a literature review and several brainstorm sessions, this paper presents six dimensions: Variety, learning capacity, room for autonomous change, leadership, availability of resources and fair governance. These dimensions and their 22 criteria form the Adaptive Capacity Wheel. This wheel can help academics and social actors to assess if institutions stimulate the adaptive capacity of society to respond to climate change; and to focus on whether and how institutions need to be redesigned. This paper also briefly demonstrates the application of this Adaptive Capacity Wheel to different institutions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We have employed a process-based dynamic vegetation modeling (MAPSS-CENTURY: MC) approach to project change in vegetation life forms under projected climate conditions that attained 81% overall accuracy. The present and projected climate conditions suggested highly resilient/stable forest covers in wet climate regimes and moderately resilient in dry semi-arid regions. Several forested grids in the seasonally dry tropical forest in the Eastern Ghats and dry Deccan peninsula regions are estimated to be less resilient, which may experience a regime shift toward scrub and grassland. The future prediction demonstrated an upward temperature shift in the Western Himalayas and trans-Himalaya, which may facilitate forest spread at higher elevations. Although the forest cover resilience may increase in future climate conditions, the disturbances in several regions in the Deccan Peninsula and the Eastern Ghats may trigger forest to scrub and grassland transition. The inaccuracy in model simulation in the Western Himalayas could be attributed to coarse resolution grids (0.5 degrees) failing to resolve the narrow climate niches. The spatially explicit model simulation provides opportunities to develop long-term climate change adaptation and conservation strategies.","[Das, Pulakesh; Behera, Mukunda Dev] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Ctr Oceans Rivers Atmosphere & Land Sci, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Das, Pulakesh; Roy, Parth Sarathi] World Resources Inst India, Sustainable Landscapes & Restorat, New Delhi 110016, India; [Bhaskaran, Prasad K.] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Ocean Engn & Naval Architecture Dept, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur,"Behera, MD (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Ctr Oceans Rivers Atmosphere & Land Sci, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",mdbehera@coral.iitkgp.ac.in,,"Behera, Mukunda/0000-0002-9976-6270; Das, Pulakesh/0000-0002-0508-7219",Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur,Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur,"This study has been carried out under the framework of Climate Change Effects on Indian Forest Cover, a project under DST CoE in Climate Change.

It is, therefore, important to understand challenges that might result from increasing extreme heat conditions, and how humans within urban centres can adapt. In this article, we provide a review that considers the experience of poor urban residents with extreme temperatures and adaptation strategies in relation to low-income, informal urban contexts in Africa. Our analysis is carried out across four focus countries: Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt. Only cursory insights exist in the context of informal settlements. We found that heat stress remains an overlooked topic in comparison to other climate change adaptation needs. Evidence shows that adaptation strategies varied and differed in framing, scale, and applied methods across the contexts. Adaptation strategies dominantly examine a broad variety of alternative building measures and, to a lesser degree, greening/nature-based strategies. It is important to highlight heat stress as a cross-cutting, focal topic in urban research in relation to informal settlements and generally broaden the spectrum. It is worthwhile to pay special attention to strategic actions and research designs that foresee win-win and co-beneficial options for local urban communities.","[Laue, Franziska; Adegun, Olumuyiwa Bayode; Ley, Astrid] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Urban Planning & Design, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany; [Adegun, Olumuyiwa Bayode] Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Architecture, Akure 340110, Nigeria; [Adegun, Olumuyiwa Bayode] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Architecture & Planning, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Stuttgart; University of Witwatersrand,"Adegun, OB (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Urban Planning & Design, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany.;Adegun, OB (corresponding author), Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Architecture, Akure 340110, Nigeria.;Adegun, OB (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Architecture & Planning, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",franziska_laue@email.de; obadegun@futa.edu.ng; astrid.ley@si.uni-stuttgart.de,,"Adegun, Olumuyiwa/0000-0003-1045-4447; Ley, Astrid/0000-0002-7297-8214",University of Stuttgart,University of Stuttgart,The APC was funded by University of Stuttgart.,,74,0,0,2,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2022,14,13,,,,,,,8182,10.3390/su14138182,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14138182,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,2Y2DL,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000825700500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Subsequently, as a result of HCA, six clusters were identified based on the 30 years of monthly NDVI data, delineating unique NDVI characteristics of the upstream watersheds. Additionally, based on the RDA results, environmental factors, including precipitation, temperature, slope, and aspect, can explain approximately 52% of the NDVI variance over the entire time series. Among environmental factors, nine factors were identified significantly through RDA analysis for explaining NDVI variance: average slope, temperature, flat slope, northeast-facing slope, rainfall, east-facing slope, southeast-facing slope, west-facing slope, and northwest-facing slope, which reflect an intimate connection between climatic and orthographic factors with vegetation. Furthermore, the rainfall and temperature represent different variations in all scenarios and seasons. With consideration of the characteristics of the clusters and significant environmental factors, corresponding climate change adaptation strategies are proposed for each cluster under climate change scenarios. Thus, the results provide insight to assess the natural clustering of the upstream watersheds in Taiwan, benefitting future sustainable watershed management.","[Tsai, Hui Ping; Wong, Wei-Ying] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taichung 40227, Taiwan; [Tsai, Hui Ping] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Innovat & Dev Ctr Sustainable Agr, Taichung 40227, Taiwan; [Tsai, Hui Ping] Pervas AI Res PAIR Labs, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan",National Chung Hsing University; National Chung Hsing University,"Tsai, HP (corresponding author), Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.;Tsai, HP (corresponding author), Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Innovat & Dev Ctr Sustainable Agr, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.;Tsai, HP (corresponding author), Pervas AI Res PAIR Labs, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.",huiping.tsai@nchu.edu.tw; wongweiying25@gmail.com,"Tsai, HuiPing/AAC-2802-2022","TSAI, HUI PING/0000-0002-4915-1075; Wong, Wei-Ying/0000-0003-4752-367X","Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan [SWCB-106-048]; Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 107-2119-M-005-008-MY2, MOST 109-2121-M-005002]; Pervasive AI Research (PAIR) Labs, Taiwan; Innovation and Development Center of Sustainable Agriculture from The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan","Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan; Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology; Pervasive AI Research (PAIR) Labs, Taiwan; Innovation and Development Center of Sustainable Agriculture from The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan","The authors would like to thank the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan for the major financial support under project of SWCB-106-048.

However, climate change, population growth, competing demands, water quality concerns, and environmental restoration projects all have a large impact on Los Angeles' dependency on future water importation. In this study, a system characterization was performed to assess each of the water sources that supply Los Angeles and the factors affecting them under present and potential future conditions. Additionally, water demand and conservation methods in Los Angeles were examined to understand their impact on the overall water supply system. Of the five main water sources that supply Los Angeles-Los Angeles Aqueduct, Colorado River, California Aqueduct, local groundwater, and reclaimed water-a majority will be impacted by climate change, water quality, energy, and cost constraints. While the expansion of water demand management and agricultural water transfers can help address the challenge of increasing demand, the impacts of climate variability and competing demands are likely to constrain their potential. The characteristics of the Los Angeles water supply system provide the basis for a system sustainability assessment that bounds the options for solutions to meet both a growing demand and the need for climate change adaptation.

We first replicate a version of the Adaptation in DICE climate model (AD-DICE) (de Bruin et al., 2009), which modifies the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (DICE) (Nordhaus and Boyer, 2000) to incorporate climate change adaptation explicitly into the traditional optimisation framework. Our model is then extended to include uncertainty over a probability distribution of expected Climate Sensitivity (CS) values and the implications for optimal mitigation and adaptation levels are then explored. In the certainty model runs, the results of previous studies that incorporated adaptation into the portfolio of climate change responses are largely confirmed. Modelling an uncertain CS with the same expected value as under certainty leads to several insights: before learning occurs, optimal levels of both mitigation and adaptation are lower under uncertainty than under certainty in this same early period, optimal mitigation and adaptation levels are most sensitive to the respective cost of each strategy, with the mitigation level more dependent on adaptation costs than vice versa variance in CS - a parameter with long-term effects - affects mitigation levels more than adaptation levels.","[Felgenhauer, Tyler] Univ N Carolina, UNC Inst Environm, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Felgenhauer, Tyler] Univ N Carolina, Dept Publ Policy, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [de Bruin, Kelly C.] Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Wageningen University & Research,"Felgenhauer, T (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, UNC Inst Environm, CB 3435,Abernethy Hall, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",felgenhauer@unc.edu; kelly.debruin@wur.nl,"Felgenhauer, Tyler/W-8380-2019","Felgenhauer, Tyler/0000-0001-9122-0444; de Bruin, Kelly/0000-0001-6291-6397",U.S. IIASA National Member Organization,U.S. IIASA National Member Organization,"Tyler Felgenhauer: Research for this paper was conducted during the summer of 2007 while the author was a Young Summer Scientist YSSP at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), in Laxenburg Austria.

The upcycled container architecture is being accepted since it is more eco-friendly than using the traditional building materials with intensive carbon footprint. Moreover, owing to the unquestionable urgency of climate change, existing climate-adaptive design strategies may no longer respond effectively as they are supposed to work in the previous passive design. Therefore, this paper explores the conceptual design for an upcycled shipping container building, which is designed as a carbon-smart modular living solution to a single family house under three design scenarios, related to cold, temperate, and hot-humid climatic zones, respectively. The extra feature of future climate adaption has been added by assessing the projected future climate data with the ASHRAE Standard 55 and Current Handbook of Fundamentals Comfort Model. Compared with the conventional design, Rome would gradually face more failures in conventional climate-adaptive design measures in the coming 60 years, as the growing trends in both cooling and dehumidification demand. Consequently, the appropriate utilization of internal heat gains are proposed to be the most promising measure, followed by the measure of windows sun shading and passive solar direct gain by using low mass, in the upcoming future in Rome.

The reasons for the flooding hazards include the following two factors: hazardous weather conditions and degradation of the hydrological environment due to anthropogenic activities. This review work investigated the weather conditions based on recorded data, which showed that both 1998 and 2016 were in El Nino periods. Human activities include the degradations of rivers and lakes and the effects caused by the building of the Three Gorges Dam. In addition, the flooding in 2016 had a lower hazard scale than that in 1998 but resulted in larger economic losses than that of 1998. To mitigate urban waterlogging caused by flooding hazards, China proposed a new strategy named Spongy City (SPC) in 2014. SPC promotes sustainable city development so that a city has the resilience to adapt to climate change, to mitigate the impacts of waterlogging caused by extreme rainfall events. The countermeasures used to tackle the SPC construction-related problems, such as local inundation, water resource shortage, storm water usage, and water pollution control, are proposed for city management to improve the environment.","[Lyu, Hai-Min; Xu, Ye-Shuang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Ocean Engn, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Civil Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Lyu, Hai-Min; Xu, Ye-Shuang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Naval Architecture, Dept Civil Engn, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Adv Ship & Deep Sea Explor, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Wen-Chieh] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Inst Tunnel & Underground Struct Engn, Xian 710055, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Arulrajah, Arul] Swinburne Univ Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Ship & Deep Sea Exploration; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Xi'an University of Architecture & Technology; Swinburne University of Technology,"Xu, YS (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Ocean Engn, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Civil Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.;Xu, YS (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Naval Architecture, Dept Civil Engn, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Adv Ship & Deep Sea Explor, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",lvhaimin@sjtu.edu.cn; xuyeshuang@sjtu.edu.cn; w-c.cheng@xauat.edu.cn; aarulrajah@swin.edu.au,,"Arulrajah, Arul/0000-0003-1512-9803; Cheng, Wen-chieh/0000-0002-1902-7815; Lyu, Hai-Min/0000-0002-2641-8099",National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2015CB057802],National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(National Basic Research Program of China),The research work described herein was funded by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program: 2015CB057802).

This review discussed food security threats and other negative consequences associated with climate change in the fisheries production in West Africa. It discussed various aspects of the linkage between food security and fisheries production system in a changing climate and highlight areas factions for policy makers. The impacts of climate change on most of the fish and fisheries of West Africa were not well understood. However, general knowledge on possible impacts suggests changes may be detrimental to fisheries production and food security from household to regional level. The study suggested that regional cooperation and governments need to focus on immediate and practical priority issues to effectively address long term issue such as climate change.

Following on brief explanations of the terms adaptation, adaptive management and adaptive capacity, a summary of recent (2011) findings on projections of climate change effects on hydrological responses over South Africa is presented as the scientific cornerstone to practical adaptive management options. These options are based on the identification of major categories and subcategories in which adaptive capacity can be enhanced, the identification of 17 sectors within the broader South African water-related community which are likely to be impacted by climate change and the identification of the range of foreseen changes that these various sectors are likely to have to cope with, and adapt to, as a consequence of projected changes in climate drivers and hydrological responses. Five sectors are then selected for detailed case studies on adaptive management options, viz. national water planners, municipalities, rain-fed (dryland) agriculture, the insurance industry and aquatic ecosystems.

A number of forecasts for OSR yield, national production and subsequent economic values are presented, providing estimates of impacts on both yield and value for different levels of adaptation. Under future climate change scenarios, there will be increasing pressure to maintain yields at current levels. Losses can be minimized in the short term (up to the 2020s) with a 'low'-adaptation strategy, which essentially requires some farmer-led changes towards best management practices. However, the predicted impacts of climate change can be negated and, in most cases, improved upon, with 'high'adaptation strategies. This requires increased funding from both the public and private sectors and more directed efforts at adaptation from the producer. Most literature on adaptation to climate change has had a conceptual focus with little quantification of impacts. It is argued that quantifying the impacts of adaptation is essential to provide clearer information to guide policy and industry approaches to future climate change risk.","[Barnes, A.

This paper introduces a way to model spatio-temporal dynamics of biomass production at a regional scale in order to derive land use strategies that enhance biomass provision and avoid trade-offs for other ecosystem services. The software platform GISCAME was employed to bridge the gap between local land management decisions and regional planning by linking growth and yield models with an integrative mesoscale modeling and assessment approach. The model region is located in Saxony, Germany. Five scenarios were simulated, which aimed at testing different alternatives for adapted land use in the context of climate change and increasing biomass demand. The results showed, for example, that forest conversion towards climate-change-adapted forest types had positive effects on ecological integrity and landscape aesthetics. In contrast, negative impacts on landscape aesthetics must be expected if agricultural sites were converted into short rotation coppices. Uncertainties with stem from assumptions regarding growth and yield models were discussed.

In particular, modelling studies have postulated a possible impact of soil-moisture deficit and drought on hot extremes(7-11). Such effects could be responsible for impending changes in the occurrence of heat waves in Europe(7). Here we analyse observational indices based on measurements at 275 meteorological stations in central and southeastern Europe, and on publicly available gridded observations(12). We find a relationship between soil-moisture deficit, as expressed by the standardized precipitation index(13), and summer hot extremes in southeastern Europe. This relationship is stronger for the high end of the distribution of temperature extremes. We compare our results with simulations of current climate models and find that the models correctly represent the soil-moisture impacts on temperature extremes in southeastern Europe, but overestimate them in central Europe.

As a large but also weak agricultural country, China must take corresponding adaptation measures in regard to climate change. As C3 and C4 crops have different carbon sequestration pathways, the responses of their growth to climate change are different. This study comprehensively compared the impacts of climate change on the growth of C3 and C4 crops in China by considering several key variables, such as solar radiation, temperature, precipitation, CO2 concen-tration, and agro-climatic constraints. The WOFOST (WOrld FOod STudies) model was used to quantitatively simulate and analyze the impacts of these variables on crop yield under four different scenarios. The results show that 1) during the growth period, solar radiation had the most significant change, followed by temperature difference between day and night, daily minimum temperature, daily maximum temperature, and precipitation; 2) the growth indicators of both C3 and C4 crops were more strongly correlated with solar radiation and tem-perature; and 3) under the four scenarios, changes in temperature and solar radiation had negative effects on both C3 and C4 crops in most regions, and changes in CO2 concentration had greater impacts on crop yields than other factors. This study revealed the temporal and spatial patterns of crop growth indicators under different climate change scenarios in the past 30 years, which provides a scientific basis for exploring how to adapt to climate change and provide higher levels of crop productivity in China.","[Wang, Yuying; Shi, Haiyun] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen Key Lab Precis Measurement & Early Warnin, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Suning] Inst Basic Sci, Ctr Climate Phys, Pusan, South Korea",Southern University of Science & Technology; Institute for Basic Science - Korea (IBS),"Shi, HY (corresponding author), Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen Key Lab Precis Measurement & Early Warnin, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",shihy@sustech.edu.cn,,,"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Precision Measurement and Early Warning Technology for Urban Environmental Health Risks, Natural Science Foundation of Shenzhen [JCYJ20210324105014039]; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Soil and Groundwater Pollution Control [2017B030301012]; State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Integrated Surface Water-Groundwater Pollution Control","Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Precision Measurement and Early Warning Technology for Urban Environmental Health Risks, Natural Science Foundation of Shenzhen; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Soil and Groundwater Pollution Control; State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Integrated Surface Water-Groundwater Pollution Control","This study was supported by Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Precision Measurement and Early Warning Technology for Urban Environmental Health Risks, Natural Science Foundation of Shenzhen (JCYJ20210324105014039) , Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Soil and Groundwater Pollution Control (2017B030301012) , and State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Integrated Surface Water-Groundwater Pollution Control.",,69,0,0,12,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1574-9541,1878-0512,,ECOL INFORM,Ecol.

During the transition to the use of clean energy, the power system will show increasingly prominent features such as high ratio of clean energy, high ratio of electrification, and a high proportion of electric and electronic equipment, coupled with summer and winter load peaks. Against this backdrop, this paper studies the impacts of climate extremes on the power system using the Texas power outage as an example, and proposes general adaptation measures to cope with climate extremes. For a start, this paper reviews the power outage in Texas caused by an extreme cold wave across the North America in 2021, and conducts an in-depth analysis of its causes. Then, based on the theoretical framework of disaster risk management. this paper analyzes the weather and climate disaster risks, extreme events, exposure, and vulnerability faced by the power system in the context of climate change and extreme events. Finally, in order to build a new power system. this paper establishes an overall framework for the power system to mitigate and adapt to climate change, and summarizes the key techniques involved in power generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption, as well as key technologies in the fields of power supply, power grid, power load, and energy storage, and the strategies and measures for addressing climate change.","[Ma Zhiyuan; Zhao Zijian; Liu Changyi; Yang Fang] Global Energy Interconnect Dev & Cooperat Org GEI, 8 Xuanwumennei St, Beijing 100031, Peoples R China; [Wang Mou] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Res Ctr Sustainable Dev, 27 Wangfujing St, Beijing 100010, Peoples R China; [Wang Mou] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Res Inst Ecocivilizat, 27 Wangfujing St, Beijing 100010, Peoples R China; [Wang Mou] Univ Chinese Acad Social Sci, 11 Changyu St, Beijing 102488, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Yang, F (corresponding author), Global Energy Interconnect Dev & Cooperat Org GEI, 8 Xuanwumennei St, Beijing 100031, Peoples R China.",zhiyuan-ma@geidco.org; zijian-zhao@geidco.org; changyi-liu@geidco.org; fang-yang1@geidco.org; wangnwu@vip.163.com,"Ma, ZhiYuan/GWN-1061-2022",,Study on Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Emission Reduction in the Energy Production Sector [GEIDCO-E[2020]-044]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42175171],Study on Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Emission Reduction in the Energy Production Sector; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This paper is funded by the Study on Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Emission Reduction in the Energy Production Sector (GEIDCO-E[2020]-044) and by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42175171).,,38,0,0,6,6,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2345-7481,2345-752X,,CHIN J URBAN ENV STU,Chin.

This study examines climate change perceptions in four rural municipalities in Central Chile, and the effect that exposure to meteorological information has on such perceptions, using a survey conducted in 2011. It uses a probit model to identify the socioeconomic and productive factors associated with what we define as a clear perception of climate change. Most farmers in this survey recognize that there have been changes in temperature and precipitation patterns during the last 24 years: About 62 % perceive that the average temperatures have increased; 93 % that precipitation has decreased; and 87 % that droughts are more frequent. The econometric model shows the significance of education and access to meteorological information for climate change perception. The results reveal that younger, more educated producers and those who own their land tend to have a clearer perception of climate change than older, less educated, or tenant farmers. From a policy point of view, it is important to give all farmers information that will help them to adapt to climate change using appropriate farming technologies and practices. Projects and programs designed to enhance understanding of the consequences of climate change will help farmers to develop the management ability to cope with climate risk.","[Roco, Lisandro] Univ Catolica Maule, Fac Agr & Forestry, Dept Forestry, Talca, Chile; [Engler, Alejandra; Bravo-Ureta, Boris E.; Jara-Rojas, Roberto] Univ Talca, Dept Agr Econ, Talca, Chile; [Bravo-Ureta, Boris E.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Bravo-Ureta, Boris E.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",Universidad Catolica del Maule; Universidad de Talca; University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut,"Roco, L (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Maule, Fac Agr & Forestry, Dept Forestry, POB 617,Ave San Miguel 3605, Talca, Chile.",lroco@ucm.cl,"Roco, Lisandro/ABE-7011-2020; mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020; Jara-Rojas, Roberto/AAY-3810-2021","Roco, Lisandro/0000-0002-6267-8461; Jara-Rojas, Roberto/0000-0001-5693-0037",Latin American and Caribbean Environmental Economics Program (LACEEP); Chilean National Comission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT),Latin American and Caribbean Environmental Economics Program (LACEEP); Chilean National Comission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT),This work was partially supported by a research grant from the Latin American and Caribbean Environmental Economics Program (LACEEP) and a doctoral scholarship from Chilean National Comission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT).

As wheat is a globally traded food commodity central to the food security of many nations, this paper uses it as an example to explore the impact of climate change on global food supply and quantify the resulting greenhouse gas emissions. Published data on projected wheat production is used to analyse how global production can be increased to match projected demand. The results show that the largest projected wheat demand increases are in areas most likely to suffer severe climate change impacts, but that global demand could be met if northern hemisphere producers exploit climate change benefits to increase production and narrow their yield gaps. Life cycle assessment of different climate change scenarios shows that in the case of one of the most important wheat producers (the UK) it may be possible to improve yields with an increase of only 0.6% in the emission intensity per unit of wheat produced in a 2 C scenario. However, UK production would need to rise substantially, increasing total UK wheat production emissions by 26%. This demonstrates how national emission inventories and associated targets do not incentivise minimisation of global greenhouse gas emissions while meeting increased food demands, highlighting a triad of challenges: meeting the rising demand for food, adapting to climate change and reducing emissions.

Downscaling techniques are required to capture these features, identify the most vulnerable areas to extreme changes and help decision makers to design strategies of mitigation and adaptation to climate change. A Regional Climate Model, WRF-ARW, is used to downscale the IPCC-AR4 ECHAM5/MPI-OM General Circulation Model results with high resolution (10 km), considering three different emissions scenarios (B1, A1B and A2) for 2001-2050. Model skills to reproduce observed extremes are assessed for a control period, 1971-2000, using the ERA40 reanalysis to drive the WRF-ARW simulations. A representative set of indices for temperature and precipitation extremes is projected. The modelling system correctly reproduces amplitude and frequency of extremes and provides a high degree of detail on variability over neighbouring areas. However, it tends to overestimate the persistence of wet events and consequently slightly underestimate the length of dry periods. Drier and hotter conditions are generally projected for the NWMB, with significant increases in the duration of droughts and the occurrence of heavy precipitation events. The projected increase in the number of tropical nights and extreme temperatures could have a negative effect on human health and comfort conditions. Simulations allow defining specifically vulnerable areas, such as the Ebro Valley or the Pyrenees, and foreseeing impacts on socio-economic activities in the region.","[Barrera-Escoda, A.; Cunillera, J.] Meteorol Serv Catalonia, Climate Change Unit, Barcelona, Spain; [Goncalves, M.; Guerreiro, D.; Baldasano, J.

However, if urban planning measures are poorly designed or implemented, it can increase costs and vulnerability, and unfairly affect the interests of particular groups. Through a case study on the coastal climate hazard planning framework in Victoria, Australia, this paper aims to illustrate how urban planning measures can lead to maladaptation and draw lessons for the future design and implementation of planning responses. Five main policy lessons are drawn from the case study. First, planning frameworks should encourage the adoption of robust approaches that are as insensitive to the uncertainties associated with coastal climate hazards as possible. Secondly, policy makers need to be mindful of the opportunity costs and equity implications of planning responses. Thirdly, to be sustainable, planning responses must be robust to social and political factors, something that can be achieved through the use of flexible approaches that allow continued use and development of land but on conditions that protect the interests of governments and communities. Fourthly, policy makers need to be mindful of transaction costs. Finally, when devolving planning responsibilities to lower levels of government, policy makers need to ensure that the objectives of planning frameworks are clear, there is minimal ambiguity in decision guidelines, and that the resourcing and capacity constraints of planning bodies are appropriately considered.","Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Climate Law & Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Macintosh, A (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Climate Law & Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",andrew.macintosh@anu.edu.au,,"Macintosh, Andrew/0000-0001-5700-7105",,,,,118,71,71,1,73,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Agroforestry cultures are being discursively reintroduced for better adaptability and resilience, with the first practical explorations seen in the field. Scholars have been working with farmers and regional stakeholders to establish a baseline for making agroforestry policy viable and sustainable. In a research effort that lasted three years, a large group of Czech farmers was interviewed via questionnaire surveys, standardized focus groups and in-depth personal interviews regarding their knowledge of agroforestry systems, their willingness to participate in these systems, and their concerns and expectations therewith. The information obtained helped the researchers gain better understanding of issues related to implementation of these systems. It was found that although trees are present on Czech farms and farmers appreciate their aesthetic and ecological landscape functions, knowledge about possible local synergies with crops and animals is lacking. This local knowledge gap, together with lack of market opportunities for the output of agroforestry systems and undeveloped administrative processes, have been identified as the greatest obstacles to the establishment of agroforestry systems. The researchers argue that the discovered cognitive and technological lock-in of the farmers may represent a risk to climate change adaptability and resilience. For the development of complex and localised land use (e.g., agroforestry) in such a context, the researchers suggest participative on-farm research, which would broaden the local knowledge base related to ecology and entrepreneurship.","[Krcmarova, Jana; Brendzova, Alica] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Ethnol, Na Florenci 3, Prague 11000, Czech Republic; [Kala, Lukas] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Lidicka 971, Brno 60200, Czech Republic; [Chabada, Thomas] Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Dept Environm Studies, Jostova 218-10, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Ethnology of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Masaryk University Brno,"Krcmarova, J (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Ethnol, Na Florenci 3, Prague 11000, Czech Republic.",jana.krcmarova@yahoo.com; lukas.kala@ibot.cas.cz; alica.brendzova@gmail.com; tomaschabada@mail.muni.cz,"Brendzová, Alica/ABD-2066-2020; Chabada, Tomas/AAF-7895-2019","Brendzová, Alica/0000-0003-1757-322X; Chabada, Tomas/0000-0001-5760-4751","Technology Agency of the Czech Republic [TL01000298]; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences, a long-term research development project [RVO 67985939]; Institute of Ethnology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, a long-term research development project [RVO: 68378076]","Technology Agency of the Czech Republic; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences, a long-term research development project; Institute of Ethnology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, a long-term research development project","This research was funded by Technology Agency of the Czech Republic, grant number TL01000298; The Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences, a long-term research development project no.

Notably this includes evidence of a receding coastline in certain areas and shifting wind regimes. Coupled with an increasing demand for coastal development, the City of Cape Town as the administrative authority is presented with an unfolding scenario of uncharted waters. From a coastal management perspective this requires a reappraisal of its governance strategies. However, this paper demonstrates that various governance structures within the City, whilst designed to address these challenges, are instead competing with, and undermining each other. In the context of a coastal city these dissonant governance structures translate into conventional (Weberian) forms of bureaucracy that counter efforts at promoting Integrated Coastal Management, the key tenets being institutional learning, collaboration, deliberation, flexibility and adaptive management. The disjuncture between governance structures in turn is restricting the City's ability in achieving its own coastal adaption strategies, particularly the restoration and maintenance of dune systems as effective 'buffers' against climate change induced pressures such as sea-level rise and storm surges. The procedural rigidity delivered by the bureaucracy is instead leading to a 'pathology': risks are being created and their production perpetuated by the bureaucracy charged with mitigating these risks. We suggest that the role of informal networks are explored as a means to circumvent the 'necessary evil' of bureaucracy, towards enabling stronger degrees of Integrated Coastal Management and ultimately successful climate change adaptation responses.

The approach provides a simplified dynamic vulnerability model developed within a conceptual model adopted - but very rarely made operational - by many international organisations such as the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change, the European Union. We propose a procedure in which disciplinary experts and local actors interact for the identification of the most relevant issues with reference to a specific vulnerability problem. Local actors (e.g. representatives of public administrations, business, NGOs) identify the most relevant issues related to the various dimensions of vulnerability, to be considered as input variables to contextualise the generalised model in the study case. Quantitative indicators are provided by disciplinary experts to describe past and future trends of variables, and their trajectories are combined to explore possible future vulnerability trends and scenarios. A non additive aggregation operator is proposed to allow experts and actors to pro vide their preferences through ad hoc questionnaires, thus overcoming the oversimplifications of most of the current vulnerability indices, which are usually either additive (fully compensatory) or multiplicative (non compensatory), and providing transparent and robust management of subjectivity and analysis of the deriving variability and uncertainty in model outputs. Input data for the demonstration of the model derive from the European Project Brahmatwinn, with reference to the Assam State in India. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, relatively little attention has been focused on the ways in which these interactions help to shape planning and policy in response to both processes. This paper examines how the intersections between the twin crises of economic recession and climate change are influencing hazards mitigation policy and climate change adaptation planning in three of Ireland's coastal cities. The cities of Dublin, Cork, and Galway are important case studies for this analysis due to the magnitude of socioeconomic and environmental changes they have witnessed in recent years. The paper begins by using the double-exposure framework to analyse how the interactions between global environmental and socioeconomic change have produced the contextual environment within which decision making and policy formation take place. This is followed by the presentation and analysis of the results of semistructured interviews with local decision makers and stakeholders. These illustrate that the interactions between environmental change and economic crisis have created the material and ideological conditions in which a neoliberal growth centred discourse of economic development dominates all areas of decision making and- policy. This has important implications for environmental policy and planning in cities, promoting a vision of a modern competitive city in which technological solutions are the preferred means of addressing flood risks. These decisions in turn reshape the exposures and vulnerabilities of local communities.","Univ Strathclyde, Sch Appl Social Sci Geog, Glasgow G4 0LT, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Jeffers, JM (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Sch Appl Social Sci Geog, Lord Hope Bldg,141 St James Rd, Glasgow G4 0LT, Lanark, Scotland.",jamesjeffers1@gmail.com,,"Jeffers, James/0000-0001-6315-9949",,,,,78,16,16,1,47,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0308-518X,1472-3409,,ENVIRON PLANN A,Environ.

Two procedures to match analysis approaches with adaptation problems,CLIMATIC CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change adaptation; Type of decision analysis; Cost-benefit analysis; Climate uncertainty; Chesapeake Bay,SEA-LEVEL RISE; UNCERTAINTY; MANAGEMENT; WATER; MODEL,"Climate adaptation decisions are difficult because the future climate is deeply uncertain. Combined with uncertainties concerning the cost, lifetime, and effectiveness of adaptation measures, this implies that the net benefits of alternative adaptation strategies are ambiguous. On one hand, a simple analysis that disregards uncertainty might lead to near-term choices that are later regretted if future circumstances differ from those assumed. On the other hand, careful uncertainty-based decision analyses can be costly in personnel and time and might not make a difference. This paper considers two questions adaptation managers might ask. First, what type of analysis is most appropriate for a particular adaptation decision? We answer this question by proposing a six-step screening procedure to compare the usefulness of predict-then-act analysis, multi-scenario analysis without adaptive options, and multi-scenario analysis incorporating adaptive options. A tutorial application is presented using decision trees. However, this procedure may be cumbersome if managers face several adaptation problems simultaneously. Hence, a second question is how can managers quickly identify problems that would benefit most from thorough decision analysis? To address this question, we propose a procedure that ranks multiple adaptation problems in terms of the necessity and value of comprehensive analysis. Analysis can then emphasize the highest-ranking problems. This procedure is illustrated by a ranking of adaptation problems in the Chesapeake Bay region. The two complementary procedures proposed here can help managers focus analytical efforts where they will be most useful.","[Shi, Rui; Hobbs, Benjamin F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Environm Hlth & Engn, 3400 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Jiang, Huai] Energy & Environm Econ Inc, 44 Montgomery St, San Francisco, CA USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Shi, R (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Environm Hlth & Engn, 3400 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",rshi8@jhu.edu,,,NOAA Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments Program,NOAA Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments Program,Funding was provided by a grant by the NOAA Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments Program to the RAND Corporation.,,33,11,11,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Our approach combined indicators of change in historic ecosystem extent, ecosystem functioning (hard corals, fleshy algae, herbivores and piscivores) and projected sea temperature warming. We show that WIO coral reefs are vulnerable to collapse at the regional level, while in 11 nested ecoregions they range from critically endangered (islands, driven by future warming) to vulnerable (continental coast and northern Seychelles, driven principally by fishing pressure). Responses to avoid coral reef collapse must include ecosystem-based management of reefs and adjacent systems combined with mitigating and adapting to climate change. Our approach can be replicated across coral reefs globally to help countries and other actors meet conservation and sustainability targets set under multiple global conventions-including the Convention on Biological Diversity's post-2020 global biodiversity framework and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.","[Obura, David; Gudka, Mishal; Samoilys, Melita; Osuka, Kennedy; Mbugua, James] CORDIO East Africa, Mombasa, Kenya; [Obura, David] IUCN Coral Specialist Grp, Mombasa, Kenya; [Samoilys, Melita] IUCN Grouper & Wrasse Specialist Grp, Mombasa, Kenya; [Keith, David A.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Porter, Sean] Oceanog Res Inst, Durban, South Africa; [Roche, Ronan] Bangor Univ, Ctr Appl Marine Sci, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales; [van Hooidonk, Ruben] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [van Hooidonk, Ruben] NOAA, Ocean Chem & Ecosyst Div, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL USA; [Ahamada, Said] AIDE, Moroni, Comoros; [Araman, Armindo] Adm Nacl Areas Conservacao ANAC, Maputo, Mozambique; [Karisa, Juliet] Kenya Marine & Fisheries Res Inst, Mombasa, Kenya; [Komakoma, John] Marine Parks & Reserves Unit MPRU, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Madi, Mouchtadi] Moheli Marine Pk, Nioumachoua, Comoros; [Ravinia, Isabelle] Seychelles Natl Parks Author, Victoria, Seychelles; [Razafindrainibe, Haja] Ctr Natl Rech Oceanog CNRO, Nosy Be, Madagascar; [Yahya, Saleh] Inst Marine Sci IMS, Zanzibar, Tanzania; [Zivane, Francisco] Natl Inst Fisheries Res, Maputo, Mozambique",University of New South Wales Sydney; Bangor University; University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML),"Obura, D (corresponding author), CORDIO East Africa, Mombasa, Kenya.;Obura, D (corresponding author), IUCN Coral Specialist Grp, Mombasa, Kenya.",dobura@cordioea.net,"van Hooidonk, Ruben/F-7395-2010","van Hooidonk, Ruben/0000-0002-3804-1233; YAHYA, SALEH/0000-0002-5975-9957; Obura, David/0000-0003-2256-6649; Roche, Ronan/0000-0002-6342-9571; Osuka, Kennedy/0000-0001-7940-5411",Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD),Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD)(CGIAR),"We thank contributors in the Western Indian Ocean GCRMN for access to data for this study and the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Unit for initial training and scoping.

Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) tolerance to drought scenarios is widely known, but adaptation to climate changes has been a challenge for forest sustainability protection. In this work, ECMF and MHB communities from cork oak forests were cross-linked and correlated with climates. Cenococcum, Russula and Tuber were the most abundant ECMF capable of interacting with MHB (ECMF similar to MHB) genera in cork oak stands, while Bacillus, Burkholderia and Streptomyces were the most conspicuous MHB. Integrating all microbial data, two consortia Lactarius/Bacillaceae and Russula/Burkholderaceae have singled out but revealed a negative interaction with each other. Russula/Burkholderaceae might have an important role for cork oak forest sustainability in arid environments, which will be complemented by the lower drought adaptation of competitive Lactarius/Bacillaceae.

Yet a landscape governance approach could also stimulate governments to develop land-use management policies to facilitate adaptation to climate change. I organized focus group discussions with members of conservation groups, REDD+ scholars, and members of the REDD+ agroforestry research community at the Association of American Geographers 2016 Annual Meeting, to identify potential conservation challenges and opportunities associated with carbon-farming in grasslands and plantations under the proposed landscape governance approach to REDD+.

The present study documented perceptions of climate variation and the community's ability to adapt to climate change hazards threatening the production of subsistence crops. Data were collected through interactions with 100 participants. In the study, climate change is explained as variations in temperature and rainfall patterns which resulted in excessive heat, erratic rainfall patterns and drought negatively impacting on subsistence crop production. Community members have the potential to limit the impacts of climate hazards on subsistence crop production. The negative impacts of climate hazards are limited by community members' indigenous knowledge of rainfall prediction, the seasons, crop diversification and mixed cropping. Mulching and the application of kraal manure improve the soil structure and fertility to reduce crop failure. These adaptation measures are resilient to the negative impact of climate hazards and may be helpful in the development of adaptation policies to assist rural communities vulnerable to climate change hazards.","[Rankoana, Sejabaledi A.] Univ Limpopo, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Private Bag X 1106, ZA-0727 Sovenga, South Africa",University of Limpopo,"Rankoana, SA (corresponding author), Univ Limpopo, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Private Bag X 1106, ZA-0727 Sovenga, South Africa.",sejabaledi.rankoana@ul.ac.za,,,,,,,38,25,25,0,23,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2016,8,8,,,,,,,672,10.3390/su8080672,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su8080672,,,10,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DU8HC,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000382452900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding disturbances in the context of ecological processes may lead to models that accurately predict population trajectories. Few studies examine the key ecological processes that drive changes on reefs. Processes of major interest include reproduction, recruitment, post-settlement mortality, coral growth, fragmentation, and mortality. These population processes are dependent on macro-processes, such as predation and herbivory, which in turn vary in accordance with regional oceanography. Some coral-reef regions experience high-frequency temperature anomalies, whereas other regions experience low-frequency anomalies. It may turn out that corals in the high-frequency regions are also most likely to undergo rapid directional selection, and adapt to climate change, because only alleles experiencing persistent selection pressure may attain high frequency. Yet corals are clonal organisms and the same genotypes are often exposed to different environments and to different selective pressures. Therefore, when comparing coral-population trajectories across regions and oceans, it is critical to understand the key processes of corals within local, regional, and historical contexts.

The nature and extent of the effects of climate change on rural livelihoods varies across Nepal in accordance with its highly diverse environmental conditions. In order to capture some of this variability, a comparative study was performed in two different ecological regions: Terai (lowland) and Mountain (upland) in the western development region of Nepal. The study focuses on perceptions of, and on adaptations to climate change by farmers. Information was collected from both primary and secondary data sources. Climate data were analyzed through trend analysis. Results show that most farmers perceive climate change acutely and respond to it, based on their own indigenous knowledge and experiences, through both agricultural and non-agricultural adaptations at an individual level. The study also shows that there is a need to go beyond the individual level, and to plan and provide support for appropriate technologies and strategies in order to cope with the expected increasing impacts of climate change.","[Manandhar, Sujata] Univ Yamanashi, Dept Ecosocial Syst Engn, Kofu, Yamanashi 4008511, Japan; [Vogt, Dietrich Schmidt] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Ctr Mt Ecosyst Studies, Kunming 650204, Peoples R China; [Perret, Sylvain R.] Asian Inst Technol, UMR G Eau, Klongluang 12120, Thailand; [Kazama, Futaba] Univ Yamanashi, Int Res Ctr River Basin Environm, Kofu, Yamanashi 4008511, Japan","University of Yamanashi; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS; Asian Institute of Technology; University of Yamanashi","Manandhar, S (corresponding author), Univ Yamanashi, Dept Ecosocial Syst Engn, 4-3-11 Takeda, Kofu, Yamanashi 4008511, Japan.",sujatamanandhar@gmail.com,,,"Norwegian government, Local Initiatives for Biodiversity Research and Development, Pokhara; Nepal Wheat Research Program, Bhairahawa; District Agriculture Development Office, Mustang, Nepal","Norwegian government, Local Initiatives for Biodiversity Research and Development, Pokhara; Nepal Wheat Research Program, Bhairahawa; District Agriculture Development Office, Mustang, Nepal","This research is supported by Norwegian government, Local Initiatives for Biodiversity Research and Development, Pokhara; Nepal Wheat Research Program, Bhairahawa; and District Agriculture Development Office, Mustang, Nepal.

The insurance industry can drive adaptation to climate change by influencing both property developers and prospective buyers. Buildings must be located and designed to ensure that they are able to withstand climate change - particularly increased flood risk. Insurers will only be able to insure buildings - vital to ensure that they are sellable - if this risk is managed to acceptable levels. The purpose of this briefing is to introduce guidance from the Association of British Insurers to help developers, planning authorities and people buying new properties to build and buy properties that rise to the challenges presented by climate change. The guidance recommends that developers follow national planning policy statements, provide buyers with information on climate risks and how they are managed, and develop publicly available standards or kitemarks that certify enhanced resilience to climate change impacts. Furthermore, before buying a property in a new development, prospective owners are advised check the flood risk and obtain information on measures taken to reduce it.","[Surminski, S.; Philp, A.] Assoc British Insurers, London, England",,"Surminski, S (corresponding author), Assoc British Insurers, London, England.",,,"Surminski, Swenja/0000-0003-1270-5545",,,,,7,2,2,0,9,THOMAS TELFORD PUBLISHING,LONDON,"THOMAS TELFORD HOUSE, 1 HERON QUAY, LONDON E14 4JD, ENGLAND",1478-4629,,,P I CIVIL ENG-ENG SU,Proc.

However, NBS realization depends critically on the governance framework that enables the NBS policy process. Drawing from three case studies in Nocera Inferiore (Italy), Munich (Germany), and Wolong (China), we identify key governance enablers-the contextual preconditions, policy processes, and institutions-that proved essential for NBS initiation, planning, design, and implementation. In the three cases, interviews confirm the success of the NBS measures and their benefits in terms not only of DRR but of multiple ecological and social-economic co-benefits. Results highlight critical governance enablers of NBS, including: polycentric governance (novel arrangements in the public administration that involved multiple institutional scales and/or sectors); co-design (innovative stakeholder participatory processes that influenced the final NBS); pro-NBS interest and coalition groups (organized pressure groups that advocated for an NBS); and financial incentives (financing community-based implementation and monitoring of NBS).

To examine an association between climate variability and birth weight in Mali and Kenya in relation to the local agricultural specialization. Methods. We combined health and sociodemographic data from the Demographic Health Surveys for Kenya (2008 and 2014) and Mali (2006 and 2012) with detailed data on precipitation, temperature, and vegetation. We analyzed the association between climate variability and birth weight by using multilevel regression models for the most common agricultural specializations: food cropping, cash cropping, and pastoralism. Results. There are differences in sensitivity to climate among different agricultural communities. An additional 100 millimeters of rainfall during the 12-month period before birth was associated with a 47-gram (P=.001) and 89-gram (P=.10) increase in birth weight for food croppers in Kenya and Mali, respectively. Every additional hot month in food-cropping communities in Kenya was associated with a 71-gram decrease in birth weight (P=.030), likely because of food croppers' limited use of modern agricultural techniques. Overall, cash croppers are least sensitive to climate variability in both countries. Conclusions. Effective climate change adaptation strategies are essential for protecting and improving health outcomes and should be tailored to local households' livelihood strategies.","[Bakhtsiyarava, Maryia; Grace, Kathryn] Univ Minnesota, Dept Geog Environm & Soc, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Bakhtsiyarava, Maryia; Grace, Kathryn; Nawrotzki, Raphael J.] Minnesota Populat Ctr, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Nawrotzki, Raphael J.] Univ Minnesota, 225 19th Ave S,50 Willey Hall, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Bakhtsiyarava, M (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, 225 19th Ave S,50 Willey Hall, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",bakht013@umn.edu,"Bakhtsiyarava, Maryia/GPS-5031-2022","Bakhtsiyarava, Maryia/0000-0001-5327-4556",Minnesota Population Center through Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development [R24 HD041023]; National Science Foundation (NSF) [ACI-0940818]; Minnesota Population Center Research Collaboration Award,Minnesota Population Center through Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development; National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Minnesota Population Center Research Collaboration Award,"The authors acknowledge support from the Minnesota Population Center (R24 HD041023), funded through grants from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development.

SNA has recently been integrated into research on adaptive capacity in the global change sciences, but often not at the household level. The methodology relies heavily on measuring food, money, wood and water, labour, and information about disease exchanges between households, all of which are referenced in previous work on adaptation in the developing world. The regional focus is the rural Eastern Cape of South Africa but results have wider geographic application. Results bring into question assumptions about adaptive capacity's relationship to network centrality, one of the most common measures in SNA. This is particularly where exchanges of wood and water and the information about disease are concerned. In the case of the former, results controvert contemporary work on livelihoods and natural resource dependence, while the latter points to a need for further clarification on when households share information about their ill health. The use of network variables combined with other methods may allow for a more concrete understanding of household adaptive capacity in the rural developing world.","[Schramski, Sam] Indiana Univ, Ctr Anal Social Ecol Landscapes, 701 East Kirkwood Ave,Student Bldg,Room 331, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [McCarty, Christopher] Univ Florida, Bur Econ & Business Res, Gainesville, FL USA; [Barnes, Grenville] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Schramski, S (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Ctr Anal Social Ecol Landscapes, 701 East Kirkwood Ave,Student Bldg,Room 331, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",schramski@gmail.com,,"McCarty, Christopher/0000-0002-2917-8318",,,,,58,3,3,2,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Formal and informal institutions help shape exposure, sensitivity and capacities to respond of individuals, social groups and social-ecological systems. In this paper we draw on several case studies of flood events and flood-affected communities to first assess how current practices reflect various laws, procedures, programs and policies for managing floods and disasters and then explore the implications for dealing with additional challenges posed by climate change. Our analysis identifies several institutional traps which need to be overcome if vulnerability is to be reduced, namely capture of agendas by technical elites, single-level or centralized concentration of capacities, organizational fragmentation and overemphasis on reactive crisis management. Possible responses are to expand public participation in managing risks, build adaptive capacities at multiple levels and link them, integrate flood disaster management and climate change adaptation into development planning, prioritize risk reduction for socially vulnerable groups and strengthen links between knowledge and practice. Responses like these could help reduce vulnerabilities under current climate and flood regimes, while also improving capacities to handle the future which every way that unfolds.","[Lebel, Louis] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Social Sci, Unit Social & Environm Res, Chiang Mai 50202, Thailand; [Manuta, Jesse B.] Ateneo de Davao Univ, Sch Arts & Sci, Davao, Philippines; [Garden, Po] Internews, Chiang Mai, Thailand",Chiang Mai University; Ateneo de Davao University,"Lebel, L (corresponding author), Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Social Sci, Unit Social & Environm Res, Chiang Mai 50202, Thailand.",louis@sea-user.org; jbmanuta@gmail.com; po@internews.org,"Lebel, Louis/D-4130-2014","Lebel, Louis/0000-0001-6187-6418",Packard Foundation through the START International Secretariat; Asia-Pacific Network for Global Environmental Change Research; START; Echel Eau and International Fund for Agriculture Development [PN50]; European Commission,Packard Foundation through the START International Secretariat; Asia-Pacific Network for Global Environmental Change Research; START(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Echel Eau and International Fund for Agriculture Development; European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"The Packard Foundation through the START International Secretariat is thanked for their support to Jesse Manuta.

However, this useful kind of knowledge co-production is far from automatic, and indeed the conditions which make it more likely to happen are not well understood.

Hypotheses were tested through path analysis, predictive relevance and effect size of variables. Findings The findings show that GIC and GHRM have no direct impact on EP; instead, GI plays a mediating role to make GIC and GHRM helpful in improving an organization's EP. Also, the environmental strategies play a significant role in the EP and act as a moderator in the relationship between GI and EP. Originality/value The Global Climate Risk Index has ranked Pakistan as the fifth most vulnerable to climate change. Industrial activities are contributing significantly to carbon emissions, and therefore, it is vital to mitigate and adapt to climate change to improve the organization's EP.

Current studies often only seek to estimate the mitigation potential of such initiatives or to study the design elements that may be more or less conducive to their effectiveness. Little is known about the impacts of such initiatives on broader social and environmental goals and about their catalytic impacts, that is, whether such transnational initiatives can grow and possibly replicate. Here we develop an approach inspired by political systems theory to reach a fuller understanding of the effectiveness of transnational initiatives. We operationalize a generalized framework through a combination of methodologies, using a new dataset of climate actions under the Momentum for Change program of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which we combine with surveys, database analysis, and contextualizing interviews. We conclude with a reflection on the applicability of the framework and a discussion on opportunities for the Momentum for Change program to strengthen its efforts.","[Chan, Sander] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Chan, Sander] Deutsch Inst Entwicklungspolit, German Dev Inst Deutsch Inst, Bonn, Germany; [Chan, Sander] Global Ctr Adaptat, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Biermann, Frank] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Global Sustainabil Governance, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE); Utrecht University,"Chan, S (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands.;Chan, S (corresponding author), Deutsch Inst Entwicklungspolit, German Dev Inst Deutsch Inst, Bonn, Germany.;Chan, S (corresponding author), Global Ctr Adaptat, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",m.chan@uu.nl,,"Chan, Sander/0000-0001-7852-3838",,,,,52,1,1,1,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2589-8116,,,EARTH SYST GOV-NETH,Earth Syst.

Artificial ecosystems, such as coniferous plantation forests, can suffer irreversible deterioration due to even a slight change in environmental conditions. However, few studies have examined the effects of converting natural forests to plantations on their vulnerability to catastrophic winds. By modelling the 2004 windthrow event of Typhoon Songda in northern Japan using the random forest machine learning method, we answered two questions: do Abies plantation forests and natural mixed forests differ in their vulnerability to strong winds and how do winds, topography and forest structure affect their vulnerability. Our results show that Abies plantation forests are more vulnerable to catastrophic wind than natural mixed forests under most conditions. However, the windthrow process was common to both types of forests, and the behaviour of wind inside the forests may determine the windthrow probability. Future management options for adapting to climate change were proposed based on these findings, including modifications of plantation forest structure to reduce windthrow risk and reconversion of plantations to natural forests.","[Morimoto, Junko; Nakagawa, Kosuke; Nakamura, Futoshi] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kita Ku, Kita 9,Nishi 9, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan; [Takano, Kohei T.; Aiba, Masahiro] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Lab Ecol Integrat, Aoba Ku, Aoba 6-3, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; [Takano, Kohei T.; Oguro, Michio] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Matsunosato 1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan; [Takano, Kohei T.] Nagano Environm Conservat Res Inst, Nat Environm Div, Kitago 2054-120, Nagano, Nagano 3810075, Japan; [Mishima, Yoshio] Rissho Univ, Fac Geoenvironm Sci, Magechi 1700, Kumagaya, Saitama 3600194, Japan; [Furukawa, Yasuto; Ogawa, Kenta] Rakuno Gakuen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Bunkyodai Midorimachi 582, Ebetsu, Hokkaido 0698501, Japan; [Ito, Rui] Japan Meteorol Business Support Ctr, Nagamine 1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan; [Takemi, Tetsuya] Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Uji, Kyoto 6110011, Japan; [Peterson, Chris J.] Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA",Hokkaido University; Tohoku University; Forestry & Forest Products Research Institute - Japan; Rakuno Gakuen University; Kyoto University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Morimoto, J (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kita Ku, Kita 9,Nishi 9, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan.",jmo1219@for.agr.hokudai.ac.jp,"Nakamura, Futoshi/A-6696-2012; Takemi, Tetsuya/AAS-8862-2021; Aiba, Masahiro/A-1736-2009; Ogawa, Kenta/B-7687-2008; Takano, Kohei T/D-8077-2013","Nakamura, Futoshi/0000-0003-4351-2578; Takemi, Tetsuya/0000-0002-7596-2373; Takano, Kohei T/0000-0001-8803-0252; Ogawa, Kenta/0000-0003-2561-8774; Ito, Rui/0000-0002-3170-0232","JSPS KAKENHI [24580034, 17H01516]; Programme for Risk Information on Climate Change (SOUSEI Programme); Social Implementation Programme on Climate Change Adaptation Technology (SI-CAT); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (Predicting and Assessing Natural Capital and Ecosystem Services (PANCES)) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan [S-15]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24580034] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Programme for Risk Information on Climate Change (SOUSEI Programme); Social Implementation Programme on Climate Change Adaptation Technology (SI-CAT); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (Predicting and Assessing Natural Capital and Ecosystem Services (PANCES)) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers 24580034 and 17H01516, the Programme for Risk Information on Climate Change (SOUSEI Programme), the Social Implementation Programme on Climate Change Adaptation Technology (SI-CAT) the GRENE-ei Programme by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT), and the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S-15 Predicting and Assessing Natural Capital and Ecosystem Services (PANCES)) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan.",,60,17,18,2,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0015-752X,1464-3626,,FORESTRY,Forestry,OCT,2019,92,4,,,,,436,443,,10.1093/forestry/cpy045,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/forestry/cpy045,,,8,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,KF8WS,,Green Submitted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000509517800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Available estimates of remaining vegetation cover in the biome currently range from 11% to 16%. However, our new land-cover map, prepared at the highest resolution ever (5 m), reveals a current vegetation cover of 28%, or 32 million hectares (Mha) of native vegetation. Simultaneously, we found 7.2 Mha of degraded riparian areas, of which 5.2 Mha at least must be restored before 2038 by landowners for legislation compliance. Restoring the existing legal debt could increase native vegetation cover in the Atlantic Forest up to 35%. Such effort, if well planned and implemented, could reduce extinction processes by increasing connectivity of vegetation remnants and rising total native cover to above the critical biodiversity threshold established for different taxonomic groups. If undertaken, this process can be adaptive to climate change and boost sustainable development in this most populous biome in Brazil, turning it into a hopespot.

An important question that has not been considered thus far is how climate change-induced water scarcity in agriculture may promote or hinder rural entrepreneurship. In this paper, a model is developed to explore the conditions under which rural enterprise may or may not be undertaken by farmers struggling to adapt to climate change-related water scarcity. The results derived here highlight the potential inter-generational trade-offs climate change could create in the pathways towards promoting developmental goals through rural enterprise. When farmers take on entrepreneurial activity, it also affects the human capital accumulation capability of their future generations through affecting their educational efforts. The risk of future reduction in rainfall availability makes the decision over whether or not to avail of the entrepreneurial opportunity challenging. Such risks may force less efficient farmers into taking to enterprise early on, thereby leading to suboptimal outcomes. However, several situations emerge under which, despite the lure of higher expected profits, farmers may not avail of an entrepreneurial opportunity or may delay it.","Macquarie Univ, Dept Environm & Geog, Fac Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Ranjan, R (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Environm & Geog, Fac Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",ram.ranjan@mq.edu.au,,"ranjan, ram/0000-0002-8756-9392",,,,,21,6,6,1,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Given the high burden of disease already associated with environmental factors in this region, this temperature increase may lead to grave challenges for human health and quality of life. HIV/AIDS, poverty, food and water insecurity together with inequality and unemployment will further complicate the manner in which we will need to address the challenges of a changing climate. The health impacts are direct, such as increased temperatures leading to heat exhaustion, and indirect, such as likely increases in infectious diseases from contaminated water and changes in the distribution and/or magnitude of vector-borne diseases. The most effective measures for adapting to climate change to ensure healthy populations are to implement basic public health systems and services. These range from a continuous supply of clean water to adequate primary healthcare services. Support for required interventions is required not only from government, but also from healthcare professionals and communities. The need for disease surveillance, data capturing and more focused research is paramount.","[Wright, C. Y.; Garland, R.

Such strategies need to encompass a balanced mix of non-structural (institutional) and structural (technical) measures based on sound scientific knowledge. This article discusses measures carried out to protect the city of Venice, Italy from flooding (locally known as high water), and reflects on their ability to anticipate a possible acceleration of sea-level rise as induced by climate change. It is based on scientific literature, legislative and policy documents of key institutions, reports and documents of organizations working on Venice issues, newspaper articles, and interviews. Our analysis shows that the synergic action of the hydraulic defense infrastructure under construction is in principle adequate to withstand a broad range of sea-level rise scenarios for the next 100 years. However, when the goal is to use these investments effectively major changes in the existing institutional arrangements will be required in the years to come. The Venice findings point out the difficulties and yet the importance of identifying and implementing both non-structural and structural measures to adapt to climate change.","[Munaretto, Stefania] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, NL-1081 Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Munaretto, Stefania] Univ IUAV Venice, Fac Urban & Reg Planning, Venice, Italy; [Vellinga, Pier] Wageningen Univ, Alterra Res Inst, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Tobi, Hilde] Wageningen Univ, Res Methodol Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; IUAV University Venice; Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Munaretto, S (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 Amsterdam, Netherlands.",stefania.munaretto@vu.nl,"Tobi, Hilde/A-1512-2013","Tobi, Hilde/0000-0002-8804-0298",,,,,78,10,10,9,72,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0892-0753,1521-0421,,COAST MANAGE,Coast.

The notion leaves no explicit role for the strength of personal beliefs in climate change and adaptive capacity. The consequences were: (i) adaptive action to climate change taken by an individual who is exposed to and sensitive to climate change is not influenced to a considerable degree by their strength of belief in climate change and (ii) adaptive action to climate change taken by an individual who is exposed to and sensitive to climate change is not influenced to a considerable degree by their strength of belief in an adaptive capacity. Data from a 2004 questionnaire of 1950 Swedish private individual forest owners, who were assumed exposed to and sensitive to climate change, were used.

This article addresses this research gap by providing an assessment of broad trends in progress on planning and implementing adaptation in developed countries. Primary inputs are the National Communications (NCs) by these countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), although the article also discusses illustrative examples of recent adaptation activities that have not been covered in the NCs. NCs reflect 'whole government' perspectives and follow a standardized reporting format, which facilitates cross-national comparisons. The analysis shows that impacts and adaptation receive limited attention within NCs. The discussion on impacts and adaptation has typically been dominated by climate scenarios and impacts analysis, while the discussion on adaptation is often limited to the identification of generic options. There are signs of recent progress, however, in the Third and especially the Fourth NCs, in which a growing number of developed countries report on establishing frameworks for adaptation and on efforts to implement adaptation measures that take future climate into account. Although an encouraging sign, it is still too early to assess the eventual impact of such measures.","[Agrawala, Shardul] OECD, Environm Directorate, Paris 16, France; [Gagnon-Lebrun, Frederic] EcoRessources Consultants, Montreal, PQ H2Z 1P8, Canada",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Agrawala, S (corresponding author), OECD, Environm Directorate, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, Paris 16, France.",shardul.agrawala@oecd.org,,,,,,,26,48,48,1,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Particularly, little is known whether adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) augments crop yield and income. Therefore, we investigate the impact of CSA adoption on yield and income in Bangladesh, one of the countries of the world most vulnerable to climate change and disaster prone. To achieve this, based on primary data from a sample of 600 smallholder farms, the endogenous switching regression (ESR) is applied while controlling for endogeneity issues and selection bias of CSA adoption. For robustness check, propensity score matching (PSM) is applied. Consistent results from both models are found indicating that CSA adoption has yield and income effects on smallholder farms. Interestingly, if non-adopting households are soil salinity conscious and adopt CSA, their yield would increase by 7.55%. In addition, non-adopting households would significantly have tremendous income gains on account of CSA adoption. Results demonstrate that policy support measures for CSA adoption in flood-prone areas can have important implications for food security and poverty eradication through crop yield boosts and income augmentation in line with the purview of the sustainable development goals (SDGs).","[Akter, Asma; Geng, Xianhui; Mwalupaso, Gershom Endelani; Ndungu, Michael Kiraru] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210095, Peoples R China; [Akter, Asma] Sher E Bangla Agr Univ, Dept Management & Finance, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh; [Lu, Hua] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Ecol Civilizat, Nanchang 330013, Peoples R China; [Hoque, Fazlul] Sher E Bangla Agr Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Mkt, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh; [Abbas, Qasir] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan",Nanjing Agricultural University; Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University (SAU); Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University (SAU); University of Agriculture Faisalabad,"Geng, XH (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210095, Peoples R China.",gengxh@njau.edu.cn,"AKTER, ASMA/AAT-2345-2021; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","AKTER, ASMA/0000-0001-5759-1057; ",Earmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System [CARS-28],Earmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System,This research was financially supported by a research grant from the Earmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System (Grant numbers: CARS-28),,97,0,0,5,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

Accounting for future vulnerability is necessary, because adaptation is planned for future climate risks. However, future-oriented vulnerability assessments are rare, and methodological and conceptual gaps exist. Particularly, investigating the causes of future vulnerability and understanding the socioeconomic processes driving it requires methodological development and stepping away from common quantitative approaches. At the same time, little attention has been paid to the epistemology of future-oriented vulnerability assessments and its implications for practice, as well as to governance modes where the results are intended to be used. In this paper, I synthesize literature on the epistemology of future-oriented vulnerability assessments, and on the governance modes, as well as discuss their roles in the science and practice of vulnerability assessments.

Water and land resources are fundamental for smallholder farmers and their productivity. The concept of IKS plays a significant role in climate change adaptation in Zimbabwe's rural communities. Climate change has a considerable influence on the success of agricultural production in the rural communities of Zimbabwe. Hence, it becomes fundamental to assess the community-based methods of climate governance. Qualitative multiple case study exploratory designs were employed with data collected through individual interviews with smallholder farmers, and thematic content analysis was used to analyse data. This study found that enhancing and embracing IKS is of paramount importance for inclusion in local-level strategies in the development process with special reference to climate governance in water and land resource management, particularly in under-resourced communities. It also established that the use of IKS enhances communities' adaptive capacity and it should not be conducted at the expense of scientific methods but rather should be employed in order to complement the existing scientific global knowledge systems.","[Mugambiwa, S.

The emergent concept of resilient livelihoods risks perpetuating problematic framings of both socio-ecological and livelihoods dynamics that limit the effectiveness of development and adaptation interventions. In this paper, I connect recent contributions to the livelihoods and socio-ecological resilience literatures to define resilient livelihoods as projects aimed at the achievement of well-being in a manner that preserves existing systems of meaning, order, and privilege. These projects (re)produce socio-ecologies, deeply human assemblages of socio-cultural and biotic elements. So framed, the idea of resilient livelihoods centers meaning, power, difference, and agency in both livelihoods and socio-ecological dynamics. It opens up new understandings of the character, sources, and importance of resilience in livelihoods, allows for the identification of new indicators of livelihoods fragility, points to previously-overlooked sources of potential livelihoods transformation and change, and suggests sites of productive engagement between development and adaptation interventions and transformation and change.","[Carr, Edward R.] Clark Univ, Int Dev Community & Environm Dept IDCE, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Carr, Edward R.] Clark Univ, George Perkins Marsh Inst, Humanitarian Response & Dev Lab HURDL, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Clark University; Clark University,"Carr, ER (corresponding author), Clark Univ, Int Dev Community & Environm Dept IDCE, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.;Carr, ER (corresponding author), Clark Univ, George Perkins Marsh Inst, Humanitarian Response & Dev Lab HURDL, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",edcarr@clarku.edu,"Carr, Edward R/A-7206-2009","Carr, Edward/0000-0001-7784-471X",ESRC [ES/S007687/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,79,15,15,10,27,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

Irrigation is critical for climate change adaptation, but it is also an important source of greenhouse gas emissions. This study analyzes the carbon (C) footprint of irrigation in Spain, covering the complete historical process of mechanization. A 21-fold total, 6-fold area-based, and 4-fold product-based increase in the carbon footprint was observed during the 20th century, despite an increase in water use efficiency. CH4 emissions from waterbodies, which had not previously been considered in the C footprint of irrigation systems, dominated the emission budget during most of the analyzed period. Technologies to save water and tap new water resources greatly increased energy and infrastructure demand, while improvements in power generation efficiency had a limited influence on irrigation emissions. Electricity production from irrigation dams may contribute to climate change mitigation, but the amount produced in relation to that consumed in irrigation has greatly declined. High uncertainty in CH4 emission estimates from waterbodies stresses a need for more spatially resolved data and an improved empirical knowledge of the links between water quality, water level fluctuations, and emissions at the regional scale.","[Aguilera, Eduardo; Vila-Traver, Jaime; Infante-Amate, Juan; Guzman, Gloria I.; Gonzalez de Molina, Manuel] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Ctra Utrera Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain; [Aguilera, Eduardo] Univ Politecn Madrid, Res Ctr Management Environm & Agr Risks CEIGRAM, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Deemer, Bridget R.] US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, 2255 N Gemini Dr, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA",Universidad Pablo de Olavide; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Aguilera, E (corresponding author), Univ Pablo de Olavide, Ctra Utrera Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.;Aguilera, E (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Res Ctr Management Environm & Agr Risks CEIGRAM, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",eduardo.aguilera@upm.es,"Infante-Amate, Juan/ABF-4144-2021; Aguilera, Eduardo/H-4864-2015; Gonzalez de Molina, Manuel/H-4474-2015","Infante-Amate, Juan/0000-0003-1446-7181; Aguilera, Eduardo/0000-0003-4382-124X; Gonzalez de Molina, Manuel/0000-0002-0253-6971; Guzman Casado, Gloria Isabel/0000-0003-1165-7182","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [SSHRC 895-2011-1020]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain [HAR2015-69620-C2-1-P, FJCI-2017-34077, BES-2016-076336]",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain(Spanish Government),"We thank Sydney Foks and four anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

This paper explores a success case of adaptive governance in a non-western country and tries to understand what factors lead to the adoption of this type of governance. Adaptive governance is considered most efficient to address the many challenges of climate change and natural disasters because it embraces uncertainty by focusing on collaboration, flexibility and learning. Yet, the concept remains underdeveloped and the conditions under which governments decide to embrace adaptive governance are not clear. The paper argues that two main factors are crucial for governments to turn to adaptive governance. First, a traumatic shock is likely to stimulate a reconsideration of the manner in which governance is thought and applied. The shock by involving considerable economic and human cost creates a momentum for governance rethinking. Second, a committed political leadership is essential to make use of that momentum to reform previous governance practices to create a more resilient system. These arguments are explored in the case of Odisha, an Indian state that was able to adopt adaptive governance and that became a successful example of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation.","[Walch, Colin] Uppsala Univ, Dept Peace & Conflict Res, Uppsala, Sweden; [Walch, Colin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Uppsala University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Walch, C (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Peace & Conflict Res, Uppsala, Sweden.;Walch, C (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",colin.walch@pcr.uu.se,,,"Swedish Research Council [2016-06389, 2016-00243]",Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),This research was supported by The Swedish Research Council [grant numbers 2016-06389 and 2016-00243].,,51,16,16,4,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

This paper documents how the MLVI was developed and demonstrates the utility of this approach by using primary household survey data of 16 selected districts of three sub-basins in the HKH region. The analysis gives important clues about differences in the intensity and composition of multidimensional livelihood vulnerability across these locations that should be useful to decision makers to identify areas of intervention and guide their measures to reduce vulnerability.","[Gerlitz, Jean-Yves; Banerjee, Soumyadeep] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Macchi, Mirjam] Swiss Agcy Dev & Cooperat, ICIMOD, Freiburgstr 130, CH-3003 Bern, Switzerland; [Brooks, Nick] Garama 3C Climate Change Consultancy, Sackville Pl Business Ctr,44-48 Magdalen St, Norwich NR2 1JU, Norfolk, England; [Pandey, Rajiv] Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, Srinagar 246174, Uttarakand, India; [Jha, Shashidhar Kumar] Indian Inst Forest Management, POB 357, Bhopal 462003, MP, India",Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University; Indian Institute of Forest Management,"Gerlitz, JY (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal.",jygerlitz@outlook.com,", RAJIV/AAE-6333-2022; Pandey, Rajiv/F-2657-2010; , Rajiv/N-9631-2019; Gerlitz, Jean-Yves/AAK-4656-2020; Jha, shashidhar kuamar/O-5244-2019",", RAJIV/0000-0001-7407-3550; , Rajiv/0000-0003-4849-775X; Gerlitz, Jean-Yves/0000-0002-1397-0474; Brooks, Nick/0000-0002-5073-9386","Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Norway; Swedish International Development Agency (Sida); Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP), Pakistan; Aaranyak, India; Nepal Development and Research Institute (NDRI), Nepal; Koshi Victims' Society (KVS), Nepal","Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Norway; Swedish International Development Agency (Sida); Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP), Pakistan; Aaranyak, India; Nepal Development and Research Institute (NDRI), Nepal; Koshi Victims' Society (KVS), Nepal","This study was a part of the Himalayan Climate Change Adaptation Programme (HICAP).

The goals of the NCAP were to build an inclusive partnership, increase climate change awareness, assess vulnerability, and develop science-based adaptation strategies to reduce these vulnerabilities. The NCAP expanded previous science-management partnerships on federal lands to a larger, more ecologically and geographically complex region and extended the approach to a broader range of stakeholders. The NCAP focused on two national forests and two national parks in the North Cascades Range, Washington (USA), a total land area of 2.4 million ha, making it the largest science-management partnership of its kind. The NCAP assessed climate change vulnerability for four resource sectors (hydrology and access; vegetation and ecological disturbance; wildlife; and fish) and developed adaptation options for each sector.

To stem this knowledge gap, this study examines the evolution of farm-based climate adaptation practices in the vegetable subsector of Cameroon's western highlands. Specifically, we (i) explore the different adaptation practices, (ii) estimate the determinants of farm-based adaptation, and (iii) determine the effects of farm-based adaptation on vegetable performance. Data were collected from a representative sample of farming households (N = 150) in two communities using a semi-structured questionnaire, complemented by key informant interviews (N = 10) and focus group discussions (N = 5). The Product Moment Correlation established an evolution from traditional practices to more modern scientific practices with changing climate, as vegetable farmers shifted from using local seeds to improved ones, intensified pest control strategies and adopted water pump-based irrigation practices. The binary logistic regression model revealed that belonging to farming groups, increase in income and access to credit significantly explained farm-based adaptation (p = 0.041). Furthermore, farm-based practices were significantly reflected in crop performance, mirrored through an increase in vegetable quantity (p = 0.003) and perceived quality (p = 0.046). The results suggest the need for further research to blend traditional and conventional adaptation approaches, and to create enabling environments to foster social capital (belonging to groups) and access to credit as key levers for climate-resilient vegetable production in the western highlands of Cameroon.","[Kimengsi, Jude Ndzifon] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Environm Sci, Forest Inst & Int Dev FIID Res Grp, Dresden, Germany; [Kimengsi, Jude Ndzifon] Univ Bamenda, Dept Geog, Bamenda, Cameroon; [Akumbo, Chia Michael; Tume, Suiven John Paul; Akhere, Gwan Solange] Univ Bamenda, Dept Geog & Planning, Bamenda, Cameroon; [Balgah, Roland Azibo] Univ Bamenda, Coll Technol, Bamenda, Cameroon; [Tingum, Ernest Ngeh] Univ Namibia, Dept Econ, Windhoek, Namibia",Technische Universitat Dresden; University of Namibia,"Kimengsi, JN (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Environm Sci, Forest Inst & Int Dev FIID Res Grp, Dresden, Germany.",jude_ndzifon.kimengsi@tu-dresden.de,,"Kimengsi, Jude Ndzifon/0000-0002-1927-7443; John Paul Tume, Suiven/0000-0002-2159-4608",,,,,64,1,1,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1886,,,COGENT SOC SCI,Cogent Soc.

In this article we explore whether, how and to what extent the governance of knowledge helps or hinders managerial change towards more proactive climate adaptation. We applied a knowledge governance framework that addresses social and cultural dimensions of environmental decision-making, alongside the institutional arrangements that support particular knowledge-based relationships, to document the knowledge-based processes in place for managing protected areas under uncertain climate change in Colombia. We found that the results of scientific experimentation and modelling (mainly in the natural sciences) are often stated as the preferred source of knowledge to inform decision making, forming a dominant narrative that climate adaptation can and should be driven by scientific and technical information. However, institutional arrangements in practice were typically more diverse in the knowledge sources that contribute to protected area policy and practice. This indicates a significant mis-match between the desired knowledge base for climate adaptation governance, and the actual knowledge processes that underpin effective planning. We propose that understanding institutional arrangements that shape adaptation decision contexts can help to address barriers for using climate information effectively, including understanding its limitations. It can also help managers identify opportunities to draw on existing diverse and rich knowledge systems to support the institutional transformations needed to enable strategic planning and management for effective climate adaptation.","[Munera, Claudia; van Kerkhoff, Lorrae] Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Sci, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Munera, C (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Sci, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",claudia.munera@anu.edu.au,"van Kerkhoff, Lorrae/AAF-2275-2020","van Kerkhoff, Lorrae/0000-0003-0247-1511","Luc Hoffmann Institute; Luc Hoffmann Fellowship grant [P10002150, 2174]",Luc Hoffmann Institute; Luc Hoffmann Fellowship grant,"The authors would like to acknowledge financial support provided by the Luc Hoffmann Institute.

This paper compares diversity-based climate adaptation approaches in current land use in the Cam Xuyen district, Ha Tinh province, Central Vietnam and in the Kapingazi river watershed in Embu district, Eastern province, Kenya, in order to understand local responses to climate variability and examine the potential for policy support of diversity management by local people. Literature reviews and trend analysis of local time series of rainfall and temperature were combined with stakeholder interviews and workshops to identify technology and policy options for dealing with current and future climate variability. At all study sites, diversity in land use at farm level and along agriculture-forestry landscape gradients was a key strategy. Policy options to support such an approach could include legalization of agroforestry in Vietnam and a combination of regulations and incentive-based approaches to reconcile household decision-making with longer term and collective actions to benefit landscape diversity in Kenya. Lessons learnt in both study areas about payments for environmental services can be used in policy discussions.","[Hoang, M. H.; Catacutan, D.; Perez-Teran, A. S.; Nguyen, H. Q.; Dumas-Johansen, M.

Earlier work has predicted that physiological adaptation to climate change will be accompanied by a shift in temperature preferences, but empirical evidence for this is lacking. Here, we test whether exposure to different thermal environments has led to changes in preferred temperatures in the wild. Our study takes advantage of a natural experiment  in Iceland, where freshwater populations of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are found in waters warmed by geothermal activity year-round (warm habitats), adjacent to populations in ambient-temperature lakes (cold habitats). We used a shuttle-box approach to measure temperature preferences of wild-caught sticklebacks from three warm-cold population pairs. Our prediction was that fish from warm habitats would prefer higher water temperatures than those from cold habitats. We found no support for this, as fish from both warm and cold habitats had an average preferred temperature of 13?. Thus, our results challenge the assumption that there will be a shift in ectotherm temperature preferences in response to climate change. In addition, since warm-habitat fish can persist at relatively high temperatures despite a lower-temperature preference, we suggest that preferred temperature alone may be a poor indicator of a population's adaptive potential to a novel thermal environment.","[Pilakouta, Natalie; Killen, Shaun S.; Lindstrom, Jan; Metcalfe, Neil B.; Parsons, Kevin J.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers, One Hlth, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Pilakouta, Natalie] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Kristjansson, Bjarni K.; Skulason, Skuli] Holar Univ, Dept Aquaculture & Fish Biol, Sauoarkrokur, Iceland; [Skulason, Skuli] Iceland Museum Nat Hist, Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Glasgow; University of Aberdeen,"Pilakouta, N (corresponding author), Zool Bldg,Tillydrone Ave, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland.;Parsons, KJ (corresponding author), Graham Kerr Bldg,Univ Ave, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",natalie.pilakouta@abdn.ac.uk; kevin.parsons@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Pilakouta, Natalie/0000-0001-8503-520X; Killen, Shaun/0000-0003-4949-3988; Kristjansson, Bjarni K./0000-0001-6984-5771",Natural Environment Research Council;  [NE/N016734/1],Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); ,"Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: NE/N016734/1",,55,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Wheat and rice, the two most important foods in the country, were considered representatives of food security. A CGE model was developed to achieve the research goals. In this context, a stochastic model based on Monte Carlo simulation was used to provide three scenarios (best, average, and worst) indicating probable changes in climate variables. It is important to model the problem of changing climatic variables for irrigated crops, as groundwater resource depletion and restrictions on extraction from Iranian aquifers reduce planted areas and yields. Therefore, this study applies this model to both rain-fed and irrigated crops, whereas studies in the literature only evaluate rain-fed crops. Food security will face serious challenges as food supplies, and consumption of goods and services are declining in average and worst scenarios, according to findings. Consequently, the negative impact of climate change on food security and people's livelihoods requires a review of the policies implemented within the country. Effective solutions include research and development to introduce drought-tolerant varieties and adopt appropriate strategies to adapt to climate change. Improving the incomes of farmers is one solution to mitigating the impacts of climate change.","[Javadi, Akram; Ghahremanzadeh, Mohammad; Hayati, Boballah] Univ Tabriz, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Tabriz, Iran; [Sassi, Maria] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Pavia, Italy; [Javanbakht, Ozra] Urmia Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Orumiyeh, Iran",University of Tabriz; University of Pavia; Urmia University,"Javadi, A; Ghahremanzadeh, M (corresponding author), Univ Tabriz, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Tabriz, Iran.",akramjavadi@tabrizu.ac.ir; ghahremanzadeh@Tabrizu.ac.ir,,"Javadi, Akram/0000-0002-1651-0473; Ghahremanzadeh, Mohammad/0000-0003-0993-9244",,,,,43,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

Most studies of vulnerability are based upon short timeframes in the recent past and so may focus on its symptoms rather than its underlying causes, or derive exclusively from systems-based approaches that can present historical change without recourse to human agency. This paper makes extensive use of the historical written record to analyse the comparative root-causes of the vulnerability and resilience of rural farming communities to drought over a period of three centuries (1505-1830) in the area between the Zambezi and Save rivers in southern Africa. The paper first considers vulnerability, resilience and adaptation as temporal frameworks, and analyses evidence for drought and its impacts in the pre-colonial past. It then reconstructs agroecosystem, livelihood and institutional vulnerability for six societies and settlements over the long-run using an indicator approach. The resultant trajectories of vulnerability are discussed in the context of the differential impacts of past drought, through which the decisive drivers and constraints of vulnerability and resilience are identified. The paper concludes with a number of key themes from this long-run analysis for contemporary vulnerability and adaptation to climate change, and points to the importance of institutional adaptation, normative goals, and uneven distributions of power.","[Hannaford, Matthew J.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Hist, Drift 6, NL-3512 BS Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Hannaford, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Hist, Drift 6, NL-3512 BS Utrecht, Netherlands.",m.j.hannaford@uu.nl,,"Hannaford, Matthew/0000-0002-9982-9868",University of Sheffield Energy and Environment Division PhD scholarship; International Studies Group at the University of the Free State; Royal Geographical Society Dudley Stamp Memorial fund; ERC [339647],University of Sheffield Energy and Environment Division PhD scholarship; International Studies Group at the University of the Free State; Royal Geographical Society Dudley Stamp Memorial fund; ERC(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),"This research was funded by a University of Sheffield Energy and Environment Division PhD scholarship.

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) plays an important role in food security, whilst its yield is greatly influenced by climate change. Thus, it is critical to quantify changes in rice yield, determine the potential climatic conditions affecting yield variation, and identify strategies to counter the effects of climate change. Historical double-rice yields and climatic variables were analyzed in the major double-rice region of Southern China. Yield varied nonlinearly in most provinces, fluctuated more for late rice, and exhibited stagnation in 1980-2012. During the growth stages, the mean temperature (T-mean) increased significantly at 75.1% of the stations examined (P < 0.05), while high inter-annual variation in precipitation (Prec) and radiation (Rad) decreased for 64.2% and 62.2% of stations. The joint effects of the three climatic variables increased yields of early- and late-rice by 0.51% and 2.83%, respectively. Climatic variation accounted for 40.04% and 29.72% of yield variability for early- and late-rice, respectively. Thus, double-rice production in Southern China is strongly affected by inter-annual climatic variation, requiring resilient farming practices to adapt to climate change and consequently enhance food security.

Climate change has been claimed to have low salience as a risk issue because it cannot be directly experienced. Still, personal factors such as strength of belief in local effects of climate change have been shown to correlate strongly with responses to climate change and there is a growing literature on the hypothesis that personal experience of climate change (and/or its effects) explains responses to climate change. Here we provide, using survey data from 845 private forest owners operating in a wide range of bio-climatic as well as economic-social-political structures in a latitudinal gradient across Europe, the first evidence that the personal strength of belief and perception of local effects of climate change, highly significantly explain human responses to climate change. A logistic regression model was fitted to the two variables, estimating expected probabilities ranging from 0.07 (SD +/-0.01) to 0.81 (SD +/-0.03) for self-reported adaptive measures taken. Adding socio-demographic variables improved the fit, estimating expected probabilities ranging from 0.022 (SD +/-0.008) to 0.91 (SD +/-0.02).

Climate change, population growth, and urbanization have only exacerbated this crisis. For the Caribbean, climate change through the impact of increasing temperatures and rainfall variability has resulted in more frequent and intense episodes of disasters including droughts and floods which have impaired the quantity and quality of freshwater supplies. Using Caribbean-specific climate forecasting, it is shown that rainfall totals in Kingston, Jamaica, are expected to reduce by 2030 and 2050 under two RCPs. In addition, the timing of the primary rainy season is expected to shift, potentially impacting water supply security. Analysis of the potential of rainwater harvesting (RWH) to augment supply and enhance water supply resilience shows that in two communities studied in Kingston, it can contribute up to 7% of total water supply. Household storage requirements are about 1 m(3) per household, which is feasible. RWH offers the potential to contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation measures at a household level. Policy, incentives, and increased awareness about the potential of RWH to meet non-potable household demand in Kingston must be improved, as well as efforts to reduce the currently unreasonably high levels of non-revenue water in order to move towards an integrated, sustainable, and climate-resilient urban water supply strategy for the city.","[Townsend, Danneille A.; Susnik, Janez; van der Zaag, Pieter] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Land & Management Dept, POB 3015, NL-2601 DA Delft, Netherlands; [van der Zaag, Pieter] Delft Univ Technol TU Delft, Water Management Dept, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands",IHE Delft Institute for Water Education,"Susnik, J (corresponding author), IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Land & Management Dept, POB 3015, NL-2601 DA Delft, Netherlands.",danneille.townsend@gmail.com; j.susnik@un-ihe.org; p.vanderzaag@un-ihe.org,"Susnik, Janez/T-6303-2017; van der Zaag, Pieter/B-8247-2008; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Susnik, Janez/0000-0002-8814-0168; van der Zaag, Pieter/0000-0002-1215-2656; Townsend, Danneille/0000-0003-1278-5194",DUPC2; Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs; IHE Delft in the period 2016-2020,DUPC2; Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs; IHE Delft in the period 2016-2020,"This research was funded by DUPC2, the programmatic cooperation between the Directorate-General for International Cooperation of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and IHE Delft in the period 2016-2020 for contribution towards research, fieldwork, and the writing of this manuscript.",,31,0,0,1,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,DEC,2020,11,12,,,,,,,1314,10.3390/atmos11121314,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11121314,,,21,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,PJ3WY,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000601703600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Qualitative interviews and focus groups were conducted across three case-ports in which a wide range of adaptive capacity elements, including systems and processes, skills and knowledge and organizational culture and norms, were explored. In total, 15 interviews and three focus groups were organized, totaling 69 participant-hours of rich qualitative data. Findings suggest that the ports seem to have established a variety of systems and processes to cope with and manage the impacts of extreme weather events. Although acknowledging the need for continuous improvement, the management staff were confident about the effectiveness of current systems and processes to tackle the potential threats from extreme weather events. The general view was that additional adaption measures are not required to specifically deal with the impacts of extreme weather. However, it was also acknowledged that strengthening of adaptive capacity could be enhanced by mainstreaming climate considerations into existing risk evaluation, workforce management, and operational systems. Whilst sustainability issues are becoming increasingly important to port businesses, it is argued that ports should integrate climate change adaptation as part of their wider risk management strategies, as well as their sustainable development agenda to update and guide the actions, behaviours, and practices of the port workforce.","[Chhetri, Prem; Gekara, Victor; Thai, Vinh V.] RMIT Univ, Sch Business IT & Logist, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Scott, Helen] RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Thai, VV (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Business IT & Logist, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",vinh.thai@rmit.edu.au,,"Thai, Vinh/0000-0001-6863-8439",Australian Government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency); National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility,Australian Government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency)(Australian Government); National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility,"This work was carried out with financial support from the Australian Government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) and the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility.

Design/methodology/approach - Standard precipitation index and Mann-Kendal test were used to analyze drought incident and trends of drought occurrences, respectively. The spatial extent of droughts in the study area has been interpolated by inverse distance weighted method using the spatial analyst tool of ArcGIS. Findings - Most of the studied stations experienced drought episodes in 1984, 1987/1988, 1992/1993, 1999, 2003/2004 and 2007/2008 which were among the worst drought years in the history of Ethiopia. The year 1984 was the most drastic and distinct-wide extreme drought episode in all studied stations. The Mann-Kendal test shows an increasing tendencies of drought at three-month (spring) timescale at all stations though significant (p < 0.05) only at Mekaneselam and decreasing tendencies at three-month (summer) and 12-month timescales at all stations. The frequency of total drought was the highest in central and north parts of the region in all study seasons. Originality/value - This detail drought characterization can be used as bench mark to take comprehensive drought management measures such as early warning system, preparation and contingency planning, climate change adaptation programs.","[Mohammed, Yimer; Yimer, Fantaw; Tadesse, Menfese] Hawassa Univ, Hawassa, Ethiopia; [Mohammed, Yimer] Dilla Univ, Dilla, Ethiopia; [Tesfaye, Kindie] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Hawassa University; Dilla University; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Mohammed, Y (corresponding author), Hawassa Univ, Hawassa, Ethiopia.;Mohammed, Y (corresponding author), Dilla Univ, Dilla, Ethiopia.",yimermoh2013@gmail.com,,"Tesfaye, Kindie/0000-0002-7201-8053",,,,,69,32,33,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

So far, the scientific literature has not clearly framed behavioural barriers related to the uptake of mitigation and adaptation strategies. Therefore behavioural barriers are frequently not considered in the modelling framework for climate change policy assessments. This paper presents a method that frames farmers' behavioural barriers and analyses their main determinants in order to incorporate behavioural constraints in the modelling frameworks. Three focus group discussions and a household survey were carried out in order to assess farmers' behavioural barriers taking into account the perspectives of both farmers and agricultural technical advisors. The analytical framework includes Principal Component Analysis to identify behavioural barriers and a binary Logit model to analyse the marginal effects of their main determinants. Farming experience, educational attainment and receiving climate information seem to be the key factors that determine the probability of displaying or not displaying most behavioural barriers. This work presents a method to model behavioural barriers in the context of the adoption of climate change adaptation and mitigation practices. Since a better understanding of behavioural barriers can help to enhance the support of mitigation and adaptation policies to farmers, this study could provide a valuable contribution to the deliberation of climate change policies in Kenya.","[Garcia de Jalon, Silvestre; Iglesias, Ana] Tech Univ Madrid UPM, Dept Agr Econ & Social Sci, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Silvestri, Silvia] Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Granados, Alfredo] Tech Univ Madrid, Dept Hydraul & Energy Engn, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"de Jalon, SG (corresponding author), Tech Univ Madrid UPM, Dept Agr Econ & Social Sci, Ave Complutense S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain.",silvestre.jalon@upm.es; S.Silvestri@cgiar.org; a.granados@upm.es; ana.iglesias@upm.es,"Granados, Alfredo/AAA-6648-2019; Iglesias, Ana/AEN-3261-2022",,European Commission Animal Change project [KBBE-266018],European Commission Animal Change project,"This research was funded by the European Commission Animal Change project (contract no.

The framework is a thinking tool meant as a heuristic that outlines key factors and different dimensions that need to be addressed when assessing vulnerability in the context of natural hazards and climate change. The approach underlines that the key factors of such a common framework are related to the exposure of a society or system to a hazard or stressor, the susceptibility of the system or community exposed, and its resilience and adaptive capacity. Additionally, it underlines the necessity to consider key factors and multiple thematic dimensions when assessing vulnerability in the context of natural and socio-natural hazards. In this regard, it shows key linkages between the different concepts used within the disaster risk management (DRM) and climate change adaptation (CCA) research. Further, it helps to illustrate the strong relationships between different concepts used in DRM and CCA. The framework is also a tool for communicating complexity and stresses the need for societal change in order to reduce risk and to promote adaptation. With regard to this, the policy relevance of the framework and first results of its application are outlined. Overall, the framework presented enhances the discussion on how to frame and link vulnerability, disaster risk, risk management and adaptation concepts.","[Birkmann, J.; Welle, T.] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Birkmann, J.] Univ Munich, Dept Geog, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Cardona, O.

This study aims to investigate the effects of the climate and land-use changes on water balance in 2037, the end of the National Strategy, for the Mun River Basin, NE Thailand. The simulated climate dataset used in this study was ensemble means from IPCC AR5 Global Circulation Models for representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 climate scenarios. The land-use change was simulated using the Dyna-CLUE (Conversion of Land Use and its Effects) model. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to assess the water balance (considering evapotranspiration-ET, percolation-PERC, surface runoff-SURQ, and groundwater lateral flow-LATQ). The combined effects could increase monthly ET, whereas the climate change effect could outrun the land-use changes, resulting in increasing PERC. The sustainable development under the National Strategy (2018-2037) could be insignificantly affecting the water balance, whereas the Bioethanol-Oriented land-use scenario could increase SURQ and decline LATQ, which could intensify flooding.

The lack of green areas, high pollution levels, and human overpopulation contributed to the increase of the urban heat island effect and proved to be the perfect ingredients for the spread of the virus that changed, perhaps forever, our ways of living inhabiting. The consequences were even more dramatic for the inhabitants of informal neighbourhoods, as these exacerbated existing problems related to economic instability and low food and water security. This paper proposes using Nature-Based Solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate change and increase access to water in informal settlements. The research study focused on analysing two technologies, the Blue-Green roof and Rain Garden, developing a prototype for each one. Considering that the practice of self-building characterises spontaneous settlements, the modules were conceived to be built by the inhabitants using recycled materials. These low-tech strategies improve indoor thermal comfort, facilitate the storage of filtered rainwater for domestic use and provide access to affordable food through domestic scale cultivation. Implementing these solutions in marginalised neighbourhoods could also empower residents to face challenges related to Global Warming, such as runoffs generated by heavy precipitations, and improve hygienic conditions to prevent the spread of diseases.","[Munoz Veloza, Monica Alexandra; Dadati, Maria Caterina; Giordano, Roberto; Savio, Lorenzo] Politecn Torino, Dept Architecture & Design, Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin,"Veloza, MAM (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Dept Architecture & Design, Turin, Italy.",monica.munozveloza@polito.it,,"MUNOZ VELOZA, MONICA ALEXANDRA/0000-0002-1865-565X; SAVIO, LORENZO/0000-0001-7139-9256; GIORDANO, Roberto/0000-0001-6640-548X",,,,,18,0,0,3,4,"UNIV POLITECNICA VALENCIA, EDITORIAL UPV",VALENCIA,"CAMINO VERA S-N, VALENCIA, 46022, SPAIN",2444-9091,,,VITRUVIO,Vitruvio,JUN,2022,7,1,,,,,62,77,,10.4995/vitruvio-ijats.2022.17437,http://dx.doi.org/10.4995/vitruvio-ijats.2022.17437,,,16,Architecture,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Architecture,2X6DH,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000825291600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study quantitatively examined the contribution of LULC changes to temperature trends in Myanmar and Thailand as the typical parts of SEA during 1990-2019 using the observation minus reanalysis (OMR) method. Overall, the average maximum, mean, and minimum temperatures obtained from OMR trends indicate significant warming trends of 0.17 degrees C/10a, 0.20 degrees C/10a, and 0.42 degrees C/10a, respectively. The rates of minimum temperature increase were larger than maximum and mean temperatures. The decreases of forest land and cropland, and the expansions of settlements land fractions were strongly correlated with the observed warming trends. It was found that the effects of forest land converted to settlement land on warming were higher than forest conversion to cropland.

These occur about the morpho-functional contexts of the city fabric and the areas belonging to the settlement system. In urban planning, this information is useful at different scales of representation and can be spatialized according to the management and sustainable use of rainwater. The main goal is to facilitate the recognition of environmental and physical-morphological correlations between exogenous and endogenous factors, characterizing the effectiveness of NbS in the mitigation of hydraulic risk, namely: climate change, planning processes and urban governance models. The experiment supports planning systems with an analysis model capable of recognizing risks by processing UWS replicable logical models.

J,"Rose, CM",,,,"Rose, Carol M.",,,RATIONS AND TAKINGS,WISCONSIN LAW REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PROPERTY; EVOLUTION,"Andrew Coan's judicial capacity model explains many things about the pattern of U.S. Supreme Court opinions. Among other things, it perhaps inadvertently explains why the Court makes such wretched decisions about state and local government, particularly in connection with regulatory takings claims. As Coan explains, the Court defines these small-scale regulatory issues as normal, not requiring anything more than sporadic intervention. But because it can dodge these issues, the Court never becomes familiar with them except in the most superficial way and has little incentive to come up with sensible solutions. Instead it episodically creates off-the-cuff categories that often disrupt state and local governance practices. This article will give a number of examples from takings cases, including several mentioned in Coan's book, e.g. the physical invasion and total takings categories, as well as the Court's vexingly intrusive decisions about conditions on land use permitting. Together these decisions create confusion, ignore the patterns in which property rights normally evolve, and impede state and local efforts to deal with major environmental problems such as waste management and adaptation to climate change. Many of the Court's decisions also strongly hint at an underlying prejudice against state and local government.",,,,,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,0,UNIV WISCONSIN LAW SCHOOL,MADISON,"975 BASCOM MALL, MADISON, WI 53706 USA",0043-650X,1943-1120,,WISC LAW REV,Wis.

Cities can benefit from preventing these effects through adaptation measures. However, before any action can be taken in improving these urban climate conditions, an awareness of the problems is needed. Numerous studies show that there is awareness of urban climate extremes as a problem, yet that knowledge lacks amongst different actors in society, and may further differ between countries. Therefore, we conducted an international study on the awareness levels regarding urban climate phenomena and the sense of urgency to act within four groups: citizens, local politicians, urban planners and designers, and urban climate experts. Semi-structured interviews with experts in ten countries worldwide were conducted. Results indicate that the urgency to adapt to climate change was acknowledged rather equally for the four groups of actors. In contrast, awareness of urban climate phenomena (urban heat islands and urban wind patterns) amongst citizens and politicians is rather low in most countries. Amongst urban planners and designers and the urban climate experts we observed a generally high awareness regarding urban climate phenomena. Raising awareness requires tailor-made strategies for specific needs of the different actor groups.","[Lenzholzer, Sanda; Carsjens, Gerrit-Jan] Wageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Landscape Architecture & Spatial Planning Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Brown, Robert D.; Kim, YouJoung; Lee, Kanghyun] Texas A&M Univ, Landscape Architecture & Urban Planning, College Stn, TX USA; [Tavares, Silvia] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Social Sci, Urban Design & Town Planning, 90 Sippy Downs Dr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia; [Vanos, Jennifer] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA",Wageningen University & Research; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of the Sunshine Coast; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Lenzholzer, S (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Landscape Architecture & Spatial Planning Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",sanda.lenzholzer@wur.nl; gerrit-jan.carsjens@wur.nl; rbrown@arch.tamu.edu; stavares@usc.edu.au; jvanos@asu.edu; kyj0244k@tamu.edu; leeman233@tamu.edu,"Vanos, Jennifer/AAO-3146-2020; Tavares, Silvia G/E-6337-2017; Carsjens, Gerrit J/B-8048-2015","Vanos, Jennifer/0000-0003-1854-9096; Tavares, Silvia G/0000-0002-8405-9717; Carsjens, Gerrit J/0000-0001-8001-4645; Kim, YouJoung/0000-0001-6281-4884",Microclimate Design Research Group of Texas AM University; Landscape Architecture and Spatial Planning Group of Wageningen University,Microclimate Design Research Group of Texas AM University; Landscape Architecture and Spatial Planning Group of Wageningen University,"This project was partly supported by the Microclimate Design Research Group of Texas A&M University and by the Landscape Architecture and Spatial Planning Group of Wageningen University.

In the case of water, this has resulted in an inappropriate mixing of individualist research methods designed to measure public perceptions of risk and water-based practices, with mass consumption data that cannot be specifically linked to the individual. This mixing has a tendency to reinforce a long-standing blame culture that drives interest in the development of behaviour change initiatives while the relatively unchallenged hydraulic mission to provide safe drinking water and sanitation progresses. With this in mind this paper reviews examples of water use research from California, Australia, and the UK and highlights the more effective routes to understanding water customers and developing behaviour change initiatives that utilise stages of change models and grounded techniques incorporating qualitative and quantitative data from individual sources. A secondary aim is to argue for re-framing the relations between various actors in a changing climate to allow the development of new policy approaches, learning, and openness, from industry, regulators, and customers, based on new theories from the field.","[Pearce, Rebecca; Barr, Stewart] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England; [Dessai, Suraje] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Dessai, Suraje] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Exeter; University of Leeds; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of Leeds,"Pearce, R (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England.",rp292@exeter.ac.uk,"Dessai, Suraje/D-4219-2009","Dessai, Suraje/0000-0002-7879-9364","Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [EP/G061181/1]; Environment Agency [ES/G041040/1]; ARCC-Water project; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; EPSRC [EP/G061181/2, EP/G061157/1, EP/G061181/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/G061181/1, EP/G061157/1, EP/G061181/2] Funding Source: researchfish",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Environment Agency; ARCC-Water project; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),Rebecca Pearce was supported by an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) CASE studentship with the Environment Agency (ES/G041040/1).

This study examines determinants of CSA practices and status adoptions in Siyadebrina Wayu Distract. For this purpose, mixed methods were applied. Accordingly a questionnaire survey, key informant interview and focus group discussion were used to collect data from various sources. Binary logistic regression and descriptive statistic were applied to analyze the quantitative data collected from 368 randomly selected sample households. Findings revealed integrated soil fertility management, crop diversification, crop rotation, and intercropping found to be highly adopted CSA practices in the study area. Factors including farming system, farm size, access to irrigated farm, access to extension service, distance to market places, and access to weather information were identified as determinants for the CSA practices. The result shows that though respondents' participation was encouraging, the rate of adoption of CSA was low. Therefore, we suggest that the extension program should give attention for the introduction of context and site specific CSA technologies and support farmers with relevant skill and knowledge training as well as input provisions. Further, policy and support programs should also focus on dissemination of CSA best practices and lessons learnt elsewhere to smallholder farmers.","[Kifle, Tekeste] Ethiopian Inst Agr Res, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Kifle, Tekeste; Ayal, Desalegn Yayeh; Mulugeta, Messay] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Ctr Food Secur, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR); Addis Ababa University,"Ayal, DY (corresponding author), Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Ctr Food Secur, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",,,,,,,,49,4,4,3,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8807,,,CLIM SERV,Clim.

In this paper we explore very different approach, using shared-values crystallization as a pre-process to standard vulnerability risk assessments (VRAs), which recently reported significant impacts on plans produced. We posit this could be due to learning via changed local perceptions of roles, and we use multiple-case study work with five Village Development Committees (VDCs) in North East District, Botswana, and examine VRA outputs, and pre- and post-VRA interview transcripts, for evidence. Findings indicate that VDC members who took part in the shared-values pre-process significantly clarified and prioritized their general roles, and subsequently engaged more deeply in the planning process, taking more responsibility and ownership for the final adaptation plans. They related climate risks to their local lived-realities better, producing quality action plans, funding innovations and mainstreaming of adaptation into wider local plans, alongside an eagerness to present ideas to higher-governance levels. These findings suggest the shared-values pre-process could be immediately valuable for multilevel adaptation planning practices, and that the concept of role clarification deserves more specific consideration in academic studies on participation.","[Sethamo, Obakeng A.; Harder, Marie K.] Fudan Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Sethamo, Obakeng A.] SADC, Southern African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Ad, Windhoek, Namibia; [Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen, Sylvia] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Harder, Marie K.] Univ Brighton, Sch Comp Engn & Math, Cockcroft Bldg,Lewes Rd, Brighton BN2 4GJ, E Sussex, England",Fudan University; Wageningen University & Research; University of Brighton,"Harder, MK (corresponding author), Univ Brighton, Sch Comp Engn & Math, Cockcroft Bldg,Lewes Rd, Brighton BN2 4GJ, E Sussex, England.",m.k.harder@brighton.ac.uk,"; harder, marie/D-3157-2013","Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen, Sylvia I/0000-0001-7632-8545; harder, marie/0000-0002-1811-4597",China National Thousand Talents Program; European Union [212237],China National Thousand Talents Program; European Union(European Commission),"This work was funded indirectly through the China National Thousand Talents Program funding the post of MKH, and builds directly on work funded by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (grant number 212237) under the 'Research for the Benefit of Specific Groups: Civil Society Organizations', ESDinds.",,65,0,0,1,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Current agricultural systems and their nutrient cycles are out of balance, due to the segregation of feed provision and consumption. However, knowledge on interlinkages between feed supply and demand is scarce and remains unclear on the transnational level. Here we show that the ecosystem service (ES) biomass production from grassland (BP), based on supply, flow and demand, varies spatially in the Alpine space and that climate change is contributing to the amplification of BP surpluses or deficits. We detected hotspots of BP flow and demand resulting in a negative energy balance: in the strongholds of animal husbandry, the demand exceeded the flow by up to 2,320 GJ ME ha(-1). We found strong regional distinctions concerning climate change: Southern Alps will experience loss in BP provision, whereas low-elevation pre-Alps are predisposed to an increase of BP provision under moderate climate change. Livestock systems in mountains depend on grassland BP flows. We therefore recommend that our findings are integrated in a climate change adapted grassland management, which is crucial on the transnational level for the restoration and maintenance of regional nutrient cycles and BP provision.","[Jaeger, Hieronymus; Tappeiner, Ulrike] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Ecol, Sternwartestr 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Jaeger, Hieronymus] Ifuplan Inst Environm Planning & Spatial Dev, Amalienstr 79, D-80799 Munich, Germany; [Peratoner, Giovanni] Laimburg Res Ctr, Res Area Mt Agr, Laimburg 6, I-39040 Post Auer, Italy; [Tappeiner, Ulrike; Tasser, Erich] Eurac Res, Inst Alpine Environm, Drususallee 1, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy",University of Innsbruck; European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano,"Jager, H (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Dept Ecol, Sternwartestr 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",hieronymus.jaeger@uibk.ac.at,"Tappeiner, Ulrike/B-8727-2009; Tasser, Erich/AAS-8608-2020","Tappeiner, Ulrike/0000-0002-0195-7459; Tasser, Erich/0000-0002-9179-7494","European Regional Development Fund through the Interreg Alpine Space programme ('AlpES' project) [CUP: D52I16000220007]; Autonomous Province of Bozen/Bolzano - South Tyrol (Division for the Promotion of Education, Universities and Research, project MONALISA); Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy; HRSM-cooperation project KLIMAGRO; University of Innsbruck","European Regional Development Fund through the Interreg Alpine Space programme ('AlpES' project); Autonomous Province of Bozen/Bolzano - South Tyrol (Division for the Promotion of Education, Universities and Research, project MONALISA); Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy; HRSM-cooperation project KLIMAGRO; University of Innsbruck","We thank the involved editors and reviewers for their insightful comments that substantially improved the paper.

This degradation is predicted to have consequences for many processes, which previous modelling studies have suggested would occur gradually. Here we project that soil moisture will decrease abruptly (within a few months) in response to permafrost degradation over large areas of the present-day permafrost region, based on analysis of transient climate change simulations performed using a state-of-the-art regional climate model. This regime shift is reflected in abrupt increases in summer near-surface temperature and convective precipitation, and decreases in relative humidity and surface runoff. Of particular relevance to northern systems are changes to the bearing capacity of the soil due to increased drainage, increases in the potential for intense rainfall events and increases in lightning frequency. Combined with increases in forest fuel combustibility, these are projected to abruptly and substantially increase the severity of wildfires, which constitute one of the greatest risks to northern ecosystems, communities and infrastructures.

In this systematic literature review, we investigated the geographic, methodological, and conceptual characteristics of case studies in climate change science to evaluate the extent they provide policy recommendations to answer the questions: how can researchers best gather and report policy-relevant information for climate change adaptation, resilience, and/or recovery? What are the current themes within the literature, and how can these areas best advance as policy-relevant fields within climate change science? Findings highlight that policy recommendations were more robust, and significantly more likely, in case studies that employ participatory research methods; and geographic characteristics and use of theoretical frameworks are associated with providing policy recommendations. On the other hand, studies that focus on biophysical parameters of climate change offered weak or no policy recommendations.Thus, we conclude that local-level case study research can serve as validation and calibration data for large-scale models as long as they accurately represent the local values and perceptions of the people in the study area. We elaborate on the opportunities that exist in non-human, biophysical, research for communicating findings to policy-friendly audiences.","[Teodoro, Jose Daniel; OLeary, Donal S.; Silva, Julie A.] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, 2138 Samuel J LeFrak Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Kerr, Siobhan E.] Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Peskin, Eva] Univ Maryland, Dept Womens Studies, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Teodoro, JD (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, 2138 Samuel J LeFrak Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",teodoro@umd.edu,,"Silva, Julie/0000-0002-4837-5288; Teodoro, Jose Daniel/0000-0002-6904-2829","Department of Geographical Sciences, University of Maryland","Department of Geographical Sciences, University of Maryland","Funding was provided by the Department of Geographical Sciences, University of Maryland.",,69,2,2,2,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2523-3963,2523-3971,,SN APPL SCI,SN Appl.

Using the Colwell index of predictability and monthly normalized precipitation data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model ensembles, this study identifies spatial hotspots of changes in precipitation predictability in the United States under various climate scenarios. Over the historic period (1950-2005), the recurrent pattern of precipitation is highly predictable in the East and along the coastal Northwest, and is less so in the arid Southwest. Comparing the future (2040-2095) to the historic period, larger changes in precipitation predictability are observed under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 8.5 than those under RCP 4.5. Finally, there are region-specific hotspots of future changes in precipitation predictability, and these hotspots often coincide with regions of little projected change in total precipitation, with exceptions along the wetter East and parts of the drier central West. Therefore, decision-makers are advised to not rely on future total precipitation as an indicator of water resources. Changes in precipitation predictability and the subsequent changes on seasonality and variability are equally, if not more, important factors to be included in future regional environmental assessment.","[Jiang, Mingkai; Felzer, Benjamin S.; Sahagian, Dork] Lehigh Univ, Earth & Environm Sci, 1 W Packer Ave, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA",Lehigh University,"Jiang, MK (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Earth & Environm Sci, 1 W Packer Ave, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",mij212@lehigh.edu,"Jiang, Mingkai/Y-3305-2019; Felzer, Benjamin S/AAB-3456-2021","Jiang, Mingkai/0000-0002-9982-9518; Felzer, Benjamin S/0000-0002-3990-3739","National Science Foundation (NSF) Macrosystems Biology (MSB) [1137306, NSF 10-555]; NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Science (IBSS) [1416651, NSF 12-614]",National Science Foundation (NSF) Macrosystems Biology (MSB)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Science (IBSS)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Macrosystems Biology (MSB) under Grant Number 1137306 (program solicitation NSF 10-555) and NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Science (IBSS) under Grant Number 1416651 (program solicitation NSF 12-614).

Over the last decades, an increasing number of drought spells has been observed in several parts of Europe. Our study aims to estimate long-term trends of soil drought at Scots pine ( L.) stands along the prevailing climatic gradient in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, northeastern Germany. To this end, soil water balance simulations were carried out at 24 sites over the period from 1951 to 2009 with the physically based model LWF-BROOK90. As a threshold for soil water stress, we used 40% of relative extractable water (REW). The results indicated an increased number of drought days further east, together with declining totals of precipitation. However, specific site conditions had a large influence on the occurrence of soil drought, partly overriding the climatic differences across the study area. Soil drought has distinctly increased in the recent past, both in duration and in intensity, affecting the eastern sites more than the western sites. The increased soil dryness could be attributed to higher atmospheric evaporative demand due to higher temperatures, as well as slightly lower precipitation sums during the summer months. To mitigate the negative effects of future climate change, adaptation measures should preferably be conducted in the eastern parts of northeastern Germany.","[Bauwe, Andreas; Criegee, Christian; Glatzel, Stephan; Lennartz, Bernd] Univ Rostock, Agr & Umweltwissenschaft Fak, D-18059 Rostock, Germany",University of Rostock,"Bauwe, A (corresponding author), Univ Rostock, Agr & Umweltwissenschaft Fak, Justus von Liebig Weg 6, D-18059 Rostock, Germany.",andreas.bauwe@uni-rostock.de,"Glatzel, Stephan/AAE-8189-2019; Lennartz, Bernd/M-3823-2019","Glatzel, Stephan/0000-0002-2572-5484; Lennartz, Bernd/0000-0003-3020-7312",Exzellenzforderprogramm of the Federal State Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania [UG 08-035],Exzellenzforderprogramm of the Federal State Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania,"The study is part of the research project Forest Adaptation and Restoration in NE Germany (FARSeeING), which is supported financially by the Exzellenzforderprogramm of the Federal State Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (UG 08-035).

Whereas paying individuals directly to be healthier seems to have a limited effect, offering financial incentives through health insurance improves health. Changing the environment to make healthier choices more accessible acts as an incentive to improve health. Employers can provide incentives to improve the health of their employees. Producers and service providers can take voluntary action to make their products less harmful, and they can be nudged into marketing healthier products within a regulatory environment. International agreements and monitoring systems can incentivize governments to do more for health. Lessons from climate change adaptation suggest that multilevel governance and policy integration are greater obstacles to policy change and implementation than knowing what has to be done. Policy change and implementation are triggered by many drivers, many of which are side effects of other policy pressures rather than of the direct policy goal itself. Effective action to reduce noncommunicable diseases will require leveraging social networks into a new ways of thinking about health; making better health prestigious and aspirational, and giving health and wellness a brand that encourages positive behavior change.","[Anderson, Peter] Newcastle Univ, Inst Hlth & Soc, Fac Med, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4AX, Tyne & Wear, England; [Harrison, Oliver] Hlth Author, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Cooper, Cary] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster, England; [Jane-Llopis, Eva] World Econ Forum, Geneva, Switzerland",Newcastle University - UK; Lancaster University,"Anderson, P (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Inst Hlth & Soc, Fac Med, Baddiley Clark Bldg,Richardson Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4AX, Tyne & Wear, England.",peteranderson.mail@gmail.com,,"Jane Llopis, Eva/0000-0002-1739-3635",,,,,166,13,13,1,50,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1081-0730,1087-0415,,J HEALTH COMMUN,J.

The current and future generations of children are the most vulnerable population to suffer the effects of climate change. By 2030, there will be 131 000 additional child deaths each year if climate mitigation strategies are not enacted, driven by the synergy of an increasing burden of infectious diseases, food insecurity and political instability. Over half a billion of the world's children live in areas vulnerable to extreme weather events, and there is a pressing risk that our current lack of action to mitigate and adapt to climate change will result in today's children, and future generations, being the first to have poorer physical and mental health than previous generations - creating a significant intergenerational ethical dilemma. Child health-care professionals need to advocate for policies to address climate change that consider the complex health, planetary and ethical considerations necessary to solve the most significant risk to our children's health today.

With the increasing frequency of water crises worldwide, understanding the nature of climatic impacts along spatial and temporal dimensions is vital to the development of timely, and spatially relevant mitigation options. This study aims to quantify the nature of hydrologic uncertainties at a spatial and temporal dimension in a regional watershed system under scenarios of varying climatic uncertainties. Watershed-wide impacts of climate change under uncertain future scenarios are modeled with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the Connecticut River Watershed of northeastern USA. Changes in watershed flows are quantified for at subbasin scale. The results show that uncertainty in climate change, primarily through variability in precipitation and temperature can lead to spatial and temporal uncertainty in hydrologic processes in the watershed system. In general, the results show that uncertainty in climate can significantly impact the spatial and temporal characteristics in runoff, infiltration, evapotranspiration, and water yield of watershed systems. Strategies to enhance watershed resilience to climatic uncertainty need dynamic information on the vulnerability. Spatial and temporal strategies for adaptation to climatic change conditions could include forest cover and management practices in sensitive locations at local and regional scales.

Land-cover changes can affect the climate by altering the water and energy balance of the land surface. Numerous modelling studies have indicated that alterations at the land surface can result in considerable changes in precipitation. Yet land-cover-induced precipitation changes remain largely unconstrained by observations. Here we use an observation-based continental-scale statistical model to show that forestation of rain-fed agricultural land in Europe triggers substantial changes in precipitation. Locally, we find an increase in precipitation following forestation, in particular in winter, which is supported by a paired rain-gauge analysis. In addition, forests are estimated to increase downwind precipitation in most regions during summer. By contrast, the downwind effect in winter is positive in coastal areas but near neutral and negative in Continental and Northern Europe, respectively. The combined local and non-local effects of a realistic reforestation scenario, constrained by sustainability safeguards, are estimated to increase summer precipitation by 7.6 +/- 6.7% on average over Europe (0.13 +/- 0.11 mm d(-1)), potentially offsetting a substantial part of the projected precipitation decrease from climate change. We therefore conclude that land-cover-induced alterations of precipitation should be considered when developing land-management strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation.","[Meier, Ronny; Schwaab, Jonas; Seneviratne, Sonia I.; Sprenger, Michael; Davin, Edouard L.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Lewis, Elizabeth] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Newcastle University - UK,"Meier, R; Davin, EL (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.",ronny.meier@env.ethz.ch; edouard.davin@env.ethz.ch,"Davin, Edouard L./L-7033-2016; Seneviratne, Sonia I./G-8761-2011","Davin, Edouard L./0000-0003-3322-9330; Seneviratne, Sonia I./0000-0001-9528-2917; Meier, Ronny/0000-0003-0200-6150",Swiss National Science Foundations (SNSF) [200021_172715]; Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN),Swiss National Science Foundations (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN),"We are thankful for the help and advice of A.

We held two scenario development workshops with regional experts in conservation, agriculture, land use planning, policy, and economic development to create scenarios of land use in the northern Piedmont and northern Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. We structured the workshops around a framework that guided stakeholders through several steps eventually resulting in four unique scenarios describing the region in 50 years. Scenario narratives were defined by the intersection of highly influential and uncertain drivers of change relevant to land use planning and ecosystem services. Participants from the northern Shenandoah Valley region selected population growth and climate change adaptation as their scenario defining drivers, while participants from the northern Piedmont region selected planning strategy and climate change impact as their scenario defining drivers. Participants fleshed out scenarios into descriptive narratives that incorporated qualitative and quantitative measures of change. Details from the scenario narratives informed land use change models to further quantify tradeoffs between land use planning decisions and ecosystem services.

In Taiwan, the term resilience is generally considered as a synonym for adaptation. This may limit the use of the notion. By understanding resilience in terms of adaptation and mitigation, we identify six attributes for assessment. The assessment is addressed in local level climate change adaptation policies in two selected cities. The city of Taipei represents places where local adaptation policies were directed mainly by the national government. The city of Tainan represents places where the municipal government plays a more critical role in framing these policies. This can result in different policymaking considerations. The assessment points out that the proposed actions of these policies are broader than a general understanding of adaptation. Mitigation strategies are addressed and sometimes highly recommended. Because of this, we can interpret these actions as resilience strategies covered under the use of the term adaptation. The notion of resilience does not stay on the rhetorical level alone. It is happening in shaping decisions - without using the terminology directly. The broadness of the resilience notion, in spite of being abstract, can provide a more general framework for cross-sectorial discussion and collaboration in policy-making. This is particularly important for dealing with complex issues, such as climate-related disturbances, which cannot be managed by a single group of professions.","[Lu, Peiwen] Natl Changhua Univ Educ, Dept Geog, Changhua, Changhua County, Taiwan; [Huang, Ellie Yu-Hui; Liang, Shu-Yun] Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Liu, Gin-Rong] Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Taoyuan, Taiwan",National Changhua University of Education; National Central University; National Central University,"Liu, GR (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",grliu@csrsr.ncu.edu.tw,,,Taiwan Integrated Research Programme on Climate Change Adaptation Technology (TaiCCAT) [MOST 104-2621-M008-001],Taiwan Integrated Research Programme on Climate Change Adaptation Technology (TaiCCAT),The advanced support from the Taiwan Integrated Research Programme on Climate Change Adaptation Technology (TaiCCAT) is acknowledged and deeply appreciated (MOST 104-2621-M008-001).,,63,4,4,0,10,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1017-0839,2311-7680,,TERR ATMOS OCEAN SCI,Terr.

As a small Indonesian island, Bali is likely to also be affected by climate change impacts, including rising sea levels, drought, and flooding, which will also impact on its paddy production. This paper shows how the focus area of vulnerability assessments in Bali has been identified, based on multiple assessments including literature reviews, statistical assessment, stakeholder and policy assessment, and interviews with farmers. A project team applied a six-step process to identify issues linked to climate change, the purpose and system of vulnerability assessment, potential risk/harm in context, and potential variables for a further assessment. The team identified paddy production as a significant issue, and the purpose and system was the Presidential Decree No.5 on paddy production. Significant concerns linked to paddy production included droughts, land use change, and potential variables for vulnerability assessment such as water level and the price of rice. This paper suggests how adaptive measures should be implemented to handle paddy production in a changing climate.

United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on climate action urges to combat climate change im-pacts that are more pronounced in developing countries and on marginal & small farmers. Climate smart agriculture (CSA) that jointly addresses food security and sustainable agriculture systems has been emphasized, still adoption of CSA practices is low demanding a framework for location specific identification, prioritization and upscaling of CSA interventions.OBJECTIVE: Present study is contemplated to prioritize and upscale climate smart agriculture interventions in climatically vulnerable coastal and non-coastal ecosystems based on perceived effectiveness and upscaling po-tential by farmers. It also attempts to delineate the livelihood indicators of farmers influencing perceived effectiveness of CSA and its upscaling potential.METHODS: Farmers' participatory framework to prioritize CSA interventions in most climatically vulnerable coastal and non-coastal ecosystems of India, where National Innovations on Climate Resilience Agriculture (NICRA) programme of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has been implemented. Farmers have prioritized CSA interventions on the basis of four pillars of CSA giving maximum weightage to income followed by productivity, resilience, and mitigation in both coastal and non-coastal regions. While judging upscaling potential of CSA interventions, coastal district farmers have given highest weightage to technical feasibility followed by synergy with Govt. plans, cost of technology and gender inclusivity; contrastingly, highest weightage is given to cost of technology followed by gender inclusivity, technical feasibility and synergy with Govt. plans by the farmers of non-coastal district.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Micro level stratifications of dominant livelihoods and their differential prefer-ences for CSA interventions (like scientific technology, institutional innovations, indigenous technical knowledge and information & communication technologies interventions) are unraveled. Climate smart agricultural pro-duction technologies prioritized are mainly resistant crop varieties & livestock breeds, intercropping, water management and vaccination of livestock; farmers have also preferred adaptation through indigenous technical knowledge to build resilience. However, adequate institutional infrastructures and use of ICTs are less than sufficient which needs strengthening. The major determinants of CSA effectiveness and upscaling potential in terms of farm livelihood indicators are revealed through multiple regression and path analyses.SIGNIFICANCE: This approach would be helpful for future policy advocacy to prioritize and upscale location specific CSA interventions so as to insulate farmers better from the climatic adversities in similar ecosystems of other developing countries.","[Das, Usha; Ansari, M.

Using data from three case studies, we highlight the ways that industrial development and CCMA initiatives are intertwined in both policy and project creation, and how this confluence is creating potentials for maladaptive outcomes. Each case study involves partnerships between international institutions and the national government, each deploys CCMA as either a primary or supporting legitimation, and each failed to adhere to institutional and/or internationally recognized standards of justice. In Cambodia, mismanaged projects are typically blamed on the kleptocratic and patrimonial governance system. We show how such blame obscures the collusion of international partners, who also sidestep their own safeguards, and ignores the potential for maladaptation at the project level and the adverse social and environmental impacts of the policies themselves.Key policy insights Initiatives to mitigate or adapt to climate change look very much like the development projects that caused climate change: Extreme caution must be exercised to ensure policies and projects do not exacerbate the conditions driving climate change.Safeguards on paper' are insufficient to avoid negative impacts and strict accountability mechanisms must be put in place.Academic researchers can be part of that accountability mechanism through case study reports, policy briefs, technical facilitation to help ensure community needs are met and safeguards are executed as written.Impacts beyond the project scale must be assessed to avoid negative consequences for social and ecological systems at the landscape level.","[Work, Courtney; Scheidel, Arnim] Inst Social Studies, Governance Law & Social Justice, The Hague, Netherlands; [Song, Danik] Equitable Cambodia, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Rong, Vannrith] Royal Univ Phnom Penh, Dev Studies, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Rong, Vannrith] Cambodian Peace Bldg Network CPN, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Work, Courtney] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Ethnol, Taipei, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Work, C (corresponding author), Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Ethnol, Taipei, Taiwan.",cwork@nccu.edu.tw,"Scheidel, Arnim/C-3105-2018","Scheidel, Arnim/0000-0001-9764-685X; Work, Courtney/0000-0003-4454-0247",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [W07.68.416]; United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DfID) as part of the Conflict and Cooperation in the Management of Climate Change (CCMCC) initiative [07.68.416],Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DfID) as part of the Conflict and Cooperation in the Management of Climate Change (CCMCC) initiative,Research was conducted with funding by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO; grant number W07.68.416) and the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DfID; grant number 07.68.416) as part of the Conflict and Cooperation in the Management of Climate Change (CCMCC) initiative.,,78,32,32,3,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

The need for a reliable seasonal hydrologic forecast is significant and is becoming even more urgent under future climate conditions, as the assimilation of seasonal forecast information in decision making becomes part of the short and long-term climate change adaptation strategies in a range of contexts, such as energy supply, water supply and management, rural urban, agriculture, infrastructure and disaster preparedness and relief. This work deals with the framework for implementation of the Pitman-WR2012 model in a hydrological forecasting mode. The Pitman-WR2012 model was forced with 10-member ensemble seasonal climate forecast from Climate Forecast Systems v.2 (CFSv2), which is downscaled using the principal components regression (PCR) approach. The generated seasonal hydrological forecast focused on the summer season, in particular on the Dec-Jan-Feb (DJF) period, which is the rainy season in the studied catchment (Kraai River catchment in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa). The hydrological forecast issued at the end of November showed skill in December and February (assessed through Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Ranked Probability Skill Score (RPSS)), with poorer skill in January. Importantly, the skill of streamflow forecast was better than that of rainfall forecast, which likely results from the influence of the initial conditions of the hydrological model. In conclusion Pitman-WR2012 model performed realistically when implemented in seasonal hydrological forecasts mode, and it is important that in that mode the model is run with near-real-time rainfall data in order to maximize forecast skill arising from initial conditions.","[Fikileni, Sesethu; Wolski, Piotr] Univ Cape Town, Climate Syst Anal Grp, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Fikileni, S (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Climate Syst Anal Grp, Cape Town, South Africa.",3142270@myuwc.ac.za,,"Wolski, Piotr/0000-0002-6120-6593","Department of Science and Technology (DST), through a National Research Foundation (NRF); Water Research Commission [K5-2436, K5-2746]","Department of Science and Technology (DST), through a National Research Foundation (NRF)(Department of Science & Technology (India)Department of Science & Technology (DOST), Philippines); Water Research Commission","The financial assistance of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), through a National Research Foundation (NRF) scholarship, towards this research is hereby acknowledged.; A special word of thanks goes out to the data providers such as the Department of Water and Sanitation, for streamflow data, the online Water Resource Study 2012 (Dr Allan Bailey) for assistance in the Pitman Model, South African Weather Service (SAWS) for the rainfall data, Water Research Commission Projects K5-2436 and K5-2746 and Climate System Analysis Group (CSAG) for CHIRPS data and downscaled climate (rainfall) forecasts.",,49,0,0,3,3,WATER RESEARCH COMMISSION,PRETORIA,"PO BOX 824, PRETORIA 0001, SOUTH AFRICA",0378-4738,1816-7950,,WATER SA,Water SA,JAN,2022,48,1,,,,,62,74,,10.17159/wsa/2022.v48.i1.3891,http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/wsa/2022.v48.i1.3891,,,13,Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Water Resources,1C1BG,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000792862700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aimed to formulate alginate macrobeads inoculants using strains Bacillus sp. XT13 and XT14, and evaluate their effect on the stress response of guinea grass under drought. First, we produced two prototypes per bacterial strain based on the alginate-bacterial broth ratio and selected one for each strain based on the release kinetics and the biodegradability of the formulates in soil. Then, we evaluated their effect on some biochemical, morphological, and nutritional responses of Guinea grass under drought in greenhouse conditions. The results showed a biodegradability increase and a slow-release rate for the prototypes 70:30 XT13 and 80:20 XT14. The greenhouse experiments showed that inoculation of both Bacillus sp. strains improved plant growth significantly under drought. Furthermore, the co-inoculation of the alginate macrobeads of both strains showed a greater effect on the grass response than that observed with individual inoculations (p < 0.05). When compared with the drought control treatment, the co-inoculation increased plant total dry biomass production by 94.4% and nutritional quality parameters such as crude protein content (260%) and digestibility (10.73%). Co-inoculation also showed a significant effect (p < 0.05) in the plant's antioxidant response, as the ascorbate peroxidase activity decreased 5.46%. In contrast, proline accumulation increased in plants inoculated with the alginate macrobeads of XT13, XT14 and XT13 + XT14 by 3.1-fold, 3.3-fold and 2.3, respectively. Overall, our results suggest that formulation of macrobeads with these bacteria can modulate plants response to drought and have the potential to be a climate change adaptation strategy for agricultural production.","[Mendoza-Labrador, Jonathan; Romero-Perdomo, Felipe; Buitrago, Ruth Bonilla] Ctr Invest Tibaitata, Corporac Colombiana Invest Agr AGROSAVIA, Mosquera 250047, Colombia; [Abril, Jorge] Ctr Invest Tibaitata, Corporac Colombiana Invest Agr AGROSAVIA, Codazzi 250047, Colombia; [Hernandez, Juan-Pablo] Univ El Bosque, Microbiol Ambiental, Programa Biol, 131 A,Cra 9 131a-2, Bogota, Colombia; [Uribe-Velez, Daniel] La Univ Nacl Colombia IBUN, Inst Biotecnol, Carrera 45 26-85, Bogota, Colombia","Corporacion Colombiana de Investigacion Agropecuaria, AGROSAVIA; Corporacion Colombiana de Investigacion Agropecuaria, AGROSAVIA; Universidad El Bosque","Buitrago, RB (corresponding author), Ctr Invest Tibaitata, Corporac Colombiana Invest Agr AGROSAVIA, Mosquera 250047, Colombia.",rbonilla@agrosavia.co,,"Romero-Perdomo, Felipe/0000-0002-4277-1925",Ministerio de Agricultura y desarrollo Rural [3197],Ministerio de Agricultura y desarrollo Rural,Formatting of funding sources Funding: This work was supported by Ministerio de Agricultura y desarrollo Rural-grant n? 3197.,,59,6,6,4,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2452-2198,,RHIZOSPHERE-NETH,Rhizosphere,SEP,2021,19,,,,,,,,100385,10.1016/j.rhisph.2021.100385,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rhisph.2021.100385,,JUN 2021,9,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,WJ7CF,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000709197800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The effects of several drivers, e.g., geomorphology, topography, climate variability, accessibility, demographic indicators, and changes in human activities on the occurrence of natural vegetation in the severe drought periods and, prior to the year 2000, have been analyzed in West Africa. A binary logistic regression (BLR) model was developed to better understand whether the variability in these drivers over the past years was statistically significant in explaining the occurrence of natural vegetation in the year 2000. Our results showed that multiple drivers explained the occurrence of natural vegetation in West Africa at p < 0.05. The dominant drivers, however, were site-specific. Overall, human influence indicators were the dominant drivers in explaining the occurrence of natural vegetation in the selected hotspots. Human appropriation of net primary productivity (HANPP), which is an indicator of human socio-economic activities, explained the decreased likelihood of natural vegetation occurrence at all the study sites. However, the impacts of the remaining significant drivers on natural vegetation were either positive (increased the probability of occurrence) or negative (decreased the probability of occurrence), depending on the unique environmental and socio-economic conditions of the areas under consideration. The study highlights the significant role human activities play in altering the normal functioning of the ecosystem by means of a statistical model. The research contributes to a better understanding of the relationships and the interactions between multiple drivers and the response of natural vegetation in West Africa. The results are likely to be useful for planning climate change adaptation and sustainable development programs in West Africa.","[Asenso Barnieh, Beatrice; Jia, Li; Menenti, Massimo; Jiang, Min; Zeng, Yelong; Bennour, Ali] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Asenso Barnieh, Beatrice; Zeng, Yelong; Bennour, Ali] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Olymp Campus, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Menenti, Massimo] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Stevin Weg 1, NL-2825 CN Delft, Netherlands; [Zhou, Jie] Cent China Normal Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Key Lab Geog Proc Anal & Simulat Hubei Prov, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Delft University of Technology; Central China Normal University","Jia, L (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",b.a.barnieh@radi.ac.cn; jiali@aircas.ac.cn; m.menenti@radi.ac.cn; jiangmin@aircas.ac.cn; zhou.j@mail.ccnu.edu.cn; zengyl2018@radi.ac.cn; alibennour@radi.ac.cn,"Jia, li/GPW-8015-2022; li, jia/GVT-7587-2022; Zhou, Jie/G-6760-2011","Jia, Li/0000-0002-3108-8645; Bennour, Ali/0000-0002-6413-7300; Jiang, Min/0000-0002-3510-9829; Zhou, Jie/0000-0002-1199-4261; Zeng, Yelong/0000-0003-4294-2453; Menenti, Massimo/0000-0001-9176-4556",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41661144022]; United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) [41661144022]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19030203]; Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative [2020VTA0001]; MOST High-Level Foreign Expert Program [GL20200161002]; Chinese Government Scholarship Council (CSC) [2018SLJ023247],National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative; MOST High-Level Foreign Expert Program; Chinese Government Scholarship Council (CSC),"This project was jointly funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) (Grant No. 41661144022), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA19030203), the Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative (Grant No. 2020VTA0001), the MOST High-Level Foreign Expert Program (Grant No. GL20200161002), and the Chinese Government Scholarship Council (CSC) (Grant No. 2018SLJ023247).",,98,2,2,1,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2021,13,9,,,,,,,4673,10.3390/su13094673,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13094673,,,37,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,SC8CO,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000650892000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The adoption of the germplasms will however depend on the effective demand of wheat growers. This study investigates the preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for frost and yellow rust resistance, grain yield, grain color, plant height, and length of maturity traits of wheat in Ethiopia. A choice experiment method was used to generate 8181 observations from a random sample of 303 smallholder farm households. We report mean WTP values, preference heterogeneity and attribute non-attendance patterns based on different formulations of the mixed logit model. The results revealed that farmers are willing to pay for yellow rust resistance, frost resistance, increase in grain yield, and white grain color (cf. brown). Farmers showed disinterest in increase in length of maturity and black grain color (cf. brown). Farmers have high WTP for yellow rust resistance and frost resistance traits, which is nearly 10 times the value they are willing to pay for increase in grain yield of 100 kg per hectare. Similarly, farmers are willing to pay for harvesting wheat yield a month earlier a price four times the value they attach to increase in grain yield of 100 kg per hectare. The weight farmers attach to climate related traits of wheat show the importance farmers implicitly give to the climatic factors they must consider in their wheat production. Therefore, carefully developed wheat varieties would improve the effectiveness of the climate change adaptation strategies of smallholder farmers.","[Teferi, Ermias Tesfaye] Bahir Dar Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Kassie, Girma T.] Int Ctr Agr Res Dry Areas ICARDA, Rabat, Morocco; [Pe, Mario Enrico] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Life Sci, Pisa, Italy; [Fadda, Carlo] Biovers Int, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Bahir Dar University; CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA); Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Alliance; Bioversity International,"Kassie, GT (corresponding author), Int Ctr Agr Res Dry Areas ICARDA, Rabat, Morocco.",g.tesfahun@cgiar.org; marioenrico.pe@santannapisa.it; C.Fadda@cgiar.org,"Teferi, Ermias/AAW-1763-2021","Teferi, Ermias/0000-0003-2279-7666; Fadda, Carlo/0000-0003-3075-6207",Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies and Bioversity International; Wheat CGIAR Research Program,Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies and Bioversity International; Wheat CGIAR Research Program(CGIAR),"We are very thankful to two anonymous reviewers whose comments helped improve the quality of this manuscript.

However, given that adaptation processes are in early stages, evaluation of approaches across agency, organizational, and geographic boundaries is critical. Thus, we conducted a qualitative comparison of three conceptual frameworks for climate change vulnerability assessment and adaptation efforts in the Canadian and United States forestry agency contexts. We focus our comparison on components of the conceptual frameworks, development process, intended users, similarities and differences in institutional contexts (geographic and organizational), and implementation. Finally, we present case studies to illustrate how the frameworks have been implemented on the ground and in different contexts. Despite different trajectories of development, the Canadian and US forest agencies have developed similar conceptual frameworks for vulnerability assessment and adaptation. We found that key components of the conceptual frameworks included: establishing a science-management partnership; evaluating current forest conditions and management objectives; conducting detailed science-based vulnerability assessments; developing adaptation approaches and on-the-ground tactics; implementing adaptation tactics; and monitoring outcomes and adjusting as needed. However, the contexts in which these frameworks are implemented vary considerably within and between countries, mostly because of differences in land ownership, management norms, and organizational cultures. On-the-ground applications, although slow to develop, are beginning to proliferate, providing examples that can be emulated by others. A strategy for accelerating implementation of adaptation in Canada and the United States is suggested, building on successes by federal agencies and extending to public, private, and crown lands.","[Halofsky, Jessica E.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Andrews-Key, Sheri A.] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 117 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N5C8, Canada; [Edwards, Jason E.; Williamson, Tim B.] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Northern Forestry Ctr, 5320-122nd St, Edmonton, AB T6H 3S5, Canada; [Johnston, Mark H.] Saskatchewan Res Council, 15 Innovat Blvd, Saskatoon, SK S7N 2X8, Canada; [Nelson, Harry W.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Resources Management, 4609-2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Peterson, David L.] US Forest Serv, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, 400 N 34th St, Seattle, WA 98103 USA; [Schmitt, Kristen M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Northern Inst Appl Climate Sci, 410 MacInnes Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Swanston, Christopher W.] US Forest Serv, Northern Res Stn, Northern Inst Appl Climate Sci, 410 MacInnes Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Saskatchewan; Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service; University of British Columbia; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Michigan Technological University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Halofsky, JE (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jhalo@uw.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,,,,,70,36,36,5,59,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,1872-7042,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

The increasing incidence of tropical cyclones in the Arabian Sea in recent decades and the devastating impacts of the December 2004 tsunami in India stressed the importance of assessing the vulnerability of coastal areas to flooding and inundation, notably in view of climate change induced sea-level rising (SLR). This study aims to develop a Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) for the state of Goa and to use this index to examine the vulnerability of the different administrative units of the state, known as talukas. This is accomplished by using seven physical and geologic risk variables characterising the vulnerability of the coast, including historical shoreline change, rate of relative sea-level change, coastal regional elevation, coastal slope, mean tidal range, significant wave height, and geomorphology using conventional and remotely sensed data, in addition to two socioeconomic parameters: population and tourist density data. Using a composite CVI based on those relative risk variables, each of the seven coastal talukas was categorised according to its vulnerability. The resulting vulnerability map depicts the talukas that are the most and least vulnerable to erosion, flooding and inundation of coastal lands, and that the inclusion of socio-economic parameters influences the overall assessment of vulnerability. This study provides information aimed at increasing awareness amongst decision-makers to deal with disaster mitigation and coastal zone management, and is a first step towards prioritising areas for climate change adaptation in view of the projected SLR and increased storminess.

There is, however, a knowledge gap in how to design and plan nature-based solutions in a nonanthropocentric manner that enhances co-benefits for humans and nonhuman living organisms. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review to explore how an ecological justice perspective can advance the understanding of nature-based solutions. We argue that ecological justice, which builds on the equitable distribution of environmental goods and bads, social-ecological interconnectedness, nature's agency and capabilities, and participation and inclusion in decision-making, provides a transformative framework for rethinking nature-based solutions in and for cities. A qualitative analysis of 121 peer-reviewed records shows a highly human-centred worldview for delivering nature-based solutions and a relationship to social justice with no direct reference to the dimensions of ecological justice. There is, however, an underlying recognition of the importance of nonhumans, ecosystem integrity and well-being, and a need to consider their needs and capacities through multispecies nature-based solutions design and planning. We conclude with a discussion of the critical aspects for designing and planning ecologically just cities through nature-based solutions and future research directions to further integrate these fields.","[Pineda-Pinto, Melissa; Frantzeskaki, Niki; Nygaard, Christian A.] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Hlth Arts & Design, Ctr Urban Transit, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Swinburne University of Technology,"Pineda-Pinto, M (corresponding author), Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Hlth Arts & Design, Ctr Urban Transit, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",mpinedapinto@swin.edu.au; nfrantzeskaki@swin.edu.au; anygaard@swin.edu.au,"Pineda, Melissa/HGE-4576-2022","Nygaard, Christian A.B./0000-0002-6286-6163; PINEDA PINTO, MELISSA/0000-0001-9644-0569",,,,,133,22,22,39,123,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0044-7447,1654-7209,,AMBIO,Ambio,JAN,2022,51,1,,,SI,,167,182,,10.1007/s13280-021-01553-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-021-01553-7,,APR 2021,16,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XL9NM,33864236,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000640718700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study proposes an ensemble approach for identifying the virtual water content (VWC) of main crops on the Korean Peninsula in past and future climates. Ensemble results with low uncertainty were obtained using three regional climate models, five potential evapotranspiration methods, and the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) crop model. The productivity results of major crops (rice and maize) under climate change are likely to increase more than in the past based on the ensemble results. The ensemble VWC is calculated using three types of crop yields and fifteen consumptive amounts of water use in the past and the future. While the ensemble VWC of rice and maize was 1.18 m(3) kg(-1) and 0.58 m(3) kg(-1), respectively, in the past, the future amounts were estimated at 0.76 m(3) kg(-1) and 0.48 m(3) kg(-1), respectively. The yields of both crops showed a decline in future projections, indicating that this change could have a positive impact on future water demand. The positive changes in crop productivity and water consumption due to climate change suggest that adaptation to climate change can be an opportunity for enhancing sustainability as well as for minimizing agricultural damage.","[Lim, Chul-Hee; Choi, Yuyoung; Lee, Woo-Kyun] Korea Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Lim, Chul-Hee; Kim, Seung Hee; Kafatos, Menas C.] Chapman Univ, Ctr Excellence Earth Syst Modeling & Observat, Orange, CA 92866 USA",Korea University; Chapman University System; Chapman University,"Lee, WK (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",limpossible@korea.ac.kr; sekim@chapman.edu; cuteyu0@korea.ac.kr; kafatos@chapman.edu; leewk@korea.ac.kr,"Lee, Woo-Kyun/AAP-9837-2020","Lee, Woo-Kyun/0000-0002-2188-359X",Korean Ministry of Environment [2016000210001]; Climate Change Correspondence Program [2014001310008],"Korean Ministry of Environment(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea); Climate Change Correspondence Program",This study was supported by the Korean Ministry of Environment as part of the Public Technology Development Project based on Environmental Policy (Project Number: 2016000210001) and Climate Change Correspondence Program (Project Number: 2014001310008).

It illustrates this with a large scale site-specific model which identifies the SuDS devices suitable for the area and also at the smaller scale, in order to achieve greenfield runoff rates. A method to create a series of maps using geographical information is shown, to indicate feasible locations for SuDS devices across the local government authority area. Applying the larger scale maps, a management train was designed for a smaller-scale regeneration site using MicroDrainage (R) software to control runoff at greenfield rates. The generated maps were constructed to provide initial guidance to local government on suitable SuDS at individual sites in a planning area. At all scales, the decision about which device to select was complex and influenced by a range of factors, with slightly different problems encountered.

The property insurance and catastrophe reinsurance sectors are notorious for their cyclicity, with prices and returns oscillating dramatically between soft and hard markets. The problem of overaccummulation in soft market periods is often resolved by the destruction of reinsurers' capital reserves through huge catastrophic losses. This is typically followed by the revision of catastrophe models and reestimation of exposed values, processes which absorb additional (re)insurance capital and provide technoscientific legitimacy for raising rates. Reframing climate change risk in terms of ecologically-sourced devaluation suggests that, rather than posing an immediate existential threat, in the short to medium term the uncertain impacts of global climate change might constitute a recurrent catastrophic fix for particular segments of financial capital. This highlights both the productivity of uncertainty about climate change impacts and the limits of presuming that the operations of the private insurance market can produce a built environment more adapted to climate change.

Knowledge about the potential occurrence of groundwater droughts is relevant for existing and future groundwater users, particularly in regions where climate change is expected to extend or increase the number of dry periods. This study proposes a method to quantify the groundwater memory as basis for characterising the intrinsic susceptibility of groundwater to drought. The memory of groundwater was estimated using a sliding window autocorrelation function applied on 114 groundwater level time series. A Random Forest regressor then modelled the groundwater memory across Ireland, using national digital maps as input files. The key variables explaining groundwater memory are: the relative and absolute surface topography and a thick overburden (>10 m). Accordingly, the lowest memory appears in elevated areas with overburden thick-nesses of <10 m, and vice versa. Areas of low, moderate and high groundwater memory relate to high, moderate and low groundwater drought susceptibility. The uncertainty of the results is lowest in areas of low memory and highest in areas of high memory, presumably related to the distribution of the observations. The results are considered relevant in the context of water resources planning across sectors (agriculture, industry, domestic), particularly in the context of climate change adaptation.","[Schuler, Philip] CDM Smith Consult GmbH, Bouchestr 12, D-12435 Berlin, Germany; [Schuler, Philip; Campanya, Joan; Doherty, Damien; Williams, Natalya Hunter; McCormack, Ted] Geol Survey Ireland, Booterstown Ave, Booterstown, Blackrock, Ireland; [Campanya, Joan] South East Technol Univ, Kilkenny Rd, Moanacurragh, Carlow, Ireland; [Moe, Henning] CDM Smith Ireland Ltd, 15 Wentworth, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Doherty, Damien] Tobin Consulting Engineers, Blanchardstown Corp Pk, Dublin 15, Ireland",,"Schuler, P (corresponding author), CDM Smith GmbH, Bouchestr 12, D-12435 Berlin, Germany.",philip.schuler@cdmsmith.com,"Campanya, Joan/I-4806-2016","Campanya, Joan/0000-0001-5330-7223","Geological Survey Ireland, a division of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC); Geological Survey Ireland [2019-TRP-GW-001]","Geological Survey Ireland, a division of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC); Geological Survey Ireland","This work was primarily carried out as part of the scientific project Groundwater Climate, funded by Geological Survey Ireland, a division of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) .

In this study, proxy variables in 22 sub-watersheds of the Nakdong River, Korea were used to investigate climate exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and non-point pollution in sub-watersheds, a climate change vulnerability index (CCVI) was established, and the vulnerability of each sub-watershed in the Nakdong River was evaluated. Climate exposure was highest in the Nakdong Estuary sub-watershed (75.5-81.7) and lowest in the Geumhogang sub-watershed (21.1-28.1). Sensitivity was highest (55.7) in the Nakdong Miryang sub-watershed and lowest (19.6) in the Habcheon dam sub-watershed. Adaptive capacity and the resulting CCVI were highest in the Geumhogang sub-watershed (96.2 and 66.2-67.9, respectively) and lowest in the Wicheon sub-watershed (2.61 and 18.5-20.4, respectively), indicating low and high vulnerabilities to climate change, respectively. The study revealed that the high CCVI sensitivity was due to adaptive capacity. These findings can help establish rational climate change response plans for regional water resource management. To assess climate change vulnerability more accurately, regional bias can be prevented by considering various human factors, including resources, budget, and facilities.","[Kim, Jungmin; Kwon, Heongak] Natl Inst Environm Res, Nakdong River Environm Res Ctr, 24-11 Gukgasan,Dan Daero 52 Gil, Daegu 43008, South Korea","National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER), Republic of Korea","Kim, J (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Res, Nakdong River Environm Res Ctr, 24-11 Gukgasan,Dan Daero 52 Gil, Daegu 43008, South Korea.",jungminkim6214@gmail.com; hun7082@korea.kr,,,National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER) - Ministry of Environment (ME) of the Republic of Korea [NIER-2021-01-01-042],"National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER) - Ministry of Environment (ME) of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of KoreaNational Institute of Environmental Research (NIER), Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by the National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER), funded by the Ministry of Environment (ME) of the Republic of Korea (grant number NIER-2021-01-01-042).",,36,0,0,3,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

However, the region's climate is affected by complex multi-scalar processes and poorly represented in climate models, leading to uncertainty surrounding rainfall change. The importance of circulation features in controlling long-term rainfall variability provides an opportunity to constrain projections. We use a process-based climate model evaluation methodology to demonstrate links between Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) rainfall biases over Kenya and circulation biases in the Indian Ocean Walker Circulation (IOWC). During both the long and short rains, models with wet biases in historical runs continue to be wet in future. Wet future projections are associated with enhanced easterly winds over the equatorial Indian Ocean, as well as decreasing vertical velocity over Kenya and increasing vertical velocity over the Maritime Continent. We demonstrate that models with a simulated IOWC which is close to reanalysis in historical runs project different changes to Kenyan rainfall than those which do not. In particular, the projected rainfall increase during the long rains is confined to a single month (April) in these models. We call for a renewed focus on the Walker Circulation as a way to constrain uncertain rainfall projections elsewhere in the tropics.","[King, James A.; Washington, Richard] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England; [King, James A.] Univ Sheffield, Leverhulme Ctr Climate Change Mitigat, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Oxford; University of Sheffield,"King, JA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England.;King, JA (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Leverhulme Ctr Climate Change Mitigat, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",james.king@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Washington, Richard/0000-0003-2521-4614; King, James/0000-0001-8825-0183",UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) through the Doctoral Training Partnership in Environmental Research [NE/L002621/1],UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) through the Doctoral Training Partnership in Environmental Research(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),James A.

Inadequate sub-national level information is a significant lacuna for planning spatially targeted climate change adaptation investments. A fixed-effect panel regression analyses of 19 states from 2001 to 2015 assess the impacts of exposure to floods and droughts on the growth of gross state domestic product (GSDP) and human development index (HDI) in India. The flood and drought exposure are estimated using satellite data. The 19 states comprise 95% of the population and contribute 93% to the national GDP. The results show that floods indeed expose a large area, but droughts have the most significant impacts at the sub-national level. The most affected GSDPs are in the non-agriculture sectors, positively by the floods and negatively by droughts. No significant influence on human development may be due to substantial investment on mitigation of flood and drought impacts and their influence on better income, health, and education conditions. Because some Indian states still have a large geographical area, profiling disasters impacts at even smaller sub-national units such as districts can lead to effective targeted mitigation and adaptation activities, reduce shocks, and accelerate income growth and human development.","[Amarasinghe, Upali; Amarnath, Giriraj; Alahacoon, Niranga; Ghosh, Surajit] Int Water Management Inst IWMI, 127 Sunil Mawatha, Colombo 10120, Sri Lanka",CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI),"Amarasinghe, U (corresponding author), Int Water Management Inst IWMI, 127 Sunil Mawatha, Colombo 10120, Sri Lanka.",u.amarasinghe@cgiar.org; a.giriraj@cgiar.org; n.alahacoon@cgiar.org; s.ghosh@cgiar.org,"Ghosh, Surajit/S-9693-2017","Ghosh, Surajit/0000-0002-3928-2135; Amarnath, Giriraj/0000-0002-7390-9800","CGIARs (Consultative Group of International Agricultural Research Program (CRP) on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR Research Program (CRP) on Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE); CGIAR Trust Fund","CGIARs (Consultative Group of International Agricultural Research Program (CRP) on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR Research Program (CRP) on Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE)(CGIAR); CGIAR Trust Fund(CGIAR)","This research was funded by the CGIARs (Consultative Group of International Agricultural Research Program (CRP) on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), and CGIAR Research Program (CRP) on Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE), which is carried out with support from the CGIAR Trust Fund and through bilateral funding agreements.

In order to assess a community's adaptation strategies, understanding of how different groups in that community comprehend climate change is crucial. Public risk perception is important as it can induce or confine political, economic, and social actions dealing with particular hazards. Climate change adaptation is a well-established policy discourse in Bangladesh that has made its people more or less aware of it. Similarly, shrimp-farming communities in southwestern Bangladesh understand environmental and climate change in their own ways. In order to understand how the shrimp-farming communities in coastal Bangladesh perceive current climate instabilities, we conducted a qualitative study in shrimp-farming villages in coastal Bangladesh where about 80% of commercial shrimp of the country is cultivated. We compared farmers' perceptions of local climate change with existing scientific knowledge and found remarkable similarities. Our assessment shows that at least two factors are critical for this outcome: coastal people's exposure to and experience of frequent climate extremes; and a radical approach to defining climate regimes in Bangladesh by various stakeholders and the media, depicting anthropogenic global warming as a certainty for the country. Thus, a convergence of scientific construct and sociocultural construct construes the level of awareness of the general public about climate change.","[Kais, Shaikh Mohammad] Univ Rajshahi, Dept Sociol, Rajshahi 6205, Bangladesh; [Islam, Md Saidul] Nanyang Technol Univ Singapore, Div Sociol, Singapore 639818, Singapore",University of Rajshahi; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Kais, SM (corresponding author), Univ Rajshahi, Dept Sociol, Rajshahi 6205, Bangladesh.",skais11@yahoo.com; msaidul@ntu.edu.sg,"Islam, Saidul/Y-4402-2019; Kais, Mohammad/AAX-4430-2020","Islam, Saidul/0000-0002-6217-0430; Kais, Mohammad/0000-0001-7325-2602","Tier-1 grant from the Ministry of Education, Singapore [RG67/18]","Tier-1 grant from the Ministry of Education, Singapore(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","This research was partly funded by a Tier-1 grant from the Ministry of Education, Singapore (Grant No. RG67/18).",,68,14,14,2,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

In this regard, household strategies tend to be dependent on local and context-specific conditions. However, the strategic development of climate change adaptation measures, as well as natural resource and migration management on national and international level require transferable results and recommendations. In this paper, a first attempt is made to address the lack of meta-knowledge and to create a bigger trans-regional picture on the topic. It provides an exploratory and systematic synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data from 63 studies covering more than 9700 rural households from Sub-Saharan African drylands. Relevant household coping and adaptation strategies under different types of environmental change are assessed with a particular focus on the role and relative significance of migration. The results demonstrate that strategies related to crop, livestock, soil and water management are, by far, the most common. Yet, various forms of migration are reported as strategy by about 23% of the households. Corroborated by qualitative findings, this emphasises the importance of migration for responding to unfavourable environmental conditions at the household level. Based on the synthesised literature, future directions for research needed to support socially and ecologically sustainable coping and adaptation are provided.","[Wiederkehr, Charlotte; Beckmann, Michael; Hermans, Kathleen] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Wiederkehr, C (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Leipzig, Germany.",charlotte.wiederkehr@ufz.de,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Beckmann, Michael/0000-0002-5678-265X",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the Junior Research Group MigSoKo [01UU1606],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the Junior Research Group MigSoKo(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),We gratefully thank Katharine A Tyndall for valuable support of the data collection and coding process and Ralf Seppelt for fruitful discussions.

This diffuse collection of actors and institutions suggest that producing climate services will help bridge gaps between climate scientists and decision-makers and will therefore help vulnerable countries and people manage the risks and optimize the impacts of climate change. This article examines this global science-policy ecosystem using the case of climate services produced by Australian science agencies for consumption in adaptation programming in the Pacific Island countries of Kiribati and Solomon Islands. Linking research on geographies of marketization and the neoliberalization of science, I demonstrate that within the climate service movement a focus on usefulness is paired with an emphasis on commercialization. As a result, this case shows the inherent tensions in the climate service model: first, a focus on competition and circulating service products at the expense of collaborative relationships; second, difficulties in negotiating uncertainty; and third contradictions between 'objective' and 'entrepreneurial' science. In each of these instances, the commercialized mechanisms through which climate services are governed, and the political economic circumstances within which they are produced, magnify rather than ameliorate gaps between science and policy.","[Webber, Sophie] Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney,"Webber, S (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",sophie.webber@sydney.edu.au,,"Webber, Sophie/0000-0002-7597-4622",Social Science and Humanities Research Council Canada; Killam Fellowship; University of British Columbia,Social Science and Humanities Research Council Canada; Killam Fellowship; University of British Columbia,"I acknowledge the receipt of a Social Science and Humanities Research Council Canada Graduate Scholarship, and Postdoctoral Research Fellowship, a Killam Fellowship, and University of British Columbia internal grants, all of which supported this research project.

We explored the role of information in collective decision-making in a landscape planning process in the Baakse Beek region, the Netherlands. Information was provided on (a) the degree to which measures contribute to multiple purposes, (b) whether they are beneficial to stakeholders representing different sectors of land use, and (c) the need for landscape-level implementation of adaptation measures. Our analysis suggests that the negotiation process resulted in collective decisions for more collaborative adaptation measures than could be expected from individual preferences previous to the planning session. Based on the results, it is plausible that the provided information enhanced integrative agreements by leading stakeholders to realize that they were mutually interdependent, both in acquiring individual benefits as well as in implementing the measures at the landscape level. Our findings are significant in the context of the emerging insight that targeted information provision for climate adaptation of landscapes can support collaboration between the relevant stakeholders.","[Vos, Claire C.; Steingrover, Eveliene G.] Wageningen Environm Res, Team Nat & Soc, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6078 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Van der Wal, Merel M.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Radboud Teachers Acad, Erasmuspl 1, NL-6525 HT Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Opdam, Paul F.

The key to ensuring grain yield is to recognize the risks caused by climate change. In this paper, the trends of temperature and precipitation over the next thirty years in China are analysed using CMIP6 under the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5 and SSP 5-8.5 climate scenarios. The resilience indicators of grain yield are proposed for the first time. We find that the higher the emission concentration is, the greater the temperature increase will be and further northward the precipitation belt will move. Meanwhile, the resilience varies across different climate zones. The temperate monsoon climate zone has a stronger resilience to adapt to climate change compared to that of other areas. The resilience of the temperate continental and plateau alpine climate zones are moderate. However, the resilience of the subtropical and tropical monsoon climates zones are poor.","[Chou, Jieming; Xu, Yuan; Yang, Fan; Li, Jiangnan; Zhao, Weixing] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Mingyang] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University,"Sun, MY (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",201821051163@mail.bnu.edu.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1509003, 2016YFA0602703]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42075167]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFC1509003; 2016YFA0602703) the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42075167).,,33,1,1,18,54,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

The results show that: (i) access to public climate information and technical or physical support increases the likelihood that farmers adapt to climate change by undertaking irrigation and/or drainage measures; and (ii) decisions to adapt increased crop yield, but they did not significantly increase crop profit margins. This point appears to have been ignored by previous studies. Based on these new empirical results, the paper suggests that government should continue to provide climate information and various types of supports to improve farmers' adaptation abilities and help to reduce the levels of factor input by, for example, substituting organic for chemical fertiliser inputs. Such government-led policies should be supported alongside the implementation of domestic agricultural supply-side reform.","[Song, Chunxiao; Liu, Ruifeng; Ma, Hengyun] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Zhengzhou, Henan, Peoples R China; [Oxley, Les] Univ Waikato, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand",Henan Agricultural University; University of Waikato,"Ma, HY (corresponding author), Henan Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Zhengzhou, Henan, Peoples R China.",h.y.ma@163.com,"Song, Chunxiao/GXH-8050-2022; Oxley, Les T/A-6075-2008; Liu, Ruifeng/AAW-4881-2021","Song, Chunxiao/0000-0001-7876-8050; Oxley, Les/0000-0003-3621-2323",National Social Science Foundation of China [14BGL093],National Social Science Foundation of China,"Financial support from National Social Science Foundation of China (14BGL093) is gratefully acknowledged.

It also considers how this risk is linked to poverty and to the inadequacies in city and municipal governments. It discusses those who live or work in locations most at risk (including those lacking the needed infrastructure); those who lack knowledge and capacity to adapt; those whose homes and neighbourhoods face the greatest risks when impacts occur; and those who are least able to cope with the impacts (for instance, from injury, death and loss of property and income). Adaptation to climate change cannot eliminate many of the extreme weather risks, so it needs to limit their impacts through good disaster preparedness and post-disaster response.

Considering that this country is a paradigmatic case of almost full access to drinking water service in urban areas, this research is one of the first attempts to measure customers' WTP for initiatives to increase the drinking water service's autonomy when natural extreme events occur. Findings indicate an average WTP of CLP 1,371 (USD 1.81), equivalent to 16.72% of the average water bills per month. We also found significant differences in WTP among water suppliers. Although most sociodemographic predictors are not relevant, the results regarding WTP determinants also suggest that political attitudes are especially important, revealing polarized preferences about water suppliers in need of climate change adaptation.","[Maldonado, Luis; Quiero-Bastias, Maximo; Atal, Gabriela] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Sociol, Santiago, Chile; [Maldonado, Luis] Ctr Social Conflict & Cohes Studies ANID FONDAP, Santiago 15130009, Chile; [Maldonado, Luis; Molinos-Senante, Maria] Res Ctr Integrated Disaster Risk Management ANID F, Santiago 15110017, Chile; [Molinos-Senante, Maria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ingn Hidraul & Ambiental, Santiago, Chile; [Maldonado, Luis] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Sociol, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Casilla 306, Correo 22, Macu, Santiago 7810000, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Maldonado, L (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Sociol, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Casilla 306, Correo 22, Macu, Santiago 7810000, Chile.",lmaldona@uc.cl,,"Maldonado, Luis/0000-0002-0028-4766; Quiero-Bastias, Maximo/0000-0001-5404-9764","FONDECYT REGULAR [1181754, 1191522]; ANID Beca Doctorado Nacional 2019 [21191237]; Fondo de Financiamiento de Centros de Investigacion en Areas Prioritarias [15110017, 15130009]",FONDECYT REGULAR(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); ANID Beca Doctorado Nacional 2019; Fondo de Financiamiento de Centros de Investigacion en Areas Prioritarias,"This work was supported by the FONDECYT REGULAR [1181754, 1191522]; ANID Beca Doctorado Nacional 2019 [21191237]; Fondo de Financiamiento de Centros de Investigacion en Areas Prioritarias [15110017, 15130009].",,59,0,0,2,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1573-062X,1744-9006,,URBAN WATER J,Urban Water J.,JAN 2,2023,20,1,,,,,74,88,,10.1080/1573062X.2022.2153702,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1573062X.2022.2153702,,DEC 2022,15,Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Water Resources,8F8KP,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000894245600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To inform these efforts, the scientific community has provided a growing body of recommendations on biodiversity management with climate change. A previously published study reviewed the first wave of such recommendations in the peer-reviewed literature as they occurred between 1985 and 2007. Here we build on that work, reviewing the literature from the subsequent time period, 2007-2017. We report on the development of the field between the two time periods, and review in depth three highly ranked, climate change-specific conservation strategies from the more recent time period. Overall, recommended strategies for ecological management have remained remarkably consistent over the last three decades, and the field continues to draw mainly on conventional, longstanding conservation approaches. However, the actionability and specificity of recommendations have increased, and certain novel, climate change-specific strategies have become more prominent, pointing the way toward increasing options for practitioner response.","[McLaughlin, B.

The purpose of this research was to explore how climate change-related concerns affect reproductive attitudes and motivations to remain childfree. Two studies were conducted: study 1 consisted of a content analysis of reader comments on articles discussing going childfree in response to climate change, and study 2 featured semi-structured interviews conducted in New Zealand and the USA. The impact of future children on the planet, in the context of overpopulation and overconsumption, was a major theme in both studies. Perspectives of doom and hope emerged simultaneously, indicating how climate anxiety influences reproductive attitudes.

One adaptation strategy is to focus conservation on climate-change refugia (that is, areas relatively buffered from contemporary climate change over time that enable persistence of valued physical, ecological, and sociocultural resources). In this Special Issue, recent methodological and conceptual advances in refugia science will be highlighted. Advances in this emerging subdiscipline are improving scientific understanding and conservation in the face of climate change by considering scale and ecosystem dynamics, and looking beyond climate exposure to sensitivity and adaptive capacity. We propose considering refugia in the context of a multifaceted, long-term, network-based approach, as temporal and spatial gradients of ecological persistence that can act as slow lanes rather than areas of stasis. After years of discussion confined primarily to the scientific literature, researchers and resource managers are now working together to put refugia conservation into practice.","[Morelli, Toni Lyn] US Geol Survey USGS, Northeast Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Barrows, Cameron W.] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Conservat Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Ramirez, Aaron R.] Reed Coll, Dept Biol & Environm Studies, Portland, OR 97202 USA; [Cartwright, Jennifer M.] USGS, Lower Mississippi Gulf Water Sci Ctr, Nashville, TN USA; [Ackerly, David D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ackerly, David D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Eaves, Tatiana D.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Krieger Sch Arts & Sci, Baltimore, MD USA; [Ebersole, Joseph L.] US EPA, Pacific Ecol Syst Div, Off Res & Dev, Corvallis, OR USA; [Krawchuk, Meg A.; Meigs, Garrett W.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Letcher, Benjamin H.] USGS, Conte Anadromous Fish Lab, Turners Falls, MA USA; [Mahalovich, Mary F.] US Forest Serv, Northern Rocky Mt Southwestern & Intermt Reg, USDA, Moscow, ID USA; [Michalak, Julia L.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Millar, Constance, I] US Forest Serv, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, USDA, Albany, CA USA; [Quinones, Rebecca M.] Massachusetts Div Fisheries & Wildlife, Westborough, MA USA; [Stralberg, Diana] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Thorne, James H.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of California System; University of California Riverside; Reed College - Oregon; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Johns Hopkins University; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Oregon State University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; University of Alberta; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Morelli, TL (corresponding author), US Geol Survey USGS, Northeast Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",tmorelli@usgs.gov,"Meigs, Garrett/AAH-4948-2021; Ebersole, Joseph/AAT-5862-2020; Stralberg, Diana/W-9267-2019","Meigs, Garrett/0000-0001-5942-691X; Ebersole, Joseph/0000-0003-1050-1995; Stralberg, Diana/0000-0003-4900-024X; Cartwright, Jennifer/0000-0003-0851-8456","US Department of the Interior National, Northeast, and Northwest Climate Adaptation Science Centers; Wilburforce Foundation; University of California-Berkeley","US Department of the Interior National, Northeast, and Northwest Climate Adaptation Science Centers; Wilburforce Foundation; University of California-Berkeley(University of California System)","Publication of this Special Issue was funded by the US Department of the Interior National, Northeast, and Northwest Climate Adaptation Science Centers.

By drawing upon a body of literature that conceptualizes the established international architecture in this regard as rooted in power relations, this article opens up our current perspective of the EU as an international climate actor. An analysis of policy documents and targeted semi-structured interviews reveals that the EU discursively emphasizes the responsibility of partner countries to manage risk and become 'resilient' to climate impacts, while downplaying the transformative potential of adaptation for development. We see this dynamic further reflected in GCCA policy techniques, which promote the production of quantified and depoliticized knowledge on adaptation. This in its turn further guides the allocation of GCCA support and is instrumentalized in order to establish a stable identity for the organization and reproduce the EU as a climate leader in this regard.","[De Roeck, Frederik] Univ Ghent, Ctr EU Studies, Univ Str 8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"De Roeck, F (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Ctr EU Studies, Univ Str 8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Frederik.Deroeck@Ugent.be,"De Roeck, Frederik/AAD-3436-2020","De Roeck, Frederik/0000-0003-1030-2224",Research Foundation Flanders [11ZU217N],Research Foundation Flanders(FWO),This work was supported by the Research Foundation Flanders [grant number 11ZU217N].,,65,8,8,1,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

We discuss the implications of both approaches in terms of credibility of simulated hydrological indicators for climate change adaptation. For that, we discuss and confirm the hypothesis that a good performance of hydrological models in the historical period increases confidence in projected impacts under climate change, and decreases uncertainty of projections related to hydrological models. Based on this, we find the second approach more trustworthy and recommend using it for impact assessment, especially if results are intended to support adaptation strategies. Guidelines for evaluation of global- and basin-scale models in the historical period, as well as criteria for model rejection from an ensemble as an outlier, are also suggested.","[Krysanova, Valentina; Hattermann, Fred; Kundzewicz, Zbigniew W.] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Res Domain Climate Impacts & Vulnerabil 2, Potsdam, Germany; [Donnelly, Chantal; Arheimer, Berit] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Hydrol Res Dept, Norrkoping, Sweden; [Gelfan, Alexander] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Water Problems, Watershed Hydrol Lab, Moscow, Russia; [Gerten, Dieter] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Res Domain Earth Syst Anal 1, Potsdam, Germany; [Kundzewicz, Zbigniew W.] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Agr & Forest Environm, Dept Climate & Water Resources, Poznan, Poland; [Gelfan, Alexander] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Fac Geog, Moscow, Russia",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Water Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Polish Academy of Sciences; Lomonosov Moscow State University,"Krysanova, V (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Res Domain Climate Impacts & Vulnerabil 2, Potsdam, Germany.",krysanova@pik-potsdam.de,"Krysanova, Valentina/AAR-2324-2020; Gelfan, Alexander/E-2357-2016; Gerten, Dieter/B-2975-2013","Gelfan, Alexander/0000-0003-3288-1933; Gerten, Dieter/0000-0002-6214-6991; Arheimer, Berit/0000-0001-8314-0735; Donnelly, Chantal/0000-0002-0086-4453; Kundzewicz, Zbigniew/0000-0002-3579-5072",Russian Science Foundation [14-17-00700]; project AQUACLEW; FORMAS (SE); DLR (DE); BMWFW (AT); IFD (DK); MINECO (ES); ANR (FR); European Commission [690462]; Russian Science Foundation [14-17-00700] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation,Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); project AQUACLEW; FORMAS (SE); DLR (DE)(Helmholtz AssociationGerman Aerospace Centre (DLR)); BMWFW (AT); IFD (DK); MINECO (ES); ANR (FR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),"The presented ECOMAG model experiments were carried out with the financial support of the Russian Science Foundation [grant no. 14-17-00700].

Local organisations integrate climate change and climatic hazards into the design and development of their projects as a means of adapting to their new climatic situation. Projects designed to boost the resilience of local livelihoods are good examples of local adaptation strategies. To upscale these adaptation initiatives, there is a need to improve information exchange between CBOs, NGOs and academia. Moreover, there is a need to bridge the gap between scientific and local knowledge in order to create projects capable of withstanding stronger natural hazards.","Both ENDS, Strateg Cooperat, NL-1018 VC Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Blanco, AVR (corresponding author), Both ENDS, Strateg Cooperat, Nieuwe Keizersgracht 45, NL-1018 VC Amsterdam, Netherlands.",ar@bothends.org,,,,,,,7,44,45,4,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0361-3666,1467-7717,,DISASTERS,Disasters,MAR,2006,30,1,,,,,140,147,,,,,,8,"Environmental Studies; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Social Sciences - Other Topics,017LA,16512866,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000235693900010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet environmental stress and adaptive capacity are distributed unevenly, and power structures play a role in fashioning them. It is argued here that when access to land and water are impacted by environmental stress, the structures that mediate their access are reinforced, even as the adaptive alternatives for smallholders are undermined. In this way, dominant resource regimes set up migration as the primary viable alternative for adaptation among a dwindling set of choices. This framework is applied to two early analogues of climate change impacts: flooded Garifuna villages of Honduras's North Coast and communities enduring glacier recession and shifting hydrologic regimes in Peru's Cordillera Blanca. In both cases, stress motivates new forms of migration that reinforce dominant power structures. In Honduras, migrants from wealthier social strata are moving on a more permanent basis, and in Peru, the once historical pattern of labor migration is becoming a practical necessity. These cases underscore the role of political economy in adaptation to climate change and adaptive migration in particular. ?????????????, ????????????????????, ??????????????, ????????????????????????????????????????????????????, ?????????????, ????????????, ???????????????????, ?????????????????, ?????????????????????????, ?????????????, ???????????????????????????????????????: ?????????????????

De acuerdo con las narrativas corrientes acerca de la adaptacion al cambio climatico, quienes se enfrentan a los escenarios de la peor clase, sin medios a su disposicion para adaptarse in situ, tienen que encarar un conjunto ineludible de estrategias de adaptacion que en ultimas incluyen el abandono permanente de espacios geograficos que se han vuelto inhabitables e improductivos para uso humano. Pero el estres ambiental y la capacidad adaptativa se distribuyen desigualmente, y las estructuras de poder juegan un papel importante en su formacion. Aqui se sostiene que cuando el acceso a la tierra y al agua es impactado por estres ambiental, las estructuras que intervienen en su acceso son reforzadas, aun a expensas de las alternativas adaptativas para los pequenos propietarios. De esa manera, los regimenes de recursos dominantes colocan a la migracion como la alternativa viable primaria de adaptacion entre un conjunto de opciones cada vez mas limitado. Este esquema se aplica a dos analogos tempranos impactados por el cambio climatico: aldeas garifunas afectadas por inundacion en la Costa Norte de Honduras y comunidades que padecen cambiantes regimenes hidrologicos en la Cordillera Blanca del Peru por la recesion de glaciares. En ambos casos el estres motiva nuevas formas de migracion que refuerzan las dominantes estructuras de poder. En Honduras, los migrantes de los estratos sociales pudientes se desplazan de una manera mas permanente, y en el Peru, el que en otros tiempos fuera un patron historico de migracion laboral se esta convirtiendo en una necesidad practica. Estos casos descubren el papel de la economia politica en la adaptacion al cambio climatico y sobre la migracion adaptativa en particular.","[Wrathall, David J.] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Bury, Jeffrey; Rampini, Costanza] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Carey, Mark] Univ Oregon, Clark Honors Coll, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Mark, Bryan] Ohio State Univ, Dept Geog, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [McKenzie, Jeff] McGill Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Montreal, PQ H3A 0E8, Canada; [Young, Kenneth] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geog & Environm, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Baraer, Michel] Univ Quebec, Ecole Technol Super, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [French, Adam] Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of Oregon; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; McGill University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Quebec; Ecole de Technologie Superieure - Canada; University of Quebec Montreal; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Wrathall, DJ (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur, UN Campus,Hermann Ehlers Str 10, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",wrathall@ehs.unu.edu; jbury@ucsc.edu; carey@uoregon.edu; Mark.9@osu.edu; Jeffrey.mckenzie@mcgill.ca; kryoung@austin.utexas.edu; michel.baraer@etsmtl.ca; akfrench@ucsc.edu; crampini@ucsc.edu,"Mark, Bryan/AAD-6137-2022; /AAD-1453-2020; Baraër, Michel/J-9351-2012","/0000-0002-4500-7957; Baraër, Michel/0000-0003-4138-3354; Young, Kenneth R./0000-0003-0866-1260","Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1010384] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1010132, 1010381] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),,,68,26,26,2,110,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-5608,1467-8306,,ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR,Ann.

We argue that a broader interpretation of adaptation is required for a comprehensive understanding of fishers' adaptive responses. Instead of examining adaptation in relation to climate driven ocean changes alone, we argue that adaptive responses are shaped by and contingent on compounding social, economic, and environmental stressors. Although research has produced management frameworks to support adaptation, few concrete examples of management actions exist, particularly actions aimed at mitigating the impacts of compounding social and economic stressors. We share the results from a multi-sited case study in which we conducted a rapid ethnographic assessment of fishing communities on the US West Coast. By examining ocean change in the context of compounding stressors, our study brings two important points to light. First, fishers are employing a wider range of adaptation strategies than previously thought. Second, there are several unrealized institutional pathways that could support and remove barriers to adaption. Our analysis highlights how ocean change compounds existing stressors through two examples, labor shortages and finding new markets. Through this paper we argue that to support fishing community adaptation to climate change, agencies should explore a range of outside of the box solutions that address cumulative stressors.","[Drakopulos, Lauren] Cornell Univ, Dept Global Dev, Warren Hall 240, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Poe, Melissa] Univ Washington, Washington Sea Grant, 3716 Brooklyn Ave NE, Seattle, WA 98105 USA",Cornell University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Drakopulos, L (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Global Dev, Warren Hall 240, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",laurendrak@cornell.edu,,,National Science Foundation [1616821]; NOAA Sea Grant; Integrated Ecosystem Assessment; NOAA Fisheries,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA Sea Grant(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Integrated Ecosystem Assessment; NOAA Fisheries(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"First and foremost, we extend deep gratitude to the fishers who shared their observations and wisdom during interviews.

Institutions in many smallholder irrigation schemes in developing countries are diverse and have potential to contribute to building climate resilience and improving livelihoods of smallholder irrigator. Human behaviour, institutional capacity and culture play important roles in shaping adaptive capacity of communities to climate change. Although much is known about how these contribute to this adaptive capacity, research focusing on their interaction is limited. In order to close this the gap, this study seeks to explore how socio-demographic, governance and institutional factors influence adaptive capacity in Exchange, Insukamini and Ruchanyu irrigation schemes. Questionnaire-based interviews, group discussions and key informant interviews were used for data collection. Adaptive capacity calculated using the livelihood vulnerability model was used as the dependent variable for this study. Ordinary least square regression was used to assess socio-demographic, institutional and governance factors influencing adaptive capacity in the smallholder irrigation scheme. The study reveals that adaptive capacity is influenced by age, gender, education, land tenure security, irrigation committee satisfaction, cooperatives, and interaction of factors. The link between age and gender were negatively moderated by awareness of irrigation policies, access to credit and land tenure security. Assessing factors influencing adaptive capacity help to improve the livelihoods of scheme farmers in the face of climate change.","[Mwadzingeni, Liboster; Mafongoya, Paramu L.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Mugandani, Raymond] Midlands State Univ, Fac Agr Environm & Nat Resources Management, Dept Land & Water Resources, Gweru, Zimbabwe",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Mwadzingeni, L (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",libomwadzi@gmail.com,,"Mugandani, Raymond/0000-0002-8280-4170; Mwadzingeni, Liboster/0000-0002-8015-7010",South Africa's National Research Foundation (NRF) [86893],South Africa's National Research Foundation (NRF)(National Research Foundation - South Africa),This research was funded by South Africa's National Research Foundation (NRF) grant number (86893).,,114,0,0,1,1,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,AUG 29,2022,17,8,,,,,,,e0273648,10.1371/journal.pone.0273648,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273648,,,21,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,8Z0QJ,36037189,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000933093300046,View Full Record in Web of Science

Restoration actions aimed at addressing these changes and restoring ecological integrity are increasing, but evidence of the effectiveness of these actions is variable. Using a rare 7-year before-after-control-impact (BACI) study of restoration of a lowland groundwater-fed river in England, UK, we explore changes in the macroinvertebrate community following the removal of impoundments and channel narrowing to aid restoration of physical processes. Restoration activity prompted significant taxonomic and functional responses of benthic invertebrate communities in the 4 years post-restoration. Specifically, significant gains in taxonomic and functional richness were evident following restoration, although corresponding evenness and diversity measures did not mirror these trends. Restoration activities prompted a shift to more rheophilic taxa and associated traits matching the physical changes to the channel and habitat composition. Temporal changes were clearer for taxonomic compositions compared to the functional properties of macroinvertebrate communities, indicating a functional redundancy effect of new colonists inhabiting restored reaches following restoration. The results highlight the value of long-term BACI studies in river restoration assessments, as well as project appraisals incorporating both taxonomic and functional observations. We highlight the urgent need of such studies to provide evidence to inform effective river restoration strategies to address future changes such as adaption to climate change and the biodiversity crisis.","[England, Judy; Johns, Tim] Environm Agcy, Howbery Pk, Wallingford OX10 8BD, Oxon, England; [Hayes, Chloe] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Nottingham NG11 8NS, England; [White, James] Cranfield Univ, River Restorat Ctr, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England",Nottingham Trent University; Cranfield University,"England, J (corresponding author), Environm Agcy, Howbery Pk, Wallingford OX10 8BD, Oxon, England.",judy.england@environment-agency.gov.uk; chloe.hayes2017@my.ntu.ac.uk; J.C.White@cranfield.ac.uk; tim.johns@environment-agency.gov.uk,,"White, James/0000-0003-2280-1442; England, Judy/0000-0001-5247-4812",,,,,75,1,1,14,40,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,AUG,2021,13,16,,,,,,,2239,10.3390/w13162239,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13162239,,,20,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,UH6XR,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000690071500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, investigations of consumption-based carbon emissions (CBEs), adjusted for international trade, have been mainly centered on theoretical arguments. This research is an attempt to address the gap by using CBEs in the case of Next Eleven (N-11) countries. Given that the N-11 are tracking to overtake the G-7 by 2050, successful action to mitigate and adapt to climate change will increasingly need to consider the impact of this fast-emerging group of countries. For empirical analysis, this study employs the cross-sectionally augmented autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL) methodology to examine the long- and short-run impact of imports and exports separately, along with economic growth, industry value addition (IVA), and oil price as control variables using data from 1990 to 2017. The empirical findings reveal that imports enhance, while exports reduce CBEs both in the long- and short-run. Whereas economic growth and IVA intensify CBEs, rising oil prices decrease CBEs both in the long and short-run. The main finding of this study provide evidence of carbon leakage and N-11 countries should diversify their energy mix toward renewable energy and adopt policies related to CBEs that recognize the transfer of emissions (carbon leakage) in trade.

To explore the characteristics and trends of global sanitation research literature, this paper presents a bibliometric analysis of 9559 articles published between 1990-2019 and extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection database. With the rapid increase in the number of related publications, both the breadth and depth of sanitation studies have increased significantly in the 21st century. In terms of multiple criteria, the comprehensive research strength of developed countries is greater than that of developing countries. The field is highly interdisciplinary, meaning that collaborations between research institutions are increasing. Keyword clustering analysis shows that the main research topics in the domain of sanitation are: (i) drinking water, (ii) sustainability, (iii) biofilm, (iv) epidemiology, and (v) WaSH (water, sanitation and hygiene). Meanwhile, keyword burst analysis showed that the new research hotspots and frontiers mainly concentrated on: (i) sustainable development of sanitation services adapting to climate change, (ii) main determinants affecting child malnutrition, (iii) research based on global and multi-national data, and (iv) evaluations on various aspects of performance.

However, the large uncertainty in the projections of future climate leads to varied estimations of future flood probability. How to cope with the uncertainties in future flood probability under climate change is an inevitable question in the adaptation. In this paper, the uncertainty introduced by climate projections was integrated into the 'expected predictive flood probability', and the risk-aversion attitude was introduced in the adaptation of river dikes. The uncertainty of climate change impact on flood probability was represented by the uncertainty in the parameters of the probabilistic model. This parameter uncertainty was estimated based on the outputs from the GCMs participated in IPCC AR4. The parameter uncertainty estimated from different GCMs under selected scenarios was integrated into the expected predictive probability of flooding, which was used in the risk-averse economic optimization. Different optimal results were obtained based on varied values of the risk-aversion index. A case of dike ring area in China was studied as an example using the proposed approach. The results show that the uncertainty of climate change increases the optimal dike height and decreases the optimal safety level. The proposed approach enables decision makers to cope with the climate change and the associated uncertainty by adjusting the risk-aversion level.","[Wang, L.; van Gelder, P. H. A. J.

The paper further extends the analysis to generate an insight into Dhaka's urban flood due to possible climate change effects on top of land and housing development projects effects. Design/methodology/approach - A mixed method was applied for this research comprising qualitative techniques for analyzing the date gathered from reviewing the policies including the Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan reports, interviews, discussions and maps, whereas quantitative analysis was used to interpret the data gathered from the global positioning system (GPS) survey and questionnaire survey among the resident of the selected housing projects. Findings - Findings show that a large number of the projects have encroached flood-flow zones and ditches and drainage channels through massive land filling, which resulted in quick changes of land use with wide range of impacts on environment and habitat quality. This study highlighted that the potential climate change impact involves increasing rainfall and subsequent increase flooding. Besides, vast area will be submerged under water and increased warming in the city from high speed built-up area by unauthorized land development. Originality/value -The results of the research can be taken into consideration when making political decisions concerning adaptation to climate change.","[Alam, Md Jahangir] Univ Dhaka, Dept Sociol, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh; [Mullick, Reaz Akter] Chittagong Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Chittagong, Bangladesh",University of Dhaka; Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology (CUET),"Alam, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Dhaka, Dept Sociol, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh.",jahangirsociology@gmail.com,,,,,,,37,4,4,3,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

An often-overlooked aspect of agroforestry projects for carbon sequestration is their impact on water resources. It is often unclear to what extent the establishment of forest vegetation would be limited by water availability, whether it would engender competition with other local water uses or induce water scarcity. Here we use global water models to study the hydrologic constraints and impacts of afforestation in tropical biomes. We find that 36% of total suitable and available afforestation areas are in areas where the rain alone can meet just up to the 40% of total plant water requirement. Planting trees will substantially increase water scarcity and possible dispossession (green water grab) especially in dryland regions of Africa and Oceania. Moreover, the combination of tree restoration and irrigation expansion to rainfed agricultural areas is expected to further exacerbate water scarcity, with about half of the global suitable areas for tree restoration experiencing water scarcity at least 7 months per year. Thus, the unavailability of water can overall limit climate change adaptation strategies.This article is part of the theme issue 'Ecological complexity and the biosphere: the next 30 years'.","[Ricciardi, Livia; Galli, Nikolas; Chiarelli, Davide Danilo; Rulli, Maria Cristina] Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Milan, Italy; [D'Odorico, Paolo] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Polytechnic University of Milan; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"D'Odorico, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",paolododo@berkeley.edu,"; D'Odorico, Paolo/A-5836-2008","Galli, Nikolas/0000-0002-6746-5350; D'Odorico, Paolo/0000-0002-0007-5833; Ricciardi, Livia/0000-0002-0927-4273; Rulli, Maria Cristina/0000-0002-9694-4262",USDA Hatch Multistate project [W4190]; NEXUS NESS project; European Unions Framework Programme for Research and Innovation [2042],USDA Hatch Multistate project; NEXUS NESS project; European Unions Framework Programme for Research and Innovation,"P.D. was funded by the USDA Hatch Multistate project no.W4190 capacity fund.

Within widespread recognition of the need to link sustainable livelihoods approaches with climate change adaptation, there is growing awareness of the importance of people-centered approaches which keep the diverse experience, capabilities, and knowledges of the most vulnerable at the heart of sustainable livelihoods thinking. In response, this paper explores the conditions for changes in modes of livelihoods in a case study area where top-down strategies for sustainable livelihoods are met with residents' diverse experiences of vulnerability, and where climate and environmental changes shape residents' relations with the landscape. The research is undertaken via interviews with residents, farmers/fishers, and local government officials. Our study finds that whilst government-led initiatives for sustainable livelihoods are welcomed in the locality, inflexible policies can make it challenging for the most vulnerable people to access support. Moreover, residents see the capacity to live with and respond to extreme weather events as a critical component of maintaining a sustainable livelihood. Our findings reinforce international literature, showing that 'the poor' are not a homogenous category, and illustrate the importance of attention to the smallest levels of government who are tasked with putting sustainable livelihoods initiatives into practice in relation to people's daily lives.","[Mabon, Leslie] Univ Highlands & Islands, Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland; [Nguyen, Song Tung; Pham, Thi Tram; Tran, Thi Tuyet; Le, Hong Ngoc; Doan, Thi Thu Huong] Vietnam Acad Social Sci, Inst Human Geog, 1 Lieu Giai, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Hoang, Thi Ngoc Ha] Ctr Ecocommun Dev ECODE, 101-B6, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Mueller-Hirth, Natascha; Vertigans, Stephen] Robert Gordon Univ, Sch Appl Social Studies, Aberdeen AB10 7QG, Scotland",UHI Millennium Institute; Robert Gordon University,"Mabon, L (corresponding author), Univ Highlands & Islands, Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland.",leslie.mabon@sams.ac.uk,,"Mabon, Leslie/0000-0003-2646-6119; Le, Ngoc/0000-0002-6021-3775",NAFOSTED; Scottish Funding Council Global Challenges Research Fund; RGU's Research Investment,NAFOSTED(National Foundation for Science & Technology Development (NAFOSTED)); Scottish Funding Council Global Challenges Research Fund; RGU's Research Investment,"The research on which this paper is based is a result of the project `Sustainable livelihood adaptation to climate change of rural residents in the South Central Coast: Approach from human ecology' supported by NAFOSTED (PI Dr Nguyen Song Tung).

Efforts to improve their adaptive capacity often prove mal-adaptive due to misunderstanding the dynamics of the unique socioeconomic factors that shape their vulnerability. By integrating theories from climate change vulnerability and the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach, this study draws upon household survey data from a fishing community in Ghana to assess the vulnerability of fishing households to climate change and explore how their vulnerability is differentiated within the community. The findings suggest that household incomes in the last decade have reduced significantly, attributable to an interaction of both climatic and non-climatic factors. Analysis of the characteristics of three vulnerability groups derived by quantile clustering showed that the most vulnerable household group is not necessarily women or poorer households as expected. Rather, it is dynamic and includes all gender and economic class categories in varying proportions depending on the success or failure of the fishing season. The findings suggest furthermore that the factors that significantly differentiates vulnerability between households differ, depending on whether households are categorised by economic class, gender of household-head or vulnerability group. Consequently, the study highlights the importance of looking beyond existing social categorizations like gender and economic classes when identifying and prioritizing households for climate change adaptive capacity building.","[Koomson, Daniel; Davies-Vollum, Katherine Sian; Raha, Debadayita] Univ Derby, Sch Environm Sci, Kedleston Rd, Derby DE22 1GB, England; [Koomson, Daniel; Davies-Vollum, Katherine Sian; Raha, Debadayita] Univ Derby, Environm Sustainabil Res Ctr ESRC, Kedleston Rd, Derby DE22 1GB, England",University of Derby; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of Derby,"Koomson, D (corresponding author), Univ Derby, Sch Environm Sci, Kedleston Rd, Derby DE22 1GB, England.",d.koomson@derby.ac.uk,,"Davies-Vollum, Katherine Sian/0000-0001-6902-6645","Ph.D. studentship of Environmental Sustainability Research Centre (ESRC), University of Derby","Ph.D. studentship of Environmental Sustainability Research Centre (ESRC), University of Derby","Thanks to Andrew Agyekumhene (site manager of Muni-Pomadze Ramsar site), Michael Selorm (field assistant from University of Education, Winneba), and Gideon Ahiabor (Akosua village) for fieldwork support.

We model the vulnerability of estuarine vegetation (mangroves, saltmarshes and Casuarina forest) to sea level rise in Australia's most populous city, Sydney, and conduct a detailed assessment of impacts and adaptation options for a densely urbanised estuary, the Cooks River. Our modelling demonstrates a range of opportunities for the preservation and, in some cases, expansion of estuarine vegetation area under sea-level rise, though this is largely dependent on the degree of flexibility applied in the management of existing open space. Mangrove area increases under a high sea-level rise scenario, more so than under a low sea-level rise scenario, due to opportunities for landward colonisation. However, this would require estuarine vegetation expansion and land-use conversion of recreational, industrial or private land. Sediment nourishment emerges as a potentially cost-efficient means of preserving wetlands. The mix of wetland types is likely to change without active management, with higher proportion of mangrove and substantially less saltmarsh under all scenarios. Implementation of living shorelines, as opposed to hard defensive structures, could be incentivised. This could be achieved by planning concessions, 'payment for ecosystem services' such as managing 'blue carbon' values, and zoning controls that promote visual amenity and ecological adaptation.","[Rogers, Kerrylee; Mogensen, Laura A.] Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, Nbsw 2522, Australia; [Davies, Peter; Kelleway, Jeffrey; Saintilan, Neil] Macquarie Univ, N Ryde, NSW, Australia; [Withycombe, Geoff] EMT Eastern Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Wollongong; Macquarie University,"Rogers, K (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, Nbsw 2522, Australia.",Kerrylee@uow.edu.au; lm873@uowmail.edu.au; Peter.davies@mq.edu.au; Jeffrey.kelleway@mq.edu.au; neil.saintilan@mq.edu.au; Geoff@sydneycoastalcouncils.com.au,"Rogers, Kerrylee/AAC-8093-2022; Kelleway, Jeffrey J/H-8032-2019","Kelleway, Jeffrey J/0000-0002-5145-9466; Davies, Peter/0000-0002-2711-891X; Rogers, Kerrylee/0000-0003-1350-4737; Saintilan, Neil/0000-0001-9226-2005",Sydney Coastal Councils Group; University of Wollongong Global Challenges Program; Australian Research Council [FT130100532]; Australian Research Council [FT130100532] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Sydney Coastal Councils Group; University of Wollongong Global Challenges Program; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),We thank the Sydney Coastal Councils Group for funding the research.

However, there is limited understanding of the factors that shape actors' perceptions of the fairness of decision-making processes, a concept known as perceived procedural fairness. I develop and test a set of hypotheses about the conditions under which actors that participate in the same environmental decision-making processes perceive the fairness of those processes differently. The study draws upon data from a survey of policy actors participating in task forces, steering committees, and other forums that guide climate change adaptation decision-making in the Lake Victoria basin in East Africa. These actors vary significantly in power and capacity, which raises questions of the degree to which forums provide meaningful opportunities for all actors to contribute to decision making. Findings indicate that among pairs of actors participating in any given forum, satisfaction with procedural fairness is higher among actors with greater social capital, operating at higher administrative levels, and with larger numbers of staff members. Additionally, donor organizations perceived higher levels of procedural fairness compared to civil society, government, and international nongovernmental organizations. These results have implications for efforts to improve the efficacy and legitimacy of environmental policy making in the Lake Victoria basin, as well as other transboundary governance systems in developing regions.","[Hamilton, Matthew] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Hamilton, M (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",,"Hamilton, Matt/HJP-9671-2023","Hamilton, Matthew/0000-0003-0509-4467",NSF Division of Graduate Education (DGE) [0801430]; UC Davis; Responding to Rapid Environmental Change (REACH) IGERT,NSF Division of Graduate Education (DGE); UC Davis; Responding to Rapid Environmental Change (REACH) IGERT,"I thank Emilinah Namaganda, Shuaib Lwasa, Paul Onyango, and Charles Mundia for valuable recommendations and logistical assistance preceding and during fieldwork.

The mountain ecosystems at different elevations are vulnerable to climate change; however, there has been little research into the patterns of vegetation greening and their response to global warming. The objective of this paper is to examine the pattern of vegetation greening in different altitudinal zones in the YNR and its relationship with vegetation types and climatic factors. Specifically, the inter-annual change of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and its variation along altitudinal gradient between 1999 and 2013 was investigated using SPOT-VGT NDVI data and ASTER global digital elevation model (GDEM) data. We found that annual NDVI increased by 17.58 % in the YNR from 1999 to 2013, especially in regions dominated by broad-leaved and coniferous forests at lower elevations.

Rising temperature played a dominant role in driving the increase in NDVI, while precipitation has no statistical relationship with changes in NDVI in this region.

While they were aware of expected climate change impacts, their capacity to use this information to develop geographically specific action plans was limited. We discuss the wider relevance of the evaluation framework, its potential uses outside the study area and how it may be adjusted to suit different local and regional needs and context.

The notion of urban (climate) resilience has become highly popular in both research and practice. However, the concept is inherently malleable; it can be framed in different ways, emphasising different problems, causes, moral judgements, and solutions. This review explores contrasting ways of framing urban climate resilience and their potential consequences. It identifies four typical framings: Urban Shock-Proofing (short-term & system focus), Resilience Planning (long-term & system focus), Community Disaster Resilience (short-term & community focus), and Resilient Community Development (long-term & community focus). These framings lead to different approaches to urban resilience and climate adaptation in research, science-policy-society interactions, governance, and practical resilience-building. They also offer different synergies with wider sustainability efforts, including the SDGs. Resilience Planning is widely represented in urban climate adaptation research. However, Resilient Community Development, dealing with community self-determination, equity, and deeper long-term socio-political determinants of vulnerability, is currently underdeveloped. Expansion of current scientific and institutional toolboxes is needed to support and build community-based adaptive and transformative capacities. Explicit reflection on framing is important to facilitate collaboration among actors and across disciplinary and departmental siloes.","[Wardekker, Arjan] Univ Bergen, Ctr Study Sci & Humanities, POB 7805, N-5020 Bergen, Norway",University of Bergen,"Wardekker, A (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Ctr Study Sci & Humanities, POB 7805, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",Arjan.Wardekker@uib.no,"Wardekker, Arjan/U-8500-2019; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Wardekker, Arjan/0000-0001-7974-4835; ",Belmont Forum project SeMPER-Arctic (Norwegian Research Council) [312938],Belmont Forum project SeMPER-Arctic (Norwegian Research Council),"The author was partly funded through Belmont Forum project SeMPER-Arctic (Norwegian Research Council Grant Agreement 312938).

Thus, this study's primary objective has been to demonstrate that the current climatic zones for buildings in peninsular Spain do not represent the current climatic reality and are not adapted to climate change and the impact on the energy demand of buildings. For this reason, the climatic zones of 7967 peninsular cities have been updated and adapted to the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios by using the data measured in 77 meteorological reference stations. The results obtained have shown that in more than 80% of the cities, buildings are designed and constructed according to an obsolete climatic classification that does not take into account the current or future climatic reality, which will significantly affect the thermal performance of a building and highlights the need to review the climatic zoning in the country. The results obtained can be extrapolated to other regions. The methodology defined in this work can be used as a reference, thus making an essential scientific contribution in reflecting on current capacities and the possibilities of improving the building stock.","[Diaz-Lopez, Carmen; Zamorano, Montserrat] Univ Granada, ETS Ingn Caminos Canales & Puertos, Dept Civil Engn, Campus Fuentenueva S-N, Granada 18071, Spain; [Jodar, Joaquin] Univ Jaen, Dept Math, Campus Las Lagunillas, Jaen 23071, Spain; [Verichev, Konstantin] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Civil Engn, Gen Lagos 2050, Valdivia 5111187, Chile; [Rodriguez, Miguel Luis] Univ Granada, Dept Appl Math, Campus Fuentenueva, Granada 18071, Spain; [Carpio, Manuel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Construct Engn & Management, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile",University of Granada; Universidad de Jaen; Universidad Austral de Chile; University of Granada; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Zamorano, M (corresponding author), Univ Granada, ETS Ingn Caminos Canales & Puertos, Dept Civil Engn, Campus Fuentenueva S-N, Granada 18071, Spain.",carmendiaz@ugr.es; jjodar@ujaen.es; konstantin.verichev@uach.cl; miguelrg@ugr.es; manuel.carpio@ing.puc.cl; zamorano@ugr.es,"Díaz-López, Carmen/AAD-5683-2022; Verichev, Konstantin/AAC-9438-2019; Rodriguez, Miguel L./AAN-8244-2021; Jódar Reyes, Joaquín/AGJ-7171-2022; Díaz-López, Carmen/AAF-8921-2019; Carpio, Manuel/F-6097-2016","Díaz-López, Carmen/0000-0002-6378-6624; Verichev, Konstantin/0000-0001-6523-1238; Rodriguez, Miguel L./0000-0002-0743-9783; Díaz-López, Carmen/0000-0002-6378-6624; Carpio, Manuel/0000-0001-9593-6669; Zamorano, Montserrat/0000-0002-2030-1076; Jodar Reyes, Joaquin/0000-0002-8421-019X","Junta de Andalucia [FQM191, TEP968, FQM178]; University of Jaen [EI_FQM8]; ANID PFCHA/DOCTORADO BECAS [CHILE/2019-21191227]; Fundacion Biodiversidad, del Ministerio para la Transicion Ecologica (the Ministry for Ecological Transition) Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo (ANID) de Chile: ANID FONDECYT [1201052]","Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia); University of Jaen; ANID PFCHA/DOCTORADO BECAS; Fundacion Biodiversidad, del Ministerio para la Transicion Ecologica (the Ministry for Ecological Transition) Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo (ANID) de Chile: ANID FONDECYT","This research was funded by the Junta de Andalucia (Research Groups FQM191, TEP968 and FQM178), the University of Jaen (Research Structure EI_FQM8), Fundacion Biodiversidad, del Ministerio para la Transicion Ecologica (the Ministry for Ecological Transition) Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo (ANID) de Chile: ANID FONDECYT 1201052; ANID PFCHA/DOCTORADO BECAS CHILE/2019-21191227.",,53,10,10,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

This process is known as climate policy integration (CPI) or climate mainstreaming. Enhancing its understanding as a public policy making process can provide insights for its operationalization, which becomes relevant in the context of the implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions in the global South. This paper aims to enhance the understanding of the how windows of opportunity for CPI are formed by drawing on elements from the multiple streams framework (MSF) developed by John Kingdon. This paper analyses grey literature regarding two cases of climate mainstreaming initiatives implemented by international cooperation organizations. The results show that relevant elements from the MSF, such as, attachment to other high-profile national issues, timing the integration with routine institutional procedures, and the presence of policy entrepreneurs, have been catalysing factors for CPI in the context of such initiatives. However, we can only assess the value of this analytical framework for CPI by testing it systematically through case studies in a variety of contexts.","[Garcia Hernandez, Alma Lucia; Bolwig, Simon] Tech Univ Denmark, UNEP DTU Partnership, Dept Technol Management & Econ, Copenhagen O, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Hernandez, ALG (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Technol Management & Econ, Marmorvej 51,Bldg FN Byen,Room 3-7-45, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.",almag@dtu.dk,"; Bolwig, Simon/O-7237-2017","Garcia Hernandez, Alma Lucia/0000-0001-5250-8146; Bolwig, Simon/0000-0003-1537-7938",,,,,78,7,7,4,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

J,"Rose, CM",,,,"Rose, Carol M.",,,RATIONS AND TAKINGS,WISCONSIN LAW REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Andrew Coan's judicial capacity model explains many things about the pattern of U.S. Supreme Court opinions. Among other things, it perhaps inadvertently explains why the Court makes such wretched decisions about state and local government, particularly in connection with regulatory takings claims. As Coan explains, the Court defines these small-scale regulatory issues as normal, not requiring anything more than sporadic intervention. But because it can dodge these issues, the Court never becomes familiar with them except in the most superficial way and has little incentive to come up with sensible solutions. Instead it episodically creates off-the-cuff categories that often disrupt state and local governance practices. This article will give a number of examples from takings cases, including several mentioned in Coan's book, e.g. the physical invasion and total takings categories, as well as the Court's vexingly intrusive decisions about conditions on land use permitting. Together these decisions create confusion, ignore the patterns in which property rights normally evolve, and impede state and local efforts to deal with major environmental problems such as waste management and adaptation to climate change. Many of the Court's decisions also strongly hint at an underlying prejudice against state and local government.",,,,,,,,,,,39,1,1,0,0,UNIV WISCONSIN LAW SCHOOL,MADISON,"975 BASCOM MALL, MADISON, WI 53706 USA",0043-650X,1943-1120,,WISC LAW REV,Wis.

The empirical results showed that value addition to agricultural commodities declines CO2 emissions in countries with high pollution levels. The study revealed a positive nexus between CO2 emissions and energy consumption homogeneously distributed across quantiles. Trade openness was found to lower CO2 emissions in countries with lower and higher levels of environmental pollution. While fossil fuel energy consumption was found to exacerbate CO2 emissions, renewable energy consumption confirmed its mitigating effect on environmental pollution. The institution of climate-smart agricultural options will sustainably increase productivity and income while adapting to climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Diversification of energy technologies with clean and modern energy sources like renewables avoid the over-dependence on fossil fuels for agricultural purposes. Trade policies can stimulate flows of technology and investment opportunities for specialization in production and economies of scale. Hence, the consideration of policies that boost agricultural sector productivity and create an efficient market for international trade in Africa will help in improving livelihoods.","[Sarkodie, Samuel A.] Nord Univ, Business Sch HHN, Bodo, Norway; [Ntiamoah, Evans B.; Li, Dongmei] Sichuan Agr Univ, Yaan, Peoples R China",Nord University; Sichuan Agricultural University,"Sarkodie, SA (corresponding author), Nord Univ, Business Sch HHN, Bodo, Norway.",asumadusarkodiesamuel@yahoo.com,"Sarkodie, Samuel Asumadu/I-3854-2015; Ntiamoah, Evans Brako/AFS-1534-2022","Sarkodie, Samuel Asumadu/0000-0001-5035-5983; ","Nord Business School, Bodo, Norway; Sichuan Agricultural University under the national social science fund (general projects) [13BJY114]","Nord Business School, Bodo, Norway; Sichuan Agricultural University under the national social science fund (general projects)","SAS appreciates Nord Business School, Bodo, Norway for their financial support.

Proxy data has suggested a regional aridification event coincided with this collapse, but there is a lack of records collected from within the Mesopotamian region, where the Akkadian Empire was based. Here we analyse a suite of simulations from the HadCM3 climate model covering the last 6000 years. The results show that long-term drivers produced a shift to a more arid climate, showing minima in both precipitation and river flow at 2000 BCE, whilst temperatures were colder at 2250 BCE. These changes were sufficient to have a negative impact on the natural vegetation in Mesopotamia, suggesting that this climate change would have also impacted the agriculture sustaining local communities. We suggest that the combined effects of climate change and land mismanagement would lead to shortages of water and food, which may have contributed to social disruption and the collapse of the Akkadian Empire. We also find examples of resilience through the surviving cities such as Tell Brak and Tell Mozan. These could provide lessons for adapting to climate change in the future, as modern-day climate change threatens food and water security.","[Cookson, Evangeline; Hill, Daniel J.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Lawrence, Dan] Univ Durham, Dept Archaeol, South Rd, Durham DH1 1LE, England",University of Leeds; Durham University,"Cookson, E (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",ee15ec@leeds.ac.uk,,,Durham University International Engagement grant; European Research Council under the European Union [802424],Durham University International Engagement grant; European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)),"E.C. performed these analyses for her research experience placement in the School of Earth and Environment and as part of her dissertation on BSc Environmental Science at the University of Leeds.

Inarguably, Africa's susceptibility to climate change is high because it hosts the majority of the world's poor who cannot afford the costs of coping mechanisms. Agricultural insurance is being largely put forward as a coping measure of adapting to climate change to sustain farm production and farmers' livelihood. The study critically reviewed numerous publications on climate change impacts and the role of insurance in the adaptation process. It examined the effects of varying weather conditions and insurance on net crop revenue using the instrumental variable regression approach on a Ricardian model. The study further identified factors influencing the purchase of insurance among the farmers with a probit model. The study data were collected from a cross section of farmers in three selected provinces of South Africa. Results of data analysis indicated that owning insurance, number of labourers employed, size of irrigated farmland and rainfall have significant effects on net revenue. It was also revealed that experience, indicated by years of farming and revenue, influenced farmers' adoption of insurance. Consequently, the paper advocates for the provision of efficient irrigation facilities and promotion of insurance among farmers.","[Elum, Zelda Anne; Antwi, Michael Akwasi] Univ South Africa, Dept Agr & Anim Hlth, UNISA Sci Campus,POB X6, ZA-1710 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Nhamo, Godwell] Univ Port Harcourt, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, PMB 5323, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria; [Antwi, Michael Akwasi] Univ South Africa, Inst Corp Citizenship, POB 392, ZA-0003 Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa; University of Port Harcourt; University of South Africa,"Elum, ZA (corresponding author), Univ South Africa, Dept Agr & Anim Hlth, UNISA Sci Campus,POB X6, ZA-1710 Johannesburg, South Africa.",zeldaforreal@yahoo.com,"Elum, Zelda Anne/AAL-6018-2020; Nhamo, Godwell/N-5165-2015","Elum, Zelda Anne/0000-0002-3032-4108; Nhamo, Godwell/0000-0001-5465-2168",Department for International Development (DfID) under the Climate Impact Research Capacity and Leadership Enhancement (CIRCLE) Programme; University of South Africa (UNISA); University of Port Harcourt,Department for International Development (DfID) under the Climate Impact Research Capacity and Leadership Enhancement (CIRCLE) Programme; University of South Africa (UNISA); University of Port Harcourt,This research was supported by funding from the Department for International Development (DfID) under the Climate Impact Research Capacity and Leadership Enhancement (CIRCLE) Programme.

We analyse how both levels approach adaptation to climate change. Using Boltanski and Thevenot's six common worlds of justification model for debates on public issues, we analyse the rhetoric of national, regional, and local tourism strategies in Finland and then explore how the rhetoric is employed by interviewing 42 local tourism actors. The strategy analysis shows that strategic documents do not simply describe situations but are active in creating and shaping future development, and how different kinds of orders of worth are used, to establish acceptable universal truths to shape through consensus how tourism actors think about the sector's future. Results show that at a strategic level, climate change issues are dealt with in an abstract manner, concentrating on the viewpoints of markets and industry, while ecological justification is lacking, and lacks urgency. Operational instructions are not provided for the entrepreneurs. The actors' interviews show that structural changes in the sector are demanded but both tourism growth and nature's survival are taken for granted.","[Kietavainen, Asta] Univ Lapland, Fac Social Sci, Rovaniemi, Finland; [Tuulentie, Seija] Finnish Forest Res Inst, Northern Reg Unit, Rovaniemi, Finland",University of Lapland; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Kietavainen, A (corresponding author), Univ Lapland, Fac Social Sci, Rovaniemi, Finland.",asta.kietavainen@ulapland.fi,"Tuulentie, Seija/H-8901-2018",,,,,,53,14,14,2,13,CHANNEL VIEW PUBLICATIONS,CLEVEDON,"FRANKFURT LODGE, CLEVEDON HALL, VICTORIA ROAD, CLEVEDON, BS21 7HH, ENGLAND",0966-9582,1747-7646,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

Adaptation is therefore crucial to manage the growing threat to coastal communities and cities. This case study focuses on Lagos, Nigeria, one of the world's largest urban centers where rapid urbanization, poor urban planning, degrading infrastructure, and inadequate preparedness compounds flood vulnerability. We situate flood risk perceptions within the context of climate-induced mobilities in Lagos, which no study has done, filling a necessary knowledge gap. Furthermore, we apply a unique approach to flood risk perception and its linkage to migration, by using three measures of risk - affect, probability, and consequence, as opposed to a singular measure. Results show that the affect measure of flood risk perception is significantly higher than probability and consequence measures. Furthermore, flood risk perception is shaped by prior experiences with flooding and proximity to hazard. The effect of proximity on risk perception differs across the three measures. We also found that flood risk perceptions and future migration intentions are positively correlated. These results demon-strate the usefulness of using multiple measures to assess flood risk perceptions, offering multiple pathways for targeted interventions and flood risk communication.","[Ekoh, Susan S.] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Grad Program Environm Sci, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Teron, Lemir; Kristiansen, Silje] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm Studies, Syracuse, NY USA; [Ajibade, Idowu] Portland State Univ, Dept Geog, Portland, OR USA; [Ekoh, Susan S.] German Inst Dev & Sustainabil IDOS, Bonn, Germany; [Kristiansen, Silje] Univ Bergen, CET Ctr Climate & Energy Transformat, Bergen, Norway; [Kristiansen, Silje] Univ Bergen, Dept Informat & Media Studies, Bergen, Norway",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry; Portland State University; University of Bergen; University of Bergen,"Ekoh, SS (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Grad Program Environm Sci, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.;Ekoh, SS (corresponding author), German Inst Dev & Sustainabil IDOS, Bonn, Germany.",Susan.Ekoh@idos-research.de; silje.kristiansen@uib.no,,,Randolph G.

We develop an integrated modelling framework to compute stochastic Pareto frontiers using realizations of three climate scenarios (SIMILAR, DRY, WET) for the semi-arid Seewinkel region in Austria. The stochastic Pareto frontiers relate net benefits of agricultural production (NB) to three environmental goal indicators including groundwater extraction (GWEX), nitrate leaching (NO3), and topsoil organic carbon stocks (SOC). The simulation results depict trade-offs and environmental co-benefits depending on the climate scenario and induced land use changes. A 1% (or 20%) decline of NB reduces GWEX by 11?83% (or 61?100%) and NO3 by 18?19% (or 49?53%), and increases SOC by 1% (or 5%), depending on the climate scenario. The results also reveal some environmental co-benefits for all Pareto frontier combinations. Climate change intensifies or alleviates trade-offs between NB and environmental goal indicators: in a dry climate scenario, trade-offs between NB and GWEX as well as SOC increase, while in a wet climate scenario, trade-offs between NB and NO3 increase. Overall, we find that efficient climate change adaptation of land use and management practices significantly improves the environmental outcomes for fairly small reductions in agricultural net benefits.","[Karner, Katrin; Schmid, Erwin; Mitter, Hermine] BOKU Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Sustainable Econ Dev, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Schneider, Uwe A.] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil, Dept Geosci, Res Unit Sustainabil & Global Change, Hamburg, Germany","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Hamburg","Karner, K (corresponding author), BOKU Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Sustainable Econ Dev, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",katrin.karner@boku.ac.at,"Schneider, Uwe A/M-7342-2016; Schmid, Erwin/Z-1946-2019","Schneider, Uwe A/0000-0002-6833-9292; Schmid, Erwin/0000-0003-4783-9666","ERA4CS JPI Climate project Climate Services for the Water-Energy-Land-Food Nexus (CLISWELN) - Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research [863470]; research project Variability of Groundwater Recharge and its Implication for Sustainable Land Use in Austria (RechAUT) - Austrian Academy of Sciences (OAW); project Uncertainty propagation in integrated modelling approaches for global change and impacts on the bio-economy (UncertProp) [KR16AC0K13332]; Austrian Climate Research Program (ACRP) of the Climate and Energy Fund","ERA4CS JPI Climate project Climate Services for the Water-Energy-Land-Food Nexus (CLISWELN) - Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research; research project Variability of Groundwater Recharge and its Implication for Sustainable Land Use in Austria (RechAUT) - Austrian Academy of Sciences (OAW); project Uncertainty propagation in integrated modelling approaches for global change and impacts on the bio-economy (UncertProp); Austrian Climate Research Program (ACRP) of the Climate and Energy Fund","This research was supported by the ERA4CS JPI Climate project Climate Services for the Water-Energy-Land-Food Nexus (CLISWELN) [Grant-ID: 863470] funded by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research and administered by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG), by the research project Variability of Groundwater Recharge and its Implication for Sustainable Land Use in Austria (RechAUT) funded by the Austrian Academy of Sciences (OAW), as well as by the project Uncertainty propagation in integrated modelling approaches for global change and impacts on the bio-economy (UncertProp; KR16AC0K13332).

Soil moisture dictates the productivity of ecosystems, plays a major role in land-atmosphere interactions, influences climate change projections, and shapes future water security. Monitoring of long-term soil moisture trends has proven useful for managing water resource allocation and developing solutions to global water security challenges. Thus, we examine annual trends in surface soil moisture throughout the U.S. Great Plains region from 1987 to 2016 using data from NASA's observation-driven SPoRT-LIS land surface model at 3 km resolution. Results reveal a drying trend in soil moisture for a majority of the U.S. Great Plains, although wetter conditions have been realized in the northernmost region of the Missouri River basin. These results, when coupled with climate change-driven increases in temperature and evapotranspiration, will inevitably drive baseline soil moisture to drier conditions in the future. Under drying soil moisture conditions, future agricultural production and water resource management in the U.S. Great Plains will become increasingly complicated, thereby threatening future food and water security. However, these results can be applied to inform and improve climate change adaptation strategies in order to ensure adequate volumes of freshwater to meet future human and environmental water demand.","[McDonough, K.

Collective action among smallholder farmers has been suggested as influencing local adaptation processes hence the need to evaluate its impact in different contexts. This paper provides evidence of collective action in enhancing local adaptation to climate variability. It determines the importance of different forms of collective action for enhancing adaptation. Through simple random sampling, a survey of 240 households in Embu County in Kenya and 200 households from Kapchorwa district of Uganda was undertaken. Focus-group discussions involving farmer groups and local government representatives were performed to triangulate information collected through the surveys. The results show a positive relationship between membership in farmer groups and adaptation to climate variability in both sites. Four main components of collective action were identified in Embu and these included the development of internal group capacities, assets mobilization and management, collective marketing, and management of human and natural capital. In Kapchorwa, the development of internal group capacities, risk spreading, and financial resources were significant. We argue that local-level governance and institutional arrangements for collective action are critical for successful adaptation to climate variability.","[Ombogoh, Douglas Bwire; Tanui, Joseph; Mowo, Jeremias] World Agroforestry Ctr, United Nations Ave,POB 30677, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Ombogoh, Douglas Bwire; Muriuki, John] Kenyatta Univ, Sch Environm Studies, POB 43844, Nairobi 00100, Kenya",CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF); Kenyatta University,"Ombogoh, DB (corresponding author), World Agroforestry Ctr, United Nations Ave,POB 30677, Nairobi 00100, Kenya.;Ombogoh, DB (corresponding author), Kenyatta Univ, Sch Environm Studies, POB 43844, Nairobi 00100, Kenya.",ombogodagy@gmail.com,"Ombogoh, Douglas/GYI-8799-2022",,International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) [1228],International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),This work was supported by International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) (ICRAF grant number 1228).,,54,10,10,1,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The goal of this program was to facilitate timely management decisions and adaptation responses to climate change impacts. A novel approach is described for strategic planning that combines available regional-scale predictions and climate drivers (top down) with local monitoring information (bottom up) to identify candidate sentinels of climate change. Using this approach, 37 candidate sentinels of climate change were identified as well as a suite of core abiotic parameters that are drivers of environmental change. A process for prioritizing sentinels was developed and identified six of high priority for inclusion in pilot-scale monitoring programs. A monitoring strategy and an online sentinel data clearinghouse were developed. The work and processes presented here are meant to serve as a guide to other coastal and estuarine management programs seeking to establish a targeted monitoring program for climate change and to provide a set of lessons learned.

This paper considers how climate change came to be considered by local government against four institutional markers: the emergence of climate change advocates among local politicians and civil servants; climate change as a significant issue in municipal plans; staff and funds allocated to climate change issues; and a serious consideration of climate change issues within local government decision making. Considerable progress has been achieved on the second and third of these - but less so on the first and fourth. The paper highlights how climate change issues need to be rooted in local realities that centre on avoiding or limiting impacts from, for instance, heat waves, heavy rainfall and storm surges and sea-level rise, and also the ecological changes and water supply constraints brought about by climate change. To date, international agencies have paid little attention to adaptation, as the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation) has been prioritized. This paper also stresses the importance of building local knowledge and capacity about climate change risks and adaptive responses. Without this, decision makers will continue seeing environmental issues as constraints on development rather than as essential underpinnings of and contributors to development.","eThekwini Municipal, Environm Management Dept, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa",,"Roberts, D (corresponding author), eThekwini Municipal, Environm Management Dept, POB 680, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa.",robertsd@durban.gov.za,,,,,,,1,158,162,1,44,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

There is an urgent need for new types of occupations that balance the built environment and nature (especially forests). For that reason, the concept of vernacular landscape has gotten attention in many disciplines but been regarded as a stand-alone tool or study subject. The paper aims to investigate the co-presence of vernacular and political landscapes (which termed by J. B. Jackson). The hypothesis of this study is that understanding interaction of the vernacular and political way of settling with forests throughout history can pull out problem statements for the future development. By analysis of archival documents combined with fieldwork and interpretive mapping in Thua Thien Hue Province through the key historical periods, the result reveals that the co-presence of the two landscapes has become increasingly profound over time. Simultaneously, there is a trend of decentralization in the territory. Problem statements drawn from the result set a basis for future studies of alternative environmental design and settling model linked with forests to adapt to climate change.","[Quang Minh Nguyen] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Architecture, Fac Engn Sci, OSA Res Grp, Kasteelpk Arenberg 1 Box 2431, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Mai Thi Hong Nguyen] Hue Univ Agr & Forestry, Fac Forestry, 102 Phung Hung, Hue 530000, Thua Thien Hue, Vietnam",KU Leuven; Hue University,"Nguyen, QM (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Architecture, Fac Engn Sci, OSA Res Grp, Kasteelpk Arenberg 1 Box 2431, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",minhquang.nguyen@kuleuven.be; nguyenthihongmai@huaf.edu.vn,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2666-7193,,TREES FOREST PEOPLE,Trees For.

Therefore, this study addresses the livelihood vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies in response to the climate change issues based on empirical evidence from wetland communities using the livelihood vulnerability index (LVI) in Tanguar haor, located in Sylhet, Bangladesh. The finding shows that people of the study area are switching their formal livelihood activities into alternative sources. Crop diversification, homestead gardening, erosion proofing, and cage aquaculture are commonly used by the studied communities to adapt to climate change impacts. The main driver of vulnerabilities was found to be lack of education, underdeveloped infrastructures, lack of advanced health facilities, and lack of alternative livelihoods during extreme events. Therefore, people living in and around the haor region need special consideration. Overall, the study suggests that policy or institutional arrangements are required to promote the better governance system for local communities to improve their living standard so that they can achieve resilience to the impacts of climate variability and change in this area.","[Raihan, Farzana; Milon, Mahmud] Shahjalal Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Forestry & Environm Sci, Sylhet 3114, Bangladesh",Shahjalal University of Science & Technology (SUST),"Raihan, F (corresponding author), Shahjalal Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Forestry & Environm Sci, Sylhet 3114, Bangladesh.",fraihan-for@sust.edu,,,,,,,44,6,7,2,7,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",2040-2244,2408-9354,,J WATER CLIM CHANGE,J.

This occurs because complex relationships exist between adaptive capacity and resilience, and some issues also create challenges related to the construction, operation, and application of resilience. This study identified the dynamics of temporal, spatial changes of resilience found in a sample of wheat-drought resilience in Australia's wheatsheep production zone during 1991-2010. I estimated resilience using principal component analysis, mapped resilience and its components, distinguished resilient and sensitive regions, and provided recommendations related to improving resilience. I frame that resilience is composed of social resilience including on- and off-site adaptive capacity as well as biophysical resilience including resistance and absorption. I found that resilience and its components have different temporal trends, spatial shifts and growth ratios in each region during different years, which results from complicated interactions, such as complementation and substitution among its components. In wheat-sheep zones, I recommend that identifying regional bottlenecks, science-policy engagement, and managing resilience components are the priorities for improving resilience.","[Huai, Jianjun] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Huai, Jianjun] Northwest A&F Univ, Western Dev Res Ctr, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Huai, Jianjun] Northwest A&F Univ, Lab Ecosyst Predict & Global Change, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; Northwest A&F University - China; Northwest A&F University - China,"Huai, JJ (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Huai, JJ (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Western Dev Res Ctr, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Huai, JJ (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Lab Ecosyst Predict & Global Change, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",h2009j.happy@163.com,,"Huai, Jianjun/0000-0003-4175-2260",,,,,49,8,8,1,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,AUG 25,2017,7,,,,,,,,9532,10.1038/s41598-017-09669-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-09669-1,,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,FE8IO,28842585,"gold, Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000408449000011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding behavioural change is critical if federal and local governments intend to implement programmes requiring actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change. This understudied aspect of climate change policy is addressed by quantitatively examining the degree to which residents living in the US are willing to alter their behaviour to mitigate climate change impacts, and by identifying the major factors contributing to this willingness. Based on a national survey, the reported willingness of individuals to alter behaviours is explained, using the components of risk, individual stress, capacity and ecological values. The findings indicate that specific personal traits and contextual characteristics trigger a significantly greater willingness to change longstanding behavioural patterns. These insights into the factors motivating behavioural change can provide guidance to decision makers at both federal and local levels on how best to implement climate change policies.","[Brody, Samuel] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Sci, Galveston, TX 77553 USA; [Grover, Himanshu] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Urban Planning, College Stn, TX 78743 USA; [Vedlitz, Arnold] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Urban Planning, Bush Sch Govt, College Stn, TX 78743 USA; [Vedlitz, Arnold] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Urban Planning, Publ Serv, College Stn, TX 78743 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Bush School of Government & Public Service; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Brody, S (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Sci, Galveston, TX 77553 USA.",sbrody@tamu.edu,"Grover, Himanshu/HNR-4326-2023","Grover, Himanshu/0000-0003-3593-2548",,,,,105,60,60,4,62,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Thermal resilience is among the many aspects of overall building resilience that has the co-benefit of reducing energy demands and carbon emissions. Thermal resilience of buildings is commonly assessed using two indicators: thermal autonomy (TA) and passive habitability (PH). An emerging body of research has identified these two indicators as being significantly correlated to energy efficient building performance. However, there remains a need to achieve consensus about how to coherently and consistently model TA and PH during the early stages of design to better inform decision making. This paper proposes a framework to establish a common set of building energy modeling conventions, comfort and habitability thresholds, and selection criteria for weather data to promote useful TA and PH indicators. It concludes by proposing practical applications of thermal resilience modeling to help address climate change adaptation and futureproofing in codes and standards.","[Kesik, Ted; Ozkan, Aylin] Univ Toronto, Daniels Fac Architecture Landscape & Design, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Kesik, Ted] Univ Toronto, Dept Civil & Mineral Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada; [O'brien, William] Carleton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Ozkan, Aylin] RWDI Consulting Engineers & Scientists, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Carleton University,"Kesik, T (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Daniels Fac Architecture Landscape & Design, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Kesik, T (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Civil & Mineral Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada.",ted.kesik@daniels.utoronto.ca,,,BC Housing and ROCKWOOL North America,BC Housing and ROCKWOOL North America,The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of BC Housing and ROCKWOOL North America for the research underlying this paper.

We found three major north-south axes of connectivity traversing the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which emerged as an important east-west linkage. Only 7% of the highest-ranked connections are currently secured by protected areas. We found 120 linkages in North and South Korea that are intersected by road networks consisting of motorways and trunk roads under both models. These locations should be the focus of immediate attention for conservation planners, as well as 274 and 1130 additional road-impacted linkages under one model or the other. The results can be used for policy support, and potentially as a basis for the two countries to engage in discussions about ecosystem health and climate change adaptation.

This research employs an ordered probit model to data collected from 1800 farm households from drought-prone and groundwater depleted areas of Bangladesh. This is the first study of its kind. Severity of rice production loss, while differing across all three rice crops, was higher for rain-fed crops. This was broadly consistent with available independent evidence. Geophysical factors, household characteristics, institutional and market accessibility, and household adaptation strategy were key determinants of crop loss. The impdct of these factors was specific to the crop and severity of loss. This study has several policy implications involving market, R & D and institutional support based options. Strengthening support systems for institutional and market accessibility, and science driven climate change adaptation strategy including generation and wider dissemination of drought tolerant rice varieties, and enhancing farmers' capacity to change rice varieties on a regular basis, constitute key areas for policy intervention.","[Islam, Zeenatul; Sarker, Md.

We also need to develop new social practices and encourage a broader cultural shift towards sustainability. Against this background, this paper explores the role of mindfulness in adapting to increasing risk and climate change. Based on a literature review, it assesses current research on 'mindful climate adaptation', and explores how individual mindfulness is linked to climate adaptation. While in practice mindfulness-based approaches to climate adaptation have gained widespread recognition (e.g., by the United Nations), the results show that related research is scarce and fragmented. There is almost no research into the role of mindfulness in climate adaptation. At the same time, new scientific domains are opening up in cognate fields that illuminate the mindfulness-adaptation nexus from certain perspectives. These fields include: (1) disaster management; (2) individual well-being; (3) organisational management; (4) environmental behaviour; (5) social justice; and (6) knowledge production. As new concepts and approaches emerge, they require critical construct validation and empirical testing. The importance of further investigation is supported by a complementary empirical study, which shows that individual mindfulness disposition coincides with increased motivation to take (or support) climate adaptation actions. The paper concludes that mindfulness has the potential to facilitate adaptation at all scales (through cognitive, managerial, structural, ontological, and epistemological change processes) and should, therefore, become a core element in climate and associated sustainability research. Finally, it sketches the conceptual trajectories of the mindfulness-adaptation nexus and presents a pioneering, comprehensive framework for 'mindful climate adaptation'.","[Wamsler, Christine] Lund Univ, Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Box 170, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Wamsler, C (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Box 170, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",christine.wamsler@lucsus.lu.se,,,,,,,191,33,34,4,61,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1862-4065,1862-4057,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

Published and unpublished studies from January 2005 to March 2022 in English and Portuguese were included in this review. The search, conducted on PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, SciELO, and RCAAP (Repositorio Cientifico de Acesso Aberto de Portugal), followed a three-step search strategy. Data extraction was performed by two independent reviewers, using an extraction tool specifically designed for the review questions. Twenty-seven studies were eligible for inclusion: six used interviews as a qualitative method, three were systematic reviews, three were case study analyses, three used surveys and questionnaires as quantitative methods, two used integrative baseline reviews, and three utilized a process model design. Six studies targeted local, public and private stakeholders. Community settings were the context target of fifteen studies, whereas twelve specifically referred to urban settings. Seven types of community actions were acknowledged across the globe, characterised as hybrid interventions and referring to the leading stakeholders: local governments, non-governmental organizations, civil society, universities, public health, and private sectors.","[Salvador Costa, Maria Joao; Monteiro, Vanessa; Melo, Pedro] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Hlth, Inst Hlth Sci, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal; [Leitao, Alexandra] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Res Ctr Management & Econ, Catolica Porto Business Sch, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal; [Silva, Rosa] Portugal Ctr Evidence Based Practice JBI Ctr Exce, Nursing Sch Coimbra, Hlth Sci Res Unit Nursing UICISA E, P-3004011 Coimbra, Portugal; [Monteiro, Vanessa] Vila Real Community Care Unit 1, P-5000557 Vila Real, Portugal",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa; Universidade Catolica Portuguesa; Nursing School of Coimbra,"Costa, MJS; Melo, P (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Hlth, Inst Hlth Sci, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal.",mjvcosta@ucp.pt; pmelo@ucp.pt,"Silva, Rosa/AAC-5368-2019","Silva, Rosa/0000-0002-3947-7098; Salvador Costa, Maria Joao/0000-0002-6144-5375; dos Santos Cardoso Monteiro, Vanessa/0000-0003-2078-9128; Melo, Pedro/0000-0002-0005-6384","Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT), Portugal [RL3WP 6-HAC4-CG (NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000067)]","Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT), Portugal(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","This research was funded by Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT), Portugal, Project HAC4CG_6-Heritage, Art, Creation for Climate Change.

Population growth is a driver of both climate vulnerability and climate-altering emissions. We asked, to what extent do countries take population growth into account in their NDCs, beyond simple statements of population trends? Our research method was a comprehensive text review of 164 NDCs submitted by countries. About one-third (49) of countries' NDCs either link population growth to a negative effect and/or identify population growth as a challenge or trend affecting societal needs. Common impacts of population growth noted were increased energy demand, natural resource degradation, vulnerability to climate impacts, and decreased food and water security. Seven NDCs included strategies to slow population growth, and none specified implementation measures. Overall, the adaptation potential and mitigation co-benefits associated with slowing population growth through meeting the unmet need for family planning are largely overlooked in national NDC documents, suggesting that they are also neglected in countries' climate change planning. In upcoming rounds of NDC updates, we recommend that governments consider the potential impact of population growth on adaptation and mitigation efforts, prioritize meeting their unmet needs for family planning, and integrate population-health-environment projects in their national climate plans.","[Dodson, Jenna; Derer, Patricia; Gotmark, Frank] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Cafaro, Philip] Colorado State Univ, Sch Global Environm Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO USA",University of Gothenburg; Colorado State University,"Gotmark, F (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden.",frank.gotmark@bioenv.gu.se,,"Gotmark, Frank/0000-0003-2604-3298",University of Gothenburg - Global Challenges Foundation [3/2017],University of Gothenburg - Global Challenges Foundation,Open access funding provided by University of Gothenburg.

Here we report, climate-induced future hydrological prediction in Mangoky river, Madagascar using an artificial neural network (ANN) and the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). The current study downscaled two global climate models on the mid-term, noted the 2040s (2041-2050) and long-term, noted 2090s (2091-2099) under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) scenarios, SSP 3-7.0 and SSP 5-8.5. Statistical indices of both ANN and SWAT showed good performance (R-2 > 0.65) of the models. Our results revealed a rise in maximum temperature (4.26-4.69 degrees C) and minimum temperature (2.74-3.01 degrees C) in the 2040s and 2090s. Under SSP 3-7.0 and SSP 5-8.5, a decline in the annual precipitation is projected in the 2040s and increased the 2090s. This study found that future precipitation and temperature could significantly decrease annual runoff by 60.59% and 73.77% in the 2040s; and 25.18% and 23.45% in the 2090s under SSP 3-7.0 and SSP 5-8.5, respectively.

Engineering technologies can be implemented to avoid these emissions, and to recover the non-emitted CH4 for power generation. The immediate benefit of recovering non-emitted CH4 from large dams for renewable energy production is the mitigation of anthropogenic impacts like the construction of new large dams, the actual CH4 emissions from large dams, and the use of unsustainable fossil fuels and natural gas reserves. Under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol, such technologies can be recognized as promising alternatives for human adaptations to climate change concerning sustainable power generation, particularly in developing nations owning a considerable number of large dams. In view of novel technologies to extract CH4 from large dams, we estimate that roughly 23 +/- 2.6, 2.6 +/- 0.2 and 32 +/- 5.1 Tg CH4 could be used as an environmentally sound option for power generation in Brazil, China and India, respectively. For the whole world this number may increase to around 100 +/- 6.9 Tg CH4.","[Lima, Ivan B. T.; Ramos, Fernando M.; Bambace, Luis A.

Two related climate change scenarios were used: a coarse-scale scenario produced from results of a general circulation model (GCM) which also provided the boundary conditions to a regional climate model (RCM), from which a fine-scale scenario was constructed. Cotton model simulations were performed for three cases: climate change alone; climate change and elevated CO2; climate change, elevated CO2 and adaptations to climate change. In general, significant differences in state-average projected yield changes between the coarse and fine-scale scenarios are found for these three cases. In the first two cases, different directions of change are found in some sub-regions. With adaptation, yields substantially increase for both climate scenarios, but more so for the coarse-scale scenario (30% domain-average increase). Under irrigation, yield change differences between the two climate scenarios are small in all three cases, and yields are higher under irrigation (similar to35% domain-average increase with adaptation case) compared to dryland conditions. For the climate change alone case, differences in summer water-stress levels explain the contrasts in dryland yield patterns between the coarse and fine-scale climate scenarios.","Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Environm & Societal Impacts Grp, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; Mississippi State Univ, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Mississippi State University,"Doherty, RM (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Environm & Societal Impacts Grp, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",,"Whetton, Penny H/A-6885-2012; Reddy, K.

Most have used the concept of barriers to adaptation' in an attempt to describe why governance of adaptation is challenging. However, these studies have recently been critiqued for over simplifying complex governance processes by referring to the static concept of barriers, thereby ignoring dynamic complexity as a root explanatory cause. This paper builds the argument that how barriers are currently used in the literature is insufficient to explain why the governance of adaptation often proves difficult. We adopt a so-called mechanism-based approach to investigate how and why the governance of ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) reaches impasses in five cases in Thailand and the Netherlands. Our findings show six causal mechanisms that explain impasses in the five case studies: (1) frame polarisation, (2) timing synchronisation, (3) risk innovation, (4) rules of the game, (5) veto players and (6) lost in translation. Several of these causal mechanisms are recurring and emerge under specific contextual conditions or are activated by other mechanisms. Our findings provide valuable insights into the impasses in the governance of EbA and allow for critical reflections on the analytical value of the mechanism-based approach in explaining why the governance of adaptation proves difficult and how this can be overcome.","[Sieber, Ina Maren] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Phys Geog & Landschaftsokol, Schneiderberg 50, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Biesbroek, Robbert] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [de Block, Debora] Wageningen Univ & Res, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Leibniz University Hannover; Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Sieber, IM (corresponding author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Phys Geog & Landschaftsokol, Schneiderberg 50, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",sieber@phygeo.uni-hannover.de; Robbert.biesbroek@wur.nl; Debora.deblock@wur.nl,"Biesbroek, Robbert/ABE-3686-2021; Sieber, Ina Maren/AAC-9158-2022; Biesbroek, Robbert/GZZ-4476-2022","Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419; Sieber, Ina Maren/0000-0003-2134-0429; Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419",,,,,61,12,12,3,19,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Although climate warming is projected to continue into the future, studies examining long-term resilience of semiarid forests against climate change are limited. In this study, long-term forest resilience was defined as the capacity of forest recruitment to compensate for losses from mortality. We observed an obvious change in long-term forest resilience along a local aridity gradient by reconstructing tree growth trend and disturbance history and investigating postdisturbance regeneration in semiarid forests in southern Siberia. In our study, with increased severity of local aridity, forests became vulnerable to drought stress, and regeneration first accelerated and then ceased. Radial growth of trees during 1900-2012 was also relatively stable on the moderately arid site. Furthermore, we found that smaller forest patches always have relatively weaker resilience under the same climatic conditions. Our results imply a relatively higher resilience in arid timberline forest patches than in continuous forests; however, further climate warming and increased drought could possibly cause the disappearance of small forest patches around the arid tree line. This study sheds light on climate change adaptation and provides insight into managing vulnerable semiarid forests.","[Xu, Chongyang; Liu, Hongyan] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Xu, Chongyang; Liu, Hongyan] Peking Univ, MOE Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Anenkhonov, Oleg A.; Sandanov, Denis V.; Balsanova, Larisa D.; Naidanov, Bulat B.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Gen & Expt Biol, Siberian Branch, Ulan Ude 670047, Russia; [Korolyuk, Andrey Yu] Russian Acad Sci, Cent Siberian Bot Garden, Siberian Branch, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Wu, Xiuchen] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Resources Sci & Technol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Central Siberian Botanical Garden; Russian Academy of Sciences; Beijing Normal University,"Liu, HY (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Liu, HY (corresponding author), Peking Univ, MOE Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",lhy@urban.pku.edu.cn,"Найданов, Булат/AAU-7892-2021; Sandanov, Denis V/J-6472-2018; Balsanova, Larisa/AAO-5848-2021; Korolyuk, Andrey/I-7831-2018; Anenkhonov, Oleg/J-8690-2016","Sandanov, Denis V/0000-0002-8504-3485; Anenkhonov, Oleg/0000-0001-8633-7154; Andrey, Korolyuk/0000-0003-4646-4698; Naidanov, Bulat/0000-0002-4667-9915; Balsanova, Larisa/0000-0002-1805-2613","National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC 41325002, 41530747]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was granted by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC 41325002 and 41530747).,,56,50,62,15,126,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Scenario approaches are useful in adaptation planning by putting together projected climate change and socioeconomic trends with broader development needs when identifying associated priorities-and using them to develop appropriate strategies, plans and initiatives. To date, explorative scenario approaches have been largely adopted in adaptation planning. In this paper, we determine the benefits of using normative scenario approaches. They include a process known as backcasting, which is particularly useful for areas where adaptation planning and actions are strongly intertwined with development planning, and considerable efforts are needed to improve the well-being of the people living in those areas. We show the relevance of backcasting by presenting three case study applications in the following developing countries: Ghana, Honduras and Tajikistan. The results of these case studies indicate that backcasting has specific relevance for adaptation planning, including capacity building and awareness raising to contextualize information on climate impacts with stakeholders' development needs. Our results also indicate that the developed scenarios provided benefits in promoting horizontal and vertical integration, thus bringing together diverse sectorial and sub-national priorities-adaptation options can thereby be aligned with these needs. Finally, use of the scenarios advances countries' participation in national and multi-country adaptation projects by targeting actions that provide multiple benefits.","[Bizikova, Livia] IISD, Ottawa, ON K1P 5E7, Canada; [Pinter, Laszlo] Cent European Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Tubiello, Nicola] Food & Agr Org UN, Dept Nat Resources, Climate Energy & Tenure Div, I-00153 Rome, Italy",Central European University; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Bizikova, L (corresponding author), IISD, 75 Albert St,Suite 903, Ottawa, ON K1P 5E7, Canada.",lbizikova@iisd.ca; lpinter@iisd.ca; francesco.tubiello@fao.org,,,,,,,47,6,6,2,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Their understandings of time, and their practices that invoke time, form the complex and sometimes conflicting temporalities of adaptation to environmental change. They link the conditions of the past to those of the present and the future in a variety of ways, and their contemporary practices rest on such linking explicitly or implicitly. Yet the temporal connections between the present and distant future of places are undertheorized and poorly considered in the science and policy of adaptation to environmental change. In this article we address this theoretical and practical challenge by weaving together arguments from social and environmental geography with evidence from small coastal communities in southeastern Australia. We show that the past conditions residents' imagined futures and that these local, imagined futures are incongruent with scientific, popular, and policy accounts of the future. Thus we argue that the temporalities of adaptation include incommensurate and unacknowledged ways of knowing and that these affect adaptation practices. We propose that strategies devised by governments for adapting to environmental change need to make visible-and calibrate policies with-the diverse temporalities of adaptation. On this basis, the times between the present and the long-term future can be better navigated as a series of short and negotiated policy steps.","[Fincher, Ruth; Barnett, Jon; Graham, Sonia] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Fincher, R (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Resource Management & Geog, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",r.fincher@unimelb.edu.au; jbarn@unimelb.edu.au; sonia.graham@unimelb.edu.au,"Graham, Sonia/G-4399-2012; Barnett, Jon/E-2122-2013; Barnett, Jon/AAQ-9002-2021","Graham, Sonia/0000-0003-4195-4559; Barnett, Jon/0000-0002-0862-0808; Barnett, Jon/0000-0002-0862-0808",Australian Research Council [LP100100586]; East Gippsland Shire Council; Gippsland Coastal Board; Victorian Department of Planning and Community Development; Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment; Wellington Shire Council; Australian Research Council [LP100100586] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); East Gippsland Shire Council; Gippsland Coastal Board; Victorian Department of Planning and Community Development; Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment; Wellington Shire Council; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This research was funded through Australian Research Council Linkage Grant LP100100586, with support from the East Gippsland Shire Council, the Gippsland Coastal Board, the Victorian Department of Planning and Community Development, the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment, and Wellington Shire Council.",,49,25,25,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-5608,1467-8306,,ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR,Ann.

Current IPCC Guidelines for calculating nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from sewage management are both highly uncertain and incomplete; a major methodological gap relates to the calculation of indirect N2O emissions from sewage disposed to marine environments. Here we apply a novel approach to estimate past and future global sewage-nitrogen emissions to coastal oceans and the potential marine N2O emissions linked to this nitrogen source. Then, by estimating the future cost associated with this largely uncharacterized emission source, we demonstrate the industry significance of developing a methodology for estimating N2O emissions from marine receiving environments. The capacity to accurately estimate, monitor and report GHG emissions has important consequences for informing future policy decisions regarding both mitigation and adaptation. A robust N2O emissions estimation methodology for sewage-nitrogen disposed to coastal oceans will allow the international water sector to more accurately and comprehensively inventory its N2O emissions. This will in turn allow for proper accounting of related future emissions liabilities while also enabling the sector to capitalize on any future economic returns linked to this source-providing much-needed capital to support the sector's future infrastructure and climate change adaptation challenges.

These ecosystems are natural carbon sinks, relevant to mitigate global warming because they are able to sequester significant amounts of CO2 for biomass production, and to store organic matter in sediments for a very long time. We present the temporal evaluation of fluxes (g m(-2) year(-1)) and inventories (Mg ha(-1)) of organic carbon (C-org) from sediment cores collected in mangroves areas associated with the coastal lagoon Estero de Urias, in Mazatlan, Sinaloa. The work strategy included the geochemical characterization of sediments by elemental composition analysis through X-ray fluorescence spectrometry to evaluate changes in sediment origin (terrestrial or marine); the determination of the grain size distribution to evaluate changes in the hydrodynamics of the study sites; and the quantification of C-org concentrations with an elemental analyzer. Finally, we estimated the economic cost of the impacts of CO2 emissions caused by the oxidation of C-org due to potential perturbations of the study sites. This information is an additional component of the economic benefits of the preservation of mangrove ecosystems, relevant in coastal wetland management plans, since mangrove conservation contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and could be used as part of an ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change strategy in tropical and subtropical zones around the world.","[Aldana-Gutierrez, G.; Cuellar-Martinez, T.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Posgrad Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Ruiz-Fernandez, A.

This region, which is known for its monsoon climate (which involves a distinct temporal and spatial variation in rainfall), has experienced a decrease in annual rainfall over the last century. This study is aimed at investigating how smallholder farmers perceive climate change and at identifying the methods that these smallholders use to adapt to climate change. We use data collected from a survey of 215 households to compare the climate vulnerability of three watershed communities in Kerala. We find that the farmers perceive substantial increases in both temperature and the unpredictability of monsoons; this is in accordance with actual observed weather trends. The selection of effective adaptation strategies is one of the key challenges that smallholders face as they seek to reduce their vulnerability. The surveyed households simultaneously use various adaptation methods, including information and communication technology, crop and farm diversification, social networking through cooperatives, and soil and water conservation measures. The results of a binary regression model reveal that the household head's age, education and gender, as well as the farm's size and the household's size, assets, livestock ownership, poverty status and use of extension services, are all significantly correlated with the households' choices regarding adaptations to cope with climate change.","[Funk, Christoph; Winker, Peter] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Stat & Econometr, Licher Str 64, D-35394 Giessen, Germany; [Sathyan, Archana Raghavan; Breuer, Lutz] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Res Ctr Bio Syst Land Use & Nutr iFZ, Inst Landscape Ecol & Resources Management ILR, Heinrich Buff Ring 26-32, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Funk, Christoph] Macquarie Univ, Dept Actuarial Studies & Business Analyt, 4 Eastern Rd, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Winker, Peter; Breuer, Lutz] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Ctr Int Dev & Environm Res, Senckenbergstr 3, D-35390 Giessen, Germany; [Sathyan, Archana Raghavan] Kerala Agr Univ, Coll Agr, Dept Agr Extens, Thiruvananthapuram 695522, Kerala, India",Justus Liebig University Giessen; Justus Liebig University Giessen; Macquarie University; Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Funk, C (corresponding author), Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Stat & Econometr, Licher Str 64, D-35394 Giessen, Germany.",Christoph.Funk@wirtschaft.uni-giessen.de,"Winker, Peter/D-1389-2011; Raghavan Sathyan, Archana/AAY-1991-2021; Breuer, Lutz/C-6652-2013","Winker, Peter/0000-0003-3412-4207; Raghavan Sathyan, Archana/0000-0002-7526-4452; Breuer, Lutz/0000-0001-9720-1076; Funk, Christoph/0000-0001-7388-4415","Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, Bonn, Germany [PKZ: 91538032]; Macquarie University","Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, Bonn, Germany(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Macquarie University","We would like to gratefully acknowledge funding from Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, Bonn, Germany (ST42-for Development-Related Post Graduate Courses, 50,077,057 and PKZ: 91538032) for conducting the field study and research as well as Macquarie University for providing the International Macquarie University Research Scholarship (iMQRES) to Christoph Funk.

At the main study site, Gaff Point, aerial photographs revealed a shoreline retreat rate from 1976 to 2011 (ca. 0.3 m.y(-1)), with a threefold increase in the rate of heath area loss in the last 10 years relative to the previous 25 years (1976-2001). Empetrum nigrum produces a large crop of berries and sets up seedlings via three main dispersers (gulls, passerines, and mink) at the sea edge and woodland margin. Laboratory study demonstrated that seed germination was scant and slow in the season of berry production but that it was rapid and substantial (mean 33%-50% from berry or scat) for seeds that incubated overwinter in berry or in scat. The largest seed bank coincides with the site of greatest berry production in the heath, but seedlings were not observed in its mat. Most of the scat rain (77%) is deposited at the shore edge and seedlings here are lost to coastal erosion over-winter. Spruce tree understories are the only safe sites for seedling establishment, and if these juveniles become adults of heathland formed after the death of edge trees, the crowberry has an ontogenetic niche shift adapted to climate change.

Although future developments may be sited and designed to be more survivable and resistant to losses, an over-arching strategy is needed for those that are already at high risk. Traditionally, most plans for protecting WUI inhabitants focus on fuel reduction in strategic locations (e.g., defensible space around homes, fuel breaks around communities). While this approach can reduce fire hazard in specific locations and under certain weather conditions, there are a variety of vulnerabilities that are not directly addressed by fuel reduction. A more comprehensive approach is needed - one that facilitates climate change adaptation and future resilience - to mitigate multiple fire-related risks. A Regional Wildfire Mitigation Program (RWMP), expanding on traditional approaches to wildfire protection, is a key step in this direction. The goals of an RWMP include (1) retrofitting of the built environment (i.e., structural ignition vulnerabilities, water supply deficiencies, evacuation constraints); (2) buffering the landscape (i.e., a mosaic of less flammable land uses complementing traditional fuel breaks); and (3) training the community (i.e., education to become fire-adapted). We demonstrate here a consistent methodology for mapping hazards and vulnerabilities, assessing the risks of multiple negative impacts, prioritizing diverse mitigation activities, and implementing solutions that are effective and portable across many WUI environments.","[Moritz, Max A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [Moritz, Max A.] Univ Calif, Cooperat Extens, Oakland, CA USA; [Hazard, Rob] St Barbara Cty Fire, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [Johnston, Kelly; Mowery, Molly; Oran, Katie] Community Wildfire Planning Ctr, Boulder, CO USA; [Mayes, Marc; Wesolowski, Graham] Nat Assets Lab SIG NAL, Spatial Informat Grp, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [Mayes, Marc] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Earth Res Inst, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [Parkinson, Anne-Marie] St Barbara Cty Fire Safe Council, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [Schmidt, David A.] Spatial Informat Grp SIG, Pleasanton, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Moritz, MA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA USA.;Moritz, MA (corresponding author), Univ Calif, Cooperat Extens, Oakland, CA USA.",mmoritz@ucsb.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,,,,,44,0,0,9,11,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-893X,,FRONT FOR GLOB CHANG,Front.

Variable retention harvesting (VRH) has been suggested to be a potential method to increase forest biodiversity, growth, and carbon (C) sequestration. A field trial was established in an 88-year-old red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) plantation in southern Ontario, Canada, using a completely randomized design to examine the response of tree productivity and other forest values to five harvesting treatments: 33% aggregate retention (33A), 55% aggregate retention (55A), 33% dispersed retention (33D), and 55% dispersed retention (55D) in comparison to an unharvested control (CN). In this study, we explored the impacts of VRH on aboveground stem radial growth and annual C increment. Standard dendrochronological methods and allometric equations were used to quantify tree- and stand-level treatment effects during a five-year pre-harvest (2009-2013) and post-harvest (2014-2018) period. Tree-level growth and C increment were increased by the dispersed retention pattern regardless of retention level. At the stand level, the total C increment was highest at greater retention levels and did not vary with retention pattern. These results suggest that the choice of retention level and pattern can have a large influence on management objectives as they relate to timber production, climate change adaptation, and/or climate change mitigation.","[Zugic, Jessica I.; Pisaric, Michael F.

Fixed and random effects models of panel data are employed to control for the possible heterogeneity between countries. In addition, the study uses an instrumental variable estimation approach and a Canay(2011) panel quantile regression as a robustness check. The main results reveal that e-finance reduces CO2 emissions in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and leads to a lower pollution rate. The paper also finds that the EKC hypothesis holds. These findings have several important policy implications for OECD countries, and the model may be extended to investigate similar issues in developing economies.","[Elheddad, Mohamed] Sch Syst Univ Coll Ctr, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Elheddad, Mohamed] Misurata Univ, Fac Polit & Econ, Misrata, Libya; [Benjasak, Chonlakan] Walailak Univ, Sch Management, Thaiburi, Thailand; [Deljavan, Rana] Johnson Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Mainz, Germany; [Alharthi, Majed] King Abdulaziz Univ, Coll Business, Finance Dept, POB 344, Rabigh 21911, Saudi Arabia; [Almabrok, Jaballa M.] Omar Al Mukhtar Univ, Business Sch, Al Bayda, Libya",King Abdulaziz University; Omar Al Mukhtar University,"Elheddad, M (corresponding author), Sch Syst Univ Coll Ctr, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.;Elheddad, M (corresponding author), Misurata Univ, Fac Polit & Econ, Misrata, Libya.",bchonlak@mail.wu.ac.th; rdeljava@stdudents.uni-mainz.de; mdalharthi@kau.edu.sa; jaballa.mohammed@omu.edu.ly,"Elheddad, Mohamed/P-6154-2019","Elheddad, Mohamed/0000-0002-4175-4808",,,,,70,31,31,10,41,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0040-1625,1873-5509,,TECHNOL FORECAST SOC,Technol.

Residents' participation is the main driving force of GI implementation. Based on semi-structured interviews, GIS spatial analysis, and multiple regression, we investigated residents' willingness to participate in the implementation of GI in public and private space and identified the influence factors in Shanghai, China. The results show that, compared with private space, residents prefer to implement GI in public space, where they have different preferences of GI measures. On urban scale, residents' willingness to participate in the implementation of GI in private space is characterized as high in the inner city, low in the suburban areas, while the spatial difference is insignificant for public space. In addition, the factors affecting residents' willingness to participate in the implementation of GI are different in private and public space. The deterministic factors of GI participation are gender, education level, and floor for private space, while only include building age for public space, in addition to the common factors of free time, cognition of GI, perception of pluvial flood risk, supportive factors, and environment-improving factors that can influence both private and public space GI participation. Our analysis therefore provides valuable information for policymakers concerning nature-based solutions to climate change adaptation and urban sustainability.","[Yu, Yang; Xu, Hui; Wang, Xiaohan; Wen, Jiahong; Du, Shiqiang; Zhang, Min] Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Environm & Geog Sci, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China; [Du, Shiqiang] Shanghai Normal Univ, Inst Urban Studies, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Min] East China Normal Univ, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Ke, Qian] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Hydraul Engn, 1 Stevinweg, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands",Shanghai Normal University; Shanghai Normal University; East China Normal University; Delft University of Technology,"Xu, H (corresponding author), Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Environm & Geog Sci, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China.",yuyangace123@163.com; xuhui@shnu.edu.cn; 18101897362@163.com; jhwen@shnu.edu.cn; shiqiangdu@shnu.edu.cn; zhangmin@shnu.edu.cn; Q.ke@tudelft.nl,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Ke, Qian/0000-0002-3111-994X; Du, Shiqiang/0000-0002-9787-186X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71603168, 41701001, 41871200, 51708350]; National Key Research and Development Plan [YS2017YFC, 1503001]; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research NWO [ALWSD.2016.007]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Plan; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant numbers: 71603168, 41701001, 41871200 and 51708350), National Key Research and Development Plan (Grant numbers: YS2017YFC and 1503001), and The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research NWO (Grant number: ALWSD.2016.007).",,48,12,13,15,65,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT 1,2019,11,19,,,,,,,5396,10.3390/su11195396,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11195396,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JI5RS,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000493525500255,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, the Tianchi Lake, a typical cold-water lake and a UNESCO/MAB (Man and Biosphere) nature reserve located in high latitude and elevation with the relatively low intensity of human activity was chosen as a system to examine the linkages between climate change and eutrophication. As a part of the UNESCO Bogda Man and Biosphere Reserve, Tianchi Lake has been well preserved for prevention from human intervention, but why has it been infected with eutrophication recent years? Our results show that climate change played a significant role in the eutrophication in the Tianchi Lake. Increased temperature, changed precipitation pattern and wind-induced hydrodynamic fluctuations in the summer season were suggested to make a major contribution to the accelerated eutrophication. The results also showed that the local temperature and precipitation changes were closely linked to the large-scale atmospheric circulation, which opens the door for the method to be applied in other regions without local climatic information. This study suggests that there is an urgent need to take into consideration of climate change adaptation into the conservation and management of cold-water lakes globally.

This article describes a methodology to develop future peak design discharges throughout the United States that can be used as a guidance to map future floodplains. In order to develop a lower and upper limit for anticipated peak flow discharges, two future growth scenarios - Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)-RCP 2.6 and 8.5 were identified as the weak and strong climate scenario respectively based on the output from the global climate models. The Generalized Least Square technique in United States Geological Survey's Weighted Multiple Regression (WREG) program was used to develop regression equations that relate peak discharges to basin and climate parameters of the contributing watershed. The design discharges reflect the most recent climate model results. Number of frost days, heavy rainfall days, high temperature days, and snow depth were found to be the common extreme climate parameters influencing the regression equations. This methodology can be extended to other flood frequency events if rainfall data is available. The future discharges can be utilized in hydraulics models to estimate floodplains that can assist in resilient infrastructure planning and outline climate change adaptation strategies.","[Selvanathan, Sivasankkar; Sreetharan, Mathini; Rand, Krista; Choi, Janghwoan; Mampara, Mathew] Dewberry, Dept Water Resources, Fairfax, VA 22031 USA; [Smirnov, Dmitry] Dewberry, Dept Water Resources, Denver, CO 80209 USA",,"Selvanathan, S (corresponding author), 3969 Acorn Ridge Ct, Fairfax, VA 22033 USA.",sivasankkar@gmail.com,,,,,,,37,5,5,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1093-474X,1752-1688,,J AM WATER RESOUR AS,J.

Positive associations have been noted between temperature and diarrhea incidence, but considerable uncertainty surrounds quantitative estimates of this relationship because of pathogen-specific factors and a scarcity of data on the influence of meteorological factors on the risk of disease. Quantifying these relationships is important for disease prevention and climate change adaptation. Methods. To address these issues, we performed a systematic literature review of studies in which at least 1 full year of data on the monthly incidence of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli were reported. We characterized seasonal patterns of disease incidence from 28 studies. In addition, using monthly time-and location-specific weather data for 18 studies, we performed univariate Poisson models on individual studies and a meta-analysis, using a generalized estimating equation, on the entire data set. Results. We found an 8% increase in the incidence of diarrheagenic E. coli (95% confidence interval, 5%-11%; P<.0001) for each 1 degrees C increase in mean monthly temperature. We found a modest positive association between 1-month-lagged mean rainfall and incidence of diarrheagenic E. coli, which was not statistically significant when we controlled for temperature. Conclusions. These results suggest that increases in ambient temperature correspond to an elevated incidence of diarrheagenic E. coli and underscore the need to redouble efforts to prevent the transmission of these pathogens in the face of increasing global temperatures.","[Philipsborn, Rebecca] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA USA; [Ahmed, Sharia M.; Levy, Karen] Emory Univ, Dept Environm Hlth, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, 1518 Clifton Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Brosi, Berry J.] Emory Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Emory University; Emory University; Rollins School Public Health; Emory University,"Levy, K (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Dept Environm Hlth, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, 1518 Clifton Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",karen.levy@emory.edu,,"Brosi, Berry/0000-0002-9233-1151","Fogarty International Center [R21TW009032]; National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH [K01AI103544]; Emory School of Medicine Discovery Program","Fogarty International Center(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC)); National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)); Emory School of Medicine Discovery Program","This work was supported by the Fogarty International Center (grant R21TW009032) and the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (grant K01AI103544 to K.

This will likely result in significant alterations to coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, increase coastal hazards and affect lifestyles of coastal communities. There is increasing speculation that mangrove, a socio-economically important ecosystem, will become more fragile and sensitive to uncertain climate variability such as sea level rise. As a result, mangrove-dependent societies may find themselves trapped in a downward spiral of ecological degradation in terms of their livelihoods and life security. Strengthening the resilience capacity of coastal communities to help them cope with this additional threat from climate change and to ensure sustainability calls for immediate action. In this context, this paper critically examines the regional implications of expected sea level rise and threats to mangrove-dependent communities through a case study approach. The main objective is to highlight the requirement for climate change communication and education to impart information that will fulfil three expectations: (1) confer understanding; (2) assess local inference on climate change through a participatory approach; and (3) construct a framework for climate change awareness among mangrove-dependent communities through community-based non-formal climate change education. This scale of approach is attracting increasing attention from policymakers to achieve climate change adaptation and derive policies from a social perspective.","[Khan, A.

This research indicates that designers of adaptation programs seek to develop and implement CAPs based on international viewpoint and their obligations, but not community requirements. Such CAPs create uneven access to information resources for communities and do not implicitly reduce community vulnerability. In response, the research proposes the establishment of an Information System (IS) to support delivery of reliable climate adaptation services to mountain communities. This research uses Nepal as a case study that experiences a lack of effective adaptation programs due to its varied topography, prevalent climate-related disasters, and barriers in capacity building and institutional development. The results of the analyses indicate that the national level focuses on preparing adaptation action plans, whilst district levels and Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) focus on facilitating adaptation implementation for community and individuals. Additionally, the results reveal that an IS can enhance the design and implementation of CAP. Finally, the results are used to articulate prioritized services for an IS to assist communities who are in the greatest need of climate service delivery.","[Khezri, Adish; Zevenbergen, Jaap] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Bennett, Rohan] Swinburne Business Sch, POB 218, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia",University of Twente,"Khezri, A (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",a.khezri@utwente.nl; rohanbennett@swin.edu.au; j.a.zevenbergen@utwente.nl,"Bennett, Rohan/P-7289-2019; Bennett, Rohan/K-5086-2013","Bennett, Rohan/0000-0002-1200-2068; Khezri, Adish/0000-0003-1229-9356","Erasmus Mundus Action 2 Project SALAM, International Scholarship of the European Commission","Erasmus Mundus Action 2 Project SALAM, International Scholarship of the European Commission","This research was funded by Erasmus Mundus Action 2 Project SALAM, International Scholarship of the European Commission.",,72,1,1,0,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2225-1154,,,CLIMATE,Climate,JUN,2018,6,2,,,,,,,47,10.3390/cli6020047,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli6020047,,,16,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,GK8QJ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000436491700029,View Full Record in Web of Science

Local governments are positioned to protect populations from climate health risks, but it is unclear whether municipalities are producing climate-adaptive policies. In this article, we develop and apply systematic methods to assess the state of public health adaptation in 401 urban areas globally with more than 1 million people, creating the first global baseline for urban public health adaptation. We find that only 10% of the sampled urban areas report any public health adaptation initiatives. The initiatives identified most frequently address risks posed by extreme weather events and involve direct changes in management or behavior rather than capacity building, research, or long-term investments in infrastructure. Based on our characterization of the current urban health adaptation landscape, we identify several gaps: limited evidence of reporting of institutional adaptation at the municipal level in urban areas in the Global South; lack of information-based adaptation initiatives; limited focus on initiatives addressing infectious disease risks; and absence of monitoring, reporting, and evaluation.","[Araos, Malcolm; Austin, Stephanie E.; Berrang-Ford, Lea; Ford, James D.] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Burnside Hall Room 705,805 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada",McGill University,"Araos, M (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Burnside Hall Room 705,805 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada.",malcolm.araosegan@mail.mcgill.ca,"Ford, James/A-4284-2013","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456","CIHR Applied Public Health Chairs Program; SSHRC Insight Grant; Trottier Public Science Policy Fellowship (Faculty of Science, McGill University); Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec (FRSQ) Bourse de Carrier","CIHR Applied Public Health Chairs Program(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); SSHRC Insight Grant; Trottier Public Science Policy Fellowship (Faculty of Science, McGill University); Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec (FRSQ) Bourse de Carrier","The authors would like to acknowledge funding provided by the CIHR Applied Public Health Chairs Program, a SSHRC Insight Grant, the Trottier Public Science Policy Fellowship (Faculty of Science, McGill University), and the Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec (FRSQ) Bourse de Carrier.

In this study, we analyzed the decadal progress of eolian erosion in the southern Gobi Desert and traced key factors controlling intensified land degradation (LD) and sand and dust (SD) generation employing satellite data and climatic variables. Columnar dust mass density from climatic data re-analyses as a major SD tracer was combined with the Mann-Kendall (MK) method and the empirical orthogonal function processor. Validation was performed by using ground data sets and field evidence from reference locations. The results revealed that (1) LD/SD patterns and hotspots in the Gobi Desert are significantly controlled by the distribution and trend of precipitation; (2) climatic conditions in the Mongolian Gobi Desert have shifted towards an unfavourable direction with respect to the LD/SD occurrence; (3) surface conditions in southeastern Mongolia have somehow decoupled from the weather factors and the transition zone between the desert and the vegetated terrain has gradually expanded probably due to anthropogenic activities. The correlation analyses between all candidate driving factors of LD/SD indicated that a major control mechanism of spatiotemporal migration of LD/SD in the southern Gobi Desert is the change in precipitation, whereas anthropogenic activity holds a secondary control. The results obtained can be used to prioritize intervention zones in the frame of land use planning processes aimed at adapting to climate change and mitigating LD and SD generation in source areas.","[Kim, Jungrack] Univ Seoul, Dept Geoinformat, Seoul, South Korea; [Dorjsuren, Munkhzul; Purevjav, Gomboluudev] Informat & Res Inst Meteorol Hydrol & Environm, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; [Zucca, Claudio] Univ Sassari, Ctr Sustainable Management Soil & Landscape, Sassari, Italy; [Zucca, Claudio] Univ Sassari, Desertificat Res Ctr NRD, Sassari, Italy",University of Seoul; Ministry of Nature Environment &Tourism Mongolia; University of Sassari; University of Sassari,"Kim, J (corresponding author), Univ Seoul, Dept Geoinformat, Seoul, South Korea.",kjrr001@gmail.com,"Zucca, Claudio/K-9167-2013","Zucca, Claudio/0000-0002-8636-0511; Dorjsuren, Munkhzul/0000-0001-5356-9995",,,,,101,0,0,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1085-3278,1099-145X,,LAND DEGRAD DEV,Land Degrad.

We compared health, microhabitats, and bat activities between native (Quercus roburL.) and non-native (Quercus rubraL.) oaks growing in different urban habitats (street vs. park) in Karlsruhe, southwestern Germany. We randomly selected 167 oak trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH)>20 cm across the city from Urban Tree Registrar. We performed tree health assessment, dendrometric, and microhabitatinventory. We recorded the four-day bat activities on 45 native and non-native oaks with acoustic loggers installed on thetrees. We found that non-native oaks were healthier than native oaks but provided less abundance and richness of micro-habitats. Tree size (positive effect) and pruning (negative effect) strongly influence microhabitat richness and abundance.In addition, park trees hosted significantly more microhabitats than street trees.

Sustainable intensification in the form of improved agricultural management practices and new technologies may help farmers cope with stress and adapt to changing conditions. In this study, we explore how climate change perceptions of agricultural risk affect adaptation to climate change through technology adoption in a unique landscape: the polders of Bangladesh. In 2016, a survey was conducted in 1003 households living on these artificial, leveed islands facing the Bay of Bengal. We analyzed the responses from polder residents to construct a climate risk index which quantifies climate risk perception in this highly vulnerable agrarian landscape. We analyzed how polder demographics influence their perceptions about climatic change using seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). Further, by using three bivariate probit regression models, we estimated how the perception of climate risk drives the differential adoption of new agricultural technologies. Our findings show that farmers perceive polder agriculture as highly vulnerable to four environmental change factors: flooding, drought, salinity, and pest infestation. The SUR model suggests that farmer demographics, community group memberships, and access to different inputs and services strongly influence climatic risk perceptions. Findings also suggest that polder farmers with higher risk perceptions have a higher propensity to adopt both chemical and mechanical adaptation strategies. Cost, however, limits the ability of farmers to adopt improved technologies, suggesting an opportunity for institution-led approaches.","[Ahmed, Zobaer; Shew, Aaron M.] Univ Arkansas, Ctr Adv Spatial Technol, 227 N Harmon Ave,JBHT 304, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Ahmed, Zobaer] Univ Arkansas, Environm Dynam Program, 340 N Campus Dr,Gearhart Hall 213, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Shew, Aaron M.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, 217 Agr Bldg, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Mondal, Manoranjan K.] Int Rice Res Inst, Bangladesh Off, House 103,Rd 1,Block F, Dhaka 1213, Bangladesh; [Yadav, Sudhir] Int Rice Res Inst, Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines; [Jagadish, S.

In this study, we utilize the Budyko equation and dual-source evapotranspiration models to assess the impacts of vegetation change and climate change on the runoff in China's Yellow River Basin (YRB). The aims of the study are as follows: (1) Apply a well-formulated Budyko framework-dual-source evapotranspiration model to explore the eco-hydrological controls of the regional water balance. (2) Precisely assess the contribution of vegetation change, precipitation change, temperature change, wind speed change, the relative humidity change, and radiation change to the decreased runoff. The results indicated that vegetation change was the dominant factor affecting the reduction of runoff in the upper reaches above Lanzhou, Toudaoguai, Longmen, Sanmenxia, and Huayuankou, and the contributions were -80.4%, -58.4%, -52.5%, -46.9%, -39.7%, and -41.6% respectively. In Lanzhou, Taodaoguai, Longmen, and Sanmenxia, the precipitation change was the second affecting factor, and the contributions were -20.8%, -31.6%, -30.0%, and -35.2%, respectively. In Huayuankou and Lijin, the relative humidity change was the second affecting factor, and the contributions were -26.8% and -35.0%, respectively.

This paper assesses the effectiveness of the Multi-disciplinary Working Group (MWG) - a WCIS co-production initiative in Senegal in influencing farmers uptake of weather and climate information (WCI). WCIS are increasingly gaining importance and widely touted as critical in helping farmers adapt to climate variability. While there have been various WCIS initiatives producing and translating climate data into tailored information and knowledge in different parts of the world, there is hardly any rigorous evidence assessing their effectiveness in improving uptake. In this assessment, we use innovative survey methods and apply rigorous analytical approaches that control for self-selection bias to establish causal linkages between the MWG and use of WCIS. Our findings indicate that MWGs are positively associated with farmers' awareness, access and uptake of WCI resulting in farm management responses depending on the type of information used. The presence of MWGs generally increases farmer's awareness of WCI by 18%, access by 12% and uptake by 10%. Furthermore, use of seasonal forecasts is generally associated with a higher proportion of farmers using improved seed, fertilizers and manure, but negatively with crop diversification within MWG locations. This suggests that participatory approaches in the provision of tailored climate information and advisory services can lead to higher uptake and use among farmers in informing farm management responses for better adaptation to climate change. We highlight lessons for improved evaluations of WCIS in future.","[Chiputwa, Brian; Wainaina, Priscilla; Makui, Parmutia; Minang, Peter A.] World Agroforestry ICRAF, United Nations Ave,POB 30677, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Nakelse, Tebila] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Agr Dev Econ Div ESA, Rome, Italy; [Zougmore, Robert B.] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Bamako, Mali; [Ndiaye, Ousmane] Aeroport Leopold Sedar Senghor, Natl Civil Aviat & Meteorol Serv Senegal ANACIM, Dakar, Senegal",CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF); Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT),"Chiputwa, B (corresponding author), World Agroforestry ICRAF, United Nations Ave,POB 30677, Nairobi 00100, Kenya.",B.Chiputwa@cgiar.org,,"Wainaina, Priscilla/0000-0002-8216-1611; Zougmore, Robert/0000-0002-6215-4852","USAID under the Climate Information Services Research Initiative (CISRI), A Learning Agenda for Climate Information Services in sub-Saharan Africa [AID-OAA-A-16-00072]; CGIAR Fund Donors","USAID under the Climate Information Services Research Initiative (CISRI), A Learning Agenda for Climate Information Services in sub-Saharan Africa; CGIAR Fund Donors(CGIAR)","This work was supported by the USAID through grant number USAID Contract No: AID-OAA-A-16-00072 under the Climate Information Services Research Initiative (CISRI), A Learning Agenda for Climate Information Services in sub-Saharan Africa.

Developing countries are the most vulnerable to climate change, yet planning rarely considers how broader community development interventions can enhance resilience and support development. One solution is resilience assessment. However, few assessment frameworks exist that are sufficiently simple to empower communities to build resilience and take ownership of adaptation efforts. This article provides an example of a 27-question framework applied with two Cambodian communes (communities) to assess and understand trends in resilience over time. It is structured around community development outcomes of economic development, environmental quality, infrastructure that matches demands, community self-reliance and capacity to adapt to climate change; it also assesses how inputs and planning contribute to these outcomes. Longitudinal analyses reveal improvements over time driven primarily by commodity values. However, the sustainability of some of these improvements is questionable given volatile commodity markets and land degradation. Oversensitivity in the assessment is acknowledged as awareness increases over time, which can be conflated with poor performance. Maladaptive pathways may be unavoidable without building resilience by attending to broader community development issues, e.g. psychological wellbeing and education on alternative livelihoods. This article makes a significant contribution to community resilience by providing a simple resilience assessment framework that has demonstrably empowered communes to adapt to change. It is novel in the use of assessment design and process principles that build reflection on the drivers of resilience and development. Critical issues remain in the power dynamics of aid dependence, weakening of family bonds and patron-client relationships that affect resilience building in Cambodia.","[Jacobson, C.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Sippy Downs Rd, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia",University of the Sunshine Coast,"Jacobson, C (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Sippy Downs Rd, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia.",cjacobso@usc.edu.au,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research [CAF2015-RR18NSY-Jacobson]; University of the Sunshine Coast Australia; Australian Government's New Colombo Plan [A181144],Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research; University of the Sunshine Coast Australia; Australian Government's New Colombo Plan(Australian Government),"This research was supported by funding from the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (CAF2015-RR18NSY-Jacobson), the University of the Sunshine Coast Australia, and the Australian Government's New Colombo Plan.

To address those issues, managers need observations based on regularly monitored environmental indicators. However, environmental monitoring of the African Great Lakes is often lacking or not based on harmonised methods. The present manuscript is a case study based on Lake Tanganyika, impacted by climate change and anthropogenic pressure affecting water quality, fisheries and biodiversity changes. The implementation of environmental monitoring has often not been continuous or standardised among bordering countries. This prevents managers from taking data-based decisions and opens a risky field where speculation may overcome a rational approach. Long-term monitoring observations are essential to guide management measures to adapt to climate changes and decrease, whenever possible, unfavourable human impact on the Great Lake environment. A regionally standardised long-term monitoring programme is proposed. The sustainability of such monitoring requires that it remains inexpensive and focuses on a few essential parameters. Its strength would be its uninterrupted implementation. Setting up a long-term integrated monitoring programme is also a goal of the Lake Tanganyika Authorities (LTA) with mandated national authorities and stakeholders. A Lake Tanganyika Regional Integrated Monitoring Programme (LTRIEMP) needs to be widely encouraged and supported to ensure its sustainability. General principles from the Lake Tanganyika case study could be useful to develop a wider harmonised sustainable long-term regional monitoring network of the African Great Lakes in a multi-lakes collaborative approach.

Since little is known on the downstream effects of local water storage, this study employs a water balance model to perform a catchment scale assessment of upscaling local scale water storage in sand dams. The impacts of increasing water storage is evaluated under current climate conditions and future climate change scenarios. Survey information is used to estimate current and future water demand and assess the benefits derived from current sand dams in the Ethiopian study area. Using an indicator of the environmental flow concept, downstream hydrological impacts are simulated for different scenarios. Storage by 613 dams, supplying water to 555,000 people, has no impact on environmental flow downstream of the sand dams. Storage by 2190 dams leads to a modest increase in the number of months with low flow (4 to 9 %). Projected climate change leads to a larger increase in the number of low flow months of 0 to 29 %. Joint climate change and maximum storage scenarios cause an increase in low flow months from 4 to 50 %. Under the most extreme climate change projection 4.5 % of the wet season discharge is stored in sand dams. Because of the local benefits of improved water supply and the acceptable range of downstream impacts, sand dams appear to be a viable way for supplying drinking water in this catchment as well as in other semi-arid regions with similar conditions.","[Lasage, Ralph; Aerts, Jeroen C.

The changing climate will, among other kinds of social and economic effects, damage public infrastructure throughout Alaska, adding to maintenance costs and shortening the lifespan of everything from schools to sanitation systems. The question of how much cost impact this change will have and when the costs are expected to occur is the question of significant concern and debate. One approach to answering this question is addressed in this paper. Based on a probabilistic model, the results in this paper estimate how much climate change will add to future costs of public infrastructure in Alaska. Based on a database of public infrastructure throughout Alaska and the estimated replacement costs and lifespans for the various types of infrastructure statewide, the model provides a first analysis of climate impact on infrastructure costs. As an additional refinement of the model, the paper presents two potential adaptation approaches to reduce the impacts of climate change on the adaptation process. Code adaptation and event adaptation are introduced as two potential processes, based on existing responses to natural disasters, that may be employed to adapt to climate change. These adaptation approaches have the potential to reduce climate change costs by 10-45%. This is significant when the total potential cost impact to infrastructure from climate change is projected to add 10-20% to infrastructure costs by 2030 and 10-12% by 2080 under different climate projections and taking design adaptations into account.","[Chinowsky, Paul S.; Strzepek, Kenneth; Opdahl, Arie] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Larsen, Peter] Nature Conservancy, Anchorage, AK USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Chinowsky, PS (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",paul.chinowsky@colorado.edu; strzepek@colorado.edu; plarsen@tnc.org; arie.opdahl@colorado.edu,"Larsen, Peter H./AAD-2874-2019",,,,,,25,7,7,0,18,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1076-0342,,,J INFRASTRUCT SYST,J.

Where there is a gap between the distribution, use, management, regulation, and future concerns/interests of corals, the value of coral communities may not be properly received, and the resource may be degraded under future environmental change. We organized records of coral occurrence in each prefecture in Japan. We assessed coral use and management status based on administrative documents. Moreover, we compiled information on how laws regulate coral harvesting. Concerns for future changes were extracted from climate change adaptation plans. Text analysis of several administrative documents showed that the frequency of occurrence of coral-related keywords varied greatly among prefectures and documents. Comparing the information on coral distribution areas and the status of use, management, and regulation organized in this study for each prefecture revealed significant gaps in some prefectures, suggesting that management and regulation should be reviewed following the distribution status. With the projected increase in the magnitude of bleaching and expansion of coral distribution areas as water temperatures rise due to global warming, one of the strengths of this study is the identification of the current status and issues of the gap between distribution and use, management, and regulation. In areas where the spatial gradient of the environment/ecosystem is considerable or where significant changes in the environment/ecosystem are expected in the future, it is essential to establish a utilization and management system that reflects the characteristics of these areas.","[Abe, Hiroya; Kitano, Yuko F.; Yamano, Hiroya] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Biodivers Div, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Abe, Hiroya; Fujita, Tomohiro; Yamano, Hiroya] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan,"Abe, H (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.",abe.hiroya@nies.go.jp,,"Abe, Hiroya/0000-0003-2777-5570","Climate Change Adaptation Research Program of National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan","Climate Change Adaptation Research Program of National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan","This study was supported by the Climate Change Adaptation Research Program of National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan.",,55,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

Therefore, this study was carried out with the aim of exploring the impact of financial inclusion on environmental degradation in the ASEAN region using balanced panel data for the period 2000-2019. First, panel unit root tests were employed to examine each data series for stationarity. Findings of the panel unit root tests depicted that all data series are stationary at the first difference. Second, Westerlund and Edgerton's error correction panel cointegration test was employed to handle heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence. Third, the PMG-ARDL approach was used to explore the long- and short-term effects of financial inclusion on environmental degradation. Findings of the PMG-ARDL found that financial inclusion, energy use, economic growth and urbanization are causing environmental degradation in the ASEAN region. Furthermore, the financial inclusion coefficient is 0.15, which is statistically significant at 5%. In the short run, a 1% increase in financial inclusion results in a 0.15% increase in environmental degradation, ceteris paribus. In the long run, financial inclusion and CO2 have a positive association that is statistically significant at 5% and has a coefficient value of 0.42. This implies that a 1% increase in financial inclusion results in a 0.42% increase in environmental degradation in the long run. Finally, this study recommends that financial inclusion must be incorporated into climate change adaptation efforts at the local, national and regional levels to address the side effects of increased CO2 emissions.","[Ahmad, Seemab; Khan, Dilawar] Kohat Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Kohat 26000, Pakistan; [Magda, Robert] Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Inst Agr & Food Econ, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary; [Magda, Robert] Northwest Univ, Vanderbijlpark Campus, ZA-1900 Vanderbijlpark, South Africa",Kohat University of Science & Technology; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; North West University - South Africa,"Khan, D (corresponding author), Kohat Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Kohat 26000, Pakistan.",seemiguli98@gmail.com; dilawar@kust.edu.pk; magda.robert@uni-mate.hu,"Khan, Dilawar/K-3683-2019; Magda, Robert/HCH-0867-2022","Magda, Robert/0000-0001-9350-6673; Khan, Dilawar/0000-0001-5872-267X",,,,,90,1,1,3,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2022,14,12,,,,,,,7058,10.3390/su14127058,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14127058,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,2L1PZ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000816795400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

There are several justifications for re-thinking for the sustainable use of crop biodiversity in our breeding programs. Thirty-one durum wheat farmers' varieties (FVs), together with five improved check varieties, were characterized in Tigray during 2014 and 2015 main cropping seasons. The genotype effect explained most of the variations in measured traits, which enabled us to identify superior and stable genotypes for wider adaptation as well varieties with more local adaptation. The genotypes and test locations imposed a highly significant (P < 0.001) effect on both phenological and quantitative traits. A yield advantage of 14.3% was obtained from top performer FV over top performer improved variety, Asassa. Of the tested FVs, 27.8% were superior for grain yield (GY) than improved varieties and 19.4% of these superior FVs were more stable and adaptable than the improved varieties. Besides giving higher GY with spatial stability, they qualify for industrial requirements with high-grain protein (>13%) and gluten (>33%) contents. FVs such as G10, G16, G21, G22 and G30 have wider adaptability and are suitable for production in all tested areas. As outcome of this study, two superior FVs, G10 (208304) and G30 (8208), were nationally released for commercial production for their productivity, stability and grain quality. Utilizing the diverse durum wheat FVs can effectively improve productivity and adaptability. Wheat breeders need to revisit these resources to improve adaptation of wheat production to the changing climatic conditions.","[Mengistu, Dejene K.; Kiros, Afewerki Y.; Mohammed, Jemal N.; Tsehaye, Yemane] Mekelle Univ, Dept Dryland Crop & Hort Sci, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Mengistu, Dejene K.; Fadda, Carlo] ILRI Campus, Biovers Int, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Mekelle University; Alliance; Bioversity International; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Mengistu, DK (corresponding author), Mekelle Univ, Dept Dryland Crop & Hort Sci, Mekelle, Ethiopia.;Mengistu, DK (corresponding author), ILRI Campus, Biovers Int, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",d.mengistu@cgiar.org,,"Fadda, Carlo/0000-0003-3075-6207",Bioversity International,Bioversity International,The authors acknowledge the financial support from Bioversity International.

The evaluation was carried out in eight pilot communes representative of salmon production (marine grow-out). Exposure was estimated with a semi-quantitative risk assessment tool based on oceanographic, meteorological and hydrological information, mortality-by-cause databases, and through extended consultation with experts and relevant stakeholders. Threats included relevant changes in water temperature and salinity, declines in dissolved oxygen, occurrence of HABs, and diseases that could be associated with climate change. Based on our analysis of the data, we divided the farming regions into four sub-regions with distinctive oceanographic properties and superimposed the sea surface warming trend and a spatial pattern of mortality by respective cause. Reduction of precipitation and the increase of air and sea surface temperature are the most relevant foreseen climate change drivers, especially for regions X and XI. The resulting vulnerability matrix indicated that communes with higher production concentrations were more exposed, which in some cases coincided with higher sensitivity and lower adaptation capacity. Our models of four management scenarios allowed us to explore the changes in vulnerability associated with a southward movement of salmon production towards the Magallanes region. By identifying new protocols to increase adaptation and reduce vulnerability in a spatially explicit fashion, we provide policy recommendations aimed at increasing climate change adaptation and the long-term sustainability of the sector.","[Soto, Doris; Leon-Munoz, Jorge; Dresdner, Jorge; Tapia, Fabian J.] Interdisciplinary Ctr Aquaculture Res INCAR, Concepcion, Chile; [Leon-Munoz, Jorge] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Fac Ciencias, Dept Quim Ambiental, Concepcion, Chile; [Dresdner, Jorge; Luengo, Carol] Univ Concepcion, Dept Econ, Concepcion, Chile; [Tapia, Fabian J.] Univ Concepcion, Ctr COPAS Austral, Concepcion, Chile; [Garreaud, Rene] Univ Chile, Dept Geofis, Santiago 8370449, Region Metropol, Chile; [Garreaud, Rene] Univ Chile, Ctr Climate & Resilience Res, CR2, Santiago 8370449, Region Metropol, Chile",Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de Chile; Universidad de Chile,"Soto, D (corresponding author), Interdisciplinary Ctr Aquaculture Res INCAR, Concepcion, Chile.",dorsoto@udec.cl,"Garreaud, Rene/I-6298-2016","Garreaud, Rene/0000-0002-7875-2443; Tapia, Fabian/0000-0001-9661-6069",Interdisciplinary Center for Aquaculture Research [FONDAP INCAR 15110027]; CORFO mesoregional programme for sustainable salmon (PMS salmon sustentable); CONICYT - FONDECYT [11170768]; COPAS Sur-Austral [CONICYT PIA PFB31],Interdisciplinary Center for Aquaculture Research; CORFO mesoregional programme for sustainable salmon (PMS salmon sustentable); CONICYT - FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); COPAS Sur-Austral(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT PIA/BASAL),"This work was supported by the Interdisciplinary Center for Aquaculture Research (FONDAP INCAR 15110027, CONICYT) and by a small grant from the CORFO mesoregional programme for sustainable salmon (PMS salmon sustentable).

This study develops an event-based probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) model for livestock snow disasters in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) region and derives risk assessment results based on historical climate conditions (1980-2015) and present-day prevention capacity. In the model, a hazard module was developed to identify and simulate individual snow disaster events based on boosted regression trees. By combining a fitted quantitative vulnerability function and exposure derived from vegetation type and grassland carrying capacity, we estimated risk metrics based on livestock mortality and mortality rate. In our results, high-risk regions include the Nyainqentanglha Range, Tanggula Range, Bayankhar Mountains and the region between the Kailas Range and the neighbouring Himalayas. In these regions, annual livestock mortality rates were estimated as > 2% and mortality was estimated as > 2 sheep unit km(-1) at a return period of 20 years. Prefectures identified with extremely high risk include Guoluo in Qinghai Province and Naqu, and Shigatse in the Tibet Autonomous Region. In these prefectures, a snow disaster event with a return period of 20 years or higher can easily claim total losses of more than 500 000 sheep units. Our event-based PRA results provide a quantitative reference for preparedness and insurance solutions in reducing mortality risk. The methodology developed here can be further adapted to future climate change risk analyses and provide important information for planning climate change adaption in the QTP region.","[Ye, Tao; Liu, Weihang; Wu, Jidong; Li, Yijia; Shi, Peijun; Zhang, Qiang] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Key Lab Environm Change & Nat Disaster, Minist Educ,Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Ye, Tao; Wu, Jidong; Li, Yijia; Shi, Peijun; Zhang, Qiang] Acad Disaster Reduct & Emergency Management, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Ye, Tao] Boston Univ, Frederick S Pardee Ctr Study Longer Range Future, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Liu, Weihang] East China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Boston University; East China Normal University,"Li, YJ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Key Lab Environm Change & Nat Disaster, Minist Educ,Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Li, YJ (corresponding author), Acad Disaster Reduct & Emergency Management, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",liyijia@mail.bnu.edu.cn,"Wu, Jidong/AAC-2778-2020; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Wu, Jidong/0000-0001-8208-8373; Liu, Weihang/0000-0002-0732-4898; Shi, Peijun/0000-0002-2968-7331; Ye, Tao/0000-0002-5037-8410",National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFA0602404]; Fund for Creative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41621061]; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology,National Key R&D Program of China; Fund for Creative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology,"This study was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (grant number 2016YFA0602404), Fund for Creative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 41621061), and State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology.

Short-duration intense rainfall is responsible for flash flooding, and several studies have suggested an amplified response to warming for rainfall extremes on hourly and subhourly time scales. However, there are very few studies examining the detection of changes in subdaily rainfall. This is due to the high cost of very high-resolution (kilometer scale) climate models needed to capture hourly rainfall extremes and to a lack of sufficiently long, high-quality, subdaily observational records. Results using output from a 1.5-km climate model over the southern United Kingdom indicate that changes in 10-min and hourly precipitation emerge before changes in daily precipitation. In particular, model results suggest detection times for short-duration rainfall intensity in the 2040s in winter and the 2080s in summer, which are, respectively, 5-10 years and decades earlier than for daily extremes. Results from a new quality-controlled observational dataset of hourly rainfall over the United Kingdom do not show a similar difference between daily and hourly trends. Natural variability appears to dominate current observed trends (including an increase in the intensity of heavy summer rainfall over the last 30 years), with some suggestion of larger daily than hourly trends for recent decades. The expectation of the reverse, namely, larger trends for short-duration rainfall, as the signature of underlying climate change has potentially important implications for detection and attribution studies.","[Kendon, Elizabeth J.] Met Off, Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Blenkinsop, Stephen; Fowler, Hayley J.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; Newcastle University - UK,"Kendon, EJ (corresponding author), Met Off, Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England.",elizabeth.kendon@metoffice.gov.uk,"Fowler, Hayley J/A-9591-2013","Fowler, Hayley J/0000-0001-8848-3606; Blenkinsop, Stephen/0000-0003-0790-6545",Joint UK BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme [GA01101]; Met Office and Natural Environment Research Council (UKMO-NERC) [NE/1006680/1]; European Research Council [ERC-2013-CoG-617329]; Wolfson Foundation; Royal Society as a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award [WM140025]; NERC [NE/I006680/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/I006680/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Joint UK BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme; Met Office and Natural Environment Research Council (UKMO-NERC); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Wolfson Foundation; Royal Society as a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"E.

A conceptual framework illustrated with urban adaptation policy,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Co-production; Transformation; Futures; Urban heat island; Climate change; Adaptation,KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE; CITIES,"Projects in which science-based futures are produced indicating the relevant impacts of climatic changes are proliferating, in tandem with the increasing attention for climate change adaptation. Constructionist science studies have put forward the concept of 'co-production' to understand how knowledge claims become stable, authoritative, get institutionalised and reorder science and society. Moreover, knowledge and structures of power are co-evolutionary. Exercises in constructing futures are interesting practices where what is and what ought are enmeshed, and where knowledge claims may in turn be performative for societal reordering. This article presents a conceptual framework to understand the transformation of knowledge claims about the future in more analytical detail. Five concepts are suggested to aid the analysis of transformations: reduction, extension, rhetorical packaging, modification and redefinition. This conceptual framework is used to present a qualitative, in-depth study about the transformation of the volatile issue of urban warming in the face of climate change in the Netherlands, and the related knowledge claims on the future of this issue. As this case makes clear, the constant erosion of legitimacy for urban warming as a matter of collective concern is important to understand the transformation of knowledge claims. Also, the context and organisational embedding in which the projects originated had direct consequences for the construction of relevant knowledge on future urban warming. Moreover, the pre-existing methodologies science brings to the production of knowledge functioned as important templates which transformed the issue of urban warming. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Modern scientific research on meteorology and climatology started in Portugal in the 1950s and a strong community of researchers in climate science, vulnerabilities, impacts, and adaptation has since developed, particularly in the last decade. Nevertheless, there are still many gaps in research, especially regarding the economic costs of climate change in Portugal and costs and benefits of adaptation. Governmental policies with a strong emphasis on mitigation were introduced at the end of the 1990s. As greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise beyond its Kyoto target for 2012, the country had to resort to the Kyoto Flexibility Mechanisms in order to comply. Climate change adaptation policies were introduced in 2010 but are far from being fully implemented. Regarding public engagement with climate change, high levels of concern contrast with limited understanding and rather weak behavioral dispositions to address climate change. Citizens display a heavy reliance on the media as sources of information, which are dominated by a techno-managerial discourse mainly focused on the global level. The final part of the article identifies research gaps and outlines a research agenda. Connections between policy and research are also discussed.

They can either contribute to or detract from resilience. Existing research has emphasized the importance of quantifying resilience in order to estimate baseline resilience and measure progress toward resilience enhancement. Previous attempts at quantification of resilience have not incorporated place-specific indicators or differential weighting of indicators for prioritization of resilience enhancement actions. Previous research efforts have also not incorporated spatial and temporal contexts when attempting to quantify resilience indicators. This research demonstrates the importance for quantifying resilience place-specific indicators, differential weighting of indicators, and the spatial and temporal contexts of indicators for resilience estimation and quantification through a case study of Sarasota County, Florida. This case study was conducted in four phases: preliminary interviews, plan review, focus group, and spatial analysis. Preliminary interviews were intended to contribute to development of research goals. The plan review process served to identify Sarasota County's planning priorities to determine possible indicators of resilience unique to Sarasota County as well as existing and planned county hazard mitigation strategies. The focus group was concerned with identifying resilience indicators through a workshop with officials from Sarasota County. The spatial analysis portion used findings from all three previous phases to demonstrate spatial patterns of resilience. This research demonstrates that although national resilience quantification metrics are useful, local scale resilience estimates appear more useful if community hazard mitigation and climate change adaptation is the primary goal.

Mapping results were checked and refined by the same analyst with the same set of criteria. The results show during the last 20 years urban areas in China have increased exponentially more than 2 times. The greatest area of urbanization changed from Northeastern provinces in 1990s to the Southeast coast of China in Jiangsu, Guangdong, Shandong, and Zhejiang in 2010s. Urban areas are mostly converted from croplands in China. Approximately 17750 km(2) croplands were converted into urban lands. Furthermore, the conversion from 2000 to 2010 doubled that from 1990 to 2000. During the 20 years, the most urbanized provinces are Jiangsu, Guangdong, Shandong and Zhejiang. We also analyzed built-up areas, gross domestic production (GDP) and population of 147 cities with a population of greater than 500000 in 2009. The result shows coastal cities and resource-based cities are with high economic efficiency per unit of built-up areas, resource-based cities have the highest population density, and the economic efficiency of most coastal provinces are lower than central provinces and Guangdong. The newly created urban expansion dataset is useful in many fields including trend analysis of urbanization in China; simulation of urban development dynamics; analysis of the relationship among urbanization, population growth and migration; studies of carbon emissions and climate change; adaptation of climate change; as well as land use and urban planning and management.","[Wang Lei; Ying Qing; Cheng Xiao; Wang XiaoYi; Huang HuaBing; Gong Peng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing Applicat, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang Lei; Ying Qing; Cheng Xiao; Wang XiaoYi; Huang HuaBing; Gong Peng] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang Lei; Hu LuanYun; Liang Lu; Yu Le; Gong Peng] Tsinghua Univ, Ctr Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Li CongCong; Cheng Xiao; Li XueYan] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Gong Peng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Ecosyst Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Chinese Academy of Sciences; Beijing Normal University; Tsinghua University; Beijing Normal University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Gong, P (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing Applicat, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",penggong@tsinghua.edu.cn,"WANG, Lei/B-4845-2012; wang, fenfei/N-9905-2015; Ying, Qing/A-3046-2011; Yu, Le/C-3701-2008; Gong, Peng/L-8184-2013; Gong, Peng/AAM-1516-2021; huang, huabing/K-1056-2013","WANG, Lei/0000-0002-7163-3644; Yu, Le/0000-0003-3115-2042; Gong, Peng/0000-0003-1513-3765; huang, huabing/0000-0001-6253-8437; Ying, Qing/0000-0002-9752-8973","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41001275]; Special Foundation for Young Scientists of State Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science [10QN-04]; National High-Tech R & D Program of China [2008AA121702, 2009AA12200101]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special Foundation for Young Scientists of State Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science; National High-Tech R & D Program of China(National High Technology Research and Development Program of China),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41001275), the Special Foundation for Young Scientists of State Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science (10QN-04) and National High-Tech R & D Program of China (2008AA121702 and 2009AA12200101).",,46,234,264,15,219,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1001-6538,1861-9541,,CHINESE SCI BULL,Chin.

A plausible way to help tackle these challenges is by developing new plant varieties that have improved crop yield, plant nutritional quality, and sustainability (or resilience) traits. However, stakeholders, consumers, and citizens' concerns and appreciation of future-proofing crops and the acceptability of new plant breeding strategies are not well-established. These groups are actors in the agri-food systems, and their views, values, needs, and expectations are crucial in helping to co-design fair, ethical, acceptable, sustainable, and socially desirable policies on new plant breeding techniques (NPBTs) and the transition to sustainable agri-food systems. In this study, we engaged with consumer experts and societal stakeholders to consider their perceptions, expectations, and acceptability of improving crops and NPBTs for future-proofing the agri-food systems. Our analysis points to a need for governments to take a proactive role in regulating NPBTs, ensure openness and transparency in breeding new crop varieties, and inform consumers about the effects of these breeding programmes and the risks and benefits of the new crop varieties developed. Consumer experts and societal stakeholders considered these strategies necessary to instil confidence in society about NPBTs and accelerate the transition to sustainable agri-food systems.","[Nair, Abhishek; Fischer, Arnout R.

Measured quantities of hydroclimatic variables, including precipitation, evapotranspiration, streamflow, etc., are the primary indicators of water availability, and indices derived using several such primary variables provide a means to express water availability across a range of spatio-temporal scales. In this study, the ability of one such multi-scalar index, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), computed at a range of time scales, was examined to see how well it could model historically observed warm season monthly and annual streamflow in 24 natural-flowing watersheds of western Canada. The empirical relationships between the SPEI, computed at 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12- and 24-month time scales, and monthly and annual streamflow were analyzed, showing significant correlations for all watersheds. The time scale of the SPEI with the strongest correlations varied seasonally. Based on these results, SPEI-based principal component regression (PCR) equations were calculated to model warm season monthly and annual historical streamflow. These PCR equations are able to adequately capture historical streamflow in these watersheds. Annual streamflow variability was better captured(mean R-adj(2) = 0.46) than monthly variability (mean R-adj(2) = 0.30 over March-October). Summer and fall streamflow variability was better captured (mean R-adj(2) = 0.42 over June-September) than spring variability (mean R-adj(2) = 0.15 over March-April).","[Gurrapu, Sunil] Natl Inst Hydrol, Surface Water Hydrol Div, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India; [Hodder, Kyle R.; Sauchyn, David J.] Univ Regina, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Regina, SK, Canada; [Sauchyn, David J.] Univ Regina, Prairie Adaptat Res Collaborat PARC, Regina, SK, Canada; [St Jacques, Jeannine Marie] Concordia Univ, Dept Geog Planning & Environm, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Regina; University of Regina; Concordia University - Canada,"Gurrapu, S (corresponding author), Natl Inst Hydrol, Surface Water Hydrol Div, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India.",gurrapus.nihr@gov.in,"Gurrapu, Sunil/E-8683-2016","Gurrapu, Sunil/0000-0002-0996-1276; Hodder, Kyle/0000-0002-1447-2557",,,,,107,2,2,1,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0701-1784,1918-1817,,CAN WATER RESOUR J,Can.

A substantial amount, USD 51 billion was allocated for devolution from the Union (Government of India) to the subnational (state) governments against the forest cover criteria for the period 2015-2019. Evidence indicates that this substantial devolution did not guarantee fund flows to the forestry sector nor result in an appreciable increase in conservation outcomes in states that benefited the most from the transfers. We conduct an in-depth empirical analysis which demonstrates that the design of the transfer is crucial in determining outcomes. Findings indicate that conservation and afforestation outcomes are likely to be better when the ecological values, the bulk of which are carbon values, are incorporated upfront in financial allocation decisions. Indirectly incentivizing subnational entities by compensating them for maintaining land under forests is a much weaker approach that may not lead to the desired outcomes. Our findings are relevant since the next phase of allocation through fiscal transfers is under active consideration. Ensuring design compatibility in financial transfers complements and links up well with international goals to achieve climate mitigation through REDD+, as well as domestic priorities for achieving the SDGs.","[Dasgupta, Purnamita; Srikanth, Kavitha] Inst Econ Growth, Delhi, India; [Dasgupta, Purnamita] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, Lalitpur, Nepal",,"Dasgupta, P (corresponding author), Inst Econ Growth, Delhi, India.;Dasgupta, P (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, Lalitpur, Nepal.",purnamita.dasgupta@gmail.com; kavithasrikanth02@gmail.com,"Srikanth, Kavitha/ABG-7788-2021","Srikanth, Kavitha/0000-0002-0289-4672; DASGUPTA, PURNAMITA/0000-0001-5148-4402",,,,,85,2,2,1,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Climate change scenarios show Botswana becoming hotter and drier with mega droughts, heat waves and more intense and spatially confined rainfall events. The Botswana Government has reacted by providing artificial water points (AWPs) in the Protected Areas and surrounding Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs), in part to compensate for the lack of access to historical sources due to fences and human expansion. Blanket provision of AWPs will disrupt the existing mobility and migratory strategies of the key ungulates that is basic to their survival and their ability to adapt to climate change. Botswana's burgeoning elephant population has already effectively re-connected the drier Kalahari System to the Northern System by breaching fences in the region. The key recommendations from the past are used to reinforce the need for ecosystem management for resilience at the landscape level via migratory corridors through shared landscapes, made possible by a renewed focus on Community Based Natural Resource Management and Payments for Ecosystem Services. The events that have occurred over the last 50 years are used to illustrate the dangers of managing at the wrong 'localised' spatial and temporal scale and failing to address the key factors of mobility and inequity that characterise the ecological and socio-economic systems, respectively.","[Perkins, Jeremy S.] Dept Environm Sci, Private Bag 0022, Gaborone, Botswana",,"Perkins, JS (corresponding author), Dept Environm Sci, Private Bag 0022, Gaborone, Botswana.",perkinsjs@mopipi.ub.bw,"Perkins, Jeremy/CAG-1257-2022","Perkins, Jeremy/0000-0002-7396-1430",SASSCAL,SASSCAL,Research for this Project was funded by SASSCAL and conducted under Research permit EWT 8/36/4 XXII (47): The impacts of climate change on livelihoods and implications for adaptive strategies in the Kalahari ecosystem of western Botswana'.

Concerned authorities increasingly question the sustainability of current river management strategies. The aim of this paper is to apply the adaptation turning point (ATP) approach and demonstrates its potential for analysing turning points in river management strategies as a method to support authorities in decisions on adaptation to climate change. Two management strategies in the Rhine River basin were selected as case studies: (1) reintroduction of a sustainable population of Atlantic salmon and (2) inland shipping in relation to water depth variability. By applying the turning point approach, we search for answers to the following questions: when will these management strategies fail due to climate change impacts on the river's hydrology? What adaptation measures exist to delay or avoid failure? The identification of adaption turning points is not easy, due to large scenario and model uncertainties in transient future projections of low-flow discharges and water temperatures. But the case studies demonstrate that the ATP approach is salient from a decision-maker's perspective, because it addresses the timing of possible failure of current management strategies. Analysis of results allows policy makers to assess risks and the urgency for action and provides them with a time horizon for adaptation planning. It is also a valuable first step in the application of methods of formal appraisal of adaptation options when flexibility in planning is required.","[van Slobbe, Erik; Werners, Saskia E.; Riquelme-Solar, Marcela; van Vliet, Michelle T.

To meet this challenge spatial planning authorities require information concerning climate change impacts on a regional and local scale level. This paper presents an assessment framework for exploring the impacts of climate change in the context of spatial planning. The framework employs indicators for exposure to climate stimuli and sensitivity to climate change induced impacts. A particular focus was put on producing a comparable classification method with regard to the set of indicators. The application of the framework allows a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the results for the impacts addressed. The framework was applied at a regional level for the whole of Germany. An indicator based model was developed assessing 11 potential impacts with relevance for the German spatial planning system. Relevant indicators of sensitivity and exposure were compared for a common assessment and spatial analysis of climate change induced potential impacts related to NUTS 3 districts. The impact analysis is applied for three different IPCC greenhouse gas emission scenarios (A2, B1, A1B) and three future periods (2011-2040, 2041-2070, 2071-2100). The assessment provides new information on the spatial distribution of different potential impacts of climate changes in Germany. Regions with cumulative impacts of climate change are identified as hot spot areas which need urgent adaptation activities by spatial planning. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We further examine how communities and fire managers have responded to these changes and what additional adaptations could be put in place. We engage a variety of social science methods, including demographic analysis, semi-structured interviews, surveys, workshops and observations of public meetings. This work is part of an interdisciplinary study of feedback and interactions between climate, vegetation, fire and human components of the Boreal forest social-ecological system of interior Alaska. We have learned that although urban and rural communities in interior Alaska face similar increased exposure to wildfire as a result of climate change, important differences exist in their sensitivity to these biophysical, climate-induced changes. In particular, reliance on wild foods, delayed suppression response, financial resources and institutional connections vary between urban and rural communities. These differences depend largely on social, economic and institutional factors, and are not necessarily related to biophysical climate impacts per se. Fire management and suppression action motivated by political, economic or other pressures can serve as unintentional or indirect adaptation to climate change. However, this indirect response alone may not sufficiently reduce vulnerability to a changing fire regime. More deliberate and strategic responses may be required, given the magnitude of the expected climate change and the likelihood of an intensification of the fire regime in interior Alaska.","[Trainor, Sarah F.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst No Engn, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Calef, Monika] SUNY Albany, Dept Geog & Planning, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Natcher, David] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Bioresource Policy Business & Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada; [Chapin, F.

Assessing heatwave-related population exposures under different warming scenarios is critical for climate change adaptation. Here, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) multi-model ensemble output results are applied over several warming periods in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR6 report, to estimate China's future heatwave population exposure under 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C warming scenarios. Our results show a significant increase in projected future annual heatwave days (HD) under both scenarios. With an additional temperature increase of 0.5 degrees C to 2.0 degrees C of warming, by mid-century an additional 20.15 percent increase in annual HD would occur, over 1.5 degrees C warming. If the climate warmed from 1.5 degrees C to 2.0 degrees C by mid-century, population exposure would increase by an additional 40.6 percent. Among the three influencing elements that cause the changes in population exposure related to heatwaves in China-climate, population, and interaction (e.g., as urbanization affects population redistribution)-climate plays the dominant role in different warming scenarios (relative contribution exceeds 70 percent). Therefore, considering the future heat risks, humanity benefits from a 0.5 degrees C reduction in warming, particularly in eastern China.

Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional study was conducted with purposive sampling of 210 households in the select ten villages of the western Himalayan region. Open-ended interview questionnaires and a close-ended survey on a 5-point Likert scale are used. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24 is used for the exploratory factor analysis. Further, Atlas-ti version 8 is also employed for thematic analysis. Findings The exploratory and thematic analysis illustrated that socio-ecological beliefs are crucial in food choices, but cultural beliefs are also changing due to climate change. Thus, the shift in socio-cultural beliefs can significantly affect the nutritional security of the indigenous societies during climate-induced emergencies in the mountain regions. Practical implications Therefore, the findings of the study are significant for a comprehensive understanding of the traditional dietary practice of the indigenous community for an evidence-based inclusive food security and climate change adaptation policy. Originality/value The inclusion of cultural practices is evident for ensuring the nutritional security. But, the magnitude of the climate-induced impacts on customary societies is not yet fully understood.

Global environmental change research has generated several useful concepts and frameworks for understanding and assessing adaptive capacity to climate change impacts, but our ability to effectively integrate and use this wealth of knowledge to mobilise and build the needed adaptive capacity remains low. We build on the capitals and the vulnerability frameworks to develop a new framework to argue for how existing frameworks and concepts can be consolidated for assessing adaptive capacity, how adaptive capacity can be mobilised and the need to assess adaptive capacity in the context of multiple climatic and non-climatic stressors. The framework adds three important insights into the studies of adaptive capacity. First, it recognises that links among various forms of capital (components of adaptive capacity) are critical for mobilising, building or depleting adaptive capacity. Second, it explicitly shows adaptive capacity is better understood when assessed in the context of multiple climatic and non-climatic stressors because the impacts of climate change are bound to manifest in complex coupled human and social systems. Third, it highlights that knowledge of multiple interactions among stressors provides a strong explanation for tackling some inherent developmental issues with climate change adaptation plans and actions. Evidence from smallscale coastal fisheries of Ghana supports the framework's assumptions and arguments.","[Freduah, George; Smith, Timothy F.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Locked Bag 4, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia; [Fidelman, Pedro] Univ Queensland, Ctr Policy Futures, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Smith, Timothy F.] Brock Univ, Environm Sustainabil Res Ctr, St Catharines, ON, Canada; [Smith, Timothy F.] Uppsala Univ, Swedish Int Ctr Educ Sustainable Dev SWEDESD, Uppsala, Sweden; [Fidelman, Pedro] Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of the Sunshine Coast; University of Queensland; Brock University; Uppsala University,"Freduah, G (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Locked Bag 4, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia.",gfreduah@usc.edu.au; p.fidelman@uq.edu.au; TSmith5@usc.edu.au,"Fidelman, Pedro/N-1466-2014; Freduah, George/Q-9663-2019","Fidelman, Pedro/0000-0001-7780-0952; Freduah, George/0000-0002-5476-8061",Too Big To Ignore (TBTI),Too Big To Ignore (TBTI),"The adaptive capacity framework discussed here was part of a PhD project at the University of the Sunshine Coast Climate Change and Fisheries in Ghana: Strategies for Building Adaptive Capacity by Small-Scale Fishers.

This challenge may be addressed by: structuring the adaptation problem using a multiple perspective adaptation framework; and applying a context specific precedence grammar logic for selecting and evaluating adaptation measures. Precedence grammar logic is a set of rule based algorithms (grammar) that are based on the relationships in a local adaptation context. This paper demonstrates the application of a context specific precedence grammar logic in an adaptation context in Can Tho, Vietnam. Adaptation pathways comprising flood adaptation measures (i.e. dike heightening) for this case were generated using rule based algorithms based on the relationships between the drivers and the adaptation measures. The results show that complex adaptation issues that are structured, can be resolved using a context specific adaptation grammar approach. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The application of climate adaptive building shells (CABS) has recently been put forward as a promising alternative within this strive for higher levels of sustainability in the built environment. Compared to conventional facades, CABS offer potential opportunities for energy savings as well improvement of indoor environmental quality. By combining the complementary beneficial aspects of both active and passive building technologies into the building envelope, CABS can draw upon the concepts of adaptability, multi-ability and evolvability. The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of research, design and development efforts in the field of CABS. Based on a structured literature review, a classification of 44 CABS is made to place the variety of concepts in context with each other, and concurrent developments. In doing so, the overall motivations, enabling technologies, and characteristic features that have contributed to the development of CABS are highlighted. Despite the positive perspectives, it was found that the concept of CABS cannot yet be considered mature. Future research needs and further challenges to be resolved are therefore identified as well.

I analyze the ways in which these activities have been documented as effective using five indicators: reducing risk and vulnerability, developing resilient social systems, improving the environment, increasing economic resources, and enhancing governance and institutions. The act of cataloging adaptation activities produces insights for current and future climate action in two main areas: understanding common attributes of adaptation initiatives reported to be effective in current literature; and identifying gaps in adaptation research and practice that address equality, justice, and power dynamics.","[Owen, Gigi] Univ Arizona, POB 210137, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona,"Owen, G (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, POB 210137, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",gigi@email.arizona.edu,,,,,,,97,73,73,30,124,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

Climate changes have been recorded, and the hydrological extremes of floods and droughts are becoming more pronounced. Adaptation to climate changes is an ongoing task, for which it is necessary to develop and maintain water management and water utility facilities and systems in a sustainable way. In addition to climate change as a growing security threat to the water infrastructure, there are other asymmetric threats and challenges such as cyber attacks, deliberate pollution, terrorist attacks, sabotage etc. Economic development and urbanization are leading to a large increase in water demand, and in this respect, water is becoming a limiting factor in development. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to initiate the protection of water resources and the protection of distribution water supply infrastructures in the Republic of Croatia. We will reduce security threats to critical infrastructure by applying approaches primarily related to legislative frameworks and then through plans, programs and other activities that will need to be implemented at all levels of critical infrastructure management.","[Trut, Damir] Minist Unutarnjih Poslova, Ravnateljstvo Civilne Zastite, Zagreb, Croatia",,"Trut, D (corresponding author), Minist Unutarnjih Poslova, Ravnateljstvo Civilne Zastite, Zagreb, Croatia.",,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,"MINISTRY INTERIOR REPUBLIC CROATIA, POLICE ACAD",ZAGREB,"AV GOJKA SUSKA 1, ZAGREB, 10090, CROATIA",1330-0229,1848-428X,,POLIC SIGUR,Polic.

Generally, AM has a green ideology and focuses on the bioregion as the only sensible level for analysis and action. This tendency for systemic functionalism of AM-as-(green)-policy-prescription depoliticizes an issue (what to do about climate change) that is political through and through. For example, those who stand to lose their livelihood as a result of AM plans or simply cannot adapt so fast may resist AM propositions. Implementing AM in practice thereby often leads to social and institutional engineering to overcome resistance. AM in academia seems quite far removed from the real worlds of social deliberation and praxis where policy is made and implemented, and where other values and interests than those implicit in AM prevail. We therefore highlight the importance of practices on the ground, claiming AM is not achieved by bioregional policies, but developed on the hoof at locally appropriate scales.

In marginalized and vulnerable communities around the globe, there is a crucial need to initiate actions to reduce adverse climatic impacts and support sustainable development goals (SDGs), particularly on food and health. Climate change's multidimensional and complex impact on food and health has prompted calls for an integrated, science-based approach that could simultaneously improve the environment and nourish development-constrained communities. This paper examines a transdisciplinary practice of agroecology that bridges the gap between science, practice, and policy for climate action. We also analyze the significance of agroecology in building climate-resilient communities through sustainable food systems. We assert that the marriage of science and local knowledge that addresses access inequities through agroecology can lessen the impact of climate change on rural communities to achieve healthier, more sustainable, and equitable food systems. Furthermore, a transformative agroecological paradigm can provide farmers with a host of adaptive possibilities leading to healthier communities, improved food security, and restored lands and forests that can sequester greenhouse gases. Based on our findings, we call on the science and policy communities to integrate agroecology as part of the broader strategic approach to climate change adaptation and mitigation.","[Amoak, Daniel; Luginaah, Isaac; McBean, Gordon] Western Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Amoak, D (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",damoak@uwo.ca,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Luginaah, Isaac/0000-0001-7858-3048; Amoak, Daniel/0000-0002-3879-7233",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Knowledge Synthesis Grant,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Knowledge Synthesis Grant,This research was supported by the Building climate resilient communities: Living within the Earth's carrying capacity research project through funding provided by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Knowledge Synthesis Grant.,,84,1,1,24,24,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2022,14,21,,,,,,,13954,10.3390/su142113954,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142113954,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6B6SC,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000881459500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While much has been written on the effect of climate change on glaciers in the Himalaya and its impact on sustainability, almost nothing has been published on rock glaciers in the region and their role in maintaining water supplies as the climate warms. Rock glaciers are important components of the Himalayan hydrological system because they are present in almost all regions of the Himalaya and are climatically more resilient than other glacier types owing to an insulating layer of debris cover. Research from other mountain regions shows that they contain potentially important water stores, although in the Himalaya, there is almost no information on their number, spatial distribution and response to future climate change. The extent to which this contributes to higher resilience of the Himalayan cryosphere as a whole is still an open question. This paper argues that research into Himalayan rock glaciers that reveals their hydrological significance is critical for underpinning climate change adaptation strategies and to ensure that this highly populated region is in a strong position to meet sustainable development goals.","[Harrison, Stephan; Jones, Darren; Anderson, Karen] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England; [Shannon, Sarah] Univ Bristol, Bristol Glaciol Ctr, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Betts, Richard A.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Betts, Richard A.] Univ Exeter, Global Syst Inst, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter; University of Bristol; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; University of Exeter,"Harrison, S (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England.",stephan.harrison@exeter.ac.uk,"Anderson, Karen/ABC-3524-2021","Anderson, Karen/0000-0002-3289-2598",,,,,25,4,4,3,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0435-3676,1468-0459,,GEOGR ANN A,Geogr.

In order to estimate future PMPs, the hydro-meteorological method is applied. The key future meteorological variable used to analyze the rate of change of future PMPs is the dew-point temperature. Future 12-h persistence 100-year return period extreme dew-point temperatures obtained from future daily dew-point temperature time series by using the scale-invariance method are applied to estimate future PMPs. As a result of estimating future PMPs using several RCMs and representative concentration pathways (RCPs) scenarios, the spatial distribution of future PMPs is expected to be similar to that of the present, but PMPs tend to increase in the future. In addition, it can be seen that the difference in PMPs estimated from various RCMs and RCP scenarios is getting bigger in the future. Especially after 2070, the difference has increased even more. In the short term, it is proposed to establish climate change adaptation policies with an 18% increase in PMPs, which is the ensemble average in the future year 2050.","[Lee, Okjeong] Pukyong Natl Univ, Div Earth Environm Syst Sci, Major Environm Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea; [Kim, Sangdan] Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea",Pukyong National University; Pukyong National University,"Kim, S (corresponding author), Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea.",lover1804@nate.com; skim@pknu.ac.kr,,"Lee, Okjeong/0000-0001-5442-7024","Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport [18AWMP-B083066-05]; National Research Foundation of Korea [21A20151713014] Funding Source: Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI), National Science & Technology Information Service (NTIS)","Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","This work is supported by the Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) grant funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (Grant 18AWMP-B083066-05).",,25,14,14,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAY,2018,10,5,,,,,,,637,10.3390/w10050637,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10050637,,,17,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,GJ3LO,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000435196700103,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presents the approaches applied to estimate emissions in agricultural sector during the period 1990-2006. It describes the origin and sources of emissions, applied methodology, parameters and emission estimates for the sector of agriculture in the country. The total greenhouse gas emissions reached 7644 Gg CO2 eq. in 2006. About 59% (4479 Gg CO2 eq.) of these emissions has originated from agricultural soils. This quantity ranks agriculture as the third largest sector in the Czech Republic representing 5.3% of the total greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). The emissions under the Czech conditions consist mainly of emissions from enteric fermentation, manure management and agricultural soils. During the period 1990-2006, GHG emissions from agriculture decreased by 50%, which was linked to reduced cattle population and amount of applied fertilizers. The study concludes that the GHG emissions in the sector of agriculture remain significant and their proper assessment is required for sound climate change adaptation and mitigation policies,","[Exnerova, Z.; Cienciala, E.] Inst Forest Ecosyst Res, Jilove, Czech Republic",,"Exnerova, Z (corresponding author), Ustav Pro Vyzkum Lesnich Ekosystemu SRO, Areal 1 Jilovske AS, Jilove 25401, Czech Republic.",zuzana.exnerova@ifer.cz,"Cienciala, Emil/F-1873-2011; Cienciala, Emil/AGM-4340-2022","Cienciala, Emil/0000-0002-1254-4254; Cienciala, Emil/0000-0002-1254-4254",,,,,19,4,4,2,19,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",1214-1178,1805-9368,,PLANT SOIL ENVIRON,Plant Soil Environ.,AUG,2009,55,8,,,,,311,319,,10.17221/2528-PSE,http://dx.doi.org/10.17221/2528-PSE,,,9,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,497KI,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000270057700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 50 (Proceedings of the 9th International Coastal Symposium), 109 - 113. Gold Coast, Australia, ISSN 0749.0208 Coastal research and management often has an issue-specific focus, with little attention paid to the interdependencies between those issues. Climate variability is one such issue that is impacted by, and impacts on, several other areas (e.g. coastal processes, infrastructure, health and regional economies). These interdependencies create challenges for local governments to scale-up so as to tackle these issues at a regional scale. Critical to this process of scaling-up is the adaptive capacity of local governments. A method to assist local governments deal with climate variability in the Sydney region is being developed by CSIRO and the Sydney Coastal Councils Group through the Australian Greenhouse Office National Climate Change Adaptation Program. The method consists of: (i) creating vulnerability mapping templates; (ii) working with local governments to determine collective and local vulnerabilities; (iii) analysis of local government priorities and capacity for adaptation; and (iv) assessment of transferability of the method to other regions.","[Smith, T.

Adaptation is essential for mitigating adverse effects of climate change, to sustain rural livelihoods and ensure future food security. We present an agent-based model, called OMOLAND-CA, which explores the impact of climate change on the adaptive capacity of rural communities in the South Omo Zone of Ethiopia. The purpose of the model is to answer research questions on the resilience and adaptive capacity of rural households with respect to variations in climate, socioeconomic factors, and land-use at the local level. Our model explicitly represents the socio-cognitive behavior of rural households toward climate change and resource flows that prompt agents to diversify their production strategy under different climatic conditions. Results from the model show that successive episodes of extreme events (e.g., droughts) affect the adaptive capacity of households, causing them to migrate from the region. Nonetheless, rural communities in the South Omo Zone, and in the model, manage to endure in spite of such harsh climatic change conditions.","[Hailegiorgis, Atesmachew] George Mason Univ, Ctr Social Complex, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Crooks, Andrew; Cioffi-Revilla, Claudio] George Mason Univ, Ctr Social Complex, Dept Computat & Data Sci, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University; George Mason University,"Hailegiorgis, A (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Ctr Social Complex, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",atesbiz@gmail.com,"Crooks, Andrew T/L-2018-2017","Crooks, Andrew T/0000-0002-5034-6654",US National Science Foundation through a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement (NSF-DDRI) grant [112348]; Cyber-Enabled Discovery and Innovation (CDI) Program [IIS-1125171]; Office of Naval Research (ONR) under a Multi-disciplinary University Research Initiative grant [N 00014-08-1-092]; Center for Social Complexity at George Mason University,US National Science Foundation through a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement (NSF-DDRI) grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Cyber-Enabled Discovery and Innovation (CDI) Program; Office of Naval Research (ONR) under a Multi-disciplinary University Research Initiative grant(Office of Naval Research); Center for Social Complexity at George Mason University,"This work was supported by the US National Science Foundation through a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement (NSF-DDRI) grant (no. 112348), a Cyber-Enabled Discovery and Innovation (CDI) Program grant (no.

This study used many technologies, such as biological treatment processes, activated sludge, trickling filters, and fixed bioreactors. However, Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) have seemed to be the most suitable technology because of their low cost and footprint. Additionally, a pilot laboratory was established to simulate the sewage treatment plant. It consisted of a primary sedimentation tank followed by an MBR tank and a chlorine disinfection tank, where the sludge was fed into a cylindrical anaerobic digester. The amount of sludge collected generated 41.5 mL/day of biogas. The application of this large-scale batch reactor will produce around 38 m3/day of biogas.

Although many communities are already responding to these impacts, inequitable structures impose barriers to their capacity to recover and adapt. Through the case of the Pehuenche people of Southern Chile, this article addresses the question of what is the relationship between resilience and adaptation to climate change. From an ethnographic approach, the article characterizes the construction process of the contextual vulnerability of Pehuenche communities and evaluates their responses to cope with climate change impacts. Fieldwork was conducted in two stages between 2017 and 2019. Results show that current Pehuenche vulnerability to climate change is an ongoing process influenced by the state rather than a consequence of this phenomenon. Although Pehuenche communities are responding to climate change impacts, their resilience is constrained by the incidence of state policy. Identifying themselves as herders, Pehuenche responses aim to restore the conditions for livestock instead of changing the factors that make them vulnerable. Most of their responses can be considered maladaptation because they reinforce vulnerability by reproducing practices that damage their social capital and cause more pressure on the territory. A critical review and reformulation of the policy implemented at the local level are mandatory to strengthen community resilience.","[Carmona, Rosario] Univ Bonn, Dept Anthropol Amer, Bonn, Germany; [Carmona, Rosario] Ctr Intercultural & Indigenous Estudies, Santiago, Chile",University of Bonn,"Carmona, R (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Dept Anthropol Amer, Bonn, Germany.;Carmona, R (corresponding author), Ctr Intercultural & Indigenous Estudies, Santiago, Chile.",s5rocarm@uni-bonn.de,"Carmona, Rosario/HHZ-6006-2022","Carmona, Rosario/0000-0003-2563-9591",Center for Intercultural and Indigenous Research (ANID/FONDAP) [15110006]; ERC Consolidator Grant [FP7-771056-LICCI]; Academy of Christian Humanism University [FIIC 2019-02-01],Center for Intercultural and Indigenous Research (ANID/FONDAP); ERC Consolidator Grant(European Research Council (ERC)); Academy of Christian Humanism University,This research was funded by the Center for Intercultural and Indigenous Research (ANID/FONDAP 15110006); the ERC Consolidator Grant to Reyes-Garcia (FP7-771056-LICCI); and the Academy of Christian Humanism University (FIIC 2019-02-01).,,67,2,2,1,3,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1939-4071,1937-5174,,ENVIRON JUSTICE,Environ.

Four key aspects of successful climate services are highlighted: the transition of climate research to operational climate services; delivering relevant, tailored, and usable climate information; effective engagement between users and providers of climate services; and building interdisciplinary professional teams. Key challenges and opportunities for climate services are recognized in this paper: a growing gap between climate science and services capability and societal need, a lack of awareness in user communities of the climate service value for their activities, and the important need for closer and more meaningful interactions between users and providers of climate services.

This is important because CA demands new ways of working with the farm system. Implementation will inevitably involve a reallocation of men's and women's resources as well as having an impact upon their ability to realize their gender interests. With respect to intra-household decision-making and the distribution of benefits, CA interventions have implications for labour requirements and labour allocation, investment decisions with respect to mechanization and herbicide use, crop choice, and residue management. CA practice may impact upon the ability of households to source a wide variety of crops, wild plants, and insects and small animals for household nutrition. Gender biases in extension service design can sideline women. This paper examines the limited research to date on the interactions between CA interventions and gender in East and Southern Africa, and, based on the gaps observed, sets out a research agenda. It argues that attention to gender in CA is particularly timely given the increasing interest in CA as a means of adapting to climate change.","[Farnworth, Cathy Rozel] Pandia Consulting, Teigelkamp 64, D-48145 Munster, Germany; [Baudron, Frederic; Misiko, Michael] CIMMYT Ethiopia, ILRI, Shola Campus,POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Andersson, Jens A.] CIMMYT Southern Africa, Royal Trop Inst, Mauritskade 63, NL-1092 AD Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Badstue, Lone; Stirling, Clare M.] CIMMYT, Apdo Postal 6-641, Mexico City 06600, DF, Mexico",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Farnworth, CR (corresponding author), Pandia Consulting, Teigelkamp 64, D-48145 Munster, Germany.",cathyfarnworth@hotmail.com,"Andersson, Jens/G-7984-2011","Andersson, Jens/0000-0002-8124-3447; Misiko, Michael/0000-0002-5298-4393; Farnworth, Cathy/0000-0002-2263-865X; Baudron, Frederic/0000-0002-5648-2083","CGIAR Research Programs (CRPs) on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT)","CGIAR Research Programs (CRPs) on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT)(CGIAR)","We acknowledge the financial support from CGIAR Research Programs (CRPs) on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) and International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT) for synthesis of this work.",,135,49,49,2,31,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1473-5903,1747-762X,,INT J AGR SUSTAIN,Int.

Given that long-term economic growth is uncertain, the impacts of a wide range of growth trajectories should be considered. In particular, slower economic growth would imply that future generations will be relatively less able to invest in emissions controls or adapt to the detrimental impacts of climate change. Taking into consideration the possibility of economic slowdown therefore heightens the urgency of reducing greenhouse gas emissions now by moving to renewable energy sources, even if this incurs short-term economic cost. I quantify this counterintuitive impact of economic growth assumptions on present-day policy decisions in a simple global economy-climate model (Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (DICE)). In DICE, slow future growth increases the economically optimal present-day carbon tax rate and the utility of taxing carbon emissions, although the magnitude of the increase is sensitive to model parameters, including the rate of social time preference and the elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption. Future scenario development should specifically include low-growth scenarios, and the possibility of low-growth economic trajectories should be taken into account in climate policy analyses.","[Krakauer, Nir Y.] CUNY City Coll, Dept Civil Engn, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Krakauer, Nir Y.] CUNY City Coll, NOAA CREST, New York, NY 10031 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Krakauer, NY (corresponding author), CUNY City Coll, Dept Civil Engn, New York, NY 10031 USA.",nkrakauer@ccny.cuny.edu,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate and Global Change postdoctoral fellowship; NOAA [NA11SEC4810004, NA12OAR4310084]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0932916, 0931402] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate and Global Change postdoctoral fellowship; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","I am grateful to Steven Schneider and participants in the Dissertations Initiative for the Advancement of Climate Change Research (DISCCRS) III symposium and the 2009 Santa Fe Institute Global Sustainability Summer School for inspiration and valuable discussions; and to Maximillian Auffhammer, Inez Fung, Boris Fain, Zachary Subin, Alexander Stine and Margaret Torn for critical reviews and suggestions.

A decline in productivity of rice in recent years has been ascribed to decrease in soil organic carbon and reserve of nutrients, non-uniform distribution of rainfall, and increase in temperature because of climate change. To assess the impact of climate change on rice yield, crop simulation model CERES-rice was calibrated and well evaluated for medium and long duration varieties through field experimental data at Kharagpur, India. Using past 27 years (1974-2000) weather data, the CERES-Rice model predicted higher yield variability of the long duration (140 days) variety 'Swama' as compared to the medium duration (120 days) verities (IR 36 and Lalat) under rainfed condition of Kharagpur, India. However the highest mean yield was simulated for the variety Swama. With increase in atmospheric CO2 level by 100 ppm, the grain yield of rice was increased up to 6% under optimum supply of water and nutrients. Increase in average air temperature by 20 degrees C resulted a decline in yield of both the medium duration varieties but an increase in yield of the long duration variety. The long duration variety showed better adaptability to climate change than the medium duration varieties under optimum input management condition.","[Swain, D.

Climatic and anthropic changes have played a crucial role in surface runoff changes. The objective of this research was to apply land-use change and future climate change to predict runoff change in the Pak Phanang River Basin. The Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov model was used to predict the land-use change, while the climate data from 2025 to 2085 under RPC2.6, RPC4.5, and RPC8.5 were generated using the MarkSim model. Additionally, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) combined land-use change and the generated meteorological data to predict the runoff change in the study area. The results showed that the annual runoff in the area would increase in the upcoming year, which would affect the production of field crops in the lowland area. Therefore, a good water drainage system is required for the coming years. Since the runoff would be about 50% reduced in the middle and late 21st century, an agroforestry system is also suggested for water capturing and reducing soil evaporation. Moreover, the runoff change's overall impact was related to GHG emissions. This finding will be useful for the authorities to determine policies and plans for climate change adaptation in the Malay Peninsula.","[Janta, Rungruang; Khwanchum, Laksanara] Walailak Univ, Sch Languages & Gen Educ, Nakhon Si Thammarat 80160, Thailand; [Janta, Rungruang; Khwanchum, Laksanara; Ditthakit, Pakorn] Walailak Univ, Ctr Excellence Sustainable Disaster Management, Nakhon Si Thammarat 80160, Thailand; [Ditthakit, Pakorn] Walailak Univ, Sch Engn & Technol, Nakhon Si Thammarat 80160, Thailand; [Al-Ansari, Nadhir] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Nat Resources Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [Nguyen Thi Thuy Linh] Thu Dau Mot Univ, Inst Appl Technol, Thu Dau Mot 75000, Vietnam",Walailak University; Walailak University; Walailak University; Lulea University of Technology; Thu Dau Mot University,"Khwanchum, L (corresponding author), Walailak Univ, Sch Languages & Gen Educ, Nakhon Si Thammarat 80160, Thailand.;Khwanchum, L (corresponding author), Walailak Univ, Ctr Excellence Sustainable Disaster Management, Nakhon Si Thammarat 80160, Thailand.",rungruang.janta@mail.wu.ac.th; laksanara.kh@mail.wmac.th; dpakorn@mail.wu.ac.th; nadhitalansari@ltu.se; nguyenthuylinh@tdmu.edu.vn,"Janta, Rungruang/GXH-6954-2022","Al-Ansari, Nadhir/0000-0002-6790-2653; Khwanchum, Laksanara/0000-0003-4676-2767; Ditthakit, Pakorn/0000-0001-9847-2177","WU grant from Walailak University, Thailand [WU63245]","WU grant from Walailak University, Thailand","This research was funded by the WU grant (WU63245) from Walailak University, Thailand.",,41,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2022,14,15,,,,,,,9106,10.3390/su14159106,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14159106,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,3R9JY,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000839222100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, the vague, ambiguous and diverse understandings of the concept of transformation, combined with a lack of empirical grounding, deter the possibilities of its application in policy and practice, including a constructive engagement with municipal governments in leveraging fundamental change. Building upon the amalgamation of insights from sociological institutionalism, policy process research and complexity theories in organisation studies, the paper proposes an institutionalisation framework as a heuristic device to make sense of transformation. The framework unpacks types, mechanisms and agents of change across three phases - emergence, embeddedness and sustained change - and is applied to analyse the experience of the municipal government of Santa Fe, Argentina, with disaster risk management over a decade. The findings confirm the two productive tensions that traction transformation, namely, change/stability and leadership/networked spaces, and that the loci of fundamental change are distributed across time, space and agentic actors. The framework and case study jointly illustrate intervention points for municipal governments to catalyse transformative change when advancing urban disaster risk management.","[Filippi, Maria Evangelina] Univ Bristol, Sch Sociol Polit & Int Studies, 11 Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England; [Filippi, Maria Evangelina] UCL, Bartlett Dev Planning Unit, 34 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9EZ, England",University of Bristol; University of London; University College London,"Filippi, ME (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Sociol Polit & Int Studies, 11 Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England.;Filippi, ME (corresponding author), UCL, Bartlett Dev Planning Unit, 34 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9EZ, England.",evangelina.filippi@bristol.ac.uk,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Filippi, Maria Evangelina/0000-0001-6182-9208",UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J500185/1]; IJURR Foundation writing-up grant [1622598],UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); IJURR Foundation writing-up grant,"Acknowledgements This work has been part of a Ph.D. research funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council [grant ES/J500185/1] and supported by the IJURR Foundation writing-up grant [grant 1622598] .

Structured questionnaires on coping and adaptation strategies were conducted among Nyangatom households, expounded by focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Correlations between times series (1987-2016) on rainfall, temperature and the local perceptions on CC were examined. The time series analysis confirmed pastoralists' perception that the frequency of extreme drought has increased since 1987. The Nyangatom responded by temporal migration and herd diversification. Other responses include flood cultivation and enhancing alliance formation with other ethnic groups. Multi-nominal logistic regression analyses indicated that age of household head (-), livestock ownership (+), crop productivity (+), off-farm income (+) and access to climate information (+) proved to be key determinants with a statistically significant (negative or positive) effect on adoption. Other factors that hindered climate change adaption include intermittent conflicts with neighbouring ethnic groups and limited access to alternative livelihood options. Interventions to facilitate transition towards sustainable, adaptation-based communities need to incorporate deliberate, longer-term, risk-reducing strategies, including rangeland management, water harvesting and small scale-irrigation schemes. Improved education access, extension services, and a conducive pastoral policy environment will help to enhance the Nyangatom adaptive capacity.","[Gebeyehu, Adane Kebede; Abbink, Jon] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Social & Cultural Anthropol, De Boelelaan, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Gebeyehu, Adane Kebede] Addis Ababa Univ, Horn Africa Reg Environm Ctr & Network, POB 80773, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Snelder, Denyse] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Ctr Int Cooperat, De Boelelaan, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Sonneveld, Ben] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Sci, Athena Inst, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Sonneveld, Ben] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Ctr World Food Studies, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Abbink, Jon] Leiden Univ, African Studies Ctr, Wassenaarseweg 52, NL-2333 AK Leiden, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Addis Ababa University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Gebeyehu, AK (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, De Boelelaan, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",a.k.gebeyehu@vu.nl; d.j.r.m.snelder@vu.nl,"Abbink, Jon G./GWB-3299-2022; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Abbink, Jon G./0000-0003-1383-7849; Sonneveld, Ben/0000-0003-3969-3716",NUFFIC/NFP program [CF11834-2016]; Erasmus + mobility program [KA107],NUFFIC/NFP program; Erasmus + mobility program,"We are grateful to the NUFFIC/NFP program for funding the research (grant number CF11834-2016) and the Erasmus + mobility program (grant number KA107).

Many studies describe agronomic practices that can increase productivity on existing agricultural land without damaging the environment and without increasing the agricultural carbon footprint. However, there is limited information on specific practices with the greatest potential to contribute to sustainable intensification on smallholder farms in sub-Saharan Africa, while simultaneously keeping the carbon footprint low. The objectives of this review were to (1) identify good agronomic practices with potential for contributing to sustainable intensification across sub-Saharan Africa, (2) synthesize available information on benefits and synergies from these technologies, and (3) discuss bottlenecks in their adoption in order to obtain insights that inform the formulation of supportive policies. Agroforestry, cereal-legume intercropping, conservation agriculture, doubled-up legume cropping, fertilizer micro-dosing, planting basins, and push-pull technology were identified as key agronomic innovations widely promoted in sub-Saharan Africa. We show that these innovations can build synergies and increase resource use efficiency while reducing agricultural carbon footprint. We outline the benefits, trade-offs, and limitations of these practices and discuss their potential role in strengthening food sovereignty and climate change adaptation and mitigation.","[Kuyah, Shem; Ndayisaba, Pierre Celestin] Jomo Kenyatta Univ Agr & Technol JKUAT, Dept Bot, POB 62000-00200, Nairobi, Kenya; [Kuyah, Shem; Weldesemayat Sileshi, Gudeta; Nkurunziza, Libere; Oborn, Ingrid] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, POB 7043, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Chirinda, Ngonidzashe] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Cali 6713, Colombia; [Chirinda, Ngonidzashe] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ UM6P, Agr Innovat & Technol Transfer AITTC, Lot 660 Hay Moulay Rachid, Benguerir 43150, Morocco; [Ndayisaba, Pierre Celestin] Int Ctr Insect Physiol & Ecol ICIPE, POB 30772-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Ndayisaba, Pierre Celestin] Rwanda Agr & Anim Resources Dev Board, Land Husb & Integrated Soil Fertil Management Pro, POB 5016, Huye, Rwanda; [Dimobe, Kangbeni] Univ Joseph Ki Zerbo, Lab Plant Biol & Ecol, UFR SVT, 03 BP 7021, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Dimobe, Kangbeni] Univ Dedougou, Inst Environm Sci & Rural Dev ISEDR, BP 176, Dedougou, Burkina Faso; [Oborn, Ingrid] World Agroforestry ICRAF, POB 30677-00100, Nairobi, Kenya",Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture & Technology; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Mohammed VI Polytechnic University; International Centre of Insect Physiology & Ecology (ICIPE); CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF),"Kuyah, S (corresponding author), Jomo Kenyatta Univ Agr & Technol JKUAT, Dept Bot, POB 62000-00200, Nairobi, Kenya.;Kuyah, S (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, POB 7043, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",kuyashem@gmail.com; sileshigw@gmail.com; libere.nkurunziza@slu.se; Ngonidzashe.Chirinda@um6p.ma; pierrec.ndayisaba@gmail.com; kangbenidimobe@gmail.com; Ingrid.Oborn@slu.se,"Dimobe, Kangbeni/AFP-4490-2022; Kuyah, Shem/G-6862-2015","Dimobe, Kangbeni/0000-0001-5536-9700; Ndayisaba, Pierre Celestin/0000-0002-8400-9146; Chirinda, Ngonidzashe/0000-0002-4213-6294; Kuyah, Shem/0000-0001-7692-585X",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,Open access funding provided by Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.,,155,20,20,11,46,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1774-0746,1773-0155,,AGRON SUSTAIN DEV,Agron.

This study proposes an integrated approach to assess how climate change might affect bridge performance under multihazard conditions involving floods and earthquakes. The approach is used for an existing bridge spanning over the San Joaquin River, California. The multihazard impact considering climate change is evaluated in terms of risk and resilience of the bridge. Future flood projections under climate change are obtained from general circulation model simulations in conjunction with a macroscale hydrological model. Enhanced intensities of future design floods are observed to cause higher expected scour at around bridge piers. This resulted in significant rise in risk (-21%) and drop in resilience (-14%) of the bridge, when compared to no climate change scenario, at a specific seismic hazard level. To reduce possible consequences, ripraps are applied around piers as a climate change adaptation measure.

These risks are quite uncertain depending on several factors. In this article, we estimate potential economic damage in 62 Iberian coastal cities from 2020 to 2100 using regional relative sea-level rise data under three representative concentration pathways (RCP 8.5, RCP 4.5 and RCP 2.6). We analyze the expected accumulated damage costs if no adaptation actions take place and compare this scenario to the investment cost of some adaptation strategies being implemented. The results show that some adaptation strategies are less costly than the potential damage under inaction. In other words, it is economically rational to invest in adaptation even in a context of high uncertainty. These calculations are very relevant to inform climate change adaptation decisions and to better manage the risk posed by sea-level rise. Moreover, our findings show the importance of a good understanding of the shape of the sea-level rise and damage cost distributions to calculate the expected damage. We show that using the 50th percentile for these calculations is not adequate as it leads to a serious underestimation of expected damage and coastal risk.","[Maria Abadie, Luis; Sainz de Murieta, Elisa; Galarraga, Ibon] Univ Basque Country, BC3 Basque Ctr Climate Change, Sede Bldg 1,1st Floor,Sci Campus, Leioa 48940, Spain; [Sainz de Murieta, Elisa] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst, London WC2A 2AZ, England",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); University of Basque Country; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"de Murieta, ES (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, BC3 Basque Ctr Climate Change, Sede Bldg 1,1st Floor,Sci Campus, Leioa 48940, Spain.;de Murieta, ES (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst, London WC2A 2AZ, England.",lm.abadie@bc3research.org; elisa.sainzdemurieta@bc3research.org; ibon.galarraga@bc3research.org,"; Sainz de Murieta, Elisa/D-4946-2012","Abadie, Luis M./0000-0002-2254-6800; Sainz de Murieta, Elisa/0000-0001-8120-3392",Basque Government through the BERC 2018-2021 program; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO through BC3 Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation [MDM-2017-0714]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2015-68023]; Basque Government [POS_2018_2_0027]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [776479],"Basque Government through the BERC 2018-2021 program(Basque Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO through BC3 Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); Basque Government(Basque Government); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme","This research is supported by the Basque Government through the BERC 2018-2021 program and by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO through BC3 Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation MDM-2017-0714.

Ecological systems are often complex and span several issues that are not integrated in the social governance system. In order to increase the fit between social and ecological systems, understanding factors that promote the integration of interdependent issues is crucial. In this paper, we consider 11 issues related to flood risk management, e.g., technical flood protection and habitat loss, which are typically addressed in different policy sectors but exhibit ecological, functional, or geographical interdependencies. We analyze two bases for issue integration: a) political actors connecting issues and, b) the legal framework cross-referencing issues. We propose a network method for systematic comparisons between issue integration based on actors and integration based on laws. For the case of Swiss flood risk management, we find that actor- and law-based issue integration co-vary and might be self-reinforcing. We further find that issue integration mostly rests on laws, although cases exist where actors are the main basis of integration. Results promote our understanding of potential bases for the integration of policy issues, thereby contributing knowledge about adaptive governance capacities in social-ecological systems that buffer the effects of climate change.","[Metz, Florence] Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, Nat Resource Policy Grp, Univ Str 22, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Metz, Florence] Univ Bern, Inst Polit Sci, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Angst, Mario; Fischer, Manuel] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol Eawag, Environm Social Sci Dept, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Bern; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG),"Metz, F (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, Nat Resource Policy Grp, Inst Environm Decis, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Univ Str 22, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",florence.metz@usys.ethz.ch,"Angst, Mario/ABG-9891-2020; Angst, Mario/HKO-1157-2023","Angst, Mario/0000-0002-8297-9827; Metz, Florence/0000-0002-8855-0271; Fischer, Manuel/0000-0003-3065-0891",Swiss National Science Foundation [149410],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation [grant number 149410].,,102,29,29,1,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

This project proposes an optimisation of scour protections by combining reliability-based techniques with the novel concepts of dynamic and wide-graded armour layers. The ultimate goal is to develop a decision support system (DSS) for scour protection design and risk and reliability analysis to be used by professionals and researchers dealing with fixed foundations applied to marine renewable energy projects (e.g. wind, wave and tidal). However, a meaningful implementation of such a DSS implies prior analysis of several knowledge gaps related to scour protection in the offshore environment, which are yet to be fully addressed in the literature. This paper provides a brief review of the scientific and technical challenges in the research field of reliability of offshore scour protection. On the basis of identified challenges, the discussion of future research lines is performed with a particular focus on the aim of the Oracle project. The recent findings related to risk and reliability analysis of offshore scour protection are addressed and framed within the existing knowledge gaps in the literature.","[Fazeres-Ferradosa, Tiago; Taveira-Pinto, Francisco; Rosa-Santos, Paulo; Chambel, Joao] Univ Porto, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Hydraul Water Resources & Environm Div,Marine Ene, Porto, Portugal; [Fazeres-Ferradosa, Tiago; Taveira-Pinto, Francisco; Rosa-Santos, Paulo] CIIMAR Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Re, Porto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Fazeres-Ferradosa, T (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Hydraul Water Resources & Environm Div,Marine Ene, Porto, Portugal.;Fazeres-Ferradosa, T (corresponding author), CIIMAR Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Re, Porto, Portugal.",tferradosa@fe.up.pt,"Santos, Paulo Jorge Rosa/B-5351-2019; Taveira-Pinto, Francisco/AAB-7090-2020; Ferradosa, Tiago João Fazeres/AAC-2360-2019; Pinto, Francisco T/J-8714-2015","Santos, Paulo Jorge Rosa/0000-0002-3768-3314; Taveira-Pinto, Francisco/0000-0003-4337-8428; Ferradosa, Tiago João Fazeres/0000-0002-8549-3320; Pinto, Francisco T/0000-0003-4337-8428; Chambel, Joao/0000-0002-7314-4959","European Fund for Regional Development (FEDER), through the COMPETE2020 [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-032170]; Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao (POCI); FCT/MCTES through national funds (PIDDAC)","European Fund for Regional Development (FEDER), through the COMPETE2020; Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao (POCI); FCT/MCTES through national funds (PIDDAC)","This work is supported by the project POCI-01-0145-FEDER-032170 (Oracle project), funded by the European Fund for Regional Development (FEDER), through the COMPETE2020, the Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao (POCI) and FCT/MCTES through national funds (PIDDAC).

Monitoring data from five full-scale Scottish drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) showed that significant correlations exist between conditionally carcinogenic trihalomethanes (THMs) levels, water temperature (r = 0.812, p = 0.0013) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (r = 0.892, p < 0.0001), respectively. The strong seasonality of these parameters demonstrated how climate can influence THMs formation. We quantified with laboratory experiments the sensitivity of THMs formation to changes in water temperature and DOC concentration. The laboratory data accurately reproduced real-world THM formation in the DWTPs. We then combined these validated relationships with information from the literature about future trends in mean summer temperatures and surface water DOC in the British Isles, to estimate future global warming impacts on THMs formation in DWTPs that use chlorine for disinfection. An increase in mean summer temperatures will likely increase THM formation, with a 1.8 degrees C temperature increase and 39% THMs increase by 2050 representing our mid-range scenario. Such an increase has major implications to potable water around the world, either an increased health risk or increased water treatment costs to maintain an equivalent quality potable supply.","[Valdivia-Garcia, Maria; Graham, David W.; Werner, David] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Valdivia-Garcia, Maria; Weir, Paul] Scottish Water, Castle House, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Newcastle University - UK,"Werner, D (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",david.werner@ncl.ac.uk,,"Graham, David W/0000-0002-9753-496X",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (United Kingdom) [EP/G037094/1]; Scottish Water,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (United Kingdom)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Scottish Water,This work was fully supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (United Kingdom) Grant EP/G037094/1 and Scottish Water.,,26,20,20,6,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,JUL 10,2019,9,,,,,,,,9967,10.1038/s41598-019-46238-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46238-0,,,10,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,IH8CE,31292461,"Green Published, gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000474731500010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Resilience to these hazards has become a growing theme in sustainable design and the current global discourse on climate change adaptation. Coping with the challenges of earth's ever-shifting climate contextualizes the importance of resilience in sustainable development. To achieve greater resilience at a minimum environmental cost, the literature suggests developing a coherent sustainability and resilience framework. This review discusses the definition of sustainability and resilience and the relationship between the two concepts in order to examine the possibility of establishing such a combined framework. Studying the relationship between the sustainability and resilience points to some similarities between the two paradigms but also highlights key differences that may impede their integration. Most existing studies advocate the incorporation of resilience indicators into sustainability metrics and believe it to be technically possible. The major finding of this review is that the integration process requires developing a new combined assessment tool or a thorough refinement of current sustainability frameworks to include resilience indicators that were not initially included. For such a unified framework to be established successfully, the active involvement of different stakeholders in all stages is necessary.","[Roostaie, S.; Nawari, N.] Univ Florida, UF Sch Architecture, Coll Design Construct & Planning, POB 115702,1480 Inner Rd, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Kibert, C.

Here, we present evidence that the warming observed in recent decades has been accompanied by increased snow avalanche frequency in the Western Indian Himalayas. Using dendrogeomorphic techniques, we reconstruct the longest time series (150 y) of the occurrence and runout distances of snow avalanches that is currently available for the Himalayas. We apply a generalized linear autoregressive moving average model to demonstrate linkages between climate warming and the observed increase in the incidence of snow avalanches. Warming air temperatures in winter and early spring have indeed favored the wetting of snow and the formation of wet snow avalanches, which are now able to reach down to subalpine slopes, where they have high potential to cause damage. These findings contradict the intuitive notion that warming results in less snow, and thus lower avalanche activity, and have major implications for the Western Himalayan region, an area where human pressure is constantly increasing. Specifically, increasing traffic on a steadily expanding road network is calling for an immediate design of risk mitigation strategies and disaster risk policies to enhance climate change adaption in the wider study region.","[Ballesteros-Canovas, J.

This paper stands in this tradition. It reports on findings derived from a nationwide survey of perceptions of and reactions to extreme weather events and interviews conducted with inhabitants of three islands in the coastal region of North Frisia (Germany). Coastal dwellers understand climate change through the lens of local and regional experiences of meteorological phenomena, seasonal changes, knowledge of the sea, and changes in local flora and fauna. Our detailed ecolinguistic analysis revealed six prevailing conceptual metaphors: Climate change is an enemy, preventing climate change is fight/war, climate change is punishment for human sins, climate change is overheating/heat, climate change is hot air/hoax and climate change is eco-dictatorship. These metaphors were used to make sense of climate change at the regional level and provide insights into place-based social and cultural conceptualisations of climate change. An understanding of these meanings should feed into developing more grounded climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in coastal regions.","[Doering, Martin; Ratter, Beate] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Doering, Martin] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany",University of Hamburg; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; Max Planck Society,"Doring, M (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.;Doring, M (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany.",Doering@metaphorik.de,"Ratter, Beate M.W./AAT-3840-2020","Ratter, Beate M.W./0000-0001-6647-4100",Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM (Regional Climate Change),Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM (Regional Climate Change),This research has been financed by the Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM (Regional Climate Change) and was conducted within the working group 7 'Risk analysis and risk management for integrated climate strategies'.

This study deals with climate change adaptation and its costs-benefits with an empirical analysis optimizing food security related adaptation strategy over a 50-year time frame. An Empirical Dynamic Commutable General Equilibrium Model for Climate and the Economy (EDCGECE) is applied to describe the potential effects of climate change on food security and examine the implications of future strategies for Malaysia. Specifically, this study considers the potential effects of climate change on food security and explores the prioritizing of mitigation options. Different scenarios show a baseline scenario without adaptation action followed by introduction of adaptation actions. The analysis reveals important contrasts from baseline to future options over time. The results indicate that food sustainability gap in Malaysia is about 30-35% below the national targets in 2015 (baseline) and the gap is rising over time due to climatic effects in agriculture. However, applying different levels of adaptation actions, (e.g. 5-20%) food security gaps are reduced over time considerably. The projected adaptation strategies applied in this study would be effective and helpful to support sustainable food security related strategies in Malaysia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Mosquito control information was collected through a survey of the responsible agencies (local governments), and RRV disease notification data were provided by the Queensland state health authority. The study developed a typology of mosquito control programs, based on the approaches used. Based on the analysis of data on RRV disease rates between mosquito control types within 4 climatic regions, each region had different combinations of mosquito control strategies in their programs; there were also general similarities in the relationship between program types and RRV rates between the regions. The long-term RRV disease rates were lower in areas where the mosquito control program included pre-emptive (rather than reactive) surveillance based on an extensive (rather than incomplete) knowledge of mosquito habitats, and where treatment of both saltwater and freshwater habitats (compared to only saltwater habitats, in coastal areas) occurred. The data indicate that mosquito control is an effective public health intervention to reduce mosquito-borne disease; hence, climate change adaptation strategies should ensure that adequate resources are available for effective vector control so as to manage the risk of mosquito-borne diseases.","[Tomerini, Deanna M.; Sipe, Neil] Griffith Univ, Urban Res Program, Griffith Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Dale, Pat E.] Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Ctr, Australian River Inst, Griffith Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University,"Tomerini, DM (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Urban Res Program, Griffith Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",,"Sipe, Neil G./A-4052-2009","Sipe, Neil G./0000-0002-3228-3768",Australian Research Council; Queensland Health [LP0211583],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Queensland Health,We acknowledge funding and in-kind support from the Australian Research Council and Queensland Health (Project LP0211583).

Local health impacts depend on a large number of factors including specific regional climate impacts, demographics and human vulnerabilities, and existing local adaptation capacity. There is a need to incorporate local data and concerns into climate adaptation plans and evaluate different approaches. Recent Findings The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided funding, technical assistance, and an adaptation framework to assist localities with climate planning and activities. The differing processes with which states, cities, and tribes develop and implement adaptation plans have been observed. We outline examples of the implementation of CDC's framework and activities for local adaptation, with a focus on case studies at differing jurisdictional levels (a state, a city, and a sovereign tribe). The use of local considerations and data are important to inform climate adaptation. The adaptable implementation of CDC's framework is helping communities protect health.","[Schramm, Paul J.; Svendsen, Erik] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Climate & Hlth Program, MS S106-6,4770 Buford Hwy, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA; [Ahmed, Munerah; Siegel, Hannah] New York City Dept Hlth & Mental Hyg, New York, NY USA; [Donatuto, Jamie; Campbell, Larry] Swinomish Indian Tribal Community, La Conner, WA USA; [Raab, Kristin] Minnesota Dept Hlth, St Paul, MN USA",Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene; Minnesota Department of Health (MHD),"Schramm, PJ (corresponding author), Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Climate & Hlth Program, MS S106-6,4770 Buford Hwy, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA.",pschramm@cdc.gov,"Svendsen, Erik/J-2671-2015","Svendsen, Erik/0000-0003-3941-0907",,,,,47,4,4,3,11,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2196-5412,,CURR ENV HLTH REP,Curr..

However, despite increasing awareness of social networks, there is very limited evidence for their application in relation to climate policy. This study fills this gap by assessing the potential of social networks for engaging local communities in climate adaptation policy, drawing on a case study of the Shoalhaven region in Australia. Participants from key representative groups were recruited using a purposive snowball sampling technique (N=24). By mapping knowledge acquisition and diffusion networks in relation to climate adaption at the local scale, this study identified key nodes within the networks. Findings demonstrate that although climate adaptation information was acquired from a diverse range of sources, the sharing knowledge networks were far more dispersed. Furthermore, although 165 knowledge sources were identified, three nodes had coverage cross the entire network, and as such acted as boundary spanners within the sharing network. This research demonstrates the utility of social network analysis to reveal the underlying knowledge networks and structures that influence community engagement pathways and in doing so outlines key implications in relation to engaging local communities in climate policy and action.Policy relevanceThe rapid development of adaptation as a mainstream strategy for managing the risks of climate change has resulted in the emergence of a broad range of adaptation policies and management strategies globally. However, the success of these initiatives is largely dependent on their acceptance and uptake by local communities, which to date remains a significant challenge. Accordingly, policy makers require novel approaches to overcome barriers to community engagement so as to enhance the likely success of community engagement pathways. This article demonstrates the value of using social network analysis to reveal the underlying knowledge network structures. This approach makes it possible to identify key individuals within a community who can disseminate adaptation information quickly across broad geographic ranges. By utilizing this approach, policy makers globally will be able to increase the extent to which adaption initiatives are accepted and adhered to by local communities, thus increasing their success.","[Cunningham, Rebecca; Dowd, Anne-Maree] CSIRO, Land & Water, 1 Technology Court, Pullenvale, Qld 4069, Australia; [Cunningham, Rebecca] Univ Manchester, Tyndall Manchester Climate Change Res, Pariser Bldg, Manchester M1 4PL, Lancs, England; [Cvitanovic, Christopher] CSIRO, Climate Adaptat Flagship, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Cvitanovic, Christopher] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia; [Measham, Thomas] CSIRO, Climate Adaptat Flagship, GPO Box 1600, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Jacobs, Brent] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Jacobs, Brent] Univ Technol Sydney, Bldg 10 235 Jones St, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Harman, Ben] CSIRO, Land & Water, GPO Box 2583, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Manchester; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Australian National University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Technology Sydney; University of Technology Sydney; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Cunningham, R (corresponding author), CSIRO, Land & Water, 1 Technology Court, Pullenvale, Qld 4069, Australia.;Cunningham, R (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Tyndall Manchester Climate Change Res, Pariser Bldg, Manchester M1 4PL, Lancs, England.",rebecca.cunningham@manchester.ac.uk,"Harman, Ben P/C-7171-2011; Measham, Tom/A-5210-2010; Cunningham, Rebecca/AAQ-7340-2020; Jacobs, Brent/K-2523-2012","Measham, Tom/0000-0003-4549-5361; Cunningham, Rebecca/0000-0001-8066-9019; Jacobs, Brent/0000-0003-3147-341X; Cvitanovic, Christopher/0000-0002-2565-3396",NSW Office of Environment and Heritage,NSW Office of Environment and Heritage,"We thank Steve Crimp, Mark Howden, Craig James, Natasha Kuruppu and Christopher Lee for helpful discussions in designing this project.

Quantifying how well Nature-based Solutions can offset anthropogenic climate change impacts is important for adaptation planning, but has rarely been done. Here we show that a widely-applied Nature-based Solution in South Africa - invasive alien tree clearing - reduces the impact of anthropogenic climate change on drought streamflow. Using a multi-model joint-attribution of climate and landscape-vegetation states during the 2015-2017 Cape Town Day Zero drought, we find that anthropogenic climate change reduced streamflow by 12-29% relative to a counterfactual world with anthropogenic emissions removed. This impact on streamflow was larger than corresponding reductions in rainfall (7-15%) and reference evapotranspiration (1.7-2%). Clearing invasive alien trees could have ameliorated streamflow reductions by 3-16% points for moderate invasions levels. Preventing further invasive alien tree spread avoided potential additional reductions of 10-27% points. Total clearing could not have offset the anthropogenic climate change impact completely. Invasive alien tree clearing is an important form of catchment restoration for managing changing hydroclimatic risk, but will need to be combined with other adaptation options as climate change accelerates.","[Holden, Petra B.; Odoulami, Romaric C.; Lawal, Kamoru A.; Kimutai, Joyce; Nkemelang, Tiro; New, Mark G.] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa; [Rebelo, Alanna J.] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Conservat Ecol & Entomol, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Wolski, Piotr] Univ Cape Town, Climate Syst Anal Grp, Cape Town, South Africa; [Kimutai, Joyce] Kenya Meteorol Dept, Nairobi, Kenya; [New, Mark G.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town; Stellenbosch University; University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Holden, PB (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa.",petra.holden@uct.ac.za,"New, Mark/A-7684-2008; Rebelo, Alanna Jane/CAE-9912-2022; Holden, Petra/AAQ-3951-2021; Nkemelang, Tiro/AAX-6682-2021","New, Mark/0000-0001-6082-8879; Holden, Petra/0000-0002-3047-1407; Odoulami, Romaric/0000-0001-8228-1608; Wolski, Piotr/0000-0002-6120-6593; Rebelo, Alanna/0000-0002-7544-9895; Nkemelang, Tiro/0000-0002-9588-7382; Lawal, Kamoru Abiodun/0000-0002-8198-8844","AXA Research Fund, through the AXA Research Chair in African Climate Risk; Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) [17-M07-KU]; BNP Paribas Foundation Climate Initiative; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","AXA Research Fund, through the AXA Research Chair in African Climate Risk(AXA Research Fund); Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA); BNP Paribas Foundation Climate Initiative; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","We are grateful for funding for this research from the AXA Research Fund, through the AXA Research Chair in African Climate Risk, the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) [grant number 17-M07-KU], and the BNP Paribas Foundation Climate Initiative.

Vulnerability is understood as having various meanings ranging from direct disaster damage to indirect factors that affect damage, such as exposure, susceptibility, and adaptation. As no universal definition of vulnerability exists, the concept has become diversified, which has led to considerable confusion and contention among scholars. Accordingly, this study conducts a bibliometric analysis to investigate the historical changes in disaster risk management?s vulnerability concept and its related fields between 2000 and 2019. This work collected bibliographic data by searching for disaster-related publications with the keyword vulnerability through an online database. The topic networks were constructed by using collected bibliographic data to identify research trends of vulnerability-related studies. This study found that the number of vulnerability-related publications increased rapidly from 2010. Among the various topics, climate change, adaptation, and resilience have become important research subjects in vulnerability-related studies, while topics related to structural mitigation had received less attention regarding the number of publications by the mid-2010s. These spotlighted topics shifted toward adaptation and resilience following international agreements. The proposed method can help an efficient understanding of the research trends in vulnerability-related studies. The analyzed trend is expected to provide scholars in this domain with a better insight into vulnerability studies.","[Kim, Byeong Je; Chung, Ji-Bum] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol UNIST, Sch Urban & Environm Engn, Ulsan, South Korea; [Jeong, Seunghoo] Korea Railrd Res Inst, Adv Railrd Civil Engn Div, Uiwang, South Korea",Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST); Korea Railroad Research Institute (KRRI),"Chung, JB (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol UNIST, Sch Urban & Environm Engn, Ulsan, South Korea.",learning@unist.ac.kr,"Chung, Ji-Bum/AAH-7479-2021","Chung, Ji-Bum/0000-0003-2388-9917; Kim, Byeong Je/0000-0002-9149-0708; Jeong, Seunghoo/0000-0003-2594-3710",Korea Statistics Research Institute; Fundamental Technology Development Program for Extreme Disaster Response - Ministry of Interior and Safety (MOST) [2020-MOIS31-013]; National Research Council of Science & Technology (NST) grant by the Korea government (MSIT) [CCL-2020-04-KRRI],"Korea Statistics Research Institute; Fundamental Technology Development Program for Extreme Disaster Response - Ministry of Interior and Safety (MOST); National Research Council of Science & Technology (NST) grant by the Korea government (MSIT)(Ministry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of KoreaNational Research Council of Science & Technology (NST), Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by the Korea Statistics Research Institute, the Fundamental Technology Development Program for Extreme Disaster Response funded by Ministry of Interior and Safety (MOST) (Grant No. 2020-MOIS31-013) and the National Research Council of Science & Technology (NST) grant by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. CCL-2020-04-KRRI).",,74,10,10,2,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

Therefore, understanding the local circumstances of climate change is vital to exert context specific responses to allay its adverse effects. This study hence assessed small holder farmers' perception and response mechanisms to climate change and their determinants in Tekeze lowland goat and sorghum livelihood zone, Northeast Ethiopia. Data collected from 260 sample respondents were analyzed in descriptive statistics and econometric model. Results revealed that 86.5% of the respondents observed changes in main climatic patterns, whereas 92.3% of them recognized variability in daily weather. Indeed, 76.8% and 83.5% of respondents perceived a rising temperature and decreasing rainfall, respectively. This finding is in line with the regression results of meteorological data recorded for 20 study years in the area. Among respondents who perceived the climate change, nearly two-third were responded through crop, livestock and nonagriculture-based livelihood initiatives. The probit model also discovered that educational status, farm/nonfarm income, extension contact, access to climate information and training were significant factors behind farmers' response decision. As a result, future development interventions should provide prominent training and extension, local meteorological service and agricultural inputs on top of creating nonagricultural income generating opportunities, would play significant role in climate change adaptation.","[Mihiretu, Ademe; Okoyo, Eric Ndemo; Lemma, Tesfaye] Sekota Dryland Agr Res Ctr, Socioecon & Agr Extens, Sekota, Ethiopia",,"Mihiretu, A (corresponding author), POB 62, Sekota, Ethiopia.",ademe_78@yahoo.com.sg; ndemoerick100@gmail.com; t.lemma41@yahoo.com,"Tefera, Tesfaye Lemma/HGB-0540-2022; mihiretu, ademe/AHD-3473-2022","mihiretu, ademe/0000-0002-2861-5694",,,,,34,5,5,1,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1932,,,COGENT FOOD AGR,Cogent Food Agr.,MAY 12,2020,6,1,,,,,,,1763647,10.1080/23311932.2020.1763647,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2020.1763647,,,23,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,LR8TO,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000535969600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For decades the region has been ripe with political controversies stemming from conflicting interests over its natural resources which all depend on the protection of approximately 1800 km of earthen levees that surround over 60 islands, some of which are below sea level and two-thirds of which are privately owned. This study uses the Q methodology to explore the discourses of the broad range of stakeholders, including farmers, land- and water-based recreation enthusiasts, water exporters, utilities, environmentalists, and government agencies, about flood risk and flood management in the Delta. The results of this study reveal five distinct views regarding the risk of submersion of one or more islands due to either overtopping during high waters or structural levee failures. The findings of this study also elucidate nuanced narratives on the viability of anticipatory climate change adaptation in the Delta. Proximity, sense of vulnerability, values, trust, and views of climate change are the underlying factors in these perspectives. The perspectives identified suggest that resolving decades of distrust among stakeholder groups will remain difficult; however, taking a cultural approach to understanding perspectives may provide an opportunity to open up the conversations to adaptation approaches, and thus fulfill the legal mandate to protect the Delta as an evolving place.","[Rittelmeyer, Pam] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Rittelmeyer, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",prittelm@ucsc.edu,"Rittelmeyer, Pam/AHD-8191-2022","Rittelmeyer, Pam/0000-0002-1729-6886","Delta Science Fellowship - Delta Stewardship Council Delta Science Program [R/SF-86, 1167]",Delta Science Fellowship - Delta Stewardship Council Delta Science Program,"I am indebted to all of the research participants for their time and effort to participate in this study.

With increasing flood risk, it is becoming more important to be able to assess the costs and benefits of adaptation strategies. To guide the design of such strategies, policy makers need tools to prioritize where adaptation is needed and how much adaptation funds are required. In this country-scale study, we show how flood risk analyses can be used in cost-benefit analyses to prioritize investments in flood adaptation strategies in Mexico under future climate scenarios. Moreover, given the often limited availability of detailed local data for such analyses, we show how state-of-the-art global data and flood risk assessment models can be applied for a detailed assessment of optimal flood-protection strategies. Our results show that especially states along the Gulf of Mexico have considerable economic benefits from investments in adaptation that limit risks from both river and coastal floods, and that increased flood-protection standards are economically beneficial for many Mexican states. We discuss the sensitivity of our results to modelling uncertainties, the transferability of our modelling approach and policy implications.

The fire weather index (FWI) system calculated from daily outputs of a regional climate model with a horizontal resolution of 50x50km was used to assess fire danger. Temperature and precipitation demonstrated a gradually increasing trend for the future. Forest fire statistics for 1987-2011 revealed that the FWI, initial spread index and seasonal severity rating were significantly related to the number of forest fires between 100 and 1000ha in size. Over three future periods, the FWI component indices will increase greatly. The mean FWI value will increase by 0.83-1.85, 1.83-2.91 and 3.33-3.97 in the periods 2011-2040, 2041-2070 and 2071-2100. The regions with predicted FWI increases are mainly in central and south-eastern China. The fire season (including days with high, very high and extreme fire danger ratings) will be prolonged by 9-13, 18-21 and 28-31 days over these periods. This fire season extension will mainly be due to days with an extreme fire danger rating. Considering predicted future changes in the forest fire danger rating and the fire season, it is suggested that climate change adaptation measures be implemented.","[Tian, Xiao-rui; Zhao, Feng-jun; Shu, Li-fu; Wang, Ming-yu] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, State Forestry Adm, Key Open Lab Forest Protect, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Forestry; Research Institute of Forest Ecology, Environment and Protection, CAF","Shu, LF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, State Forestry Adm, Key Open Lab Forest Protect, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.",shulf@caf.ac.cn,"Tian, Xiaorui/AAX-4197-2021; Tian, Xiaorui/AFD-8268-2022","Tian, Xiaorui/0000-0002-8138-2594; ",National Science and Technology Support Plan [2012BAC19B02]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31270695],National Science and Technology Support Plan; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was financially supported by the National Science and Technology Support Plan (2012BAC19B02) and Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31270695).,,49,20,23,7,55,CSIRO PUBLISHING,COLLINGWOOD,"150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD, VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA",1049-8001,1448-5516,,INT J WILDLAND FIRE,Int.

This paper explores the role of mass media coverage as a potential obstacle or enhancing factor in relation to this mainstreaming of climate policies. The paper presents a quantitative content analysis of the national-level press coverage of climate change from 1990 to 2010, focusing on Finland. The empirical results indicate four major phases of Finnish media coverage of climate change: a definition phase before the Kyoto meeting in 1997, a maturation phase after the Kyoto meeting, climate hype in 2006-2008, and a phase of levelling off that started in late 2008. The results suggest that climate issues have widely permeated various fields of newspaper coverage. This broad-based debate may create and sustain a public agenda potentially favourable to attempts to bring climate policies into the mainstream of other policy domains. However, it also may open doors for unexpected initiatives by various activists and lobbyists that employ climate concern as a tool to advance other interests. The role of mass media has received little attention in studies focusing on the mainstreaming of climate policies. This paper highlights the importance of taking media coverage into account as a key factor in the formulation and implementation of environmental policies aimed at broad-based actions.","Finnish Environm Inst, Helsinki, Finland",Finnish Environment Institute,"Lyytimaki, J (corresponding author), Finnish Environm Inst, Helsinki, Finland.",jari.lyytimaki@ymparisto.fi,"Lyytimäki, Jari/C-8688-2013","Lyytimäki, Jari/0000-0003-3308-5234",Academy of Finland [128307]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [128307] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Academy of FinlandFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES)),"The author warmly thanks Per Mickwitz, Petri Tapio and two anonymous referees for the comments on the manuscript.

Understanding the observed parameters of the changing climate and the farmers' perceptions of it, together with their coping approaches, is an important asset to making farming communities resilient. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the observed change in climatic variables; understand farmers' perceptions of the changing climate; and document their adaptation approaches in farming systems in the mid-hills of the central Himalayas. Data on the observed change in climatic variables were obtained from the nearby meteorological stations and gridded regional products, and farmers' perceptions and their adaptation practices were collected from household surveys and from the interviews of key informants. The analysis of temperature data revealed that there has been a clear warming trend. Winter temperatures are increasing faster than summer and annual temperatures, indicating a narrowing temperature range. Results on precipitation did not show a clear trend but exhibited large inter-annual variability. The standardized precipitation index (SPI) showed an increased frequency of droughts in recent years. Farmers' perceptions of the changing climate are coherent with the observed changes in climatic parameters. These changes may have a substantial impact on agriculture and the livelihood of the people in the study area. The farmers are adapting to climate change by altering their farming systems and practices. Location-specific adaptation approaches used by farmers are valuable assets for community resilience.","[Dahal, Khem Raj] Tribhuvan Univ, Inst Agr & Anim Sci, Dept Agron, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal; [Dahal, Piyush; Bista, Niranjan] Small Earth Nepal, Kathmandu 20533, Nepal; [Adhikari, Raj Kumar] UNDP, Value Chain Dev Fruit & Vegetables Project, Lalitpur 44700, Nepal; [Naukkarinen, Veera; Helenius, Juha] Univ Helsinki, Rural Inst, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Panday, Dinesh] Rodale Inst, Kutztown, PA 19530 USA; [Marambe, Buddhi] Univ Peradeniya, Fac Agr, Kandy 20400, Sri Lanka",Tribhuvan University; Institute of Agriculture & Animal Science (IAAS) - Nepal; University of Helsinki; University of Peradeniya,"Panday, D (corresponding author), Rodale Inst, Kutztown, PA 19530 USA.",dinesh.panday@huskers.unl.edu,,"Helenius, Juha/0000-0001-6933-404X; Adhikari, Raj/0000-0003-3736-8688",,,,,102,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,JAN,2023,11,1,,,,,,,11,10.3390/cli11010011,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli11010011,,,22,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,7Y0HE,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000914570900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Real-time measurements of aerosol light absorption were continuously obtained using an aethalometer while the Aethalometer model source apportionment data, optimized by using levoglucosan measurements, were evaluated against the modelling results of the LOTOS-EUROS chemical transport model. The measured mean equivalent BC mass concentration of 0.57 +/- 0.64 mu g m(-3) was the lowest observed in the Mediterranean region. BC from fossil fuel (BCff) dominated the area throughout the study period with a maximum in winter and elevated levels by the approaching summer tourist season. Diel variability of BC concentrations from biomass burning (BCbb) was observed during stable winter conditions, with clear morning and evening concentration peaks, consistent with the profile of residential heating by wood burning. Up to 88% of BC concentrations were attributed to European emission sectors, with stationary source combustion, transportation, shipping and agriculture sectors being the most influential contributors. Source apportionment of BC highlighted that, in addition to biomass burning, small combustion fossil fuel sources, including land traffic and shipping, should be more strictly controlled in order to limit BC pollution in Mediterranean coastal areas. This study serves as a basis of comparison for future studies addressing air quality and pollution source apportionment in the Adriatic and/or the Mediterranean coastal regions in efforts of mitigation and adaptation to climate change.","[Milinkovic, Andrea; Penezic, Abra; Kusan, Ana Cvitesic; Alempijevic, Saranda Bakija; Frka, Sanja] Rudjer Boskovic Inst, Div Marine & Environm Res, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Gregoric, Asta] Aerosol, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Gregoric, Asta] Univ Nova Gorica, Ctr Atmospher Res, Nova Gorica 5000, Slovenia; [Grgicin, Vedrana Dzaja; Vidic, Sonja] Croatian Meteorol & Hydrol Serv, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Kasper-Giebl, Anne] TU Wien, A-1040 Vienna, Austria",Rudjer Boskovic Institute; University of Nova Gorica; Technische Universitat Wien,"Frka, S (corresponding author), Rudjer Boskovic Inst, Div Marine & Environm Res, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",Andrea.Milinkovic@irb.hr; asta.gregoric@aerosol.eu; vedrana.dzaja@cirus.dhz.hr; sonja.vidic@cirus.dhz.hr; abra@irb.hr; Ana.Cvitesic.Kusan@irb.hr; Saranda.Bakija.Alempijevic@irb.hr; anneliese.kasper-giebl@tuwien.ac.at; frka@irb.hr,"Penezic, Abra/AAF-5880-2021; Vidic, Sonja/AAO-8892-2020","Penezic, Abra/0000-0003-1661-9767; Vidic, Sonja/0000-0002-1711-3314; Milinkovic, Andrea/0000-0002-3328-8368; Dzaja Grgicin, Vedrana/0000-0002-0318-2677; Frka, Sanja/0000-0002-9018-6165",Croatian Science Foundation [IP-2018-01-3105]; COST Action [CA16109 COLOSSAL],Croatian Science Foundation; COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),"This work has been supported by Croatian Science Foundation under the IP-2018-01-3105 project: Biochemical responses of oligotrophic Adriatic surface ecosystems to atmospheric deposition inputs (BIRE-ADI) .

Only 2.5% of all the water on Earth is freshwater and can be used to meet basic human needs such as a clean supply of water for drinking, cooking, and bathing. Water scarcity is the result of an imbalance between supply and demand. Efficient water resource management is definitely of interest to research and is a practical topic. At the same time, water-related disasters such as floods and droughts cause the loss of life and property. Disasters increase the difficulty of effective water resource management. An increase in climate extremes can also increase the risk of floods and droughts. This overview covers 150 peer-reviewed journal publications from the last twenty years focusing on risk-reduction strategies for floods and droughts. First, a definition and classification of flood and drought was introduced. Second, studies and techniques associated with risk reduction were grouped into three themes and discussed: prediction and warning; monitoring; and impact assessment, response, and management. As a result, many studies were solely focused on, and achieve excellence in, their own themes. Special attention was needed to find in these studies what can convert the adverse impacts such as flood water to positive outcomes such as drought relief. Multidisciplinary cooperation is necessary to achieve sustainability and to adapt to climate change. Finally, advanced techniques such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT) were foreseen to have a tremendous impact on future disaster risk reduction.","[Yang, Tsun-Hua] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu 30010, Taiwan; [Liu, Wen-Cheng] Natl United Univ, Dept Civil & Disaster Prevent Engn, Miaoli 36063, Taiwan",National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National United University,"Liu, WC (corresponding author), Natl United Univ, Dept Civil & Disaster Prevent Engn, Miaoli 36063, Taiwan.",tshyang@nctu.edu.tw; wcliu@nuu.edu.tw,"Liu, Wen-Cheng/ABG-4271-2020","Yang, TsunHua/0000-0002-1627-9208","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 108-2625-M-239-002, MOST 108-2625-M-009-004]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, grant numbers MOST 108-2625-M-239-002 and MOST 108-2625-M-009-004.",,148,20,20,6,38,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2020,12,7,,,,,,,2687,10.3390/su12072687,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12072687,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LL4WR,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000531558100112,View Full Record in Web of Science

Scenarios-based analyses are conducted with respect to Typhoon Vera, which caused the most severe storm surge in the recorded history of Japan in 1959. Four different hazard scenarios are chosen from a series of typhoon storm surge inundation simulations: Typhoon Vera's landfall with respect to the condition of the past seawall; Typhoon Vera's landfall with respect to the condition of the current seawall; intensifying Typhoon Vera, but retaining its original tracks; and intensifying Typhoon Vera, but choosing the worst tracks from various possible typhoon tracks. Our economic loss estimation takes advantage of fine geographical scale census and economic census data that enable us to understand the spatial distribution of property loss and business interruption loss as well as identify the most potentially affected areas and business sectors on a sub-city scale. By comparing the property loss and business interruption loss caused by different hazard scenarios, the effect of different seawalls is evaluated and the economic impact of future climate change is estimated. The results indicate that although the current seawall can considerably reduce the scale of losses, climate change can cause Ise Bay to experience more serious storm surge inundation. Moreover, the resulting economic losses would increase significantly owing to a combination of climate change and the worst track scenario. It is, therefore, necessary to consider more countermeasures to adapt to climate change in this area.","[Jiang, Xinyu; Mori, Nobuhito; Tatano, Hirokazu; Shibutani, Yoko] Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Uji, Kyoto 6110011, Japan; [Yang, Lijiao] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Informat, Uji, Kyoto 6110011, Japan",Kyoto University; Kyoto University,"Jiang, XY (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Uji, Kyoto 6110011, Japan.",jiang.xinyu.4u@kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Mori, Nobuhito/B-8627-2008","Mori, Nobuhito/0000-0001-9082-3235; Tatano, Hirokazu/0000-0001-7209-4358; Jiang, Xinyu/0000-0002-7831-3117","Precise Impact Assessments on Climate Change of the Program for Risk Information on Climate Change (SOUSEI Program) - Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology-Japan (MEXT); KAKENHI; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H04427, 25249070, 16H04428] Funding Source: KAKEN","Precise Impact Assessments on Climate Change of the Program for Risk Information on Climate Change (SOUSEI Program) - Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology-Japan (MEXT); KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported under the framework of the Precise Impact Assessments on Climate Change of the Program for Risk Information on Climate Change (SOUSEI Program) supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology-Japan (MEXT) and Grand-in-aid by KAKENHI.",,24,8,8,2,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

However, it is crucial to include an assessment of farmers' autonomous adaptation into the design and evaluation of rural policy measures. Amongst others, this helps avoid doubling efforts and ensure the effectiveness of the policies proposed. Moreover, farmers are the primary receivers of climate-proofing agricultural policies. Hence, to maximise a policy's success, it is fundamental to include farmers in its design phases. Farmers autonomously react to changes and policies should build on ongoing efforts. This work, carried out in the Veneto Region of Italy, proved the advantages of approaching adaptation as a continuum between autonomous and planned, rather than addressing the two separately. We first collected farmers' perceptions of and adaptations to change through an online questionnaire. We then identified the major determinants of their choice to adapt through a multinomial probit model. We analysed farmers' expectations of effectiveness of five different adaptation options for water conservation, via an ad-hoc online decision support system tool, mDSSweb. Our work provided policy makers with information on how different typologies of farmers are (not) adapting their practices to climate change. We clearly identified which groups of farmers the policies should target first and with what type of support. Both policy makers and farmers reacted positively to our approach and expressed interest in up-scaling it to become more inclusive.","[Bonzanigo, Laura; Giupponi, Carlo] Ctr Euromediterraneo Sui Cambiamenti Climatici, I-30140 Venice, Italy; [Bonzanigo, Laura; Bojovic, Dragana; Giupponi, Carlo] Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Dipartimento Econ, I-30121 Venice, Italy; [Maziotis, Alexandros] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, I-30140 Venice, Italy",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Fondazione Mattei,"Bonzanigo, L (corresponding author), Ctr Euromediterraneo Sui Cambiamenti Climatici, Isola San Giorgio Maggiore 8, I-30140 Venice, Italy.",laura.bonzanigo@cmcc.it; bagins@yahoo.it; alexandros.maziotis@feem.it; cgiupponi@unive.it,"Maziotis, Alexandros/AAB-5477-2020; Giupponi, Carlo/E-5895-2012","Maziotis, Alexandros/0000-0001-9817-1470; Giupponi, Carlo/0000-0001-5358-9208; BOJOVIC, Dragana/0000-0001-7354-1885",Veneto Region and its Environmental Agency (ARPAV); ICARUS project; Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA),Veneto Region and its Environmental Agency (ARPAV); ICARUS project; Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA),"The authors wish to acknowledge the support from the Veneto Region and its Environmental Agency (ARPAV).

In particular, we focus on the preparation and adoption of adaptation strategies and action plans by urban planners. For this purpose, we develop a two-tier framework of variables influencing decision-making. The framework emphasizes interaction between different commonly discussed categories of barriers (or opportunities) and their sources. We argue that whether or not urban planners take action to foster adaptation to climate change depends on three first-tier variables: information, resources, and incentives. In addition, we point out that each of these variables may itself be a function of a set of underlying second-tier variables, including actor-specific characteristics of the decision-maker, the institutional environment, and the natural and socio-economic environment. Within this framework, we specify barriers and opportunities for effective adaptation planning as hampering or promoting characteristics of these first- and second-tier variables. We apply and test the framework within the context of four case studies carried out in Lima (Peru), Santiago (Chile), Berlin and Sangerhausen (both Germany). We present anecdotal evidence, which we have gained from expert interviews in the cities. Our results indicate that the relevant categories of barriers are mainly the same across developing and developed countries. What differs is their severity. Moreover, we confirm the importance of the institutional context, including barriers and opportunities associated mainstreaming adaptation, multi-level governance and participation. Finally, our analysis reveals barriers that are specific for local or urban adaptation action, such as the strong dependency on the national regulatory framework.","[Lehmann, Paul; Brenck, Miriam; Gebhardt, Oliver] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Econ, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Schaller, Sven] DBFZ, Leipzig, Germany; [Suessbauer, Elisabeth] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Urban & Environm Sociol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Lehmann, P (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Econ, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",paul.lehmann@ufz.de,"Lehmann, Paul/F-8207-2013","Lehmann, Paul/0000-0001-7999-9125","programme  Research for the Sustainable Development of the Megacities of Tomorrow of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); Saxony-Anhalt State Ministry for Agriculture and the Environment (Miriam Brenck and Oliver Gebhardt); Climate Adaptation Santiago (CAS) by the International Climate Initiative of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU); Helmholtz Interdisciplinary Graduate School for Environmental Research (HIGRADE) by Helmholtz Impulse and Networking Fund","programme  Research for the Sustainable Development of the Megacities of Tomorrow of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Saxony-Anhalt State Ministry for Agriculture and the Environment (Miriam Brenck and Oliver Gebhardt); Climate Adaptation Santiago (CAS) by the International Climate Initiative of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU); Helmholtz Interdisciplinary Graduate School for Environmental Research (HIGRADE) by Helmholtz Impulse and Networking Fund","We are grateful for helpful and constructive comments provided by three anonymous referees.

A mixed-methods study found that people managing freshwater resources in Hawaii are highly educated and experienced in diverse professions, they perceive climate change as posing a worrisome risk, and they would like to be better informed about how to adapt to climate change. Decision makers with higher climate literacy seem to be more comfortable dealing with uncertain information. Those with lower climate literacy seem to be more trusting of climate information from familiar sources. Freshwater managers in Hawaii make a wide range of climate-sensitive decisions. These decisions can be characterized on several key dimensions including purpose (optimization and evaluation), time horizon (short term and long term), level of information uncertainty (known, uncertain, deeply uncertain, and completely unknown), and information type (quantitative and qualitative). The climate information most relevant to decision makers includes vulnerability assessments incorporating long-term projections about temperature, rainfall distribution, storms, sea level rise, and streamflow changes at an island or statewide scale. The main barriers to using available climate information include insufficient staff time to locate the information and the lack of a clear legal mandate to use the information. Overall, the results suggest that an integrated and systematic approach is needed to determine where and when uncertain climate information is useful and how a larger set of organizational and individual variables affect decision making.","[Finucane, Melissa L.; Miller, Rachel; Corlew, L.

Use of a systems perspective highlights trade-offs between activities aimed at increasing carbon storage in the ecosystem, increasing carbon storage in harvested wood products (HWPs), or increasing the substitution benefits of using wood in place of fossil fuels or more emissions-intensive products. A systems perspective also suggests that erroneous conclusions about mitigation potential could result if analyses assume that HWP carbon is emitted at harvest, or bioenergy is carbon neutral. The greatest short-run boreal mitigation benefit generally would be achieved by avoiding greenhouse gas emissions; but over the longer run, there could be significant potential in activities that increase carbon removals. Mitigation activities could maximize landscape carbon uptake or maximize landscape carbon density, but not both simultaneously. The difference between the two is the rate at which HWPs are produced to meet society's demands, and mitigation activities could seek to delay or reduce HWP emissions and increase substitution benefits. Use of forest biomass for bioenergy could also contribute though the point in time at which this produces a net mitigation benefit relative to a fossil fuel alternative will be situation-specific. Key knowledge gaps exist in understanding boreal mitigation strategies that are robust to climate change and how mitigation could be integrated with adaptation to climate change.","[Lempriere, T.

The first step in achieving engagement is documenting how the general public currently perceive and understand climate change issues, specifically the importance they place on this global problem and identifying any unique challenges for individual communities. For rural communities, which rely heavily on local agriculture industries, climate change brings both potential impacts and opportunities. Yet, to date, our knowledge about how rural residents conceptualise climate change is limited. Thus, this research explores how the broader rural community-not only farmers-conceptualises climate change and responsive activities, focussing on documenting the understandings and risk perceptions of local residents from two small Australian rural communities. Twenty-three semi-structured interviews were conducted in communities in the Eden/Gippsland region on the border of New South Wales and Victoria and the north-east of Tasmania. There are conflicting views on how climate change is conceptualised, the degree of concern and need for action, the role of local industry, who will 'win' and 'lose', and the willingness of rural communities to adapt. In particular, residents who believed in anthropogenic or human-induced factors described the changing climate as evidence of 'climate change', whereas those who were more sceptical termed it 'weather variability', suggesting that there is a divide in rural Australia that, unless urgently addressed, will hinder local and national policy responses to this global issue. Engaging these communities in the twenty-first-century climate change debate will require a significant change in terminology and communication strategies.","[Buys, Laurie; Miller, Evonne; van Megen, Kimberley] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Design, Fac Built Environm & Engn, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Buys, L (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Design, Fac Built Environm & Engn, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",l.buys@qut.edu.au,,"Buys, Laurie/0000-0001-8917-0863; Miller, Evonne/0000-0002-0577-3438",Commonwealth of Australia through the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility,Commonwealth of Australia through the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility,"The research in this article was a result of funding obtained from the Commonwealth of Australia through the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility.

Many parts of the Mediterranean region feature winters with low and sometimes marginal chill accumulation. To assess historic and future agroclimatic conditions for cultivating temperate trees (including almonds, pistachios, apricots, sweet cherries and apples), we mapped winter chill throughout this important growing region. We used on-site weather records (1974-2020) to calibrate a weather generator and produced data for historic and future scenarios. To broaden our analysis, we spatially interpolated chill for the whole Mediterranean basin. We supplemented our simulation outcomes by collecting expert knowledge (from farmers and researchers) regarding observed climate change impacts on temperate orchards as well as future risks and concerns generated by climate change. Results showed that northern African growing regions have experienced major chill losses, a likely cause of the irregular and delayed bloom highlighted by experts. The same regions, together with southern Europe, may lose up to 30 Chill Portions by 2050 under a moderate warming scenario. For the future, experts foresee increasing risk of spring frost in early-blooming cultivars, exacerbated bloom-related problems and increasing occurrence of heat waves. Our results provide evidence of likely climate change impacts on temperate orchards. Expert knowledge proved instrumental in interpreting the simulation results as well as in orienting climate change adaptation strategies. The results we present are useful for farmers and orchard managers planning new plantings, as well as for researchers and policy makers developing strategies to adapt fruit orchards to the impacts of climate change.","[Fernandez, Eduardo; Mojahid, Hajar; Luedeling, Eike] Univ Bonn, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat INRES, Dept Hort Sci, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Fernandez, Eduardo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Agron, Casilla 4-D, Quillota, Chile; [Fadon, Erica; Rodrigo, Javier] Ctr Invest & Tecnol Agroalimentaria Aragon CITA, Dept Plant Sci, Avda Montanana 930, Zaragoza 50059, Spain; [Fadon, Erica; Rodrigo, Javier] CITA Univ Zaragoza, Inst Agroalimentario Aragon IA2, Calle Miguel Servet 177, Zaragoza 50013, Spain; [Ruiz, David A.; Egea, Jose; Egea, Jose] CEBAS CSIC, Fruit Breeding Grp, Dept Plant Breeding, POB 164, Murcia 30100, Spain; [Ben Mimoun, Mehdi; Benmoussa, Haifa; Borgini, Nadia] Univ Carthage, Inst Natl Agron Tunisie INAT, Lab GREEN-TEAM LR17AGR01, 43 Ave Charles Nicolle, Tunis 1082, Tunisia; [Kodad, Ossama] Natl Sch Agr Meknes ENAM, Dept Arboriculture & Viticulture, PB S-40, Meknes 50000, Morocco; [El Yaacoubi, Adnane] Univ Sultan Moulay Slimane, Higher Sch Technol Khenifra, PB 170, Khenifra, Morocco; [Ghrab, Mohamed; Elloumi, Olfa] Univ Sfax, Olive Inst, LR16IO01 & LR16IO02,BP 1087, Sfax 3000, Tunisia; [Benmoussa, Haifa] Univ Carthage, Higher Sch Agr Mograne, Dept Agr Prod, Zaghouan, Tunisia",University of Bonn; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro de Edafologia y Biologia Aplicada del Segura (CEBAS); Universite de Carthage; Sultan Moulay Slimane University of Beni Mellal; Institut de l'Olivier; Universite de Sfax; Universite de Carthage,"Fernandez, E (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat INRES, Dept Hort Sci, D-53121 Bonn, Germany.;Fernandez, E (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Agron, Casilla 4-D, Quillota, Chile.",eduardo.fernandez.c@pucv.cl,"Benmoussa, Haïfa/U-9213-2017; Rodrigo, Javier/H-6383-2011; Egea, Jose A./K-3433-2013","Benmoussa, Haïfa/0000-0003-4071-5564; Rodrigo, Javier/0000-0002-8321-1764; EL YAACOUBI, Adnane/0000-0003-2076-1563; Fadon, Erica/0000-0002-1170-0681; Fernandez, Eduardo/0000-0002-6949-9685; Egea, Jose A./0000-0002-7821-1604","Projekt DEAL; European Union within AdaMedOr project of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01DH20012]; NextGeneration EU/PRTR [PCI2020-111966, PID2020-115473RR-I00, PCI2020-112113]",Projekt DEAL; European Union within AdaMedOr project of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; NextGeneration EU/PRTR,"Open Access funding was enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

However, previous studies may lead to biased conclusions due to the neglect of two factors, including the relative performance of climate simulations and the uncertainty in drought characterization. In this study, Bayesian model averaging is used to merge five regional climate model simulations and to project future changes in hydroclimatic regimes over China under two representative emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Drought characteristics, including drought severity and duration, are extracted using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). A Bayesian copula approach is used to uncover underlying interactions of drought characteristics and associated uncertainties across 10 climate divisions of China. The regional return periods of drought characteristics are used to assess future changes in multidimensional drought risks and the probability of extreme droughts. Our findings reveal that the variations in drought characteristics are generally underestimated by the ensemble mean (AEM) simulation. The Bayesian framework improves the reliability and accuracy of hydroclimate simulations and better reproduces the drought regimes compared to the AEM simulation. The drought duration and severity are projected to substantially increase for most areas of China based on the Bayesian framework, but the AEM simulation may lead to multiple opposite behaviors, especially under RCP4.5. The estimated joint risk from drought duration and drought severity is expected to increase under both emission scenarios. The likelihood of extreme droughts is also projected to increase as the radiative forcing increases.","[Zhang, B.; Wang, S.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, S.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Zhu, J.] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangzhou, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Sun Yat Sen University,"Wang, S (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Wang, S (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",shuo.s.wang@polyu.edu.hk,"Wang, Shuo/I-3017-2013; Zhang, Boen/GPK-7523-2022","Wang, Shuo/0000-0001-7827-187X; Zhang, Boen/0000-0002-4633-3033",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51809223]; Hong Kong Research Grants Council Early Career Scheme [PP5Z],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hong Kong Research Grants Council Early Career Scheme,"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51809223) and the Hong Kong Research Grants Council Early Career Scheme (Grant No. PP5Z).

Clarifying the water cycle process and its interannual variability mechanism over the TP is important for the climate change adaptation activities. However, our current knowledge about the precipitation recycle ratio over the TP and its interannual variation remains inconclusive. Using the advanced reanalysis data ERA5 of the high resolution and a bulk model method, the water cycle over the TP is estimated in terms of the climatology and interannual variability. The climatic precipitation recycle ratio over the TP in summer is 23%. The reason for the contradictory conclusions between Curio et al. (2015, ) and other studies reviewed is analyzed and found to be related to the different definitions of the precipitation recycle ratio associated with the atmospheric water vapor mixture. The interannual variability of the precipitation recycle ratio over the TP in summer is significantly and negatively related with the Nino 3.4 index in the preceding winter. The precipitation recycle ratio decreases to 21.4% due to the more moisture inflow in the El Nino decaying summer. The change in the recycle ratio induced by the preceding El Nino events explains 60% of its interannual variability. The response of precipitation recycle ratio over the TP in summer to the preceding El Nino and La Nina events is asymmetric. Our study is conductive to reach the consensus on the climatic precipitation recycle ratio over the TP and advance our knowledge about its interannual variability mechanism.","[Zhao, Yin; Zhou, Tianjun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LASG, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yin; Zhou, Tianjun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Tianjun] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LASG, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhoutj@lasg.iap.ac.cn,"zhao, yin/AAS-6645-2021; ZHOU, Tianjun/C-3195-2012","zhao, yin/0000-0002-3754-3725; ZHOU, Tianjun/0000-0002-5829-7279","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20060102]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41988101, 41775091]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program [2019QZKK0102]",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program,"This work is supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences under Grant No. XDA20060102 and National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 41988101 and 41775091, as well as the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program (Grant No. 2019QZKK0102).",,52,19,21,23,69,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

Large cyclones are relatively rare, and in popular imagination are thought to hit Mauritius every 15 years. Yet it has been over 25 years since the last cyclone widely considered as 'significant'. Critically, there is little known about the role of memory in responses to cyclones and details regarding responses to past cyclones in Mauritian history are scant. This article examines past experiences and impacts of cyclones in Mauritius, as well as contemporary perceptions of cyclone vulnerability and memories of historical cyclones. The analysis draws on both community interviews and archival research conducted in Mauritius and takes a longue duree approach. This approach combines an examination of both event and process with historical discourses in an effort to uncover the longstanding and slowly changing relationships between people and extreme events. The results reveal a number of repetitive patterns of responses that act out over the long term and repeat for many of the largest cyclones, indicating that tropical cyclone impact and recovery in Mauritius is strongly conditioned by complex, cultural, and place based memory (and forgetting). While these patterns could be characterised as cycles, the research instead presents a concept of 'helices' as a new conceptualisation of long term disaster memory patterns. This research is part of a growing literature arguing for the need to account for the historical processes fundamental to understanding vulnerability. This has implications for disaster risk reduction (including climate change adaptation) in Mauritius, other small islands, and elsewhere.","[Walshe, Rory A.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England; [Adamson, George C.

The aim of this study was to assess the determinant factors of climate change adaptation choices in the agro-pastoral dry lands of northeastern Ethiopia. Data on the household characteristics and adaptation choices were collected using interview schedule from a sample of 260 household heads. Multivariate probit regression and descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. The results indicated that 63.5% of farmers were applying portfolio diversification, enhancing livestock productivity, agro-ecological practices, and diversifying non-agricultural income choices to acclimatize the climate change. The model revealed that many explanatory variables, such as educational level, gender, farming experience, family size, farmland size, goat flock size, farm and non-farm income, frequency of extension contact, access to credit and climate information were significant factors for adaption choice decisions. The marginal success probability of adapting non-agricultural income diversification was the lowest compared to the agro-ecological practices, portfolio diversification and enhancing livestock productivity. The marginal success probability of jointly adapting agro-ecological practices, portfolio diversification, non-agricultural income diversification and enhancing livestock productivity choices was also lower comparing to their failure. Therefore, any effort projected to relax climate change effects should gear towards the provision of services resembling to eminence extension, vocational trainings, affordable credit, empowering vulnerable groups, community radios as well as local meteorology. Moreover, non-farm income generating initiatives on top of agricultural intensification through input supply would expedite context specific adaptation to the changing climatic status quo.","[Mihiretu, Ademe] Sekota Dryland Agr Res Ctr, Socioecon & Agr Extens, Sekota, Ethiopia; [Okoyo, Eric Ndemo; Lemma, Tesfaye] Haramaya Univ, Dept Rural Dev & Agr Extens, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia",Haramaya University,"Mihiretu, A (corresponding author), Sekota Dryland Agr Res Ctr, Socioecon & Agr Extens, Sekota, Ethiopia.",ademe_78@yahoo.com.sg,"Tefera, Tesfaye Lemma/HGB-0540-2022",,Amhara Region Agricultural Research Institute (ARARI),Amhara Region Agricultural Research Institute (ARARI),"The financial support of Amhara Region Agricultural Research Institute (ARARI) is greatly accredited.

A large variety of collaborative freshwater research and management processes is now evident around the world. However, how collective knowledge development, coproduction, or cocreation is carried out in an ethical manner is less well known. From the literature and our experiences as applied, transdisciplinary researchers and natural resource management practitioners, we seek to describe and explore these aspects of empirical cases of collaborative freshwater research and management. Drawing on cases from Indigenous community-based natural resource management in northern Australia, flood and drought risk management in Bulgaria, water management and climate change adaptation in the Pacific, and regional catchment and estuary management in Victoria and New South Wales in Australia, we identify lessons to support improved collaborative sustainable freshwater management research and practice. Cocreation represents an emerging approach to participation and collaboration in freshwater management research-practice and can be seen to constitute four interlinked and iterative phases: coinitiation, codesign, coimplementation, and coevaluation. For freshwater researchers and managers and their collaborators, paying attention to these phases and the ethical dilemmas that arise within each phase will support the cocreation of more effective and ethical research-practice through: sensitizing collaborators to the need for reflexivity in research-practice, proposing action research codesign as a method for managing emergent questions and outcomes, and supporting more equitable outcomes for collaborators through an emphasis on coevaluation and collaborative articulation of the links between research outputs and practice outcomes.","[Ayre, Margaret L.] Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Wallis, Philip J.] Victorian Catchment Management Council, East Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Daniell, Katherine A.] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Melbourne; Australian National University,"Ayre, ML (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",,"Ayre, Margaret/AAE-1981-2020; Daniell, Katherine A./L-1669-2019","Ayre, Margaret/0000-0001-7909-7391; Daniell, Katherine A./0000-0002-8433-1012",,,,,89,15,15,2,20,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

Nonetheless, the emission of climatically relevant greenhouse gases increases with the disturbance of the mangrove sediment - this might undermine the credible reservoir of carbon within the sediment. This article attempts to estimate the environmental (carbon emission) and economic consequences of converting mangrove to cropland (especially rice paddy) based on field-scale study at three different sites (Khola, Gupti and Damra) within the Bhitarkanika mangrove for two consecutive years. The study suggests that the cumulative methane (CH4) emission was significantly higher from the rice paddy (211.3 kg ha(-1)) compared to the mangrove sediment (50.8 kg ha(-1)), while the average nitrous oxide (N2O) emission was significantly higher from the later (2.1 kg ha(-1)). Multivariate statistical analysis suggests that the land use was the prime controlling factor for variation in CH4 and N2O emission. Total carbon equivalent emission (CEETOT) from the rice paddy was significantly higher than mangrove during the study period. The study suggests that the economic value of the mangrove ecosystem was several folds higher than that of the rice paddy. The CEETOT of the Bhitarkanika mangrove has increased approximately 212 Gg over last few decades due to the conversion of the mangrove area to the rice paddy. Such studies are imperative in developing effective regional climate change adaptation strategies. The study advocates urgent need to educate and aware people about the benefits of the mangrove compared to the cropland.","[Chauhan, Rita; Ramanathan, A.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper applies a case study approach, drawing from the documented experiences of organised urban poor groups in Asian countries already actively participating in collective settlement upgrading, building networks and financial resources for further action. Findings - The findings show that while certain actions might not be taken with climate change adaptation specifically in mind, these development activities also contribute to broader resilience to climate change, by reducing exposure to risk and addressing other drivers of vulnerability. The findings also show that partnerships between low income communities and other urban stakeholders, including local government, and innovative financial mechanisms managed by communities, can lead to scaled-up action to address development and adaptation deficits. This can lead the way for transformation in socio-political systems. Practical implications - The approaches applied by organised urban poor groups in Asia show that community-level actions can make a positive contribution to building their resilience to climate change, and with local government support and partnership, it could lead to scaled-up actions, through a bottom-up approach to multi-level governance. Originality/value - This paper considers how community-driven actions can build resilience to climate change, and it argues that adaptation and development should be considered together.","[Archer, Diane] Int Inst Environm & Dev, Human Settlements Grp, London, England",,"Archer, D (corresponding author), Int Inst Environm & Dev, Human Settlements Grp, London, England.",diane.archer@iied.org,,"Archer, Diane/0000-0002-7494-1183",,,,,46,5,5,3,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Macroeconomists have published on this issue since 2002 (we identified 60 studies to date). The results of the studies are contradictory and therefore the need to synthesize the available research is evident. Meta-analysis is a useful method in this field. An important aim of our article is to show how one can use the identified methodological characteristics to better understand the robustness and importance of new findings. To provide a comparative perspective, we contrast our meta-analysis and its findings with the major influential research synthesis in the field: the IPCC's 2012 special report Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation. We show that the IPCC could have been more confident about the negative economic impact of disasters and more transparent on inclusion and qualification of studies, if it had been complemented by a meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis shows that, controlling for modeling strategies and data set, the impact of disasters is significantly negative. The evidence is strongest for direct costs studies where we see no difference between our larger sample and the studies included in the IPCC report. Direct cost studies and indirect cost studies differ significantly, both in terms of the confidence that can be attached to a negative impact of natural disasters and in terms of the sources of heterogeneity of the findings reported in the primary studies.","[van Bergeijk, Peter A.

To understand, model, and adapt to these climate-glacier-water changes, it is vital to integrate the analysis of both water availability (the domain of hydrologists) and water use (the focus for social scientists). Drawn from a case study of the Santa River watershed below Peru's glaciated Cordillera Blanca mountain range, this paper provides a holistic hydro-social framework that identifies five major human variables critical to hydrological modeling because these forces have profoundly influenced water use over the last 60 years: (1) political agendas and economic development; (2) governance: laws and institutions; (3) technology and engineering; (4) land and resource use; and (5) societal responses. Notable shifts in Santa River water use-including major expansions in hydroelectricity generation, large-scale irrigation projects, and other land and resource-use practices did not necessarily stem from changing glacier runoff or hydrologic shifts, but rather from these human variables. Ultimately, then, water usage is not predictable based on water availability alone. Glacier runoff conforms to certain expected trends predicted by models of progressively reduced glacier storage. However, societal forces establish the legal, economic, political, cultural, and social drivers that actually shape water usage patterns via human modification of watershed dynamics.

The responses to these adaptations needs can be integrated and implemented using an agile urban adaptation process, i.e., an adaptive planning process quickly adapting to change in a flexible manner in short planning horizons, where the requirements and responses evolve through evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement and collaboration between self-organizing and cross-functional teams. This paper focuses on how to move from the current conceptual stage to developing practical knowledge for the operation of agile urban adaptation. Scoping methodology comprises (i) understanding and structuring the adaptation context; (ii) exploring the four agile elementsbalancing type I & II adaptation needs, flexibility, range of scenarios and involvement of stakeholdersin the adaptation context; (iii) a detailed SWOT analysis (strength, weakness, opportunities and threat) of adaptation responses; (iv) mapping relationships and synergies between the adaptation responses; and (v) preparing agility score cards for adaptation responses. The scoping exercise revealed that the agile adaptation process can move from concept to operation in Pune, India where the city is improving the basic services and adapting to climate change. For example: conventional adaptation responses such as city greening and check-dams across the rivers have agile characteristics; these responses are synergetic with other adaptation responses; and, there is a possibility to compare conventional adaptation responses based on agile characteristics. This scoping exercise also reveals that urban agile adaptation is not about implementing novel adaptation responses but understanding, planning and implementing conventional adaptation responses using an agile perspective. Urban agile adaptation is also about mainstreaming agile ideas using traditional adaptation responses. Hence, it is possible to apply agile the urban adaptation process using conventional adaptation responses in urban areas which address adaptation deficits related to infrastructure development as well as climate and socio-economic adaptation.","[Radhakrishnan, Mohanasundar; Pathak, Tejas M.; Irvine, Kenneth; Pathirana, Assela] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Water Sci & Engn Dept, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands; [Pathak, Tejas M.] Tej Urbantech Llp Co, Pune 411038, Maharashtra, India",IHE Delft Institute for Water Education,"Radhakrishnan, M (corresponding author), IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Water Sci & Engn Dept, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands.",m.radhakrishnan@un-ihe.org; Tej.urbantech@gmail.com; k.irvine@un-ihe.org; a.pathirana@un-ihe.org,"Irvine, Kenneth/M-5756-2013","Irvine, Kenneth/0000-0002-1010-9064",,,,,54,2,2,0,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,DEC,2017,9,12,,,,,,,939,10.3390/w9120939,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9120939,,,21,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,FR7DB,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000419225500034,View Full Record in Web of Science

Several studies predict worsening outcomes for future climate events, for example heat waves, drought and intense precipitation. Farmers are required to adopt several measures to thrive, given the observed or expected climate change events. Existing studies about the interaction between climate change the agriculture sector has focused evaluating the bi-directional causal relationships, and identifying adaptation measures, but research on the climate resilience aspect of these adaptation measures is missing, or at best, low. This study aims to fill this gap in knowledge by assessing resilience and contribution to sustainability of farmer-adopted measures aimed at addressing risks posed by climate change. We conduct a systematic review of 95 studies concentrating on climate adaptation by smallholder rural farmers in Nigeria in the period 2010 to 2019. We assess the climate resilience of adaptation measures using the Ifejika-Speranza Resilience Check Toolkit. Our findings show that farmers are using climate-resilient adaptation measures; however, we could not ascertain how these have led to sustainable agricultural systems, since it is not the focus of the current study. Our findings show that majority of the adaptation studies in Nigeria are focused on crop farming subsystem. The major agricultural ecosystems and the broad adaptation areas are: Crop farming (improved soil and land management, crop-specific Innovation, water management practices, climate information services and education, access to finance, and off-farm diversification), livestock farming (improved livestock management systems, improved breeding strategies, sustainable health improvement, proper feed formulation early maturing and heat-resistant bird varieties), and fish farming (water harvesting measures, organic material, quick-maturing varieties).","[Onyeneke, Robert] Alex Ekwueme Fed Univ Ndufu Alike, Fac Agr, Ikwo, Ebonyi State, Nigeria; [Nwajiuba, Chinyere Augusta] Alex Ekwueme Fed Univ Ndufu Alike, Fac Educ, Ikwo, Ebonyi State, Nigeria; [Emenekwe, Chukwuemeka Chinonso; Nwajiuba, Anulika; Ohalete, Precious] Alex Ekwueme Fed Univ Ndufu Alike, Fac Management & Social Sci, Ikwo, Ebonyi State, Nigeria; [Onyeneke, Chinenye Judith] Ebonyi State Univ, Fac Agr, Abakaliki, Nigeria; [Uwazie, Iyke Uwazie] Michael Okpara Univ Agr, Dept Econ, Umudike, Abia State, Nigeria",,"Onyeneke, R (corresponding author), Alex Ekwueme Fed Univ Ndufu Alike, Fac Agr, Ikwo, Ebonyi State, Nigeria.",robertonyeneke@yahoo.com,"Ohalete, Precious/AAM-5737-2020; Onyeneke, Robert/AAS-6211-2021","Onyeneke, Robert/0000-0002-9242-901X; Onyeneke, Chinenye/0000-0002-5801-2894; Emenekwe, Chukwuemeka/0000-0001-7099-5056",,,,,161,8,10,2,13,AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS,SPRINGFIELD,"PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604, UNITED STATES",2471-2086,,,AIMS AGRIC FOOD,AIMS AGRIC.

This study set out to map the adaptation patterns - namely, the strategies employed to cope with water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)-related impacts of climate change - within the Mabinju community, located along the banks of Lake Victoria in Western Kenya. Qualitative methods were employed, involving 17 semi-structured individual interviews and seven focus groups with village members. Insights derived from direct conversations with village members were deepened through qualitative interviews with an additional 13 WASH sector stakeholders working in the wider Lake Victoria Basin region. Through this study, various WASH-specific community adaptation measures were identified, with both positive and negative impacts on long-term local climate resilience. While many positive coping strategies were found to be spurred by the creative faculties of local residents, capacities for adaptation were found to be restrained by broader forces of poverty and resource access, resulting in the adoption of certain maladaptive coping mechanisms. These findings highlight the need for climate adaptation interventions in the WASH sector to simultaneously build on existing resilience-enhancing measures while addressing the root causes of maladaptation.","[Marcus, Hannah] World Federat Publ Hlth Assoc, 222 Winding Lane, Thornhill, ON L4J 5J6, Canada; [Hodgins, Stephen] Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Muga, Raphine] Kar Geno Ctr Hope, Kisumu, Kenya",University of Alberta,"Marcus, H (corresponding author), World Federat Publ Hlth Assoc, 222 Winding Lane, Thornhill, ON L4J 5J6, Canada.",hannahmarcus6@hotmail.com,,,,,,,53,0,0,0,0,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",2043-9083,2408-9362,,J WATER SANIT HYG DE,J.

Awareness of these differences is, as we argue, decisive for effective adaptation. This study explores the relationship between person-specific, socio-economic characteristics that are frequently associated with social vulnerability and the perception of current affectedness by extreme weather events, future impact severity as well as adaptation need and adaptation responsibility. Weuse a large online questionnaire survey from New York City studying two extreme weather events, heatwaves and heavy rainstorms. Wefind that previous harm is the most important factor across all tested models for both weather events. However, previous harm and affectedness do not well explain the perception of future impacts, whereas they correspond to views about adaptation responsibility; respondents who felt significantly more affected in the past perceive the community to be in charge of adaptation. Women (during both weather events) and the elderly (during heatwaves) state largest affectedness during past events, and see the community as being responsible for future adaptation. Hispanic and African American respondents, on the other hand, were identified to perceive adaptation to be more of an individual task-potentially related to previous experience with (a lack of) local government services in their areas. Our findings evoke equity questions, and can aid urban decision makers aiming to implement effective and just adaptation measures, targeting vulnerable socio-economic groups in New York City and potentially other cosmopolitan areas.","[Reckien, Diana] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Ctr Res Environm Decis, 419 Schermerhorn Hall,1190 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Petkova, Elisaveta P.] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 609 Schermerhorn Hall,1190 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Reckien, Diana] Univ Twente, Dept Urban & Reg Planning & Geoinformat Managemen, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands",Columbia University; Columbia University; University of Twente,"Reckien, D (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Ctr Res Environm Decis, 419 Schermerhorn Hall,1190 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Reckien, D (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Dept Urban & Reg Planning & Geoinformat Managemen, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",d.reckien@utwente.nl; elisaveta.petkova@columbia.edu,"; Reckien, Diana/P-7348-2015","Petkova, Elisaveta/0000-0003-3620-3232; Reckien, Diana/0000-0002-1145-9509","German Research Foundation (DFG) [RE 2927/2-1]; Center for Research on Environmental Decisions (CRED), Columbia University, USA","German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Center for Research on Environmental Decisions (CRED), Columbia University, USA","DR designed and performed the research, including data gathering and statistical analyses.

The choice experiment analysed the willingness to implement adaptation measures through comparing the preferences for developing a spruce dominated stand towards a diverse, mixed stand. The results show that although the majority of forest owners already recognizes the effects of climate change, they are uncertain whether and when measures should be undertaken. The owners' willingness to adapt was higher whenever the proposed adaptation measures would be undertaken by a local forest enterprise in a soft procedure maintaining and enhancing the number of deciduous trees. Financial incentives, such as income from timber harvesting or governmental funding, did not have a strong effect on owners' choices, and neither did the forest value in 50 years.

A 3D steady-state RANS CFD simulation with a SST k-omega turbulence model was used to evaluate the temperature distribution and age of air for two cases of heat source and smart windows and two ventilation openings. The model was first validated for the first case with full-scale experimental data. For window-to-wall-ratio (WWR) ranges of 20-40% and four different room outlet opening locations, the validated model was used to determine the thermal comfort metrics of the studied building with smart windows cases. The mixed-climate environmental conditions of Atlanta-GA was used for setting up the boundary conditions. The results of thermal comfort analysis showed WWR = 30% and 40% are preferred for all studied windows and smart windows with electrochromic glazing, respectively. It also showed that up to 50% temperature difference reduction between the floor and ceiling is achievable with electrochromic windows. Smart windows with/without electrochromic glazing reduced the maximum relative air temperature between the floor and ceiling by 87%/30% compared to regular windows.

However, quantitative studies of the dynamic changes in wind erosion over long time periods are relatively rare, and this knowledge gap hinders our un-derstanding of desertification under the conditions of a changing climate. Here, we selected the Mongolian Plateau as the study area. Using the revised wind erosion equation (RWEQ) model, we assessed the spatial and temporal dy-namics of wind erosion on the Mongolian Plateau from 1982 to 2018. Our results showed that the wind erosion inten-sity on the Mongolian Plateau increased from northeast to southwest. The annual mean wind erosion modulus was 46.5 t center dot ha-1 in 1982-2008, with a significant decline at a rate of -5.1 t center dot ha-1 center dot 10 yr-1. The intensity of wind erosion was the strongest in spring, followed by autumn and summer, and was weakest in winter. During 1982-2018, wind erosion showed a significant decreasing trend in all seasons except winter. The wind erosion contribution of spring to the total annual wind erosion significantly increased, while that of summer significantly decreased. These results can help decision-makers identify high-risk areas of soil erosion on the Mongolian Plateau and take effective measures to adapt to climate change.","[Wei, Xianhua; Wu, Xiaodong; Wang, Dong; Wu, Tonghua; Li, Ren; Hu, Guojie; Zou, Defu; Ma, Xin; Liu, Yadong; Yan, Xuchun; Fan, Xiaoying; Cao, Xiaoyan] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Ins Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Cryosphere Res Stn Qinghai Tibet Plateau, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Wei, Xianhua; Wu, Xiaodong; Wang, Dong; Ma, Xin; Liu, Yadong; Yan, Xuchun; Fan, Xiaoying; Cao, Xiaoyan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wu, Tonghua] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab, Guangzhou 511458, Peoples R China; [Bai, Keyu] Alliance Biovers Int & Int Ctr Trop Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Bai, Keyu] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Dashtseren, Avirmed] Mongolian Acad Sci, Inst Geog & Geoecol, Ulan Bator 15170, Mongolia; [Wu, Xiaodong] 320 West Donggang Rd, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning, CAAS; Mongolian Academy of Sciences","Wu, XD (corresponding author), 320 West Donggang Rd, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",wuxd@lzb.ac.cn,,"Avirmed, Dashtseren/0000-0003-4119-5345",National Natural Science Founda- tion of China; State Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Science; Special Founda- tion for National Science and Technology Basic Research Program of China; West Light Foundation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences;  [32061143032];  [41941015];  [41961144021];  [SKLCS-ZZ-2022];  [2017FY10130 1-5],National Natural Science Founda- tion of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Science; Special Founda- tion for National Science and Technology Basic Research Program of China; West Light Foundation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); ; ; ; ; ,"Acknowledgements This work was supported by the National Natural Science Founda- tion of China (32061143032, 41941015, 41961144021) , the State Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Science (SKLCS-ZZ-2022) , Special Founda- tion for National Science and Technology Basic Research Program of China (2017FY10130 1-5) , and the West Light Foundation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Previous studies have compared the socio ecological adaptations of culturally comparable but geographically separated communities such as medieval Greenland and Iceland. In the Shetland Islands during the Little Ice Age (LIA) unusual storminess in the 16th and 17th centuries deposited wind driven sand in the township of Broo, Dunrosssness, and on its surrounding estates. Documents, historical records and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dated sand layers show the history of deposition, and reveal two episodes of sand movement one from the mid 16th century, the second from the late 17th or early 18th century. Artifacts, records and stratigraphy suggest Broo's inhabitants successfully resisted the 16th century sand incursion, but were driven from their homes by the early 18th century. Adjacent communities embedded in the same socio economic culture survived the same events and remain viable settlements to the present day. Wind simulations demonstrate that storm conditions are likely to produce markedly lower wind velocities in the area around Broo than over the surrounding landscape making it singularly vulnerable to sand inundation. In this instance human ingenuity and resilience could not counter the misfortune of location. We conclude that in this marginal environment small geographical differences had profound and lasting impact on survivability during an episode of catastrophic environmental change.

The methodology is applied to estimate the impact of climate change on the discrete choice decision to adopt irrigation since it is an important adaptation to climate change. We develop a discrete choice model for the decision to install irrigation capacity that captures the effects of both climate means and extremes. Climatic means and frequencies of climatic events in the upper tails of the temperature and precipitation distributions are used to estimate the parameters of a normal distribution for temperature and a Weibull distribution for precipitation. Using estimates from a probit model, we examine the independent effects of changing climatic mean and variance on the probability of adopting irrigation. Increasing the mean temperature, holding variance constant, shifts the entire distribution toward warmer temperatures-increasing the frequency of extreme temperatures. For precipitation, the specification captures the separate effects of mean rainfall, frequency of rainfall, and frequency of extreme events. The results show that the tails of the temperature and precipitation distributions, not the means, are the dominant climatic determinants in irrigation adoption. The results also show that water availability, soil characteristics, farm size and operator demographics are important determinants of irrigation.","Willamette Univ, Dept Econ, Salem, OR 97301 USA; USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Willamette University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Negri, DH (corresponding author), Willamette Univ, Dept Econ, 900 State St, Salem, OR 97301 USA.",dnegri@willamette.edu,,,,,,,33,41,42,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Observational data were generated from a weather station located in the center of one of the most important appellations located in the SW part of the state. Climate change projections retrieved from a high spatiotemporal weather model using atmospheric conditions simulated for the end of the 21st Century. All the temperature variables considered demonstrated significant warming trends especially during the months of March, April and May. Temperature differences, increases in heat accumulation, and changes to potential frost events would necessitate new approaches to vineyard management. In fact, it is likely that vine budburst will occur earlier and early season frost develop as a new challenge. However, our study results are comparable with other viticulture regions of the world, with a warming trend of at least 3 to 5 degrees C in the months leading up to the growing season by the end of the 21st Century. Therefore, effective climate change adaptations will be important to the grape and wine industry in this region. Management strategies are needed to minimize climate risks while taking advantage of new opportunities related to improved climatic conditions for growing more late-ripening European Vitis vinifera grape varieties, relevant for producing higher quality wines.","[Schultze, Steven R.] Univ S Alabama, Dept Earth Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USA; [Sabbatini, Paolo] Michigan State Univ, Dept Hort, E Lansing, MI 48825 USA",University of South Alabama; Michigan State University,"Schultze, SR (corresponding author), Univ S Alabama, Dept Earth Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USA.",schultze@southalabama.edu; sabbatin@msu.edu,,"Sabbatini, Paolo/0000-0002-1610-4491",,,,,53,0,0,2,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,FEB,2022,13,2,,,,,,,251,10.3390/atmos13020251,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13020251,,,11,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,ZP3RB,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000766341200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We simulated the net primary productivity (NPP) for four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) using an improved Lund-Potsdam-Jena model. Then a method was established based on the NPP to identify the climate change risk level. From the midterm period (2041-2070) to the long-term period (2071-2099), the risks indicated by the negative anomaly and the downward trend of the NPP gradually extended and increased. The higher the scenario emissions, the more serious the risk. In particular, under the RCP8.5 scenario, during 2071-2099, the total risk area would be 81.85%, that of the high-risk area would reach 54.71%. In this high-risk area, the NPP anomaly would reach -96.00 +/- 46.95 gC center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1), and the rate of change of the NPP would reach -3.56 +/- 3.40 gC center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1). The eastern plain of the AHTZ and the eastern grasslands of Inner Mongolia are expected to become the main risk concentration areas.

Climate change adaptation measures play a significant role in coping with the alteration of climatic components, while various forms of barriers hinder the sustainability of adaptation. This research was conducted to understand the perception of IDPs on climate change impact on health in the coastal areas of Bangladesh, including the adaptation practices and barriers to the coping strategies. To fulfill the objective, 420 individual surveys were conducted randomly in two Sub-districts of Khulna district in Bangladesh. The findings reveal that the riverbank erosion and cyclones were the primary reasons for displacement, and the social relationships were hampered in the new places of living. Also, the temperature in summer and winter, and the rainfall intensity increased, whereas rainfall slightly decreased over the last ten years. Differences of opinion were identified about the effects of the changing climatic variables on the respondents' health between the previous and present locations. Despite practicing different adaptive strategies, the weak financial condition and a lack of access to health care information are mostly hindering the sustainability of adaptation. This research may help policymakers in taking proper initiatives to ensure sustainable adaptation practices in the coastal areas.","[Chowdhury, Md. Arif; Hasan, Md. Khalid; Hasan, Md.

Therefore, it is meaningful to perform an overview of possible climate change scenarios to provide appropriate strategies for climate change adaptation in the THP. In this study, spatio-temporal variations of climate data were mapped in the THP during 2000-2009, 2050-2059, and 2090-2099 periods using 14 research-grade meteorological stations and 19 bias-corrected General Circulation Models (GCMs) under representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios RCP 4.5 and 8.5. Results indicated different bias correction methods were needed for different climatic parameters and study purposes. For example, using high-quality data from the meteorological stations, the linear scaling method was selected to alter the projected precipitation while air temperatures were bias corrected using the quantile mapping method. At the end of the 21st century (2090-2099) under the severe CO2 emission scenario (RCP 8.5), the maximum and minimum air temperatures could increase from 3.9 to 10.0 degrees C and 2.8 to 8.4 degrees C across the entire THP, respectively, while precipitation could decrease by similar to 7.5% relative to the historical (2000-2009) observed data.

A questionnaire survey was conducted among 220 farmers with a random sampling technique. We found that farmers were generally concerned about climate change. Most farmers have adopted adaption measures to address the adverse effects of climate change. Adjusting farming behavior and using financial means were the main adaptation measures used by local farmers. The results revealed that the implementation of adaptation measures was constrained by the lack of technology, shortage of money, and poor infrastructure. The binary logistic regression results showed that farmers' socioeconomic characteristics, such as education, farming experience, and gender, had significant impacts on farmers' decisions to choose adaptation strategies. The regression results also indicated that farmers who believed climate change would affect their health were more willing to choose financial instruments, and farmers who believed climate change would affect their agricultural productions were likely to diversify their livelihoods.

It also examines whether there is a significant relationship between the exposure of farmers to climate change and their need for financial access as an adaptation strategy. Questionnaires were administered to 320 respondents in rural communities in northern Nigeria. Descriptive analysis shows that rural farmers are affected by climate change through increased temperature, prolonged dry seasons, floods, and drought, which lead to low harvest and, in turn, low income. An estimate from a non-parametric test also shows a significant relationship between farmers' perceived exposure to climate change and their need for credit. Although the Spearman correlation results show a 63% association between exposure to climate change and the need for finance, 96% of those seeking credit to mitigate these impacts would be unable to do so due to financial exclusiveness. The paper recommends that the Central Bank of Nigeria should ensure that microfinance institutions refocus their products/services to those who need them the most in order to enhance access to financial resources and enable farmers to build resilience that will maximize post-harvest gains. Lastly, considering that climate change is a global phenomenon with local effects, perhaps the international community could support lending to smallholder farmers through central banks by insuring the loans that banks give to farmers towards financing climate change adaptation strategies.","[Abraham, Terfa W.] Natl Inst Legislat Democrat Studies NILDS, Abuja, Nigeria; [Fonta, William M.] WASCAL Competence Ctr, Ouagadoudou, Burkina Faso",,,Lorenzcurve@yahoo.com; fontawilliam@gmail.com,,"Fonta, William/0000-0002-1398-3355","German Federal Ministry of Education (BMBF); Zentrum fur Entwicklungsforschung (ZEF)/Centre for Development Research, Department for Economic and Technological, Universitat Bonn, Bonn - Germany under the West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL)","German Federal Ministry of Education (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Zentrum fur Entwicklungsforschung (ZEF)/Centre for Development Research, Department for Economic and Technological, Universitat Bonn, Bonn - Germany under the West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL)","This paper benefits from the Graduate Research Programme in Climate Change Economics fund provided by the German Federal Ministry of Education (BMBF) in collaboration with the Zentrum fur Entwicklungsforschung (ZEF)/Centre for Development Research, Department for Economic and Technological, Universitat Bonn, Bonn - Germany under the West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL) hosted at the Universite Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar, Senegal.",,66,17,18,5,120,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,2199-4730,,FINANC INNOV,Financ.

However, recent unprecedented and irreversible changes brought on by global climate change challenge this norm and alter their lagoons and adjacent oceans into unfamiliar territories. Climate change already is affecting, and has been projected to continue to disproportionately impact, Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) through rising temperatures, sea-level rise, saltwater intrusion of freshwater resources, coastal erosion, an increase in extreme weather events, altered rainfall patterns, coral reef bleaching, and ocean acidification. While knowledge is building about potential impacts on ecosystems and some target stocks, there is little information available for communities, governments and regional institutions on how to respond to these changes and adapt. What are the consequences for marine conservation, fisheries management and coastal planning at local, national and regional scales? What strategies and policies can best support and enable responses to these challenges across different scales? What opportunities exist to finance necessary climate change adaptation and mitigation measures?

However, different delta-change methods yield different future precipitation scenarios that might significantly affect the projected future streamflow. To assess these effects, two delta-change methods were compared: the simple delta-change (SDC) method with a constant scaling factor and the quantile-quantile delta-change (QQDC) method with a quantile mapping-based non-uniform delta factor. The Xinanjiang (XAJ) hydrological model was applied using historical climatic data and two future precipitation scenarios for streamflow simulations in the Pearl River basin, China. The results show that the two delta-change methods have significant influences on future precipitation and streamflow projections, and these impacts become more distinct at finer and extreme event time scales. For instance, the QQDC method projects the 20-year daily maximum precipitation to be 8.1-98.6% higher than the SDC method. Consequently, the XAJ model with the QQDC future precipitation produces the 20-year daily maximum streamflow to be approximately 7.0-65.0% higher than that using the SDC precipitation. It implies that future precipitation transformation methods are a source of uncertainty, affecting future discharge projections. Such uncertainty should be considered in water resources management and flood control strategies for future climate change adaptations.","[Yuan, Fei; Ren, Liliang] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Fei; Tung, Yeou-Koung] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hohai University; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Yuan, F (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Yuan, F (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",fyuan@hhu.edu.cn,,,"Research Project Competition Grant of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology [RPC10EG25]; Special Fund of State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering [20145031112]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41323001]; 111 Project from the Ministry of Education and State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs, P.

Most studies on adaptive capacity focus on socio-economic parameters (such as poverty or education), and few provide detailed analysis on the role played by different institutions at local level, and the effects of how these institutions are perceived on farmers' adaptation. Semi-structured interviews were conducted among 46 households from seven villages in southern Benin (West Africa), and among representatives of several institutions at the local level. Half the participants were involved in Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) development projects and half were independent farmers. Results indicate that independent farmers mostly use non-agricultural coping strategies (loans, work in town) while project farmers mainly use agricultural adaptive strategies (improved seed varieties). Lack of adaptive capacity of independent farmers is linked to weak State institutions at the local level. Due to their lack of efficiency and high corruption rates, local State representatives are mistrusted. NGOs are trusted and seek for help, even by independent farmers. Even if NGOs do not have climate change adaptation in their agendas, they promote activities, which help reduce farmers' vulnerability. Although our results are limited to south-western Benin, they question the way adaptation is promoted today, for instance through the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (through the National Adaptation Programmes of Action).","[Baudoin, Marie-Ange] Univ Colorado, INSTAAR, Consortium Capac Bldg, Boulder, CO 80301 USA; [Sanchez, Aida Cuni] UCL, Dept Geog, London, England; [Fandohan, Belarmain] Univ Abomey Calavi, Lab Ecol Appl, Ecole Natl Super Sci & Tech Agron Ketou, Cotonou, Benin",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of London; University College London; University of Abomey Calavi,"Baudoin, MA (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, INSTAAR, Consortium Capac Bldg, 5107 Williams Fork Trail,Apt 112, Boulder, CO 80301 USA.",marieange007@gmail.com,"Fandohan, Belarmain Fandohan / Adande Belarmain/AAU-8444-2021","Fandohan, Belarmain Fandohan / Adande Belarmain/0000-0002-8426-6839",Belgian American Educational Foundation.,Belgian American Educational Foundation.,"We are grateful to Edwin Zaccai, the ULB-CEDD and our Mini-Arc fund for making this research possible.

Since this is an urban area, there is a tendency for people and businesses to converge, which results in higher water demand. At present, the combined distribution efficiency of its water infrastructures under the management and supervision of the Cauayan City Water District (CCWD) is only 87% or with a combined distribution loss of 10%, which is 1282.50m3 losses per day. This study suggests the necessity to introduce new and innovative water management technologies and systems adapted to climate change to address the city's needs. Problems that need to be addressed include a low-efficiency performance of the existing water infrastructure systems, lack of management tools for more efficient delivery of water services, limited service coverage of the water district due to limited water resources, and depletion and contamination of aquifers and other water sources since shallow aquifer is mainly utilized. Hence, a decisionsupport application based on geographic information systems (GIS) for managing urban water infrastructure with Storm Water intervention is a designed solution to address the needs of the city. The combination of decision support systems (DSS) and geographic information systems (GIS) was presented in this paper to maximize and properly utilize water infrastructure.

Development and deployment of green energy technologies offer a natural conduit to meet the growing electricity needs of the Association of Southeast Asian Economies (ASEAN) region while also serving as a viable strategy to adapt to climate change. The aim of this study is to formulate the policy lessons for the ASEAN economies and governments in facilitating the development and deployment of green technologies and alternatives energy options based on a specific case review of the ASEAN. The ASEAN economic region is prioritizing sustainable economic growth while minimizing the regional impacts of climate change through decarbonization. The study undertakes a case-specific analysis in reviewing green energy deployment in the context of green growth and energy transition using secondary data sources and discusses the current status and future options of renewable energy development in the ASEAN. We find that carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies will allow the ASEAN to continue to use fossil fuels while achieving sustainable economic growth as coal demand increases in the region. The deployment of CCS technologies will also act as an enabler of hydrogen energy as a green energy solution in the region in the longer term. Boosting public acceptance to nuclear energy, implementing energy efficiency improvement policies and eliminating fossil fuels consumption subsidies are feasible short-term and medium-term policies. Increasing both the public and private sector energy investments and development of CCS technologies in the longer term are necessary complementary policies to maximize the benefits of greater deployment of renewable energy sources in the region and combat climate change.","[Nepal, Rabindra] Univ Wollongong, Sch Business, Fac Business & Law, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Phoumin, Han] Econ Res Inst ASEAN East Asia ERIA, Senayan Jakarta Pusat 10270, Indonesia; [Khatri, Abiral] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Dept Business Soc Management, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of Wollongong; Economic Research Institute ASEAN & East Asia; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Nepal, R (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Sch Business, Fac Business & Law, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",rnepal@uow.edu.au; han.phoumin@eria.org; khatri@rsm.nl,,"Khatri, Abiral/0000-0002-7761-1833",Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia,Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia,This research paper was carried out under the funding from the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia.,,60,9,8,1,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2021,13,2,,,,,,,758,10.3390/su13020758,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13020758,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PY0JC,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000611735400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite the protection and promotion of the woody component in different parts of the CAP political text, the identification of agroforestry is not clear, although it can be recognised in the description of some landscape features, such as isolated trees and different types of hedgerows. Moreover, it is important to identify the extent of such woody components promoted by the CAP in agricultural lands to validate the impact of current and future measures. This paper aims at the characterisation of the current extent of landscape features all over Europe by analysing the Rural Development Program (RDP) measures within the CAP 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 that promote said features in Europe to increase the ecosystem service delivery. Isolated trees and hedgerows are protected unsatisfactorily through the Cross-compliance and Greening of CAP Pillar I. In contrast, Agri-environment measures associated to Pillar II are used in most European countries to protect both isolated trees and hedgerows and to promote them as boundary elements. The promotion of hedgerows and isolated trees mainly related to silvoarable and silvopastoral agroforestry practices is aimed at the promotion of the ecosystem services (such as water protection and biodiversity) and improvement in resilience (such as adaptation to climate change) they provide; therefore, the agroforestry environment benefits are indeed recognised. Landscape features comprising woody perennials should be associated with agroforestry when present in arable and permanent grasslands.","[Santiago-Freijanes, J.

The National Climate Change Policy identified that coastal areas of Trinidad and Tobago were particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts. As a small island State, the country cannot afford its productive sectors operating in and/or reliant upon coastal resources to be at risk, even as some contribute to the climate change phenomenon. The increasing threat to socio-cultural, economic and environmental sustainability posed by climate change, was acknowledged in the Draft National Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Policy Framework which aims to treat with climate change impacts in the coastal zone and reduce vulnerability to associated hazards. Given the stated objectives of the National Climate Change Policy and the Draft National ICZM Policy Framework, this paper examined the policy and plans in place to integrate climate change considerations into management for the coastal sectors of fisheries, energy, tourism and maritime transport. It found that the mainstreaming of climate change mitigation and adaptation responses in these coastal sectors has not been as effective as needed. Progress in this regard was constrained by human, financial and technical resource availability. Proposed are rationalised institutional arrangements which, if statutorily grounded, will better allow for achieving co-ordinated climate change mitigation and adaptation outcomes in Trinidad and Tobago.

The Organic Cotton Case in Mali and West Africa",OPEN AGRICULTURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,farming system; socio-ecological system; organic agriculture; communication; sociology; organic cotton; Mali; sustainable development,FRAMEWORK; SCIENCE,"Science should be capable of covering issues as diverse as farming systems, technology, innovation, climate change adaptation, poverty alleviation, extension, policy and practice, as they all relate to sustainable agriculture and development. Some years ago, the call for a new farming systems approach was raised to accommodate the principles of interdisciplinary, systems thinking and participatory research. Society calls for systems performance that provides stability and sustainability (SDGs!), multi-scale and territorial approaches and looks for solutions for critical issues such as employment, migration and inclusion/exclusion at the global level (World Society). We propose here a way in dealing with this complexity by addressing the mentioned problem from the communication and symbolic perspective, i.e. to consider the object within agricultural science but mainly observe the dedicated systems of communication. By using the concept of social systems, we can accommodate under it systems as diverse as farms, extension organizations, innovation patterns, (agricultural) sciences, policy and politics, farmer and indigenous knowledge, markets and value chains, but always in the form of communication. As such, we remain within a discipline with the potential to evolve towards a promising sub-discipline of agricultural sciences (or of sociology?). The relatively new farming approach of certified organic in combination with agroecology is relevant for family farms and small-scale entities. It depends much more on societal support for extension, technology development and policy coherence than commercial farms. Organic agriculture, with its standards, technological requirements and consumer preferences is nested in socio-economic and political networks, which makes it challenging for researchers to integrate the various components. This challenge applies particularly to countries with poorly developed institutions, weak organizations and within the context of poverty and rural exodus. We therefore use a unified approach under a single scientific system. This system observes, analyses and reports on communication aspects of involved (observed!) social systems (including networks and interactions) within the society of any given nation, including the realities of globalized markets. We are developing a case study based in Mali, in which we apply this method. The case is describing a planning process involving cotton farmers from the Sikasso region, the cotton industry, public and private extension systems, farmer organizations, local governments, the NARS (IER), FiBL, donors and the national institutions involved in climate change adaptation and food security. Various technological options of production (conventional, organic) and farming systems are available. The reflexive use of science dealing with human behavior may facilitate the pragmatic participation of researchers from various disciplines in addressing the uncertainties and opportunities that lie ahead of us and achieve the required impacts together with the practitioners.","[Nicolay, Gian L.] FiBL Res Inst Organ Agr, CH-5070 Frick, Switzerland",,"Nicolay, GL (corresponding author), FiBL Res Inst Organ Agr, CH-5070 Frick, Switzerland.",gian.nicolay@fibl.org,"Kausar, A K M Golam/AGY-6189-2022",,SNF/SDC (ORM4Soil); Mercator Foundation (Mercator Mali); Hivos for the promotion of Ecological Organic Agriculture in Africa; SDC; SNF/SDC (Yamsys),SNF/SDC (ORM4Soil); Mercator Foundation (Mercator Mali); Hivos for the promotion of Ecological Organic Agriculture in Africa; SDC; SNF/SDC (Yamsys),"This research paper was made possible thanks to the projects funded by SNF/SDC (ORM4Soil and Yamsys), the Mercator Foundation (Mercator Mali) and the support by SDC and Hivos for the promotion of Ecological Organic Agriculture in Africa.

This paper analyzes the social-ecological crisis presented by the Hemileia vastatrix outbreak, with a focus on how global, regional and national dynamics interact with local processes in the Chiapas Sierra Madre of south-eastern Mexico, a biodiversity hotspot with a tradition of smallholder, shade-grown coffee production. We explore the hypothesis that the current coffee rust epidemic is an expression of global environmental change, with implications for legal frameworks and international efforts towards risk management and climate change adaptation. Addressing debates on legal resilience building, we illustrate how mismatches of scale between social-ecological phenomena and legal and institutional arrangements may generate pathological solutions for small-scale coffee producers and shade-grown coffee ecosystems. Thereafter, using the analytical lens of modularity, the paper sheds light on landscape stewardship to reduce the risks of non-resilient characteristics such as isolation, on the one hand, and on the other, over-connectedness of habitat patches in the landscape of importance for ecosystem functions at larger scales. The interdisciplinary framework leads to recognizing the role of institutions and legal arrangements which are not limited to national boundaries in proposing solutions to this social-ecological crisis. We find that matching scales of law with agroforestry systems can be done through a variety of legal and policy instruments to contribute to resilience building. This matching of scales is vital to safeguarding biodiversity's global benefits and the right of small-scale coffee farmers to a healthy and sustainable environment.","[Libert Amico, Antoine] Programa Mexicano Carbono, Chiconautla 8-A, Texcoco 56225, Mexico; [Libert Amico, Antoine] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana, Calzada del Hueso 1100, Coyoacan 04960, Cdmx, Mexico; [Ituarte-Lima, Claudia; Elmqvist, Thomas] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico; Stockholm University,"Libert Amico, A (corresponding author), Programa Mexicano Carbono, Chiconautla 8-A, Texcoco 56225, Mexico.;Libert Amico, A (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Metropolitana, Calzada del Hueso 1100, Coyoacan 04960, Cdmx, Mexico.",antoinelibert@hotmail.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Elmqvist, Thomas/AAY-6344-2021","Elmqvist, Thomas/0000-0002-4617-6197; Ituarte-Lima, Claudia/0000-0002-4901-0950; Libert, Antoine/0000-0002-9716-0283",,,,,131,12,14,3,25,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1862-4065,1862-4057,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

Alternative sources of water, such as more resilient permafrost features (e.g. rock glaciers), are expected to become increasingly important as current warming continues. Assessments of current and future permafrost extent under climate change are not available for the Southern Hemisphere, yet are required to inform decision making over future water supply and climate change adaptation strategies. Here, downscaled model outputs were used to calculate the projected changes in permafrost extent for a first-order assessment of an example region, the Bolivian Andes. Using the 0 A degrees C mean annual air temperature as a proxy for permafrost extent, these projections show that permafrost areas will shrink from present day extent by up to 95 % under warming projected for the 2050s and by 99 % for the 2080s (under the IPCC A1B scenario, given equilibrium conditions). Using active rock glaciers as a proxy for the lower limit of permafrost extent, we also estimate that projected temperature changes would drive a near total loss of currently active rock glaciers in this region by the end of the century. In conjunction with glacier recession, a loss of permafrost extent of this magnitude represents a water security problem for the latter part of the 21st century, and it is likely that this will have negative effects on one of South America's fastest growing cities (La Paz), with similar implications for other arid mountain regions.","[Rangecroft, Sally; Suggitt, Andrew J.; Anderson, Karen] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR10 9FE, England; [Rangecroft, Sally; Harrison, Stephan] Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR10 9FE, England",University of Exeter; University of Exeter,"Rangecroft, S (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR10 9FE, England.;Rangecroft, S (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR10 9FE, England.",sr332@exeter.ac.uk,"Anderson, Karen/ABC-3524-2021","Anderson, Karen/0000-0002-3289-2598; Suggitt, Andrew/0000-0001-7697-7633",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Oxfam; Agua Sustentable [NE/H018875/1]; NERC [NE/L00268X/1]; NERC [NE/L00268X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/L00268X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Oxfam; Agua Sustentable; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"Thanks to Tim Osborn (UEA Climatic Research Unit) for useful discussions re: ClimGen downscaled climate data.

For this purpose three GCMs, two multi-model ensembles (one by averaging the predictors of GCMs and the other by regressing the predictors of GCMs against reanalysis datasets) and two scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) were considered. The downscaling model was able to reasonably reproduce the observed historical rainfall statistics when the model was driven by NCEP reanalysis datasets. Significant bias was observed in the rainfall when downscaled from historical outputs of GCMs. Bias was corrected using the Frequency Adapted Quantile Mapping technique. Future changes in rainfall were computed from the bias corrected downscaled rainfall forced by GCM outputs for the period 2041-2060 and these were then compared to the base period 1961-2000. The results show that annual and seasonal rainfalls are likely to significantly decrease for all models and scenarios in the future. The number of dry days and maximum consecutive dry days will increase whereas the number of wet days and maximum consecutive wet days will decrease. Future changes of daily rainfall occurrence sequences combined with a reduction in rainfall amounts will lead to a drier catchment, thereby reducing the runoff potential. Because this is a catchment that is a significant source of Adelaide's water supply, irrigation water and water for maintaining environmental flows, an effective climate change adaptation strategy is needed in order to face future potential water shortages.

Hence, climate adaptation in cities is necessary to improve their resilience against climate change impacts and to secure their sustainability, quality of life and economic strength. Urban planners, practitioners and decision-makers require knowledge about the effectiveness of city-scale climate adaptation measures to prioritise their options for action and to push forward the political process for the implementation of climate adaptation strategies in cities. The Deutscher Wetterdienst's new Information Portal for Climate Adaptation in Cities, INKAS, enables its users to assess and compare the quantitative effect of different adaptation measures for varying degrees of implementation. The impact of different climate adaptation measures designed to reduce summertime air temperatures in cities is systematically investigated by means of the urban climate modelling of idealised cities. INKAS is based on about 2000 urban climate simulations of various combinations of nine urban settlement types typical for Germany and of four urban surrounding countrysides. The simplified assumptions of idealised cities with typical urban settlement types simulated with the 3-dimensional urban climate model MUKLIMO_3 increases the transferability of complex urban interrelations to local decision-makers and urban planners. Simulated adaptation measures include the use of materials with high reflectivity, the installation of green roofs and the transformation of impervious surfaces between buildings into pervious surfaces.","[Buchholz, Saskia; Kossmann, Meinolf; Roos, Marita] Deutsch Wetterdienst, Dept Climate & Environm Consultancy, D-63067 Offenbach, Germany",Deutscher Wetterdienst,"Buchholz, S (corresponding author), Deutsch Wetterdienst, Frankfurter Str 135, D-63067 Offenbach, Germany.",saskia.buchholz@dwd.de,,,DWD Sonderforschungsprogramm SFP-TP 1.6 Sensitivitatsstudien zur thermischen Belastung in Stadten,DWD Sonderforschungsprogramm SFP-TP 1.6 Sensitivitatsstudien zur thermischen Belastung in Stadten,We acknowledge the financial support of the DWD Sonderforschungsprogramm SFP-TP 1.6 Sensitivitatsstudien zur thermischen Belastung in Stadten (September 2011-December 2016).,,43,4,5,1,17,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER, SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0941-2948,1610-1227,,METEOROL Z,Meteorol.

In this country, corn is produced by about 2.5 million small farmers and grown on 8.4 million hectares in rainfed agriculture. However, its production is not enough to meet demand. Climate change may negatively impact corn production, putting Mexico's food security at risk. The main goal of this work was to identify which corn races can find favorable environmental conditions in the future under climate change scenarios in the Sierra Madre Oriental. The Sierra Madre is a region highly vulnerable to climate change; in 2020, corn production was 5,785,561 Mg yr(-1) of which 49.87% was from rainfed agriculture. These corn races could be proposed to replace others not tolerant to climate change, mainly at high altitudes. Potential distribution models were obtained for seven highly productive maize races. The projections were generated with the MaxLike algorithm using representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios to 2050 and 2070. In addition, general circulation models (CCSM4, GISS.E2-R, and MPI-ESM-LR) were used. Our results show that the Tabloncillo and Tuxpeno races could slightly increase their potential distribution in the future. Both corn races present the highest number of municipalities with adequate environmental conditions for their future presence. As a strategy for adaptation to climate change, it is proposed to replace or complement maize races in high-altitude areas with other tropical ones with greater tolerance to high temperatures, such as the Tuxpeno race.","[Estrada-Contreras, Israel; Pavon, Numa P.; Cadena, Jessica Bravo] Univ Autonoma Estado Hidalgo, Ctr Invest Biol, Pachuca, Hidalgo, Mexico; [Bourg, Amandine] Inst Ecol, AC Carretera antigua Coatepec 351, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Hidalgo; Instituto de Ecologia - Mexico,"Pavon, NP (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Estado Hidalgo, Ctr Invest Biol, Pachuca, Hidalgo, Mexico.",npavon@uaeh.edu.mx,,,National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACYT); FORDECYT-PRONACE project [f/3578 No. 305223],National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); FORDECYT-PRONACE project,Israel Estrada and Jessica Bravo-Cadena thank the National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACYT) for the scholarship for a Postdoctoral Stay.

Interventions that simultaneously tackle both challenges are highly desirable. To date, most studies aiming to find synergistic interventions for these two challenges have focused on protecting or restoring vegetation and soils but overlooked how conservation or restoration of large wild animals might influence the climate mitigation and adaptation potential of ecosystems. However, interactions between large animal conservation and climate change goals may not always be positive. Here, we review wildlife conservation and climate change mitigation in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. We elucidate general principles about the biome types where, and mechanisms by which, positive synergies and negative trade-offs between wildlife conservation and climate change mitigation are likely. We find that large animals have the greatest potential to facilitate climate change mitigation at a global scale via three mechanisms: changes in fire regime, especially in previously low-flammability biomes with a new or intensifying fire regime, such as mesic grasslands or warm temperate woodlands; changes in terrestrial albedo, particularly where there is potential to shift from closed canopy to open canopy systems at higher latitudes; and increases in vegetation and soil carbon stocks, especially through a shift towards below-ground carbon pools in temperate, tropical and sub-tropical grassland ecosystems.

In response to the limited attention paid to the sustainability and equitable governance approaches of the blue economy, a US Blue New Deal has been proposed aiming to protect the health of the ocean and support coastal communities' adaptation to climate change. The Blue New Deal emerged as a central policy proposal from 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren to enhance the role of the blue economy while simultaneously addressing the climate crisis. Through a just transitions analysis, this article evaluates the proposal for a US Blue New Deal - as designed by Senator Elizabeth Warren - that would be applied towards enhancing socioeconomic resiliency, environmental justice, and addressing social inequities. As part of a critical policy analysis evaluating the areas of focus Warren's Blue New Deal presents, environmental justice and sustainability are central to the success of managing, and enhancing the role of, the blue economy. The challenges facing the Blue New Deal reflect a one size fits all federal approach that has implications for addressing multifaceted obstacles in key sectors of the blue economy, its governance, and tackling interconnected crises that exacerbate socioeconomic inequities and vulnerabilities of marginalised coastal communities. This article proposes a blue justice framework for the Blue New Deal that seeks to address the tensions and contradictions that exist in its current form and indicates how a comprehensive policy framework can enhance the sustainability and equitable involvement of the blue economy.","[Axon, Stephen; Cross, Emma; Smith, Allie] Southern Connecticut State Univ, Dept Environm Geog & Marine Sci, New Haven, CT 06515 USA; [Bertana, Amanda] Southern Connecticut State Univ, Dept Sociol, New Haven, CT USA; [Graziano, Marcello] Southern Connecticut State Univ, Dept Management & Int Business, New Haven, CT USA; [Axon, Kayleigh] Foote Sch, New Haven, CT USA; [Wakefield, Alysia] Univ Liverpool, Dept Mkt, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Connecticut State University System; Southern Connecticut State University; Connecticut State University System; Southern Connecticut State University; Connecticut State University System; Southern Connecticut State University; University of Liverpool,"Axon, S (corresponding author), Southern Connecticut State Univ, Dept Environm Geog & Marine Sci, New Haven, CT 06515 USA.",axons2@southernct.edu,,"Axon, Stephen/0000-0003-1166-6118",,,,,67,1,1,4,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0016-7398,1475-4959,,GEOGR J,Geogr.

This study demonstrates how a multidisciplinary approach integrating geotechnical engineering, hydrology, and climate science can be employed to quantify site-specific impacts of climate change on geotechnical infrastructure. Specifically, this paper quantifies the effects of changes in future streamflow on the performance of an earthen levee in Sacramento, California, considering multiple modes of failure. The streamflows for historical (1950-2000) and projected (2049-2099) scenarios with different recurrence intervals were derived from routed hydrological simulations driven by bias-corrected global climate models. The historical and future flood levels were then applied in a set of transient coupled finite-element seepage and limit equilibrium slope stability analyses to simulate the levee subjected to extreme streamflow. Variability in hydraulic and mechanical properties of soils was addressed using a Monte Carlo sampling method to evaluate and compare the probability of failure of the levee under different historical and future climate scenarios. Three individual modes (underseepage, uplift, and slope stability) along with lower and upper bounds for the combined mode of failure were examined. The results showed that incorporating future floods into levee failure analysis led to considerable reductions in the mean factor of safety and increases in the levee's probability of failure, suggesting that risk assessment based on historical records can significantly underestimate the levee's failure probability in a warming climate. Despite inherent uncertainties in future projections and substantial variability across climate models, evaluating infrastructure against projected extremes offers insights into their likely performance for the future.","[Vahedifard, Farshid; Jasim, Firas H.; Abdollahi, Masood] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Jasim, Firas H.] Tikrit Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Tikrit 34001, Iraq; [Tracy, Fred T.] US Army, Corps Engineers, Informat Technol Lab, Engn Res & Dev Ctr, Vicksburg, MS 39180 USA; [Alborzi, Aneseh; AghaKouchak, Amir] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",Mississippi State University; University of Tikrit; United States Department of Defense; United States Army; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; U.S. Army Engineer Research & Development Center (ERDC); University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Vahedifard, F (corresponding author), Mississippi State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",farshid@cee.msstate.edu; firasarab@tu.edu.iq; Fred.T.Tracy@usace.army.mil; ma1882@msstate.edu; aalborzi@uci.edu; amir.a@uci.edu,,", Aneseh/0000-0003-2233-889X; Vahedifard, Farshid/0000-0001-8883-4533","National Science Foundation [CMMI-1634748, CMMI-1635797]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This material is based upon work supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos.

An important component of the restoration plan involves storing excess stormwater deep underground in the Floridan Aquifer System using aquifer, storage and recovery (ASR) wells. In order to determine the optimal ASR system and to assess environmental impacts, USACE spent over 11 years and significant resources to develop a three-dimensional groundwater model of the Floridan Aquifer System covering a large portion of the Florida peninsula. This SEAWAT model is capable of evaluating changes in aquifer pressures and density-dependent flows in the entire study area. The model has been used to evaluate the Everglades ASR system already but could also be used by water managers for other important water resources studies in Florida including water supply estimates and adaptation to climate change. As part of an effort to make the model more readily available for other important studies, this study documents and summarizes the overall development of the SEAWAT model including a discussion regarding the intensive calibration and validation efforts undertaken during model development. The paper then demonstrates the use of the model using Everglades ASR project alternatives. Lastly, the paper outlines potential future uses of the model along with its overall limitations.

Birthed under colonial rule, the industry has undergone a confluence of events that have shaped its contemporary organisation and exacerbated deeply rooted institutional and structural conditions. Through the lens of environmental justice, the paper sheds light on the plural claims to justice under changing climatic conditions and reveals the politics of adaptation within the context of market capitalism. Using stakeholder interviews, the paper captures the articulations and manifestations of injustice by exploring the local perceptions of procedural justice and justice as recognition. Through an examination of power and politics, the paper begins by contextualising the pre-existing conditions that shape the disabling environment in which smallholders operate. This includes the neoliberal restructuring of the industry, smallholders' access to low farm gate prices, expensive farm inputs, low-value chain participation, and limited support services. As these conditions are exacerbated by climate change impacts, the paper then discusses the disparity in justice claims between farmers and industry stakeholders surrounding the deployment of suitable climate change adaptation response. This is an area of contestation, as even though smallholders face multiple stressors, industry leaders have continued to operate the island's major coffee-producing spaces as areas where profits can be mined and privileges reinforced. Effectively, the smallholder livelihoods embedded within Jamaica's coffee-producing landscapes have been subjected to asymmetrical structures of power which legitimise whose voices are heard and which adaptation pathway takes precedence, thus generating injustices, nurturing vulnerabilities and stifling agency.","[Birthwright, Anne-Teresa] Interamer Inst Global Change Res IAI, Montevideo, Uruguay",,"Birthwright, AT (corresponding author), Interamer Inst Global Change Res IAI, Montevideo, Uruguay.",annetbirthwright@yahoo.com,,,,,,,54,0,0,3,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0016-7398,1475-4959,,GEOGR J,Geogr.

Whilst the focus of climate change adaptation in Wales has been wintertime decarbonisation through the introduction of energy efficiency measures, Welsh Government now want to understand the summertime impacts of climate change on the occupants of Welsh housing. The aim of this project was to test the hypothesis that summertime indoor housing conditions in Wales will diminish as a consequence of climate change. A six-week period from 22nd July-31st August was modelled using UK 2018 local climate projections, baseline, 2030 and 2070 respectively. The results reveal increased incidences of summertime overheating in a majority of dwellings. The poorest performing dwellings were post 1990 dwellings, flats and properties with internal wall insulation. The results show that cooling strategies to reduce indoor air temperature will increasingly be required. The other indoor vulnerability modelled was that of moisture. Results demonstrate the potential for poorer indoor environmental quality due to increased relative humidity. Every location will experience increases in relative humidity regardless of dwelling typology. Relative humidity will be highest in pre-1919 dwellings and dwellings with solid stone walls. The results show that ventilation strategies to improve the extraction of moisture-laden air, whilst diluting the concentration of pollutants that are present indoors, are required if these dwellings are to avoid increased incidences of condensation, damp, and mould growth, and adverse impacts from other allergens, particles and pollutants.","[Hayles, Carolyn S.] Cardiff Metropolitan Univ, Cardiff Sch Art & Design, Western Ave, Cardiff CF5 2YB, Wales; [Huddleston, Matt; Helman, Jacob] Resilient Analyt, 814 Trail Ridge Dr, Louisville, CO 80027 USA; [Chinowsky, Paul] Univ Colorado, Program Environm Design, 314 UCB 1060 18th St, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Cardiff Metropolitan University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Hayles, CS (corresponding author), Cardiff Metropolitan Univ, Cardiff Sch Art & Design, Western Ave, Cardiff CF5 2YB, Wales.",cshayles@cardiffmet.ac.uk; mhuddleston@resilient-analytics.com; Paul.Chinowsky@colorado.edu; jhelman@resilient-analytics.com,,"Hayles, Carolyn/0000-0002-0811-0816",Welsh Government - Environmental Evidence Programme,Welsh Government - Environmental Evidence Programme,This work was supported by Welsh Government through a climate embedded research fellowship funded by the Environmental Evidence Programme.,,41,2,2,6,7,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

However, evaluations of adaptation often adopt an aggregated perspective, while disaggregation of results is important to learn about who benefits when and where. A typical example is adaptation of rice agriculture in the Vietnam Mekong Delta (VMD). Efforts focused on flood protection have mainly benefitted large-scale farmers while harming small-scale farmers. To investigate the distributional consequences of adaptation policies in the VMD, we assess both aggregate total output and equity indicators, as well as disaggregated impacts in terms of district-level farming profitability. Doing so requires an adequate representation of the multisectoral dynamics between the human and biophysical systems which influence farming profitability. We develop a spatially explicit integrated assessment model that couples inundation, sedimentation, soil fertility and nutrient dynamics, and behavioral land-use change and farming profitability calculation. We find that inter-district inequality responds in a non-linear way to climatic and socio-economic changes and choices of adaptation policies. The patterns of who wins and who loses could change substantially when a different policy is implemented or if a slightly different uncertain future materializes. We also find that there is no simple ranking of alternative adaptation policies, so one should make trade-offs based on agreed preferences. Accounting for equity implies exploring the distribution of outcomes over different groups over a range of uncertain futures. Only by accounting for multisectoral dynamics can planners anticipate the equity consequences of adaptation and prepare additional measures to aid the worse-off actors.","[Jafino, Bramka Arga; Kwakkel, Jan H.; Klijn, Frans] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Delft, Netherlands; [Klijn, Frans; Haasnoot, Marjolijn] Deltares, Delft, Netherlands; [Nguyen Viet Dung] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Hydrol, Potsdam, Germany; [van Delden, Hedwig] Res Inst Knowledge Syst, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Haasnoot, Marjolijn; Sutanudjaja, Edwin H.] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Utrecht, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; Deltares; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC); Utrecht University,"Jafino, BA (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Delft, Netherlands.",B.A.Jafino@tudelft.nl,"Kwakkel, Jan H./D-9680-2013; Haasnoot, Marjolijn/H-4827-2012","Kwakkel, Jan H./0000-0001-9447-2954; Nguyen Viet, Dung/0000-0002-2649-2520; Haasnoot, Marjolijn/0000-0002-9062-4698; Sutanudjaja, Edwin/0000-0002-3426-4069; van Delden, Hedwig/0000-0001-6976-4832; Jafino, Bramka Arga/0000-0001-6872-517X",NWO Top Sector Water Call: Adaptation Pathways for socially inclusive development of urbanizing deltas [OND1362814],NWO Top Sector Water Call: Adaptation Pathways for socially inclusive development of urbanizing deltas,This work was funded by NWO Top Sector Water Call: Adaptation Pathways for socially inclusive development of urbanizing deltas (research number OND1362814).,,126,7,7,0,15,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",,2328-4277,,EARTHS FUTURE,Earth Future,MAY,2021,9,5,,,,,,,e2020EF001939,10.1029/2020EF001939,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020EF001939,,,20,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,SL5PA,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000656968900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, risk-based EA for heavy rain events remains challenging because, unlike extreme temperature events, which often have a scale of thousands of kilometres, heavy rainfall occurrences depend on mesoscale rainfall systems and regional geographies that cannot be resolved using general circulation models (GCMs) that are currently employed for risk-based EA. Herein, we use GCM large-ensemble simulations and high-resolution downscaled products with a 20-km non-hydrostatic regional climate model (RCM), whose boundary conditions are obtained from all available GCM ensemble simulations, to show that anthropogenic warming increased the risk of two record-breaking regional heavy rainfall events in 2017 and 2018 over western Japan. The events are examined from the perspective of rainfall statistics simulated by the RCM and from the perspective of background large-scale circulation fields simulated by the GCM. In the 2017 case, precipitous terrain and a static pressure pattern in the synoptic field helped reduce uncertainty in the dynamical components, whereas in the 2018 case, a static pressure pattern in the synoptic field provided favourable conditions for event occurrence through a moisture increase under warmer climate. These findings show that successful risk-based EA for regional extreme rainfall relies on the degree to which uncertainty induced by the dynamic components is reduced by background conditioning.","[Imada, Yukiko; Kawase, Hiroaki; Takayabu, Izuru] Japan Meteorol Agcy, Meteorol Res Inst, 1-1 Nagamine, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan; [Watanabe, Masahiro] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778568, Japan; [Arai, Miki] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showa Machi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Shiogama, Hideo] Natl Inst Environm Studies, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan",Japan Meteorological Agency; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; University of Tokyo; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan,"Imada, Y (corresponding author), Japan Meteorol Agcy, Meteorol Res Inst, 1-1 Nagamine, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan.",yimada@mri-jma.go.jp,"Shiogama, Hideo/B-9598-2012","Shiogama, Hideo/0000-0001-5476-2148","Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan [JPMXD0717935457, JPMXD0717935561]; Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [18K03749]; MEXT, Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [18K03749] Funding Source: KAKEN","Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan; Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); MEXT, Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful to M.

In recent years, policies and measures are largely applied to industrial sector of the CEC to find out a sustainable pathway. However, the sustainable development performance is lacking in scientific evaluation. To comprehensively understand the status quo of industrial performance under the pressure of climate change adaptation and mitigation, this study establishes an evaluation framework of sustainable performance for industrial sector of the CEC, synthesizing the economic, environmental and social pillars. Particularly, we use global principal component analysis (GPCA), a dynamic multi-criteria decision making model, to assess the progress of industrial performance in each region from a time series perspective. We find that industrial sectors in all three regions show good trends of sustainable development during 2009-2015. Among them, the industrial sector of Tianjin performed the best and maintained the best improving status because of its positive performance on innovation, employees' benefits, and economic structure. The industrial sector in Beijing had medium performance but it had outstanding advantages on social dimension for its high proportion of R&D employment with high income level. Hebei's industrial sector performed the worst for its relatively lower energy efficiency and heavy industry-based economic structure. The innovation-driven development mode in Beijing and Tianjin provides a direction for Hebei's industrial sectors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

As such it has been adopted by a large number of disciplinesfrom psychology, physics, and ecology to disaster risk reduction, climate change adaption, and humanitarian and food security interventions. However, although numerous definitions or measures of resilience have been proposed, those were mainly discipline centered and, as such, failed to provide an adequate overarching framework. This paper explores the question of the formalization and measurement of resilience, with the objective to develop a generic metric that applies across the disciplines and to the different interpretations of resilience. Building on the definitions found in the literature, a continuum of five categories of resilience responses is identified: (i) resistance, (ii) coping strategies, (iii) adaptation, (iv) adaptive preference, and (v) transformation. Those categories are then reframed into a generic metric, using viability analysisa mathematical formalism which builds on dynamic systems and control theory. Theoretical and empirical analyses are then conducted, looking in particular at how inertia and costs associated with the types of responses influence the level of resilience. To illustrate this new metric, we draw on two models widely discussed in the resilience literature: the exploitation of renewable resources and the case of lake eutrophication. Both theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate the relevance of the typology as a generic framework for resilience but also highlight transformation as a particular case of resilience response.","[Bene, Christophe] Int Ctr Trop Agr, Cali, Colombia; [Doyen, Luc] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, GREThA, Pessac, France",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux,"Doyen, L (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, GREThA, Pessac, France.",luc.doyen@u-bordeaux.fr,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Doyen, Luc/GXH-3424-2022; Bene, Chris/ACK-2643-2022","Doyen, Luc/0000-0001-8272-6187; Bene, Chris/0000-0002-7078-9241","Institut Henri Poincare (IHP) in Paris; Belmont Forum [ANR-14-JPF1-0003, ANR-10-LABX-45, ANR-14-CE03-0001]",Institut Henri Poincare (IHP) in Paris; Belmont Forum,"The initial part of this work has been carried out with support from the Institut Henri Poincare (IHP) in Paris during the trimester mathematics of bio-economics organized as part of the Mathematics of Planet Earth 2013 initiative.

The objective was to explore how two neighbouring communities and their governments respond to large-scale environmental change within connected but uneven political ecological contexts. Current climate change impacts in this bi-national island present an opportunity to better understand not only local climate justice but also how fragmented sovereignty, territoriality, and citizenship regimes may affect processes of climate adaptation. The researchers conducted 27 semi-structured interviews in the Dominican Republic and 11 in Haiti, with open ended questions. The data analysis explores impacts of the lakes' growth; perceived causes and solutions; access to assistance; views on responsibility; and capacities for mobilization, bi-national cooperation, and international partnerships. The article argues that different capabilities for climate adaptation are shaped by historical path dependencies, local institutional contexts, and international linkages; and that attaining climate justice requires attention to these factors within a collective normative framework. The conclusion examines how climate science, research partnerships, and citizen participation might be leveraged to help build binational adaptation strategies grounded in a capabilities approach to climate justice.

However, because of various human-induced pressures, such as overfishing and poor resource management, marine resources are deteriorating at an unprecedented rate. Climate change effects this dynamic by contributing directly to marine resource deterioration and acting as an effect multiplier, worsening already-present problems in the systems. This deterioration threatens the viability of marine resources to support future food security demands and presents multiple health implications for coastal communities that rely upon these resources. This research used a narrative review to explore how the impacts of climate change are projected to impact human health and sustainable development throughout subsistence fishing communities. A case study approach focusing on the Pacific Ocean region of Micronesia was conducted to provide a practical indication of the future scenario applicable to other geographical regions across the globe. The results indicate that climate change is likely to exacerbate adverse health outcomes such as food insecurity, ciguatera fish poisoning, heatstroke, and mental health problems and that climate change may lead to the deterioration of traditional cultural practices. As the climate crisis is happening now and will be an issue extending into the foreseeable future, it is necessary to implement adaptation strategies, funding, and governance to limit global emissions, preserve marine resources, and support human well-being. Therefore, this research details adaptation strategies, such as diversifying fish catch and reviving traditional postharvest preservation methods, that may help communities adapt to climate change.","[Hodgson, Lauren; Fernando, Gabriela; Lansbury, Nina] Univ Queensland, Sch Publ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Hodgson, L (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Publ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",l.hodgson@uqconnect.edu.au,,"Fernando, Gabriela/0000-0001-6107-2911",,,,,104,0,0,1,1,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693, UNITED STATES",1948-8327,1948-8335,,WEATHER CLIM SOC,Weather Clim.

Climate change, a phenomenon that occurs over many years, has affected the lives of farmers in the agricultural sector. Therefore, it is essential to analyse the factors that affect farmers' decisions to determine their ability to adapt to climate change and maintain their livelihoods. As such, the present study examines farmers' understanding of climate change and its impact on adaptation strategies in Southeast Asia. Approximately 15 related studies were found based on a systematic review of the repositories from Scopus and the Web of Sciences using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Hence, the paper delineates five key themes: (1) sociodemographic factors, (2) physical capital, (3) assistance, (4) information, and (5) social networking. Therefore, the results underlining the determinant factors, such as income, household members, farm size, land, number of workers, access to information, education, experiences, training, support from agencies, and social networks, influence the adaptation strategies among Southeast Asian farmers. This systematic review study emphasises information accessibility, education, training, and income as the most important factors for developing adaptation strategies for farmers to deal with climate change, rather than programme, internet usage, relatives, and the number of workers. Finally, combining the main factors can promote technological advancement for farmers who rely on agriculture as their main source of income and help farmers deal with climate variability to sustain their livelihood.","[Diana, Mohd Idris Nor; Zulkepli, Nurul Atikah; Siwar, Chamhuri] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Environm & Dev LESTARI, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Zainol, Muhd Ridzuan] Lembaga Kemajuan Pertanian Kemubu KADA, PS 127,Jalan Dato Lundang, Kota Baharu 15710, Kelantan, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Diana, MIN (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Environm & Dev LESTARI, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",nordiana@ukm.edu.my; p109633@siswa.ukm.edu.my; csiwar@ukm.edu.my; muhd.ridzuan@kada.gov.my,"Idris, Nor Diana Mohd/C-4103-2018; Idris, Nor Diana Mohd/AAJ-6446-2021","Idris, Nor Diana Mohd/0000-0002-3849-4101; Zulkepli, Nurul Atikah/0000-0003-3215-6133",Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia [FRGS/1/2018/SS08/UKM/03/1],"Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia(Ministry of Education, Malaysia)","This research was funded by the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia, grant number FRGS/1/2018/SS08/UKM/03/1.",,39,5,5,10,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR,2022,14,6,,,,,,,3639,10.3390/su14063639,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14063639,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0B2CG,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000774447600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Particular focus is placed on the role of vegetation to prevent or mitigate the impacts of natural hazards and climatic extreme events. Protection forests that aim to minimize the risk of shallow landslides and other slope processes are among the numerous examples of how vegetation can reduce disaster risk and support communities to cope with natural hazards. However, there is no existing systematic review of the protection functions that vegetation offers in different mountain environments and many studies only focus on one specific controlling factor - such as the root systems - without considering NbS as an integrated concept. We performed a detailed investigation into shallow landslides as the most frequent slope processes, and conducted a systematic literature review based on two peer-reviewed bibliographic databases, Scopus and Science Direct, to ascertain the extent to which vegetation is identified as a controlling factor and the targeting of NbS for risk reduction. We assessed more than 13,000 articles published from 2000 to 2018 and conducted an in-depth evaluation of the 275 articles that satisfied the assessment criteria. Our results show that despite the promotion of NbS in internal policies, little research has been published on this topic; however, this has increased over the last decade. We therefore encourage transdisciplinary studies that integrate NbS for shallow landslides reduction.","[Arce-Mojica, Teresa de Jesus; Nehren, Udo; Anhuf, Dieter] Univ Passau, Dept Geog, Innstr 40, D-94032 Passau, Germany; [Arce-Mojica, Teresa de Jesus; Nehren, Udo] TH Koln Univ Appl Sci, Inst Technol & Resources Management Trop & Subtro, Betzdorfer Str 2, D-50679 Cologne, Germany; [Sudmeier-Rieux, Karen] Univ Lausanne, Fac Geosci & Environm, Inst Earth Sci, 724 Geopolis, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Julio Miranda, Patricia] Autonomous Univ San Luis Potosi, Fac Ciencias Sociales & Humanidades, Ave Ind 101-A Fracc, San Luis Potosi 78399, Mexico",University of Passau; University of Lausanne; Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosi,"Arce-Mojica, TD (corresponding author), ITT, Betzdorfer Str 2, D-50678 Cologne, Deutz, Germany.",teresa.arcemoj@gmail.com,"Nehren, Udo/AAJ-2155-2021","Nehren, Udo/0000-0001-6236-3542; Sudmeier-Rieux, Dr. Karen/0000-0003-0513-8968",Centers for Natural Resources and Development (CNRD) Ph.D. program,Centers for Natural Resources and Development (CNRD) Ph.D. program,We thank the Centers for Natural Resources and Development (CNRD) Ph.D. program for the financial support (Ph.D. scholarship) to the main author.,,74,32,32,10,47,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

However, its full potential will only be achieved if the challenges to agroforestry implementation are identified and the most efficient and sustainable solutions are made widely known. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore these challenges and to determine the most suitable set of solutions for each challenge that combines local effectiveness with European scale relevance. We performed a two-step solution scanning exercise. First, the main challenges to sustainable agroforestry in Europe were identified through 42 participatory workshops with 665 local stakeholders. The solutions to each challenge were scanned and classified into either direct solutions (28) to address climate change or indirect solutions (32) that improve the sustainability of agroforestry. In a second step, the direct solutions were prioritized through expert consultation in terms of their potential benefits for mitigation and adaptation. The most commonly reported barriers were a lack of knowledge and reliable financial support to which the most widely suggested indirect solutions were agroforestry training programmes and the development of safe economic routes. The direct solutions considered as holding the greatest mitigation and adaptation potential were the adoption of practices capable to increase soil organic carbon pools and the implementation of multifunctional hedgerows and windbreaks respectively. Our solution scanning approach can inform the implementation of the European climate strategy in general and to the Common Agricultural Policy in particular by pointing to concrete climate beneficial actions.","[Hernandez-Morcillo, Monica] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Burgess, Paul] Cranfield Univ, Sch Water Energy & Environm, Cranfield, Beds, England; [Mirck, Jaconette] Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus, Dept Soil Protect & Recultivat, Senftenberg, Germany; [Pantera, Anastasia] TEI Stereas Elladas, Dept Forestry & Nat Environm Management, Lamia, Greece; [Plieninger, Tobias] Univ Kassel, Chair Social Ecol Interact Agr Syst, Kassel, Germany; [Plieninger, Tobias] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",University of Copenhagen; Cranfield University; Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus; Universitat Kassel; University of Gottingen,"Hernandez-Morcillo, M (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",m.hernandezmorcillo@gmail.com,"Burgess, Paul/B-3963-2011; Plieninger, Tobias/E-3861-2010","Burgess, Paul/0000-0001-8210-3430; Plieninger, Tobias/0000-0003-1478-2587; Pantera, Anastasia/0000-0002-4339-9141",AGFORWARD project from the European Commission (7th Framework Program) [613520],AGFORWARD project from the European Commission (7th Framework Program),We thank the participants of the AGFORWARD workshops and the online survey for their time and valuable contributions.

To do this, scientists not only need to be committed and willing to interact with users but also have the capacity to listen, understand, and respond to their needs. Yet little is known about how climate scientists perceive users and respond to their needs when deliberately co-producing knowledge. Using the case study of the UK Climate Projections 2009 (UKCP09) we seek to address this gap. Drawing on interviews with climate scientists, boundary workers, and government officials involved in UKCP09, we investigate how perceptions of users and their needs are constructed as well as the difficulties in responding to them. Our research shows that climate scientists struggle to respond to users other than a small cadre of actors like themselves highly technical and highly numerate - mini-mes; as what constitutes 'credible, usable, and relevant' science is different for users and scientists. Others involved in UKCP09 considered a broader set of users, with more heterogeneous capacities, as the target audience. We find that the climate scientists' narrow perceptions of users were strongly influenced by (i) their past experiences; (ii) the level and type of scientist-user interactions; and (iii) the institutional setting in which the science took place. This research suggests that climate scientists need broader social support from other experts as well as institutional goals geared towards a broader set of users if they are to successfully co-produce climate knowledge.","[Porter, James J.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Inst Work Psychol, Sheffield S7 1AF, S Yorkshire, England; [Dessai, Suraje] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS1 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Leeds,"Porter, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Inst Work Psychol, Sheffield S7 1AF, S Yorkshire, England.",james.porter@sheffield.ac.uk,"Dessai, Suraje/D-4219-2009","Dessai, Suraje/0000-0002-7879-9364; Porter, James/0000-0002-5442-5544","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research, ERC [284369]; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) from the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP); Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research, ERC; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) from the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","This research was supported by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research (FP7/2007-2013), ERC Grant agreement 284369.

Tanzania as other countries of the world has been affected. Several studies have been conducted on farmers' perceptions and adaptation to climate change in the country, but little attention has been devoted to forest adjacent households in humid areas. This study assessed this gap through assessing forest adjacent households' voices on perceptions and adaptation strategies to climate change in Kilombero District, Tanzania. Data collection involved key informant interviews, focus group discussions and household questionnaires. Results showed that the majority of households perceived changed climate in terms of temperature increase, unpredictable rainfall, frequent occurrence of floods, increased dry spells during rainy season coupled with decreased water sources and emergence of new pests and diseases. The perceived change in climate has impacted agriculture productivity as the main livelihood source. Different coping and adaptation strategies are employed. These are; crop diversification, changing cropping calendar, adopting modern farming technologies, and increasing reliance on non-timber forest products. These strategies were positively and significantly influenced by socio-economic factors including household size, residence period, land ownership and household income. The study concludes that, there are changes in climatic conditions; and to respond to these climatic changes, forest adjacent households have developed numerous coping and adaptation strategies, which were positively and significantly influenced by some socio-economic factors. The study calls for actual implementation of local climate change policies and strategies in order to enhance adaptive capacity at household level.","[Balama, Chelestino; Augustino, Suzana; Makonda, Fortunatus B.

However, few studies focused on long-term emission changes, long-range passenger transport of air pollutants, especially, neglecting how those cities with larger urban agglomeration area interact with each other. This article fills the gap to evaluate interacting emissions from inter-city passenger transport and related PM2.5 health impacts, also to assess possible development in passenger transport sector in long-term post fossil period. Shenyang Metropolitan Area is chosen as a case in which include eight neighboring cities, covering 23.6 million inhabitants. Results show that total air pollutants and greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions from urban agglomeration area passenger transport reached 265 kt and 17 kt in 2012, respectively, and may result in about 170 deaths per year. Importantly, the interacting emissions are closely related with the local economic development of destination city, meaning that interactions between each city in an urban agglomeration area are mostly based on economic cooperation. In order to mitigate and adapt to such emissions, different scenarios were set up for policy making and implementing. Comparing with business-as-usual scenario, optimal scenarios with the promotion of hybrid vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles and ethanol vehicles can lead to less air pollutants and GHGs. Finally, appropriate policies for supporting the application of the optimal scenario were raised and discussed so that policy-makers can seek an innovative pathway to both mitigate and adapt to climate change and improve air quality in transport sector of an urban agglomeration area.

Hence, there is a need to understand vulnerability to climate change in the context of multiple exposure-sensitivities at the community level. This article responds to this perceived knowledge need based on a case study of the community of Kugluktuk in Nunavut, Canada. An established approach for vulnerability assessment is used to identify current climatic and non-climatic exposure-sensitivities along with their associated contemporary adaptation strategies. This assessment of current vulnerability is used as a basis to consider Kugluktuk's possible vulnerability to climatic change in the future. Current climate-related exposure-sensitivities in Kugluktuk relate primarily to subsistence harvesting and community infrastructure. Thinner and less stable ice conditions and unpredictable weather patterns are making travel and harvesting more dangerous and some community infrastructure is sensitive to permafrost melt and extreme weather events (e. g., flash floods). The ability of individuals and households to adapt to these and other climatic exposure-sensitivities is influenced by non-climatic factors that condition adaptive capacity including substance abuse, the erosion of traditional knowledge and youth suicide. These and other non-climatic factors often underpin adaptive capacity to deal with and adapt to changing conditions and must be considered in an assessment of vulnerability. This research argues that Northern communities are challenged by multiple exposure-sensitivities-beyond just those posed by climate-and effective adaptation to climate change requires consideration if not resolution of socio-economic and other issues in communities.","[Bradshaw, Ben; Pearce, Tristan; Smit, Barry; Tozer, Laura] Univ Guelph, Dept Geog, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Prno, Jason] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Waterloo, ON N2L 3B4, Canada; [Wandel, Johanna] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Guelph; Wilfrid Laurier University; University of Waterloo,"Bradshaw, B (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Geog, 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",bbradsha@uoguelph.ca,"Pearce, Tristan/L-9139-2019; Bradshaw, Ben/AAD-4358-2020","Bradshaw, Ben/0000-0001-7195-3974","ArcticNet, International Polar Year Canada; Canada Research Chairs Programme; Global Environmental Change Group at the University of Guelph","ArcticNet, International Polar Year Canada; Canada Research Chairs Programme(Canada Research Chairs); Global Environmental Change Group at the University of Guelph","Thank you to all interview participants in Kugluktuk and our community research assistants, Janet Kadlun, Angela Kuliktana, Manok Taipana, Beverley Anablak, Lisa Ayalik and Danielle Meyok.

Ongoing climate change will likely expose trees and forests to new stresses and disturbances during this century. Trees naturally adapt to changes in climate, but their natural adaptive ability may be compromised by the rapid changes projected for this century. In the broad sense, adaptation to climate change also includes the purposeful adaptation of human systems, which includes forestry In this article, we briefly review the expected impacts of projected climate change on trees and forest ecosystems in Poland. We further provide a framework for designing adaptive strategies to sustain or enhance forest growth, health, and ecosystem services in new climates. Within this framework, we distinguish two related objectives: (1) adaptation of decision-making process in forest management and (2) adaptation of forest ecosystems. Each of these objectives may he achieved through strategies and options whose applicability is discussed in relation to major forest functions ecological and societal, commercial, and multiple-use. Knowledge gaps and research needs are also identified. We conclude that the recent emphasis on sustainable multi-functional forestry and the current ownership structure in Poland will facilitate adaptation of Polish forests to future climates. However, much remains to be learned about the impacts of climate change, especially at the ecosystem level. Cooperation between researchers and forest managers is critical for developing better management strategies for adapting forests to climate change.","[Chmura, Daniel J.] Inst Dendrol PAN, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland; [Chmura, Daniel J.; Howe, Glenn T.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Anderson, Paul D.; St Clair, J.

A continuous succession of fluvial sediments, reflecting adaptations to climate change from the Weichselian Middle Pleniglacial (oxygen isotope stage 3) onwards, occurs in lowland river basins in the Netherlands. A comparison of the Pleniglacial and Late Glacial fluvial record in the Netherlands shows that climatic oscillations of similar magnitude did not produce changes in the fluvial sedimentary system of equal magnitude. The Late Glacial fluvial system Droves to be highly sensitive to climate change. By contrast, many of the rapid climate changes that have occurred during oxygen isotope stage 3, according to the Greenland ice core record, are not detectable in the fluvial sediments. This can be explained by differences in the impact of the climate variations on drainage basin vegetation. During the Late Glacial, the tree line repeatedly shifted through the Netherlands, whereas the area remained within the tundra zone during the Middle Pleniglacial. Precipitation variations and permafrost aggradation and degradation have played a secondary role. The Weichselian fluvial succession in the Netherlands demonstrates that detection of a change in the fluvial sedimentary system and relating this change to climate change is subject to methodological limitations. The climatic significance of changes in the fluvial record should be carefully evaluated, as well as their chronology. The possibility that climate did not influence the fluvial system should always be considered as a null hypothesis in studies on fluvial successions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Ideas and Practices Connected with Sustainability in Vanuatu,SUSTAINABILITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,anthropology; agriculture; fishing; marine conservation; climate change; Vanuatu,CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT,"The aim of this article is to explore anthropology's potential to contribute to reflections on the definition of sustainability. It draws on in-depth ethnographic fieldwork in the South Pacific island state of Vanuatu, using as its main methods semi-structured interviews, participant observation and freelisting. This article presents decisions and acts of the inhabitants of the rural village of Siviri regarding both the cultivation of food crops and fishing. It relates findings to a recent anthropological working definition of 'sustainability' that emphasises facilitating the necessary conditions for change by building and supporting diversity to address the unpredictability of the future. This definition is opposed to other current definitions that stress the preservation of existing norms. The research results presented here show that, with their decidedly future-oriented ideas and practices, the villagers of Siviri engaged with climate change adaptation projects and workshops regarding conservation and subsequently created new cultivation methods and established a marine conservation area. Additionally, they reduced their engagement in cultivation and diversified their livelihood practices. Referring to theoretical approaches connected with the 'ontological turn' in anthropology, it is argued that asking ontological questions reveals fundamental differences between the inhabitants of the village of Siviri and international and national governments and organisations in terms of their conceptualisations connected with sustainability. The article concludes that anthropology can make important contributions to discussions about sustainability that have the potential to improve the dialogue between different stakeholders by showing the alterity of conceptualisations. This may lead to new, localised and contextualised definitions of sustainability.","[Pascht, Arno] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Inst Social & Cultural Anthropol, Oettingenstr 67, D-80538 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Pascht, A (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Inst Social & Cultural Anthropol, Oettingenstr 67, D-80538 Munich, Germany.",arno.pascht@ethnologie.lmu.de,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [389654580, 298643416]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-17-FRAL-0001-01]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche(French National Research Agency (ANR))","The research for this article was conducted as part of two projects: (1) 'Lokalisierung von globaler Klimawandelpolitik in Vanuatu: Rezeption vonWissen und kulturelle Transformationen', funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation), grant number 298643416, and (2) 'A Sea of Connections: Contextualizing Fisheries in the South Pacific Region' or SOCPacific (https://socpacific.net/, accessed on 5 January 2022), co-funded by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche, grant number ANR-17-FRAL-0001-01, and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation), grant number 389654580.",,45,2,2,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2022,14,8,,,,,,,4733,10.3390/su14084733,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14084733,,,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0R3CJ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000785477300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Aiming to understand its implications, we conducted a literature review on climate change interactions with sheep and goat systems. The review first identifies the main potential impacts on productivity at the animal level (heat stress effects) and at the forage level (quantity and quality). Results from analysed studies suggest that heat stress thresholds for small ruminants could be higher than previously indicated, although they still will be affected during projected heatwaves. At the forage level, the potential positive effect of CO2 fertilisation will probably be counteracted in most of the cases due to extreme weather events and other limitations. Based on that findings, the review analyses the most suitable adaptation strategies on animal heat stress and pasture production. Particular attention is paid to integrated approaches, providing co-benefits at different levels. Finally, structural and practical challenges affecting small ruminants' sustainability in a climate change context are discussed, together with potential synergies and trade-offs among different policies and/or strategies. According to the information reviewed, small ruminant systems could be particularly vulnerable to environmental changes, as they are often produced in harsh areas under already severe circumstances. At the same time, they have particular features that could involve advantages against other livestock systems to cope with -and fight against- future climatic conditions. Consequently, they should play a important role for the climate change adaptation and mitigation options within the livestock sector.","[Pardo, G.; del Prado, A.] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Edificio Sede 1,Planta 1a,Parque Cient UPV EHU, Leioa 48940, Bizkaia, Spain",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3),"del Prado, A (corresponding author), Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Edificio Sede 1,Planta 1a,Parque Cient UPV EHU, Leioa 48940, Bizkaia, Spain.",agustin.delprado@bc3research.org,"del Prado, Agustin/B-4675-2010","del Prado, Agustin/0000-0003-3895-4478; Pardo, Guillermo/0000-0002-7961-8457","Spanish Government through Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation 2018-2022 [MDM-2017-0714]; Basque Government through the BERC 2018-2021 programme; Horizon2020 SFS-01c2015 project entitled Innovation of sustainable sheep and goat production in Europe (iSAGE) [679302]; programme Ramon y Cajal from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [RYC-2017-22143]","Spanish Government through Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation 2018-2022; Basque Government through the BERC 2018-2021 programme(Basque Government); Horizon2020 SFS-01c2015 project entitled Innovation of sustainable sheep and goat production in Europe (iSAGE); programme Ramon y Cajal from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness","This research is supported by the Spanish Government through Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation 2018-2022 (Ref.

This paper presents the results of a study that sought to understand the multiple dimensions of fairness of adaptation strategies that exist or can be developed to deal with sea-level rise. The study focused on five small communities along the south-east coast of Australia-Lakes Entrance, Seaspray, Port Albert, McLoughlins Beach and Manns Beach. Interviews were conducted with residents of the local communities to examine perceptions of current adaptation policies and their social impacts. A questionnaire was used to develop a nuanced understanding of the types of people living in these communities and their everyday lives, practices, and relationships. This enabled us to identify a range of non-material social impacts that may occur as a result of sea-level rise. Finally, focus groups were used to obtain community perspectives on the fairness of a range of potential future adaptation strategies. Together, these methods revealed that adaptation to sea-level rise is likely to affect some groups in the community significantly more than others, and in ways that will fundamentally change the nature of living in these communities. Understanding nuances in the social values of communities reveals how policies can be adapted to provide fairer outcomes for all community members through processes that create the time and space required to establish long-term working relationships between communities and government.","[Graham, Sonia; Barnett, Jon; Fincher, Ruth; Mortreux, Colette; Hurlimann, Anna] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Graham, S (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",sonia.graham@unimelb.edu.au,"Barnett, Jon/AAQ-9002-2021; Graham, Sonia/G-4399-2012","Barnett, Jon/0000-0002-0862-0808; Graham, Sonia/0000-0003-4195-4559; Hurlimann, Anna/0000-0001-9110-9340; Mortreux, Colette/0000-0001-6855-4139",Australian Research Council [LP100100586]; East Gippsland Shire Council; Wellington Shire Council; Gippsland Coastal Board; Department of Sustainability and Environment; Department of Planning and Community Development; Australian Research Council [LP100100586] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); East Gippsland Shire Council; Wellington Shire Council; Gippsland Coastal Board; Department of Sustainability and Environment; Department of Planning and Community Development; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This project has been funded by a Linkage Grant (LP100100586) from the Australian Research Council.

Recognizing this role of ecosystems, several international and nongovernmental organizations have promoted an ecosystem-based approach to adaptation. We review the scientific literature related to ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA) with forests and trees, and highlight five cases in which forests and trees can support adaptation: (1) forests and trees providing goods to local communities facing climatic threats; (2) trees in agricultural fields regulating water, soil, and microclimate for more resilient production; (3) forested watersheds regulating water and protecting soils for reduced climate impacts; (4) forests protecting coastal areas from climate-related threats; and (5) urban forests and trees regulating temperature and water for resilient cities. The literature provides evidence that EBA with forests and trees can reduce social vulnerability to climate hazards; however, uncertainties and knowledge gaps remain, particularly for regulating services in watersheds and coastal areas. Few studies have been undertaken on EBA specifically, but the abundant literature on ecosystem services can be used to fill knowledge gaps. Many studies assess the multiple benefits of ecosystems for human adaptation or well-being, but also recognize trade-offs between ecosystem services. Better understanding is needed of the efficiency, costs, and benefits, and trade-offs of EBA with forests and trees. Pilot projects under implementation could serve as learning sites and existing information could be systematized and revisited with a climate change adaptation lens.

This case demonstrates some strengths and weaknesses in the actions of local institutions to complement the national and European efforts in addressing climate change problems. Design/methodology/approach - The paper starts by considering the need to address global changes by a multi-level governance system, in line with the subsidiarity principle proposed by the European Commission for the implementation of its policies. According to this principle, different institutional levels should intervene through control and reduction of GHG emissions from their operational scale. In particular, this paper reports an ongoing activity of urban planning carried out by a local municipality of Northern Italy, Martellago (Venice Province), that has focused on the energy and GHG reduction as a priority. Findings - The analysis identified some topics to be addressed by urban plans; their higher or lower effectiveness in respect to the climate change adaptation and mitigation needs; and some constraints to be addressed by an enforced integration of different administrative levels of governance. Originality/value - This paper shows the importance of local planning in climate change issues, which is seldom considered, particularly in practice. In fact, while the elaboration of energy and urban plans is not mandatory for small municipalities, some voluntary actions - like for Martellago - show that their wide applications could contribute importantly to the efforts to decrease GHG emissions.","[Minoia, Paola; Zanetto, Gabriele] Univ Ca Foscari, Ctr IDEAS CESD, Venice, Italy; [Calzavara, Alessandro; Lovo, Loris] Agriteco Sc, Venice, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Minoia, P (corresponding author), Univ Ca Foscari, Ctr IDEAS CESD, Venice, Italy.",minoia@unive.it,"Minoia, Paola/AAF-9215-2020; Minoia, Paola/K-1806-2019; Minoia, Paola/G-9265-2015","Minoia, Paola/0000-0003-0760-5785; ",,,,,22,6,6,1,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Indeed, this move towards improved participatory approaches are increasingly framed as being integral to successful and sustainable management of coastal resources and spaces, including in the context of climate adaptation The effectiveness of the processes, structures and frameworks underpinning coastal community engagement has always been subject to external and internal drivers; however, the global threat posed by COVID-19 presented, and continues to present, an unexpected shift in approach, and the need for rapid adaptation by those of us working within these spheres. Using the Coastal Communities Adapting Together (CCAT) project as a case study, we explore how engagement with coastal communities and stakeholders in the project areas of Fingal, Ireland, and Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been impacted and forced to adapt as a result of COVID-19. Through a qualitative data collection process, we explore how project teams across different scales have rapidly adapted their models of community and stakeholder engagement, identify successes and failures, and explore challenges that have been faced. Finally, we consider if the legacy of COVID-19 has provided an opportunity for coastal community engagement approaches being used across the globe to become more diverse, adapting to new technologies and increasing accessibility and effectiveness. Insights identified as fundamental to successful adaptation and enhancing resilience include: a rapid response to change, adoption of a diversity of techniques, broadened participation and supported social learning and knowledge exchange.","[McKinley, E.; Ballinger, R.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Environm, Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3AT, Wales; [Crowe, P.

Previous studies have suggested the potential linkage of fish catch to bottom-up drivers such as ocean temperature or satellite-retrieved chlorophyll concentration across different global ecosystems. Robust estimation of bottom-up effects on global fisheries is, however, still challenging due to the lack of long-term observations of fisheries-relevant biotic variables on a global scale. Here, by using novel long-term biological and biogeochemical data reconstructed from a recently developed data assimilative Earth system model, we newly identified dominant drivers for fish catch in globally distributed coastal ecosystems. A machine learning analysis with the inclusion of reconstructed zooplankton production and dissolved oxygen concentration into the fish catch predictors provides an extended view of the links between environmental forcing and fish catch. Furthermore, the relative importance of each driver and their thresholds for high and low fish catch are analyzed, providing further insight into mechanistic principles of fish catch in individual coastal ecosystems. The results presented herein suggest the potential predictive use of their relationships and the need for continuous observational effort for global ocean biogeochemistry.","[Song, Hyo-Jong] Myongji Univ, Dept Environm Engn & Energy, Yongin 17058, South Korea; [Park, Jong-Yeon] Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Jeonju Si 54896, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea; [Park, Jong-Yeon] Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Environm & Energy Dept, Jeonju Si 54896, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea",Myongji University; Jeonbuk National University; Jeonbuk National University Hospital; Jeonbuk National University; Jeonbuk National University Hospital,"Park, JY (corresponding author), Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Jeonju Si 54896, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea.;Park, JY (corresponding author), Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Environm & Energy Dept, Jeonju Si 54896, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea.",hjsong@mju.ac.kr; jongyeon.park@jbnu.ac.kr,"park, jongyeon/AAR-1563-2021","Song, Hyo-Jong/0000-0001-7697-1370",National University Promotion Program in 2019; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2020R1C1C1008631]; NOAA's marine ecosystem tipping points initiative; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [2020R1F1A1072315],"National University Promotion Program in 2019; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); NOAA's marine ecosystem tipping points initiative; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)",This research was funded by the National University Promotion Program in 2019 and by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2020R1C1C1008631).

This adaptation is more important in regions where recurrent draughts and overexploitation of water resources happen. However, historical irrigation systems, such as the Real Acequia de Moncada (RAM) in Valencia, have found innovative approaches to deal with this phenomenon. This paper analyzes the case of Massamagrell and Pucol, which reused the treated waste-water of the closest waste-water treatment plant (WWTP). The study focused from a circular economy perspective on the technological, agronomical, and social implications of this decision. Results show that there are clear benefits for both farmers and WWTP managers. On the one hand, additional nutrients and regularity in their water supply benefit farmers. On the other, WWTP managers can reuse the treated effluent in the system, contributing to the closure of the water cycle and avoiding pumping the treated water into the sea. However, more detailed information and coordination is needed among the different stakeholders. Questions regarding the illegal connection of waste pipes with the traditional irrigation or the payment of pumping costs for reuse have gone unanswered, and there is a need for better reflection from all stakeholders.","[Hagenvoort, Joep] Wageningen Univ, Dept Int Land & Water Management, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Ortega-Reig, Mar] Univ Politecn Valencia, Ctr Valenciano Estudios Riego, Cami Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Botella, Salut] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Biotecnol, Cami Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Garcia, Carla; Palau-Salvador, Guillermo] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Ingn Rural & Agroalimentaria, Cami Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain; [de Luis, Ana] Univ Catolica Valencia, Fac Vet & Ciencias Expt, Dept Ciencias Expt & Matemat, C Guillem Castro 94, Valencia 46003, Spain",Wageningen University & Research; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Universidad Catolica de Valencia San Vicente Martir,"Palau-Salvador, G (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Ingn Rural & Agroalimentaria, Cami Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",guipasal@agf.upv.es,"Ortega-Reig, Mar/AAC-2860-2020; de Luis, Ana/R-6238-2018; Palau Salvador, Guillermo/F-7712-2016","Ortega-Reig, Mar/0000-0001-6798-7119; de Luis, Ana/0000-0002-0165-2655; Margarit, Andrei/0000-0001-9194-7352; Palau Salvador, Guillermo/0000-0003-0492-6567",,,,,36,11,11,4,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2019,11,9,,,,,,,1830,10.3390/w11091830,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11091830,,,15,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,JB8PJ,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000488834400093,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our findings suggest that developers of future educational programs consider the following: (a) the specific needs of their audience, including topical interests and learning needs; (b) the use of interdisciplinary teams for curricula development; (c) trade-offs associated with inclusivity and depth of course content; and (d) the advantages of project-based education approaches suited for adult learning audiences. By applying these concepts to future curricula, these curricula are likely to have the greatest level of impact.","[Schattman, Rachel E.] USDA, Northeast Climate Hub, 208D Aiken Ctr,81 Carrigan Dr, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Schattman, Rachel E.; Aitken, Hannah M.] Univ Vermont Extens, Burlington, VT USA; [Kaplan, Marjorie] Rutgers State Univ, Rutgers Climate Inst, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Helminski, Jennifer] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Geog, New Brunswick, NJ USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Rutgers State University New Brunswick,"Schattman, RE (corresponding author), USDA, Northeast Climate Hub, 208D Aiken Ctr,81 Carrigan Dr, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",rschattman@fs.fed.us,"Schattman, Rachel/AAX-4080-2020","Schattman, Rachel/0000-0001-7177-3914","USDA Joint Venture [14-JV-11232306-103]; Rutgers Climate Institute, University of Vermont Extension; USDA NIFA Award [2017-68002-26728]","USDA Joint Venture; Rutgers Climate Institute, University of Vermont Extension; USDA NIFA Award","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project was funded by USDA Joint Venture Agreement 14-JV-11232306-103, the Rutgers Climate Institute, University of Vermont Extension, and USDA NIFA Award #2017-68002-26728.",,52,0,0,1,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1477-9714,1479-7194,,J ADULT CONTIN EDUC,J.

In this discussion, such barriers are generally treated as having a uniform, negative impact on all actors. However, we argue that the precise nature and impact of such barriers on different actors has so far been largely overlooked. Our study of two drought-prone communities in rural Ethiopia sets out to examine how female- and male-headed households adapt to climate change, particularly focusing on how a variety of barriers influence the choice of adaptation measures to varying extents. To this purpose, we built a conceptual framework based on the Sustainable Livelihood Approach. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with male- and female-headed households, community leaders and local extension workers. Our findings suggest that gender-based differences in the choice of adaptation measures at the household level are driven by cultural, social, financial and institutional barriers. Barriers to adaptation-particularly when interacting-have a differentiated impact upon different actors. This outcome hints at the need for donors and policymakers to develop intervention strategies that are sensitive to this fact.","[Mersha, Azeb Assefa; Van Laerhoven, Frank] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Mersha, Azeb Assefa] Tilburg Univ, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Mersha, Azeb Assefa] Ethiopian Civil Serv Univ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Utrecht University; Tilburg University,"Mersha, AA (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.;Mersha, AA (corresponding author), Tilburg Univ, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.;Mersha, AA (corresponding author), Ethiopian Civil Serv Univ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",a.assefamerha@uu.nl; f.s.j.vanlaerhoven@uu.nl,"van Laerhoven, Frank/L-5913-2013","van Laerhoven, Frank/0000-0003-4282-7383; Mersha, Azeb Assefa/0000-0001-7885-8144", [NICHE/ETH/020],,"The research for this article is funded by the NICHE/ETH/020 Project, administered by Tilburg University, and the authors are grateful for the support.

However, there is a poor understanding of the relationship between city strategies on climate change mitigation and adaptation and the relevant policies at national and European level. This paper describes a comparative study and evaluation of cross-national policy. It reports the findings of studying the climate change strategies or plans from 200 European cities from Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. The study highlights the shared responsibility of global, European, national, regional and city policies. An interpretation and illustration of the influences from international and national networks and policy makers in stimulating the development of local strategies and actions is proposed. It was found that there is no archetypical way of planning for climate change, and multiple interests and motivations are inevitable. Our research warrants the need for a multi-scale approach to climate policy in the future, mainly ensuring sufficient capacity and resource to enable local authorities to plan and respond to their specific climate change agenda for maximising the management potentials for translating environmental challenges into opportunities.

This study focused on diurnal and seasonal SUHI variability, temporal trends and possible drivers in five major cities. Mean annual daytime SUHII ranged from 2.88 degrees C for Dhaka to 0.84 degrees C for Rajshahi, while nighttime intensity varied from 1.91 degrees C (Chittagong) to 0.30 degrees C (Sylhet). The pre-monsoon period exhibited the greatest magnitude and the seasonal amplitude during the winter season was positive for Dhaka and Khulna but negative for the other cities. Correlation analysis indicated that a dense city population, a high degree of imperviousness and the absence of greenery were likely to act singly, or in combination, to increase urban warming within these cities. An increasing warming trend during daytime was observed. The urban population of Bangladesh is projected to increase substantially in future (i.e., to 81.4 million by 2029), so the findings of this study provide valuable insights into this warming issue and will assist in the development of effective local-scale climate change adaptation plans.","[Dewan, Ashraf; Kiselev, Grigory; Botje, Dirk] Curtin Univ, Sch Earth & Planetary Sci, Kent St, Perth, WA 6102, Australia",Curtin University,"Dewan, A (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Sch Earth & Planetary Sci, Spatial Sci Discipline, Kent St, Perth, WA 6102, Australia.",a.dewan@curtin.edu.au,"; Dewan, Ashraf/O-2191-2015","Botje, Dirk/0000-0002-7498-3906; Dewan, Ashraf/0000-0001-5594-5464", [7188134],,"This study was partially supported by a project conducted for the World Bank (Grant number 7188134) in which A.

Ecological weed management (EWM) principles, including use of diverse tactics already employed by many farmers, may assist in adapting to and mitigating climate change. We systematically reviewed the literature on EWM and climate change and here summarise practical considerations related to changing efficacy and utility of non-chemical EWM practices. Localised changes in precipitation will affect tillage and cultivation. We expect that mulching, transplanting and some weed seedbank management strategies, which add resiliency to a weed management programme, may show increased utility in a future with more extreme and variable weather. Innovations in autonomous robotic weeding technologies and cultivation tool design show promise in helping to overcome challenges related to low and variable cultivation efficacy and traditionally slow working rates. EWM practices that help farmers achieve multiple objectives and provide benefits beyond climate change adaptation, such as financial gains, may be most advantageous, the development of which could be facilitated by interdisciplinary research and outreach efforts. Overall, we conclude that in an increasingly variable climate, farmers will have to employ a greater diversity of weed management tactics in order to spread risk and enable climate resilience through farming systems diversification.","[Gallandt, Eric R.] Univ Maine, Sch Food & Agr & Ecol, 5722 Deering Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Gallandt, Eric R.] Univ Maine, Environm Sci Program, 5722 Deering Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA",University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Gallandt, ER (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Sch Food & Agr & Ecol, 5722 Deering Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA.;Gallandt, ER (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Environm Sci Program, 5722 Deering Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",gallandt@maine.edu,,"Birthisel, Sonja/0000-0003-2892-8946; Clements, Ruth/0000-0002-9565-5653; Gallandt, Eric/0000-0001-6684-6250","University of Maine School of Food and Agriculture; University of Maine Ecology and Environmental Sciences Program; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch Project, 'Advancing physical and ecological strategies to improve weed management on organic farms' [1023881, ME022108]","University of Maine School of Food and Agriculture; University of Maine Ecology and Environmental Sciences Program; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch Project, 'Advancing physical and ecological strategies to improve weed management on organic farms'","We would like to thank Drs.

Estimation of the value of the cooling effect could help to strengthen the case for investment in a tree cover as a part of the urban infrastructure for climate change adaptation. This article aims to address this research gap by presenting a novel application of a replacement cost method using the costs of parasols for estimating the value of shade provided by urban trees. Using the method, we calculated the net present value of the shade from a generic tree and used these estimates in a case study in Prague, Czech Republic. The results showed that the costs of tree planting and maintenance were higher than the estimated shading benefits in the short term (20-30 years), but the situation reversed when the tree life expectancy increased (> 40 years). Street trees are hence a long-term investment in terms of microclimate regulation. The proposed approach can assist city planners with an assessment of microclimate regulation by urban trees as it can be easily applied with local data, and can complement other methods to show the wider benefits of urban trees.","[Horvathova, Eva; Badura, Tomas; Duchkova, Helena] Czech Acad Sci, Dept Human Dimens Global Change, Global Change Res Inst, Belidla 986-4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Horvathova, Eva] Mendel Univ Brno, Brno, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Mendel University in Brno,"Horvathova, E (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, Dept Human Dimens Global Change, V Jircharich 149-6, Prague 11000, Czech Republic.",horvathova.e@czechglobe.cz; badura.t@czechglobe.cz; duchkova.h@czechglobe.cz,"Horváthová, Eva/AAL-2442-2021; Badura, Tomas/AAE-7366-2020; Duchkova, Helena/HCH-9218-2022","Horváthová, Eva/0000-0003-1188-4895; Badura, Tomas/0000-0001-8264-0850; Duchkova, Helena/0000-0002-5022-8180",Czech Science Foundation (GACR) [20-18261S],Czech Science Foundation (GACR)(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"This work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (GACR), Grant No. 20-18261S.

To improve their adaptive capacity, the implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS) in urban areas has been identified as an appropriate action, giving urban planning and development an important role towards climate change adaptation/mitigation and risk management and resilience. However, the importance of extensively applying NBS is still underestimated, especially regarding its potential to induce significantly positive environmental and socioeconomic impacts across cities. Concerning environmental impacts, monitoring and evaluation is an important step of NBS management, where earth observation (EO) can contribute. EO is known for providing valuable disaggregated data to assess the modifications caused by NBS implementation in terms of land cover, whereas the potential of EO to uncover the role of NBS in urban metabolism modifications (e.g., energy, water, and carbon fluxes and balances) still remains underexplored. This study reviews the EO potential in the monitoring and evaluation of NBS implementation in cities, indicating that satellite observations combined with data from complementary sources may provide an evidence-based approach in terms of NBS adaptive management. EO-based tools can be applied to assess NBS' impacts on urban energy, water, and carbon balances, further improving our understanding of urban systems dynamics and supporting sustainable urbanization.","[Chrysoulakis, Nektarios; Somarakis, Giorgos; Stagakis, Stavros; Mitraka, Zina] Fdn Res & Technol Hellas FORTH, Inst Appl & Computat Math, Remote Sensing Lab, Iraklion 70013, Greece; [Stagakis, Stavros] Univ Basel, Dept Environm Sci, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Wong, Man-Sing] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ho, Hung-Chak] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Basel; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; University of Hong Kong,"Somarakis, G (corresponding author), Fdn Res & Technol Hellas FORTH, Inst Appl & Computat Math, Remote Sensing Lab, Iraklion 70013, Greece.",zedd2@iacm.forth.gr; somarage@iacm.forth.gr; stavros.stagakis@unibas.ch; mitraka@iacm.forth.gr; ls.charles@polyu.edu.hk; hcho21@hku.hk,"Somarakis, Giorgos/AAW-1834-2021; Stagakis, Stavros/O-4181-2014; Wong, Man Sing/A-2718-2014; Chrysoulakis, Nektarios/R-7341-2017","Somarakis, Giorgos/0000-0003-3910-6761; Stagakis, Stavros/0000-0001-6377-2268; Wong, Man Sing/0000-0002-6439-6775; Chrysoulakis, Nektarios/0000-0002-5208-626X; Mitraka, Zina/0000-0002-5884-1860","EU Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [870337]; General Research Fund, Hong Kong [15602619]","EU Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme; General Research Fund, Hong Kong","The research was partially conducted in the framework of the project CURE (http://curecopernicus.eu, accessed on 22 December 2020), that has received funding from the EU Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme, under Grant Agreement No 870337.

Climate-induced environmental change may increase the existing tension between conservation and visitor use as major tourism resources located in protected areas (PAs) are projected to undergo large-scale changes. This study draws upon the behavioural approach, scenario planning, and landscape visualizations to examine the relationship between climate change impacts, visitor perceptions, and visitor experience management at the Athabasca Glacier in Jasper National Park, Canada. Four tourism development scenarios defined by two management drivers (ecological integrity and visitor demand) with corresponding storylines and visualizations were developed for 2050. The visualized scenarios were presented to visitors (n=304) in a survey to understand potential implications on visitor satisfaction. The results suggest that park managers need to find a balance between ecological integrity and visitor use in a way that ensures commercialized tourism development is limited, educational material is prioritized, and ecological integrity is maintained. While understanding the behaviour of future tourists is complex, it is a critical component of climate change adaptation planning and decision-making processes that needs to be prioritized by policymakers and PAs managers.","[Weber, Melissa; Dawson, Jackie] Univ Ottawa, Dept Geog Environm & Geomat, Off 0021B,60 Univ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Groulx, Mark] Univ Northern British Columbia, Sch Environm Planning, Prince George, BC, Canada; [Lemieux, Christopher J.] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Scott, Daniel] Univ Waterloo, Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa; University of Northern British Columbia; Wilfrid Laurier University; University of Waterloo,"Weber, M (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Geog Environm & Geomat, Off 0021B,60 Univ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",mwebe093@uottawa.ca,"Scott, Daniel/AAB-6190-2020","Scott, Daniel/0000-0001-7825-9301; Lemieux, Christopher/0000-0002-4780-2006; Dawson, Jackie/0000-0002-3532-2742; Weber, Melissa/0000-0001-5916-0656",Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada [430-2012-0441]; Wilfrid Laurier University short-term research grant,Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Wilfrid Laurier University short-term research grant,This research was supported by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada under [grant number 430-2012-0441] and by a Wilfrid Laurier University short-term research grant.,,90,21,22,7,62,CHANNEL VIEW PUBLICATIONS,CLEVEDON,"FRANKFURT LODGE, CLEVEDON HALL, VICTORIA ROAD, CLEVEDON, BS21 7HH, ENGLAND",0966-9582,1747-7646,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

Sufficient information on the interplay between sector policies and the causes, impacts and response to climate change is relevant for developing sustainable climate change response plans. Using the agriculture sector as a case, this paper examines this interplay in the context of the humid forest zone (HFZ) of Cameroon. Drawing on secondary information from agriculture sector strategies, forest cover change, climate vulnerability and agriculture systems in the HFZ, we found that: (i) the objectives of agriculture expansion and avoided deforestation and forest degradation are at cross-roads; (ii) agriculture as a livelihood strategy is vulnerable to climate variability and change; (iii) strengthening agriculture production systems technically, materially and financially are main suggestions for climate resilient and low carbon emission agriculture practices. We highlight barriers that need to be addressed for the agriculture intensification mechanism, i.e. the agriculture research and extension services in Cameroon to respond to the needs of adaptation and carbon emission reductions from avoided deforestation. These barriers and others would be addressed if their financial, technology and capacity building needs are carefully evaluated as Cameroon mobilizes resources for the implementation of its National Determined Contributions.","[Chia, Eugene L.; Hubert, Didier] GIZ ProPFE, BP 7814, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Kankeu, Sufo R.] Yaounde HUB, Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, POB 2008, Messa Yaounde, Cameroon; [Kankeu, Sufo R.] Lab Espace & Societe ESO, Le Mans, France",CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),"Chia, EL (corresponding author), GIZ ProPFE, BP 7814, Yaounde, Cameroon.",lohchia@gmail.com; r.sufo@cgiar.org; didier.hubert@eco-consult.com,,"Richard, Sufo Kankeu/0000-0001-7001-1029",,,,,78,2,2,2,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1843,,,COGENT ENVIRON SCI,Cogent Environ.

Such conceptions can be problematic, generally assuming adaptation as an entirely positive and non-conflictual process. The purpose of this paper is to challenge such uncritical views, drawing attention to the conflictual nature of adaptation, and propose a theoretical framework facilitating the identification and analysis of conflicts in adaptation. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on case study research using first-hand narratives of adaptation in Nepal and the Maldives collected using qualitative interviews, participant observation and document analysis. Findings The findings identify conflicts between actors in, and around, communities that are adapting to changes. These conflicts can be categorized along three dimensions: qualitative differences in the type of conflict, the relative position of conflicting actors and the degree of manifestation of the conflict. Originality/value The three-dimensional Adaptation Conflict Framework facilitate analysis of conflicts in adaptation, allowing for a critical examination of subjectivities inherent in the adaptation discourses embedded in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation research and policy. Such an inquiry is crucial for interventions supporting community adaptation to reduce disaster risk.","[Lama, Phu Doma] Lund Univ, Div Risk Management & Societal Safety, Lund, Sweden; [Becker, Per] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden; [Becker, Per] North West Univ, Unit Environm Sci & Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa",Lund University; Lund University; North West University - South Africa,"Lama, PD (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Div Risk Management & Societal Safety, Lund, Sweden.",phu_doma.lama@risk.lth.se; per.becker@risk.lth.se,,"Becker, Per/0000-0001-9379-9461",,,,,57,2,2,1,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0965-3562,1758-6100,,DISASTER PREV MANAG,Disaster Prev.

We systematically compare the effects of cool walls to cool roofs, a heat mitigation strategy that has been widely studied and employed, using a consistent modeling framework (the Weather Research and Forecasting model). Adoption of cool walls leads to increases in urban grid cell albedo that peak in the early morning and late afternoon, when the ratio of solar radiation onto vertical walls versus horizontal surfaces is at a maximum. In Los Angeles County, daily average increase in grid cell reflected solar radiation from increasing wall albedo by 0.80 is 9.1 W m(-2), 43% of that for increasing roof albedo. Cool walls reduce canyon air temperatures in Los Angeles by 0.43 K (daily average), with the peak reduction (0.64 K) occurring at 09:00 LST and a secondary peak (0.53 K) at 18:00 LST. Per 0.10 wall (roof) albedo increase, cool walls (roofs) can reduce summertime daily average canyon air temperature by 0.05 K (0.06 K). Results reported here can be used to inform policies on urban heat island mitigation or climate change adaptation.","[Zhang, Jiachen; Mohegh, Arash; Li, Yun; Ban-Weiss, George] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Levinson, Ronnen] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Southern California; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Ban-Weiss, G (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",banweiss@usc.edu,"Zhang, Jiachen/AAK-7045-2020; Liu, Yifan/S-6217-2017","Zhang, Jiachen/0000-0003-4981-2328; Ban-Weiss, George/0000-0001-8211-2628","California Energy Commission [EPC-14-010]; National Science Foundation [CBET-1512429, 1752522]; Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Building Technologies Office of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","California Energy Commission; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Building Technologies Office of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This research was supported by the California Energy Commission under contract EPC-14-010 and the National Science Foundation under grants CBET-1512429 and 1752522.

A survey was conducted in order to prioritise the main constraints to production, to aid in future research planning, and to identify potential beneficial modifications to the current system. Three hundred and ninety one farmers were interviewed regarding their current farming system constraints, knowledge of conservation agriculture and their future plans in the Districts of Samlout in Battambang Province and Sala Krau in Pailin Province. Perceived major problems in the farming system were extreme climate events such as droughts and heavy rain, declining crop yields, and cash flow shortages, particularly in the pre-monsoon period. This is a plough based farming system, yet 66% of farmers had heard of conservation agriculture, and 59% wanted to learn more about conservation agriculture practices. Two thirds of farmers were interested in how to grow crops in the post-monsoon dry season on residual soil moisture. The survey highlighted opportunities for farmer education and adoption of farming system modifications to improve productivity and sustainability of the farming system in Northwest Cambodia, and assist with climate change adaptation.

However, urban ecosystems have not been incorporated adequately into urban governance and planning for resilience despite mounting evidence that urban resident health and wellbeing is closely tied to the quality, quantity, and diversity of urban ecosystem services. We suggest that urban ecosystem services provide key links for bridging planning, management and governance practices seeking transitions to more sustainable cities, and serve an important role in building resilience in urban systems. Emerging city goals for resilience should explicitly incorporate the value of urban ES in city planning and governance. We argue that cities need to prioritize safeguarding of a resilient supply of ecosystem services to ensure livable, sustainable cities, especially given the dynamic nature of urban systems continually responding to global environmental change. Building urban resilience of and through ecosystem services, both in research and in practice, will require dealing with the dynamic nature of urban social-ecological systems and incorporating multiple ways of knowing into governance approaches to resilience including from scientists, practitioners, designers and planners.

Heat stress in the workplace has been researched extensively in the past however, in the contemporary context of climate change, information is lacking on its extent and implications. The main factors found to exacerbate heat stress in the current and future workplace are the urban 'heat island effect', physical work, individual differences, and the developing country context where technological fixes are often not applicable. There is also a lack of information on the effects on vulnerable groups such as elderly people and pregnant women.

Those are enhanced by supportive climate adaptation policies at the sub-national level, which open up potential benefits and opportunities. Using the city of Melaka as a case study, this paper examines the importance of supportive climate adaptation policies using 'good practices' within a multi-level climate governance framework. This framework is evaluated by horizontal and vertical dimensions which assess policy actions designed to close the gap between national and local levels. Melaka is aiming to become a greener city, and its carbon reduction target is intended to support climate mitigation. This is discussed in relation to dynamic horizontal and vertical interactions at various scales. This study also examined why Melaka is considered a testing ground for climate mitigation projects that may subsequently be applied in other Malaysian states. A dual, collaborative, top-down and bottom-up approach and likely ways forward are also discussed as elements of good multi-level governance. The findings of this study should inform the application of multi-level governance in other states in Malaysia and elsewhere with similar ecological and economic contexts.","[Zen, Irina Safitri] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Kulliyyah Architecture & Environm Design, Jalan Gombak 51000, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Al-Amin, Abul Quasem] Univ Tenaga Nasl UNITEN, Inst Energy Policy & Res IEPRe, Kajang, Malaysia; [Al-Amin, Abul Quasem] MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Al-Amin, Abul Quasem; Doberstein, Brent] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Al-Amin, Abul Quasem] Univ Teknol Malaysia, AHIBS, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",International Islamic University Malaysia; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Waterloo; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Al-Amin, A (corresponding author), Univ Tenaga Nasl UNITEN, Inst Energy Policy & Res IEPRe, Kajang, Malaysia.",amin.cantt@gmail.com,"Al-Amin, Abul Quasem/AAH-4073-2019; Zen, Irina Safitri/M-6946-2013; Londe, Pedro/AAG-2267-2019","Al-Amin, Abul Quasem/0000-0002-6097-1197; Zen, Irina Safitri/0000-0002-7297-1979; ",Ministry of Education of Malaysia; UNITEN BOLD [10289176/B/9/2017/18]; UTM; UNITEN;  [18H14],Ministry of Education of Malaysia; UNITEN BOLD; UTM; UNITEN; ,"This work is part of the Tier 1, Research University Grant Vot.

This paper highlights the practices of adaptation to climate change by Indigenous reindeer herders, e.g., Saami and Komi-Izhemtsy, and Pomor fishermen, in the Russian Arctic. Our major research question is: How does the interplay of social and environmental factors determine traditional reindeer herding and fishing in the Russian North in the context of climate change, including seasonal changes? A qualitative methodology was used in both reindeer herding and fishing communities using the same interview guide. As an analytical lens, we chose resilience theory combined with the actor-network theory. Resilience theory allows us to situate the adaptive capacity of reindeer herders and fisherman within a constantly changing context. The actor-network theory offers a non-human-centered framework which allows the reconstruction of the networks that emerge in the context of adaptation and link humans, material objects, and the living environment. We found that the traditional economic activity of reindeer herders and fishermen is significantly affected by socio-economic and environmental factors. Both reindeer herders and fishermen manage to adapt to the changing environment using local knowledge and different kinds of technical tools. However, socio-economic conditions and accelerating climate change put the resilience of Indigenous communities at risk.","[Tysiachniouk, Maria S.] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Geog & Hist Studies, Yliopistokatu 7, Joensuu 80100, Finland",University of Eastern Finland,,konnov.arsene@gmail.com,,"Tysiachniouk, Maria/0000-0002-0754-6829",European Union [ENI/2018/404144]; Kone Foundation [202005986],European Union(European Commission); Kone Foundation,"Research for this article was sponsored by the European Union (grant no.

The glacier tourism sector that is highly sensitive towards changing climatic conditions is among the most relevant in this respect. This study aims to examine empirically how adaptation to climate change impacts is practiced by small- and middle-scale glacier tour operators. Data was collected by means of a set of semi-structured interviews with the managers or owners of nine small- or middle-scale tour companies operating in the Vatnajokull National Park in Southeast Iceland and observations of glacier sites where the respondents' companies are operating. The results indicate that all entrepreneurs consider climate change to be a real phenomenon that affects their present daily operations, but they perceive these implications not as significant threats to their business. The interaction of operator's attributes of agency such as firsthand experiences, risk perceptions, and abilities to self-organize, with structural elements of the glacier destination system such as economic rationales and hazard reduction institutions, has shaped and consolidated operators' adaptation processes in the form of a wait-and-see strategy combined with ad hoc reactive adaptation measures and postponed or prevented proactive long-term adaptation strategies.","[Welling, Johannes] Haskoli Isl, Reykjavik, Iceland; [Abegg, Bruno] Univ St Gallen, Res Ctr Tourism & Transport, Inst Syst Management & Publ Governance, Dufourstr 40a, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of Iceland; University of St Gallen,"Welling, J (corresponding author), Haskoli Isl, Reykjavik, Iceland.",h_welling@hi.is,,,Icelandic Tourism Research Centre; Friends of Vatnajokull,Icelandic Tourism Research Centre; Friends of Vatnajokull,"This research received financial support from the Icelandic Tourism Research Centre, the Friends of Vatnajokull, and the Hornafjorour Research Centre.",,73,14,15,1,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0020-7128,1432-1254,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

It is based on the resilience concept and the calculation, with a modelling chain, of three indicators: land stock, labour stock, and income flux. Two system states, base and climate change, and a time horizon of 2010-2025, are developed and compared for representative farming systems. The study shows that 55% of the farming systems were identified as being resilient to climate change. They are diversified and mostly grow cereals, vegetables, and forage crops combined with livestock, increasing their capability to mitigate climate change by reorganizing crop activities. 35% of the farms identified as being non-resilient are dominated by orchards, or cereals and orchards. They showed an important drop in farm income (-45%), mainly due to their inability to adapt their cropping systems to water stress and soil salinity. Finally, only 10% were identified as being poorly resilient farming systems. Those farms have mainly intensified cereal cropping systems based on a strategy of purchasing land to increase the surface area of profitable activities (forage and livestock). Overall, the methodology can be adapted for other dry land areas in the Mediterranean region and help experts and policy-makers to propose and test strategies for adapting to climate change.","[Souissi, Imen; Flichman, Guillermo; Belhouchette, Hatem] IAMM, CIHEAM, 3191 Route Mende, F-34093 Montpellier, France; [Souissi, Imen] INSTM, Ctr Goulette, Port De Peche 2060, La Goulette, Tunisia; [Boisson, Jean Marie] Univ Montpellier I, LAMETA, UMR5474, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Mekki, Insaf] INRGREF, BP 10, Ariana 2080, Tunisia; [Therond, Olivier] Univ Lorraine, INRA, UMR LAE, F-68021 Colmar, France; [Therond, Olivier] INP Toulouse, UMR 1248, AGIR, BP 52627, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Wery, Jacques] SupAgro Montpellier, UMR Syst, Bat 27,2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier 2, France; [Belhouchette, Hatem] IAMM, CIHEAM, UMR Syst, Bat 27,2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier 2, France",CIHEAM; CIHEAM IAM Montpellier; Universite de Montpellier; Institut National des Sciences et Technologies de la Mer; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Universite de Montpellier; Universite de Carthage; INRAE; Universite de Lorraine; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro,"Souissi, I (corresponding author), IAMM, CIHEAM, 3191 Route Mende, F-34093 Montpellier, France.;Souissi, I (corresponding author), INSTM, Ctr Goulette, Port De Peche 2060, La Goulette, Tunisia.",souissimen@yahoo.fr,"Belhouchette, Hatem/W-9549-2018","Belhouchette, Hatem/0000-0002-4498-0392; Mekki, Insaf/0000-0001-8140-1268; Imen, SOUISSI/0000-0003-4514-166X",,,,,56,8,8,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

In this paper, we analyse and compare the morphologies and sustainability potential of residential suburbs and their gardens in two case studies: Traditional-suburban and Modern-suburban in the Illawarra region of New South Wales. Spatial distributions of land-cover patterns were estimated using Geographic Information Systems (ArcGIS). The four sustainability parameters measured were: roof rain water collection; local food (vegetable) production; energy and CO2 emission savings from clothes lines; and carbon benefits of onsite tree canopy cover. Outcomes suggest that land cover such as tree canopy cover and other permeable and impermeable surfaces in garden spaces can significantly impact on sustainability. Impermeable surface cover is higher in the Modern-suburban compared to the Traditional-suburban development. Traditional-suburban is more capable of supporting environmental and ecological functions through better connectivity of green spaces and availability of onsite land areas for local food production. Modern-suburban has more capacity for roof rainwater collection due to larger building roof sizes, provided there is planning for sufficient tank spaces in the design phases. These results identify specific characteristics of two suburban forms which could make positive contributions to suburban sustainability. However, changes in behaviour would be essential to utilise these capabilities of suburban environments.","[Ghosh, Sumita] Univ Western Sydney, Urban Res Ctr, Parramatta, NSW 2150, Australia; Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",Western Sydney University; University of Wollongong,"Ghosh, S (corresponding author), Univ Western Sydney, Urban Res Ctr, Level 6,34 Charles St, Parramatta, NSW 2150, Australia.",s.ghosh@uws.edu.au,,"Ghosh, Sumita/0000-0001-6488-9329; Head, Lesley/0000-0002-5114-7614",,,,,48,26,27,3,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-9182,1465-3311,,AUST GEOGR,Aust.

A growing body of plan evaluation literature seeks to measure the quality of these plans, given that higher-quality plans may be more likely to achieve their objectives (e.g., reducing a community's losses from flooding). Processes of collaboration (i.e., joint decision-making by various agencies and stakeholders) and diffusion (i.e., the spread of ideas between jurisdictions over time and space), among others, may influence plan quality, although empirical evidence is limited. This study assessed potential predictors of plan quality for 33 county-level hazard mitigation plans in Washington State, using a combination of survey data, county characteristics, and previously determined plan quality scores. Significant predictors of plan quality included indicators of vertical (state-to-county) and horizontal (county-to-county) diffusion, as well as economic capacity, although indicators of collaborative dynamics, along with several other hypothesized predictors, including past disaster experience (i.e., severity) were not significant. Hazard planning professionals at the federal, state, and local levels may benefit from integrating these findings into future work, in conjunction with other climate change adaptation initiatives. Specifically, fostering peer-to-peer interactions between counties might help to produce and disseminate knowledge about climate solutions.","[Feinberg, Daniel S.] Kean Univ, Sch Environm & Sustainabil Sci, 1000 Morris Ave, Union, NJ 07083 USA; [Feinberg, Daniel S.] Monmouth Univ, Dept Chem & Phys, 400 Cedar Ave, West Long Branch, NJ 07764 USA",Monmouth University,"Feinberg, DS (corresponding author), Kean Univ, Sch Environm & Sustainabil Sci, 1000 Morris Ave, Union, NJ 07083 USA.;Feinberg, DS (corresponding author), Monmouth Univ, Dept Chem & Phys, 400 Cedar Ave, West Long Branch, NJ 07764 USA.",danielscottfeinberg@gmail.com,,"Feinberg, Daniel/0000-0003-0760-4539",Washington Sea Grant [R/RCE-4],Washington Sea Grant,This study was partially funded by Washington Sea Grant (Project No. R/RCE-4).,,65,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

At the same time, increasing awareness of the importance of municipalities acting in climate change adaptation leads to a higher demand for urban climate modelling. In this study we use MUKLIMO_3 model for a simulation of spatiotemporal pattern of air temperature in Prague and Brno. Our aim is to simulate theoretical land cover modifications and their potential impacts on air temperature during a heat wave event. The model suggests that an albedo increased by 0.25 leads to a difference of -0.2 degrees C in daily average temperature in both Prague and Brno while an albedo increased by 0.5 leads to a daily average temperature difference of -0.5 degrees C in Prague and - 0.4 degrees C in Brno. Increasing the number of trees by 30% generally leads to higher temperatures during daytime and lower temperatures during night-time. In most neighbourhoods the cooling effect of additional trees was 0.0 degrees C to -0.2 degrees C on the daily average. In some cases of compact midrise development, additional trees might even cause an increase in temperature.

To address this gap, a numerical model sediment transport study was developed to identify controlling factors and mechanisms for sediment headland bypassing potential. Four idealized headlands were designed to investigate sediment flux around the headlands using the process-based hydrodynamic model Delft-3D and spectral wave model SWAN. The 120 simulations explored morphologies, substrate compositions, sediment grain sizes, and physical forcings (i.e., tides, currents, and waves) commonly observed in natural settings. A generalized analytical framework based on flow disruption and sediment volume was used to refine which factors and conditions were more useful to address sediment bypassing. A bypassing parameter was developed for alongshore sediment flux between upstream and downstream cross-shore transects to determine the degree of blockage by a headland. The shape of the headland heavily influenced the fate of the sediment by changing the local angle between the shore and the incident waves, with oblique large waves generating the most flux. All headlands may allow sediment flux, although larger ones blocked sediment more effectively, promoting their ability to be littoral cell boundaries. The controlling factors on sediment bypassing were determined to be wave angle, size, and shape of the headland, and sediment grain size.","[George, Douglas A.; Largier, John L.] Univ Calif Davis, POB 247, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA; [Pasternack, Gregory Brian] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Hydrol Sci, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Barnard, Patrick L.; Storlazzi, Curt D.; Erikson, Li H.] US Geol Survey, Pacific Coastal & Marine Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"George, DA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, POB 247, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA.",dgeorge@ucdavis.edu; jlargier@ucdavis.edu; gpast@ucdavis.edu; pbarnard@usgs.gov; cstorlazzi@usgs.gov; lerikson@usgs.gov,"Pasternack, Gregory Brian/B-8619-2012","Pasternack, Gregory Brian/0000-0002-1977-4175","USC Sea Grant Program, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, US Department of Commerce [NA14OAR4170089]","USC Sea Grant Program, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, US Department of Commerce","This research was funded by the USC Sea Grant Program, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, US Department of Commerce, grant number NA14OAR4170089.",,78,9,9,4,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1312,,J MAR SCI ENG,J.

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that these challenges must be better understood before effective and sustainable adaptation is possible. Design/methodology/approach Understanding past livelihood impacts from climate change can help design and operationalize future interventions. In addition, globalization has had uneven effects on island countries/jurisdictions, producing situations especially in archipelagoes where there are significant differences between core and peripheral communities. This approach overcomes the problems that have characterized many recent interventions for climate-change adaptation in island contexts which have resulted in uneven and at best only marginal livelihood improvements in preparedness for future climate change. Findings Island contexts have a range of unique vulnerability and resilience characteristics that help explain recent and proposed responses to climate change. These include the sensitivity of coastal fringes to climate-environmental changes: and in island societies, the comparatively high degrees of social coherence, closeness to nature and spirituality that are uncommon in western contexts. Research limitations/implications Enhanced understanding of island environmental and social contexts, as well as insights from past climate impacts and peripherality, all contribute to more effective and sustainable future interventions for adaptation.

Especially in emerging countries they are becoming the dominant paradigm of the future urbanization, representing a sustainability challenge both from the point of view of energy and resource consumption, and from the point of view of climate change adaptation and mitigation. In this paper we compare the energy metabolism in 27 of the world's megacities including details of mobile and stationary energy consumption patterns, fuels used, as well as end-use patterns and electricity generation mix. Our results show that per capita total energy consumption scales with urban population density according to a power law characterized by the universal -3/4 scaling, pointing out that compact cities are more energy efficient with respect to dispersed cities. By comparing energy sources and sectoral end use, also focusing on electricity use and generation source, we found a significant regionalization of energy metabolism, and we discuss the implication for resilience, infrastructure planning, GHG emissions, and policies for infrastructure decarbonization. The comparison of the energy metabolism can lead to a more appropriate management of energy use patterns and electricity generation mix in megacities, giving insights on strategies to improve urban energy efficiency and reducing environmental pressure of megacities.

With poor building thermal insulation and lacking artificial heating, indoor space in winter in subtropics can become uncomfortably cold with health implications for elderly and weak people. This experimental study established two extensive green roofs on a residential building in humid-subtropical Hong Kong. Broadleaved Perennial Peanut (Arachis pintoi) and succulent Mexican- Sedum (Sedum mexicanum) plots were compared with bare concrete-tile Control Plot. Temperature sensors were installed along a holistic vertical temperature profile. Three apartments below the plots were left vacant to permit undisturbed monitoring. At Control Plot, notable heat loss especially in nighttime induces upward heat flux to cool indoor air. Vegetated roofs provide receptor and repository of solar energy as sensible heat to generate green-roof heat-sink effect (GHE). The porous substrate stores interstitial water to augment thermal capacity, conductivity and GHE. Warmer green-roof vis-A-vis cooler ceiling generates a thermal gradient to induce downward heat flux to warm indoor space. Peanut Plot with thicker substrate creates a stronger GHE than Sedum. Extensive green roofs in subtropical areas offer passive warming to indoor space in winter, with implications on indoor-heating energy consumption for a progressively aging population and climate-change adaptation.

This study examines how climate adaptation plans of small American cities and counties consider equity in their climate vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning goals and how consideration of equity in existing adaptation plans relates to the inclusion of diverse categories of stakeholders. Data analysis is based on the content of 23 local climate adaptation plans of small urban and rural municipalities across the United States with populations of less than 300 thousand people. Correlations between conceptualization of vulnerability dimensions, inclusion of 9 categories of stakeholders, and consideration of equity in 12 different domains of climate adaptation planning are examined. The study concludes that municipalities that engage more diverse groups of stakeholders and examine the sensitivity and adaptive capacity of their populations appear to be more attentive to social equity and more likely to offer specific climate adaptation measures focusing on vulnerable groups.","[Lioubimtseva, Elena] Grand Valley State Univ, Geog & Sustainable Planning Dept, Allendale, MI 49401 USA",Grand Valley State University,"Lioubimtseva, E (corresponding author), Grand Valley State Univ, Geog & Sustainable Planning Dept, Allendale, MI 49401 USA.",lioubime@gvsu.edu,,,Grand Valley State University Libraries Open Access Publishing Support Fund,Grand Valley State University Libraries Open Access Publishing Support Fund,"I would like to thank Professor Charlotte da Cunha of the University of Versailles for fruitful collaboration on methodological frameworks for monitoring local climate adaptation plans discussed in our joint papers cited here.

This study aims to define a framework for the evaluation of environmental health and comfort parameters applicable to simulation tools, with a specific focus on thermal and environmental exchanges between indoor and outdoor spaces, to define those factors that affect the perception of user's well-being in thermal stress conditions (e.g., heatwaves), both indoor and outdoor. Through the definition of two study cases in the city of Naples, Italy, special attention was paid to investigating the interaction between outdoor and indoor performance when urban temperatures rise. A comparison between a daily survey for occupants and simulations was conducted to confirm the validity of the data obtainable from the perceived thermal sensations. The obtained results show that the designed framework can reliably simulate real outdoor and indoor conditions according to comfort indices such as the predicted mean vote and adaptive comfort model. The methodological framework developed can guarantee the interoperability of data to simulate indoor and outdoor environments responding to real conditions and determine a favourable condition for the development of urban redevelopment interventions through the application of climate adaptive design strategies.","[Bassolino, Eduardo] Univ Naples Federico II, Dipartimento Architettura DiARC, I-80138 Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Bassolino, E (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dipartimento Architettura DiARC, I-80138 Naples, Italy.",eduardo.bassolino@unina.it,,"Bassolino, Eduardo/0000-0002-6255-0775",,,,,43,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,NOV,2022,13,11,,,,,,,1835,10.3390/atmos13111835,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13111835,,,24,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,6A9LU,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000880968900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate adaptation plans have prioritized water saving to prevent the devastating consequences of drought. To develop such adaptation plans, it is critical to understand the water-use patterns of cities. The present research determines the water consumption for irrigation of green spaces and residential gardens in metropolitan area of Santiago, Chile (MAS) and compares this consumption with the expected vegetation water requirements estimated using a hydrological model. The monthly water consumption was obtained from a database of drinking water meters provided by the private water utility serving most of the MAS, which includes 110 large parks and 1882 small parks. The MAS shows higher water consumption during the summer dry months (November to April). The water use for irrigation is higher than the modelled demand of vegetation, which entails a significant chance to save water. The irrigation rate of public spaces is lower than private spaces, and closer to the modelled demand. In all cases, the landscaping based on extensive lawn surfaces seems to be the main driver of over-irrigation. Further research is required to study the trade-offs between the urban green benefits and the costs of irrigation in semi-arid and Mediterranean cities.","[Reyes-Paecke, Sonia; Melo, Oscar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Agron & Ingn Forestal, Ave Vicuna Mackenna, Santiago 4860, Chile; [Gironas, Jorge; Vicuna, Sebastian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ingn, Dept Ingn Hidraul & Ambiental, Ave Vicuna Mackenna, Santiago 4860, Chile; [Reyes-Paecke, Sonia; Gironas, Jorge; Herrera, Josefina] Ctr Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable CEDEUS, Santiago 1963, Chile; [Gironas, Jorge; Melo, Oscar; Vicuna, Sebastian] Ctr Cambio Global PUC, Ave Vicuna Mackenna, Santiago 4860, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Reyes-Paecke, S (corresponding author), Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",sonia.reyes@uc.cl; jgironas@ing.puc.cl; omelo@uc.cl; svicuna@ing.puc.cl,"Vicuna, Sebastian/M-2747-2016; melo, oscar/AAC-7164-2020; Gironás, Jorge/F-8297-2013; REYES-PAECKE, SONIA/E-3746-2015","Vicuna, Sebastian/0000-0001-6971-0068; melo, oscar/0000-0002-9136-5413; Gironás, Jorge/0000-0002-6933-2658; REYES-PAECKE, SONIA/0000-0001-5888-1507",IDRC [107081-001]; CONICYT [CONICYT/FONDAP 15110020],IDRC; CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)),"We would like to thank Aguas Andinas SA for supplying the water consumption data, as well as Parque Metropolitano for facilitating the conduct of interviews and to provide valuable information for this study.

The adoption of water harvesting (WH) is examined as one possible strategy to better conserve agricultural resources and increase production. A case study approach based in Burkina Faso is used to explore farmers' attitudes to innovation via a qualitative methodology. Farmers' experiences of WH adoption and use over time are considered in relation to the 'bright spots' discourse to enable the identification of further lessons about adoption drivers for innovations aimed at reducing risk and vulnerability in small-scale agriculture. By rethinking the conceptualisation and definition of WH adoption, as well as considering use of the techniques over time rather than at the point of initial adoption alone, this research provides evidence of the dynamic nature of WH adoption and use by farmers. It demonstrates that adoption is not a dichotomous decision and that levels of intensification, modification, abandonment and replacement by farmers vary over time. Use of the sustainable rural livelihood framework highlights how this can be linked to the dynamic nature of the systems within which farmers derive their livelihoods and the need to continually adapt to dynamic, irregular and uncertain conditions (vulnerability context). These lessons from MI experience in Burkina Faso have wider implications for the promotion of climate adaptation innovations for small-scale farmers in SSA.","[Bunclark, Lisa; Gowing, John; Oughton, Elizabeth] Newcastle Univ, Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Ouattara, Korodjouma; Ouoba, Sidonie; Benao, Diane] Inst Environm & Rech Agr INERA, BP 10, Koudougou, Burkina Faso",Newcastle University - UK,"Bunclark, L (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",lisa.a.bunclark@gmail.com,,,European Community [266360],European Community(European Commission),"This work was supported by the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme [FP7/2007-2013] under the WHaTeR project (Water Harvesting Technologies Revisited) [grant number 266360].

J,"Allen, F",,,,"Allen, Fidelis",,,Nigeria: Decolonial Climate Adaptation and Conflict. Evidence from Coastal Communities of the Niger Delta,CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Decolonisation; climate; adaptation; development; Africa; Nigeria; coastal commu-nities,,"The paper proceeds on the assumption that decoloniality matters in tackling the global climate crisis, conflict, and development at the community level across countries with high vulnerabilities. Africa remains one of the most vulnerable regions in the world. By examin-ing what decolonisation means in climate adaptation and the experience of six communities in three states in the Niger Delta of Nigeria, this article contributes to the conceptualisation of the decolonial discourse of climate adaptation, development and conflict understood as conditions favourable to the crisis. I analysed qualitative data obtained from the coastal communities through observation, focus group discussions, and interviews. The results showed a reinforcement of positions in a segment of the literature on decolonial climate adaptation in communities in some parts of the world. Migration, alternative sources of livelihood, embarkment of shorelines, skills development, vocations, and infrastructure development are among legitimate adaptive mea-sures local communities are adopting. At the same time, maladaptive measures such as piracy, kidnapping, illegal oil refining, and gangsterism are common. These antisocial behaviours lead to conflict and contribute to making climate change a very complex problem. Decolonial climate ad-aptation requires collaborative interventions at the level of the community, sub-national, nation-al, and multilateral fronts. The fact that climate change is a global problem with unequal impact means that the capacity to respond well to it at the community, sub-national, national, regional, continental, and international levels is crucial in addressing the crisis. The role of decoloniality in the handling of the effects of climate change in the community may take the form of integration of local and western knowledge. The decolonial framework would appear to be elastic with a potential conceptual role of critical assessment of existing frameworks, outcomes, impact, and power relations. One of the striking messages in this analysis is the likely role of local knowledge in reducing the risk of social tension and criminal conflict, and the need to strengthen it to in-crease the resilience and well-being of people.","[Allen, Fidelis] Univ Port Harcourt, Dept Polit & Adm Studies, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria; [Allen, Fidelis] Univ Johannesburg, Inst Pan African Thought & Conversat, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Port Harcourt; University of Johannesburg,"Allen, F (corresponding author), Univ Port Harcourt, Dept Polit & Adm Studies, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria.;Allen, F (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Inst Pan African Thought & Conversat, Johannesburg, South Africa.",idelis.allen@uniport.edu.ng,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,0,ACCENT PUBLISHER,CLUJ NAPOCA,"ACCENT PUBLISHER, CLUJ NAPOCA, 00000, ROMANIA",2285-7605,,,CONFL STUD Q,Confl.

This article describes how climate change and extreme weather impact vulnerable riparian communities and settlements. The analysis is done by reviewing past research and empirical case studies from riparian rural communities of the impact zone of the Sundarbans in Bangladesh, the world's most extensive mangrove forest. The article discusses the climate-related impacts on households through a Severity Index of Vulnerability and assesses the adaptation responses they may pursue. The principal climate-related vulnerabilities and impacts due to increases in temperature, storm surges, sea flooding, and sea-level rise are seawater intrusion and riverbank erosion. Many households have adopted several autonomous reactive adaptation strategies rather than planned ones, to cope with these impacts. However, government organisations and NGOs provide less than optimal technical and financial support to households for planned and anticipatory adaptive responses. The main barriers to adaptation were the high cost of improved crop varieties, inadequate agricultural extension services, and a lack of knowledge on effective climate adaptation. The restoration of the mangrove ecosystem may increase its resilience and, among other things, make local communities less exposed. The article also presents some adaptation measures proper to reduce the climate-related vulnerability of riparian settlements.","[Leal Filho, Walter; Wolf, Franziska; Kovaleva, Marina] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Res & Transfer Ctr Sustainable Dev & Climate Chan, Hamburg, Germany; [Leal Filho, Walter] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Alam, G.

Forest fragmentation not only poses a threat to many organisms but also reduces the resistance and resilience of the ecosystem, which is especially relevant to the ongoing climate crisis. The effects of recent extreme heat years on forests in Germany have not been studied in detail for the influence of fragmentation. We investigate the relation of forest fragmentation with temperature and vitality in Germany per ecoregion at the canopy level using satellite imagery at 1-km and 30-m resolution. We compiled and correlated forest maps for connectivity based on Thiessen polygons, canopy temperatures on the hottest days based on land surface temperature, and forest vitality based on the maximum normalized difference vegetation index per growing season. We differentiated between ecoregions and main forest types. In 2022, larger intact tree-covered areas that are less fragmented have relatively low temperatures on hot days and higher overall vitality. Nearly 98% of the almost 1.95 million forest fragments at 30-m resolution in Germany are smaller than 1 km(2), which cover nearly 30% of the total forest area. To counteract the forest crisis, forest and landscape management should aim to reduce fragmentation and maintain tree biomass and forest cover in the landscape. Increasing the size of continuous forest fragments contributes to ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change.","[Mann, Deepika; Gohr, Charlotte; Blumroeder, Jeanette S. S.; Ibisch, Pierre L.

This study used Shenzhen, a sub-tropical megacity in southern China, as an example for evaluating the climate environment, heat island intensity, and urban form, and then for analyzing the relationships between them. The results revealed a high-quality climate area located southeast of Shenzhen that can provide a high wind speed and low temperature. Low-quality climate areas were located in the central and western regions and were less comfortable. The relationship between surface ventilation potential and urban form was analyzed using linear regression and the Pearson correlation coefficient, showing that there was a significant correlation between a surface urban heat island (SUHI) and building density (BD) as well as the sky view factor (SVF), and that there was also a correlation between the ventilation potential coefficient (VPC) and other factors, such as the surface's roughness length (RL) and building height (BH). The results showed that ventilation capacity deteriorated as BH and RL increased. An environmentally sensitive thermal area was identified from the surface urban heat island intensity, which was always in a strong heat island (SHI) or sub-strong heat island (SSHI) year-round. It was recommended that seven level one corridors and nine level two corridors be formed. Additionally, thermal and wind environment optimization strategies and protective suggestions were proposed for the city's overall development.","[Zhang, Shuo; Fang, Xiaoyi; Cheng, Chen; Yu, Ying] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Chen, Liuxin] Shenzhen Planning & Dev Res Ctr, Shenzhen 518034, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Li; Luo, Hongyan] Meteorol Bur Shenzhen Municipal, Shenzhen 518040, Peoples R China; [Li, Lei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Sun Yat Sen University,"Fang, XY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",fangxy@cma.gov.cn,,"Li, Lei/0000-0001-6401-1460","Ministry of Natural Resources of the PRC [TC2101050/2]; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences [2021Z001, 2020KJ024]",Ministry of Natural Resources of the PRC; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences,This research was funded by the sub-item of the major supplementary research project of the Ministry of Natural Resources of the PRC on territorial spatial planning system: A study of territorial spatial pattern in the new development stage (No. TC2101050/2); And the APC was funded by the basic research fund of the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (No. 2021Z001); and the science and technology development fund of the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (No. 2020KJ024).,,29,0,0,9,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,SEP,2022,13,9,,,,,,,1395,10.3390/atmos13091395,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13091395,,,18,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,4V3FU,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000859367100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper reviews Oklahoma's wheat breeding program over the past several decades with an emphasis on the economic aspects and planning of future breeding strategies. Over the past century, Oklahoma's wheat yields have increased but the productivity gains have been offset in part due to increased yield variability. The shift to improved wheat varieties has resulted in increased susceptibility to plant disease and pest pressure. While a few varieties introduced over the past few decades have dominated the wheat seed market, recent trends indicate producers are adopting a more diverse range of wheat varieties. Producers' concerns have expanded beyond demands for high yielding varieties to include more market oriented needs to increase protein content and test weight. This paper identifies several key policy instruments that Oklahoma stakeholders and policy makers should consider when planning future breeding strategies. A critical need is to assist Oklahoma producers in adapting to climate change by developing drought and heat resistant wheat varieties. Marketing new varieties would be improved and revenue increased if more innovative pricing structures were adopted to better align producers' willingness to pay with seed development costs, which could then be re-invested in breeding. Research budgets, which have remained stagnant in real terms, will need to be increased to adequately address producers' needs into the 21st century.","[Vitale, Jeffrey; Adam, Brian] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Vitale, Pilja] Northern Oklahoma Coll, Div Business, Tonkawa, OK 74653 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Vitale, J (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",jeffrey.vitale@okstate.edu; brian.adam@okstate.edu; pilja.vitale@noc.edu,"Adam, Brian/E-7781-2013","Adam, Brian/0000-0002-5430-0880","U.S. Department of Agriculture Project [0500-00044-012-00D, OKL02948]",U.S. Department of Agriculture Project,Funding for the research was provided in part by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Project 0500-00044-012-00D and Hatch Grant OKL02948.,,89,4,5,3,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,FEB,2020,10,2,,,,,,,238,10.3390/agronomy10020238,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10020238,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,KW7LO,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000521366400032,View Full Record in Web of Science

The objective of this paper is to provide a categorization and extent of agroforestry practices linked to agricultural and forest lands at regional level and evaluate how are they promoted by the previous (2007-2013) and current CAP (2014-2020) with a special focus on climate change mitigation potential. Agroforestry occupies almost 20 million hectares in Europe, being silvopasture and homegardens the most extensively spread practices and forest farming not quantified. Agroforestry practices are promoted at European level but in a really complex form as more than 25 measures are implemented to enhance the existing 5 agroforestry practices (silvopasture, silvoarable, riparian buffer strips, forest farming and homegardens). Simplification of the number of measures to promote agroforestry practices is needed to better follow up the implementation and to evaluate and provide future policies more adapted at European levels. Huge potential climate change mitigation options should be focused on the use of silvopasture on forest lands to reduce forest fires and to increase the presence of the woody component on arable lands (silvoarable) but also on the promotion of forest farming and homegardens as forms to increase the use of short supply chains and to increase the connection of urban, periurban and rural areas within a bioeconomy and circular economy framework.","[Mosquera-Losada, M.

Research work on adaptation and mitigation particularly emphasizes on cities and mega-cities as a natural consequence of their agglomeration of people and assets. Less focus is put on smaller coastal communities and their challenges, one of which is a lack of local expertise and knowledge. Adaptation to climate change is often a local governance level task, however. Co-work between municipal and national authorities, the utility company, research, business, consultants and citizens has resulted in a common framework to address and deal with water-related challenges in a Danish coastal community. From an assessment of combined impacts of climate change (i.e. sea level rise and storm surges, precipitation and cloudbursts and associated groundwater level responses) and stresses from degrading sewer systems and land subsidence, impact zones are mapped. The multi-player, end-user defined work transcends sectors and builds capacity by sharing data and knowledge. It mainstreams climate change issues into business, management, planning and early warning: the overall goal is an adaptation strategy unfolded from stakeholder involvement and responsibility, cost-effective decision making, climate-related asset management processes and a holistic livable cities approach to this highly vulnerable coastal community.

The model consists of 4 sub-models: mussel growth, phytoplankton population, the effect of seawater quality on mussel density, and the influence of atmospheric parameters on seawater quality. The integrated model was constructed by STELLA software and was calibrated with field observation data. The model was employed to simulate the impact of climate change on mussels based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: The Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) projection. Results demonstrated that mussel production varied due to differences in the available phytoplankton, the initial mussel weight, the cultivation period, the air temperature, and the rainfall pattern. The model simulations showed that under the greater radiative forcing scenario (Representative Concentration Pathways: RCPs), higher rainfall and air temperatures resulted in salinity reduction and thermal stress on green mussels. Consequently, mussel production was forecasted to decline over time. The simulations also revealed that during extreme weather events, low mussel density, high aeration, and being far from freshwater discharge could avoid mass mussel mortality. Using the results of the developed model, an appropriate cultivation period can be forecasted. However, it depends on the site-specific climate pattern in each cultivation area. Results can be employed as a climate change adaptation tool for mussel farmers. Finally, the information can assist other researchers interested in sustainable mussel cultivation under extreme events.","[Srisunont, Chayarat] Bansomdejchaopraya Rajabhat Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Environm Sci & Technol Program, 1061 Itsaraphap 15 Rd, Bangkok 10600, Thailand; [Srisunont, Treeranut] Valaya Alongkorn Rajabhat Univ Royal Patronage, Fac Sci & Technol, Khlong Luang 13180, Pathum Thani, Thailand; [Babel, Sandhya] Thammasat Univ, Sirindhorn Int Inst Technol SIIT, Sch Biochem Engn & Technol, POB 22, Pathum Thani 12121, Thailand",Bansomdejchaopraya Rajabhat University; Valaya Alongkorn Rajabhat University; Thammasat University,"Babel, S (corresponding author), Thammasat Univ, Sirindhorn Int Inst Technol SIIT, Sch Biochem Engn & Technol, POB 22, Pathum Thani 12121, Thailand.",sandhya@siit.tu.ac.th,,,Thailand Research Fund (TRF); Office of the Higher Education Commission (OHEC) [MRG6180223],Thailand Research Fund (TRF)(Thailand Research Fund (TRF)); Office of the Higher Education Commission (OHEC),"This research was financially supported by the Thailand Research Fund (TRF) and the Office of the Higher Education Commission (OHEC) , Grant No. MRG6180223.

Constructed analog is one of a common statistical downscaling methodology for spatial downscaling of large domain. It has challenges to reproduce extreme climate and wet-dry conditions due to combination of multiple analogs. To address this challenge, localized constructed analog (LOCA) method was developed. The global applicability of LOCA has not been reviewed, and there is a limitation in that the analog domain is spatially discontinuous and too extensive for localization. Therefore, in this study, the global applicability of the localized analog method was evaluated for the Asia region, and the bias corrected climate informed analog (BCIA) method, a localized analog method based on climate information, was proposed to overcome the limitation of existed method. The localized analogs have 7-36% higher skill for monthly and seasonal climate and at least 20 higher skill score for climate indices than unlocalized analog. Localized methods have significant advantages in reproducing the extreme and the wet-dry indices. Therefore, the global applicability of the localized analog method was confirmed. The analog dates in BCIA showed highly better qualities than those of LOCA. In downscaling performance, BCIA was superior to LOCA, and, it has a significant advantage in the index related to precipitations by more than 10% in skill score. Therefore, in the global application of localized techniques, BCIA can be utilized as a promising method.","[Kim, Seon-Ho; Kim, Jeong-Bae; Bae, Deg-Hyo] Sejong Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 209 Neungdong Ro, Seoul, South Korea",Sejong University,"Bae, DH (corresponding author), Sejong Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 209 Neungdong Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",dhbae@sejong.ac.kr,,"Kim, Jeong-Bae/0000-0002-6121-7751; sejongdaehaggyo, gimseonho/0000-0002-1217-2075",Korea Environmental Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI) through the Water Management Research Program - Ministry of Environment (MOE) of Korea [130747]; Sejong University [20210595],"Korea Environmental Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI) through the Water Management Research Program - Ministry of Environment (MOE) of Korea(Korea Environmental Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI)Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea); Sejong University","This work was supported by the Korea Environmental Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI) through the Water Management Research Program, funded by the Ministry of Environment (MOE) of Korea (No. 130747) and the faculty research fund of Sejong University in 2021 (No. 20210595).",,55,0,0,2,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

As a result, this review article draws on actual findings and lessons learned from various places in Ethiopia to assess the country's achievements and opportunities when it comes to RWH, as well as to guide future alternatives toward its sustainability. RWH acts as a tie throughout the rainy season's dry spells, benefiting human and livestock consumption as well as crop production through irrigation. So, for the victory of well-organized rain water collection, watershed treatment, seepage and evaporation control, soil and water conservation, conservation tillage, and integration of low-cost water lifting techniques and family drip systems should all be feasible. Given that the country is not further modernized, it has ancient dated experiences on the operation and exploitation of RWH systems. Aside from financial inadequacies, historical and political instability, lack of understanding among farmers, and resistance to new technologies, the country has opportunities and has made some progress on rainwater harvesting systems. In general, rainwater harvesting could enable smallholder farmers to diversify their crops, thereby enhancing household food security, dietary status, and economic return. In addition, the much-needed green revolution and climate change adaptations should combine rainwater harvesting ideas with agronomic principles in the country. More work is needed to strengthen indigenous practices and share best practices to a larger scale.","[Roba, Negash Tessema; Hishe, Birhanu Kindshih] Haramaya Univ, Haramaya Inst Technol, Dept Water Resources & Irrigat Engn, POB 138, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia; [Kassa, Asfaw Kebede] Haramaya Univ, Haramaya Inst Technol, Dept Hydraul & Water Resources Engn, POB 138, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia; [Geleta, Dame Yadeta] Samara Univ, Coll Dry Land Agr, Dept Nat Resources Management, POB 132, Samara, Ethiopia",Haramaya University; Haramaya University; Samara University,"Roba, NT (corresponding author), Haramaya Univ, Haramaya Inst Technol, Dept Water Resources & Irrigat Engn, POB 138, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia.",sifankiya53@gmail.com,"Kassa, Asfaw Kebede/AAQ-7689-2020; Tessema, Negash/AAR-9789-2021","Kassa, Asfaw Kebede/0000-0002-6496-7216; Yadeta Geleta, Dame/0000-0002-5203-198X",,,,,89,0,0,7,19,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",1606-9749,1607-0798,,WATER SUPPLY,Water Supply,FEB,2022,22,2,,,,,1611,1623,,10.2166/ws.2021.330,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2021.330,,SEP 2021,13,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,ZG7LW,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000700579800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Trends and variability of extreme temperature events in the agro-ecological zones of Pakistan are not fully understood, despite their importance. This study investigates the annual and seasonal trends of temperature extremes, and the role of Pacific variability during 1980-2019. The homogeneity of 40 synoptic stations, spatially distributed over Pakistan was assessed by removing non-climatic shifts from the data. There is distinct increases (decreases) in the upper (lower) tails are noticed in a spatially aggregated perspective. The strongest warming trends of 0.35 (0.49) degrees C decade 1 for the hottest nights (days) occur during spring, which is the hottest season of the year. The significant warming (hotter) trends are apparent for the agro-ecological zones located to central, western, and southeastern-Pakistan. The principal component analysis showed a robust increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme temperatures, with a total variance of 94.7%. In the spring season, we found strong connections between La Nina (El Nino) events over the western Pacific Ocean and changes in extreme temperatures. Analysis reveals that the strength of La Nina episodes has a much larger influence on the intensity of extremely high-temperature events over arid to semi-arid climatic zones. This information is of great use for the seasonal prediction of extremely hot days in the region and will help policymakers to formulate climate change adaptation plans.","[Saleem, Farhan; Zeng, Xiaodong] Chinese Acad Sci, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Saleem, Farhan; Zeng, Xiaodong; Hina, Saadia] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Xiaodong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Hina, Saadia] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modelling Atmospher Sci & Geo, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Hina, Saadia] Govt Coll Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan; [Omer, Abubaker] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Government College University Faisalabad; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology","Zeng, XD (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Zeng, XD (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;Zeng, XD (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",xdzeng@mail.iap.ac.cn,,"Omer, Abubaker/0000-0002-1811-9574; Hina, Saadia/0000-0002-6203-9694",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41991282],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 41991282).

Here we projected climate change impacts on snow hydrology in the upper Yellow River (UYR) basin through a distributed biosphere hydrological model with improved snow physics, forced with Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project climate model outputs under two emission scenarios (representative concentration pathways, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) during the period of 1996-2025. The results indicated that the climate in the UYR basin is turning warmer and wetter. In this context, more precipitation would occur as rain (snow-to-precipitation ratio would decrease accordingly). The total runoff generation would increase slightly with increased precipitation. The simulated snow depth and snow water equivalent would decrease by 33% and 19% per 1 degrees C warming under the RCP4.5. These declined rates would further enlarge under the RCP8.5. Accordingly, the multimodel ensemble mean snowmelt-to-runoff ratio decreases by 9% and 7% per 1 degrees C warming under the two emission scenarios. The projected responses of snow hydrology (e.g., snow depth, snow water equivalent, and snowmelt) to the changing climate in the UYR basin are consistent among different climate models and RCP scenarios, which would provide valuable insights for water resources management, environmental protection, and climate change adaption in high mountainous basins and their downstream regions.","[Liu, Wenbin; Sun, Fubao; Wang, Hong; Yang, Tao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proce, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lei; Zhou, Jing; Qi, Jia] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lei] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lei; Sun, Fubao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Fubao] Heixi Univ, Ecol Inst Qilian Mt, Zhangye, Peoples R China; [Sun, Fubao] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Water Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Zehua] Guangdong Hydropower Planning & Design Inst, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jiahong] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River Basin, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research","Liu, WB; Sun, FB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proce, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Sun, FB (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Sun, FB (corresponding author), Heixi Univ, Ecol Inst Qilian Mt, Zhangye, Peoples R China.;Sun, FB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Water Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",liuwb@igsnrr.ac.cn; sunfb@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Wang, Lei/B-3113-2019; Sun, Fubao/G-4441-2010; Sun, Fubao/Q-2421-2019; Qi, Jiaguo/AAC-4106-2020; Li, Zehua/O-7258-2019; Liu, Jiahong/AAG-1319-2021; Liu, Wenbin/AAB-2665-2021","Wang, Lei/0000-0002-7201-8715; Sun, Fubao/0000-0003-3358-8229; Li, Zehua/0000-0001-5400-6617; Liu, Wenbin/0000-0002-9569-6762; Zhou, Jing/0000-0003-4846-8334","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0401401, 2016YFA0602402]; Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [ZDRW-ZS-2017-3-1]; CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program",National Key Research and Development Program of China; Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program,"This study was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0401401 and 2016YFA0602402), the Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (ZDRW-ZS-2017-3-1), and the CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program (Fubao Sun).

Here, we use expert probability judgement to elicit a suite of local projections, and associated uncertainties, for future SLR on the Severn Estuary in the south-west of the UK. Eleven experts from a range of policy and academic backgrounds took part in a structured probability elicitation exercise for the years 2050, 2100 and 2200. In addition to the quantitative elicitation, the experts' reasoning during the task was qualitatively analysed. Quantitative analyses show that although there is consensus that sea levels will rise on the Estuary in future, there is wide variation between judgements and much uncertainty regarding the magnitude of future rise. For example, median estimates of SLR (compared to the 2011 level) range from 9.6 to 40 cm in the year 2050; 20 to 100 cm in 2100; and 35 to 300 cm in 2200. Fifty per cent confidence intervals and ninety per cent confidence intervals vary even more. Qualitative analyses indicate that experts' judgements may have been influenced by their choice of methods and information sources, the ways in which they thought about the future, and heuristics. The study shows the merits of integrating qualitative and quantitative methods to explore the reasoning behind uncertainty judgements. We conclude that where expert probability judgements are to be used to characterise uncertainty such reasoning should be made explicit.","[Thomas, Merryn; Pidgeon, Nick; Whitmarsh, Lorraine] Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Tyndall Ctr, Understanding Risk Grp, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Thomas, Merryn; Pidgeon, Nick; Whitmarsh, Lorraine] Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Climate Change Consortium Wales, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Ballinger, Rhoda] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University; Cardiff University; Cardiff University,"Thomas, M (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Tyndall Ctr, Understanding Risk Grp, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.;Thomas, M (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Climate Change Consortium Wales, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",thomasmj6@cardiff.ac.uk,"Whitmarsh, Lorraine/AAD-3756-2019; Whitmarsh, Lorraine/A-1611-2010","Whitmarsh, Lorraine/0000-0002-9054-1040; Whitmarsh, Lorraine/0000-0002-9054-1040",Cardiff University; Climate Change Consortium of Wales (C3W),Cardiff University; Climate Change Consortium of Wales (C3W),We would like to sincerely thank 11 expert participants for their time and expertise.

Little reason exists to separate them, since all three examine and aim to deal with many similar processes, including vulnerability and resilience. This article uses vulnerability and resilience to explore the intersections and overlaps amongst climate change, disaster risk reduction, and sustainability. Critiquing concepts such as return to normal and double exposure demonstrate how separating climate change from wider contexts is counterproductive. Climate change is one contributor to disaster risk and one creeping environmental change amongst many, and not necessarily the most prominent or fundamental contributor. Yet climate change has become politically important, yielding an opportunity to highlight and tackle the deep-rooted vulnerability processes that cause multiple exposure to multiple threats. To enhance resilience processes that deal with the challenges, a prudent place for climate change would be as a subset within disaster risk reduction. Climate change adaptation therefore becomes one of many processes within disaster risk reduction. In turn, disaster risk reduction should sit within development and sustainability to avoid isolation from topics wider than disaster risk. Integration of the topics in this way moves beyond expressions of vulnerability and resilience towards a vision of disaster risk reduction's future that ends tribalism and separation in order to work together to achieve common goals for humanity.","[Kelman, Ilan] UCL, UCL Inst Risk & Disaster Reduct, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Kelman, Ilan] UCL, UCL Inst Global Hlth, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Kelman, Ilan] Norwegian Inst Int Affairs NUPI, N-0033 Oslo, Norway; [Gaillard, J.

However, African governments face considerable challenges in prioritising adaptation interventions and, in particular, aligning these adaptation interventions with existing national development priorities. This article focuses on the Africa Adaptation Programme (AAP) as a case study to investigate what African countries perceive to be priority adaptation interventions. The AAP provides support to 20 African countries to identify and implement priority adaptation interventions under five AAP outcomes. This is achieved using participatory and consensus-based consultation with a wide range of stakeholders across a range of sectors. We classified each adaptation intervention identified in AAP project documents based on the following categories: (1) soft versus hard, (2) scale, (3) sector, and (4) type of intervention. We found that AAP countries selected predominantly soft adaptation interventions covering multiple sectors at the national scale. Of note, development of human and financial capital at a national scale was prioritised over hard or soft interventions at a local scale (e. g. hard infrastructure and restoration of natural capital). This suggests that (1) stakeholders were concerned with risks associated with such interventions; (2) capacity was limited to make informed decisions; and/or (3) there was a lack of coordination to create a consensus on the interventions. Our study highlights the importance of creating an enabling environment for more informed adaptation decisions and practices in African countries.","[Kumamoto, Mihoko] UNDP, Environm & Energy Grp, Bur Dev Policy, New York, NY 10017 USA; [Mills, Anthony] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Soil Sci, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [Mills, Anthony] C4 EcoSolut, ZA-7945 Cape Town, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Kumamoto, M (corresponding author), UNDP, Environm & Energy Grp, Bur Dev Policy, 304 E 45th St,FF 944, New York, NY 10017 USA.",mihoko.kumamoto@undp.org,"Mills, Anthony/AAY-6268-2021; Mills, Anthony J/W-9228-2019","Mills, Anthony J/0000-0001-5676-2440",,,,,33,10,10,0,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Management based on maximum sustainable yield (MSY) has been effective at eliminating overfishing in many regions. However, continuing to use yield-maximizing targets under climate-driven changes in productivity can result in higher anthropogenic pressure on populations subject to climate-related stress than maintaining status quo management targets. We demonstrate this effect using a theoretical example and case studies from snow crab in the eastern Bering Sea and a global marine fisheries database. In these examples, the conservation gain (i.e. biomass in the ocean) of maintaining status quo management targets is larger than the small gain in harvest made through climate adaptation in MSY-based management. The aggregate conservation gain of maintaining management targets increases as the harmful impacts of climate change on productivity worsen. Instead of climate-adaptive MSY-based targets, new management tools are needed to balance conservation and food production in ecosystems of populations displaying non-stationary productivity.","[Szuwalski, Cody S.; Hollowed, Anne B.; Holsman, Kirstin K.; Ianelli, James N.] NOAA, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Legault, Christopher M.] Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, NOAA, Woods Hole, MA USA; [Melnychuk, Michael C.; Ovando, Dan; Punt, Andre E.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Szuwalski, CS (corresponding author), NOAA, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",cody.szuwalski@noaa.gov,,,,,,,59,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1467-2960,1467-2979,,FISH FISH,Fish.

These two goals are often misaligned because adaptation measures use additional materials and equipment, which can increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This phenomenon means that building design involves tradeoffs between enhanced structural resilience and reduced GHG emissions. This paper seeks to identify the optimal investment allocation mechanisms between carbon mitigation and climate adaptation measures for the design of buildings in hurricane-prone regions. A dynamic decision-making model is developed to maximize individual investors' expected payoffs over a building's lifetime. The model is based on the damage evaluation of non-stationary hurricane occurrence and building emission performance under different mitigation scenarios. The results reveal a transition from long-advocated low-carbon investments to risk-oriented portfolios for building retrofits. A case study on Anne Arundel County, MD, for which a 60-40 resilience/abatement portfolio is recommended, shows the value of enhancing structural resilience. Discretion on the accuracy of insurance premium discounts is needed to support risk mitigation efforts. Meanwhile, subsidies for emission abatements are recommended to accommodate existing emission trading schemes and building property values. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Social learning processes represent a way of managing the inherent uncertainties and interconnectedness of adaptation issues through ongoing learning, iterative reflection, and change of responses over time. Although the theoretical case is emerging for social learning as adaptation, there is limited empirical evidence of how these processes play out as local governments engage in urban adaptation planning. This paper starts to address this gap by examining social learning processes in two cities in India. We show how the social learning processes interact with complex governance contexts in the two cities and how evidence of outcomes is emerging across individuals, networks, and systems. We go on to argue that there are several areas of social learning that need further theorisation to support its application in the urban context. First, theories of social learning need to allow for unequal power relationships to continue to shape learning processes and take into account structural and historical dynamics as well as relational forms of power. Second, the way that scale is understood needs to be reopened as a point of analysis to understand how scalar concepts are used by actors to frame and locate problems and solutions rather than being understood as fixed and immutable.","[Fisher, Susannah] Int Inst Environm & Dev, Climate Change Grp, 80-86 Grays Inn Rd, London, England; [Dodman, David] Int Inst Environm & Dev, Human Settlements Grp, London, England",,"Fisher, S (corresponding author), Int Inst Environm & Dev, Climate Change Grp, 80-86 Grays Inn Rd, London, England.",susannahfisher@gmail.com,"Fisher, Susannah/AAH-4689-2019","Fisher, Susannah/0000-0002-5960-5704; Dodman, David/0000-0002-1304-3283",UK aid,UK aid(CGIAR),"UK aid, Grant/Award Number: This was part of an accountable grant to IIED.",,41,13,13,0,18,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",1756-932X,1756-9338,,ENVIRON POLICY GOV,Environ.

We investigated how adaptations related to FEW vulnerabilities are occurring and what the global community can learn about the interactions across these adaptations. We conducted a global analysis of a data set derived from scientific literature to present the first large scale assessment (n = 1,204) of evidence-based FEW-related climate adaptations. We found that the most frequently reported adaptations to FEW vulnerabilities by continent occurred in Africa (n = 495) and Asia (n = 492). Adaptations targeting food security were more robustly documented than those relevant to water and energy security, suggesting a greater global demand to address food security. Determining statistically significant associations, we found a network of connections between variables characterizing FEW-related adaptations and showed interconnectedness between a variety of natural hazards, exposures, sectors, actors, cross-cutting topics and geographic locations. Connectivity was found between the vulnerabilities food security, water, community sustainability, and response to sea level rise across cities, settlements, and key infrastructure sectors. Additionally, generalized linear regression models revealed potential synergies and tradeoffs among FEW adaptations, such as a necessity to synergistically adapt systems to protect food and water security and tradeoffs when simultaneously addressing exposures of consumption and production vs. poverty. Results from qualitative thematic coding showcased that adaptations documented as targeting multiple exposures are still limited in considering interconnectivity of systems and applying a nexus approach in their responses. These results suggest that adopting a nexus approach to future FEW-related adaptations can have profound benefits in the management of scarce resources and with financial constraints.","[Torhan, S.; Grady, C.

The unfolding of the 1st and the last leaves need the least time and AAT, while the 8th -15th leaves need the most. With the delay of sowing date, the peak value of the variation trend of the days and active accumulated temperature to unfold one leaf basically decreased gradually. Among different fitting models, the 3rd degree polynomial fitting model y = a + bx + cx(2) + dx(3) may have better biological significance and was thus adopted. As a result, the established models showed great variations in c and d parameters for different varieties, a and c for different sowing dates. The model was tested and showed that the simulated values were in good agreement with the actual values.

The choice for collective arrangements is tied to a call for solidarity. We distinguish between one-sided (assisting community members in need) and two-sided solidarity (furthering a common interest) and between voluntary and compulsory solidarity. We assess the strength of solidarity as a basis for adaptation measures in six Dutch water management case studies. Traditionally, Dutch water management is characterized by compulsory two-sided solidarity at the water board level. Since the French times, the state is involved through compulsory national solidarity contributions to avoid societal disruption by major floods. In so far as this furthers a common interest, the contributions qualify as two-sided solidarity, but if it is considered assistance to flood-prone areas, they also qualify as one-sided solidarity. Although the Delta Programme explicitly continues on this path, our case studies show that solidarity continues to play an important role in Dutch water management in the process of adapting to a changing climate, but that an undifferentiated call for solidarity will likely result in debates over who should pay what and why. Such discussions can lead to cancellation or postponement of adaptation measures, which are not considered to be in the common interest or result in an increased reliance on local solidarity.","[Keessen, Andrea; Ernst, Wouter] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Ctr Water Oceans & Sustainabil Law, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Vink, Martinus J.] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Vink, Martinus J.] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, The Hague, Netherlands; [Wiering, Mark; Boezeman, Daan; Van Eerd, Marjolein C.

However, the potential benefits for urban areas can only be realized if such brownfields are accepted as vital elements of the urban green infrastructure. The paper addresses the potentials of different types of green urban brownfields to provide particular ecosystem services with an outstanding relevance for the urban environment and the life of local residents, and looks at how these services can be best exploited in urban areas. Based on literature reviews, climate modeling, and a survey, research findings are presented on habitat services, microclimatic regulation services, and recreational services for various types of green urban brownfields. Differences in the quantity and quality of these services can be stated according to the specific and varying vegetation inventory and structural parameters of green urban brownfields. Scenario modeling of the preservation and development or transformation of brownfields into green spaces are used to illustrate the potentials and trade-offs of land-use changes in urban environments.

As a result, the SSA population is becoming increasingly vulnerable to the double burden of malnutrition and obesity. This, combined with the increasing pressure to produce sufficient food and provide employment for this growing population together with the threat of climate change-induced declining crop yields, requires urgent sustainable solutions. Can an increase in the cultivation of climate-resilient crops (CRCs) and their utilization to produce attractive, convenient and nutritious bread products contribute to climate change adaptation and healthy and sustainable diets? A food system analysis of the bread food value chain in SSA indicates that replacement of refined, mostly imported, wheat in attractive bread products could (1) improve food and nutrition security, (2) bring about a shift to more nutritionally balanced diets, (3) increase economic inclusiveness and equitable benefits, and (4) improve sustainability and resilience of the food system. The food system analysis also provided systematic insight into the challenges and hurdles that need to be overcome to increase the availability, affordability and uptake of CRCs. Proposed interventions include improving the agronomic yield of CRCs, food product technology, raising consumer awareness and directing policies. Overall, integrated programs involving all stakeholders in the food system are needed.","[Noort, Martijn W.

Although climate change adaptation is being mainstreamed in Thailand, a well-organized overview of the impacts of climate change and potential adaptation measures has been unavailable to date. Here we present a comprehensive review of climate-change impact studies that focused on the Thai water sector, based on a literature review of six sub-sectors: riverine hydrology, sediment erosion, coastal erosion, forest hydrology, agricultural hydrology, and urban hydrology. Our review examined the long-term availability of observational data, historical changes, projected changes in key variables, and the availability of economic assessments and their implications for adaptation actions. Although some basic hydrometeorological variables have been well monitored, specific historical changes due to climate change have seldom been detected. Furthermore, although numerous future projections have been proposed, the likely changes due to climate change remain unclear due to a general lack of systematic multi-model and multi-scenario assessments and limited spatiotemporal coverage of the study area. Several gaps in the research were identified, and ten research recommendations are presented. While the information contained herein contributes to state-of-the-art knowledge on the impact of climate change on the water sector in Thailand, it will also benefit other countries on the Indochina Peninsula with a similar climate.","[Kiguchi, Masashi; Matsumoto, Kyoko] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Takata, Kumiko; Hanasaki, Naota] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, Ibaraki, Japan; [Takata, Kumiko] Azabu Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan; [Archevarahuprok, Boonlert] Thai Meteorol Dept, Bangkok, Thailand; [Champathong, Adisorn] Royal Irrigat Dept, Bangkok, Thailand; [Ikoma, Eiji] Univ Tokyo, Earth Observat Data Integrat & Fus Res Initiat, Tokyo, Japan; [Jaikaeo, Chaiporn; Piamsa-Nga, Napaporn; Raksapatcharawong, Mongkol; Rangsiwanichpong, Prem; Ritphring, Sompratana; Suanpaga, Weerakaset; Kiatiwat, Thanya] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Engn, Bangkok, Thailand; [Kaewrueng, Sudsaisin] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Agr, Bangkok, Thailand; [Kanae, Shinjiro] Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo, Japan; [Kazama, So] Tohoku Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Kuraji, Koichiro] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Nakamura, Shinichiro] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Nguyen-Le, Dzung; Yamada, Tomohito] Hokkaido Univ, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Noda, Keigo] Gifu Univ, Fac Appl Biol Sci, Gifu, Japan; [Shirakawa, Hiroaki] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Somphong, Chatuphorn; Udo, Keiko] Tohoku Univ, Int Res Inst Disaster Sci, Tohoku, Miyagi, Japan; [Srisutham, Mallika] Khon Kaen Univ, Fac Agr, Khon Kaen, Thailand; [Suanburi, Desell] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Sci, Bangkok, Thailand; [Tebakari, Taichi] Toyama Prefectural Univ, Fac Engn, Toyama, Japan; [Trisurat, Yongyut] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Forestry, Bangkok, Thailand; [Wongsa, Sanit] King Mongkuts Univ Technol, Fac Ind Educ & Technol, Bangkok, Thailand; [Yoshida, Koshi] Ibaraki Univ, Fac Agr, Ibaraki, Japan; [Oki, Taikan] United Nat Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Oki, Taikan] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Azabu University; University of Tokyo; Kasetsart University; Kasetsart University; Tokyo Institute of Technology; Tohoku University; University of Tokyo; Nagoya University; Hokkaido University; Gifu University; Nagoya University; Tohoku University; Khon Kaen University; Kasetsart University; Toyama Prefectural University; Kasetsart University; King Mongkuts University of Technology North Bangkok; King Mongkuts University of Technology Thonburi; Ibaraki University; United Nations University; University of Tokyo,"Kiguchi, M (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo, Japan.",kiguchi@iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Nakamura, Shinichiro/ACF-3536-2022; Hanasaki, Naota/C-2932-2009; Kiguchi, Masashi/GQP-0111-2022; Rangsiwanichpong, Prem/GXF-4107-2022; Udo, Keiko/AAN-1610-2021; Kazama, So/T-2641-2019; Kanae, Shinjiro/E-5606-2010; Raksapatcharawong, Mongkol/AAH-6562-2021; Oki, Taikan/E-5778-2010","Hanasaki, Naota/0000-0002-5092-7563; Kiguchi, Masashi/0000-0002-8952-6855; Rangsiwanichpong, Prem/0000-0002-1663-3537; Udo, Keiko/0000-0003-0293-1354; Kanae, Shinjiro/0000-0002-3176-4957; Oki, Taikan/0000-0003-4067-4678; Nguyen-Le, Dzung/0000-0003-0214-3411; Somphong, Chatuphorn/0000-0003-2965-0720; TAKATA, Kumiko/0000-0003-4622-8927","Japan Science and Technology Agency/Japan International Cooperation Agency; Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (JST/JICA, SATREPS)","Japan Science and Technology Agency/Japan International Cooperation Agency(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)); Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (JST/JICA, SATREPS)","This research was supported partially by the Japan Science and Technology Agency/Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (JST/JICA, SATREPS).",,202,14,14,7,26,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

The objective of this study is to contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the field of sustainable building research, through the definition of strategies to adopt Level(s) for bringing buildings into the Circular Economy. For this reason, a triple SWOT-Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)-TOWS analysis was applied. The strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of the Level(s) have been identified in relation to the availability of resources, product quality, internal and market structure, consumer perception, among others. The results obtained are conclusive in terms of the experts' positive assessment of the tool; highlighting factors such as its response to the need to adapt buildings to climate change, its a standard reference language, and its use in multiple situations. However, several barriers have also been identified, which may affect its development, including its complexity of use, its lack of self-sufficiency, and its dependence the criteria used in each evaluation. Finally, the key strategies to be carried out for the implementation of the Levels have been established. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Mountain landscapes, with their inherent constraints of remoteness, sensitive ecosystem, and marginality, pose unique challenges to rural development. We undertook an assessment of the evolution of development themes and rural development progress made in the mountain state of Sikkim over the past decade. We found that a rapidly growing national economy has facilitated a 4-fold rise in investment in key rural development subsectors in Sikkim over the past 5 years. This significant enhancement in financial investment, coupled with good governance and innovative policies, has ensured that human development indicators, along with social infrastructure creation, have shown impressive progress. Setting up village cluster-level support offices to strengthen governance, transforming regular programs to mission mode with great political determination by adopting a saturation approach, financing improved earthquake-resistant housing for poor households, and promoting climate change adaption measures to enhance rural water security are some of the innovative approaches that have the potential to be transferred to other mountain areas.

Building upon a framework proposed by McIntosh and Schlenker (2006), this paper identifies empirical conditions under which the nonlinear panel approach can approximate a long-run response to climate. When these conditions fail, the obtained relationship may still be interpretable as a weighted average of underlying short-run and long-run responses. We use this decomposition to revisit recently published climate impact estimates. For spatially large panels, the estimated temperature-outcome relationship mostly reflects the long-run climatic response; this is not so for precipitation.

An increasing number of cities are adapting to climate change to enhance their climate resilience. Given the complexity of urban systems in combination with the acceleration of climate and social change, it is challenging to measure the success of resilience-rising activities. To manage and accelerate the learning process and the transformation process, monitoring and evaluation of implemented adaptation measures are crucial. Most of the currently used indicator sets are dealing with system-focused changes. However, actor-focused changes are less addressed in holistic indicator sets, even if individual agency assumes an important role in the transformation process. This research was intended to design a framework for individual climate resilience agency and operationalise it in a composite indicator set. The indicator set is implemented in a survey with 14 research projects in Germany. Finally, the indicator set is verified using statistical and empirical validation. The study presents an applicable indicator set, which reveals more in-depth insights into the individual climate resilience agency and changes within adaptation measurements. Further, the set can be applied in both one-time assessments and repetitive measurement. Therefore, the tool can be implemented as a monitoring tool, as well as a formative evaluation tool, in the climate resilience adaptation context.","[Wilden, Daniela] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Geog, Senckenbergstr 1, D-35390 Giessen, Germany; [Feldmeyer, Daniel] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Spatial & Reg Planning, Pfaffenwaldring 7, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen; University of Stuttgart,"Wilden, D (corresponding author), Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Geog, Senckenbergstr 1, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.",daniela.wilden@geogr.uni-giessen.de; daniel.feldmeyer@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de,"Wilden, Daniela/AAR-2260-2021","Wilden, Daniela/0000-0001-6132-180X",Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) [01LR1722ABCD],Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This research was funded by Research funded by Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF), grant number 01LR1722ABCD.",,80,3,3,3,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2590-2520,,,CITY ENVIRON INTERAC,City Environ.

Our econometric results enable us to outline different regimes - both climatic and historical - via a time series analysis taking into account nonlinearity. When the rainfalls have been scarce, nomadic migrations from North to South China have been aggravated. During these periods/regimes, the temperatures, probably at a too high level, have reinforced these migrations; this result has not been demonstrated in the previous literature. The role of precipitations has probably been overestimated in previous literature while the role of temperatures changes has been a bit underestimated, at less the interaction between both climatic variables has maybe been underestimated. The climate change, by modifying the agricultural yields from pastoralists in arid or semi-arid regions, has been at the origin of many migrations' flows. Nomadic populations adaptation to climate change generated many migrations from North to the South where agricultural crops were more likely to grow. However, these migrations flows lead to interpersonal conflicts initiated by pastoralists nomads and to which agriculturalists from the South responded. These results are wondering about the interrelationships between climate, migrations and conflicts in developing countries that are likely to increase in a near future.","[Damette, Olivier] Univ Lorraine, BETA, Nancy, France; [Pei, Qing] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Social Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Universite de Lorraine; Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK),"Damette, O (corresponding author), Univ Lorraine, BETA, Nancy, France.",olivier.damette@univ-lorraine.fr; qingpei@eduhk.hk,,,,,,,31,0,0,2,3,EDITIONS L HARMATTAN,PARIS,"5-7 RUE L ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE, PARIS, 75005, FRANCE",1267-5059,2117-0843,,REV DEV,Reg.

This is particularly true for market related factors. Every change in farming practices is attributed to climate change. This article presents new evidence of how adaptations to market risks may be incorrectly attributed to climate change risk because of causal attribution bias emerging from poorly structured survey instrument and response inducing questions. Through a quasi-experiment administered on 400 rural fanning households from four districts of Pakistan, we demonstrate that when farmers are not sensitized about climate change prior to questions on adaptations they assign market factors such as availability of new market opportunities, improved purchasing power, and net profitability as major reason for changes in sowing date, growing new crop verity and use of fertilizers. To be exact, less than 2% and 1% of farmers indicated climate change as the reason behind the change in crop variety and use of fertilizers respectively. Similarly, only 10% of farmers associated late sowing with climate change. Findings of the study imply a stronger role of the market-related factors in changing agricultural practices over the time asking policymakers to design better market-based interventions and incentives for increasing the adaptation in the agriculture community. Findings have also implications for mix method research and can be generalized for all research fields involving survey design.","[Javed, Sajid Amin] SDPI, Plot D-10,Fazal e Haq Rd, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Haider, Azad] St Marys Univ, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Nawaz, Muhammad] Univ Sargodha, Econ Dept, Sargodha, Pakistan",Saint Marys University - Canada; University of Sargodha,"Haider, A (corresponding author), St Marys Univ, Halifax, NS, Canada.",sajidamin@sdpi.org; azad.haider@smu.ca,"Nawaz, Muhammad/AAP-1031-2021; Haider, Azad/AAJ-9665-2021; Nawaz, Muhammad/HGU-7620-2022","Haider, Azad/0000-0001-9936-4231",'South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics [SANDEE]' Nepal [SANDEE/2015-06],'South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics [SANDEE]' Nepal,"The authors are thankful Jeffery Vincent of Duke University for guiding the overall design of the study.

In Central America, smallholder coffee farmers are threatened by rising temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns. One strategy that could help support smallholder farmer communities adapt to climate change is the use of Ecosystem based Adaptation (EbA) practices, which are based on the conservation, restoration and sustainable management of ecosystems and biodiversity. However, little information exists on how farmers use these practices. Objective. The objective of this work was to describe the use of eleven EbA practices by smallholder coffee farmers in five landscapes in Costa Rica, Honduras and Guatemala, and compare whether the biophysical characteristics and implementation of these practices differed between landscapes. Materials and methods. The characterization of EbA practices in the field was done using participatory mapping, surveys, area and measurements of vegetation composition and structure, from July 2014 to June 2015. Comparisons between landscapes were made using analysis of variance. Results. The study suggests that most farmers are already actively using EbA practices, especially shade trees in coffee plots, contour planting, home gardens and live fences. However, there were important differences across landscapes in the prevalence and characteristics of the EM practices implemented. Conclusion. These differences suggest that smallholder farmers adapt the use of these practices in response to their social and biophysical contexts and that there is value in organizing exchanges among farmers from different regions to share their knowledge of these practices.","[Martinez-Rodriguez, M.

In this context, social science studies on subjective experiencing of heat as stress by urban citizens are a new emerging field. To contribute to the understanding of self-reported subjective heat stress and its major determinants in a daily life perspective, we conducted a questionnaire survey with 323 respondents in Karlsruhe, Germany, after heat waves in July and August 2013. Statistical data analysis showed that subjective heat stress is an issue permeating everyday activities. Subjective heat stress at home was lower than at work and in general. Subjective heat stress in general, at home, and at work was determined by the health impairments experienced during the heat and the feeling of being helplessly exposed to the heat. For subjective heat stress at home, characteristics of the residential building and the built environment additionally played a role. Although the rate of implemented coping measures was rather high, coping measures showed no uniform effect for the subjective heat stress. We conclude that in terms of urban adaptation strategies, further research is needed to understand how various processes of daily social (work) life enable or limit individual coping and that communication strategies are important for building capacities to better cope with future heat waves.","[Kunz-Plapp, Tina] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Geophys Inst, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Hackenbruch, Julia; Schipper, Janus Willem] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, South German Climate Off, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Kunz-Plapp, T (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Geophys Inst, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany.",tina.kunz-plapp@kit.edu,"Schipper, Janus Willem/AAB-6235-2022; Kunz-Plapp, Tina/N-3069-2013","Schipper, Janus Willem/0000-0002-9176-4297; Kunz-Plapp, Tina/0000-0002-9157-8136",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Open Access Publishing Fund of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Climate Initiative REKLIM (regional climate change) of the Helmholtz Association (Germany),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Open Access Publishing Fund of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Climate Initiative REKLIM (regional climate change) of the Helmholtz Association (Germany),"The research activities for the presented study were funded by the Climate Initiative REKLIM (regional climate change) of the Helmholtz Association (Germany).

Adaptation limits are delineated by capacity thresholds, after which climate damages begin to overwhelm the adaptation response and net adaptation goes negative. The levels of such thresholds depend on the complex interaction of different environmental (climatic and ecological) and human response (technological and societal) systems. In this paper, the interactions among these sub-systems are explored and four novel archetypical climate damage and adaptation response systems are developed. These damage-response systems can be described by the level of their adaptation limits thresholds, the pathways of adaptation capacity degradation and failure, and the recoverability or permanence of such climate losses once the adaptation limits have been surpassed. Policy options upon reaching the limits to adaptation include investment in more of the same technology, implementation of new and more effective adaptation, or transformational adaptation that allows the damage-response system to become more resilient. Attention is drawn to the need for greater understanding of the uncertainties of adaptation limits, how to raise the effective capacities and lifetime ranges of adaptation (and thus delay adaptation failure), and what policy options exist when adaptation limits are breached.

Water footprint (WF) is a sign of freshwater use and is not only an indicator that can be used in the climate crisis, but also to protect water against nitrate pollution. In this study, the Kucuk Menderes Basin was chosen as the study area due to different crop varieties. Agricultural crop patterns were classified using Rapideye and Sentinel-2 satellite images of the study area obtained in 2017. Thus, the cultivated areas were obtained for cotton and maize (grain and silage) in the basin. In particular, agricultural crop patterns were considered in which agricultural production was intensive and blue water was used predominantly. As a result, the first-crop corn production, which has a high blue WF of 3840 m(3)/ton in the basin, has the highest greywater footprint due to the use of intensive chemical fertilisers. This was followed by cotton with 2331 m(3)/ton, and the second-crop silage corn production had the lowest greywater footprint. Agriculture's water footprint assessment provides a solid foundation for planning climate change adaptive crop production, managing nitrate-sensitive areas and anticipating future regional changes.","[Esetlili, M.

Scenarios of future climate change predict an increase of severe drought conditions in temperate climate regions. This implies the need for adaptations of locally managed forest systems, such as European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) monocultures, for instance, through the admixing of deep-rooting silver fir (Abies alba Mill.). We designed a stable-isotope-based split-root experiment under controlled conditions to test whether silver fir seedlings could perform HR and therefore reduce drought stress in neighboring beech seedlings. Our results showed that HR by silver fir does occur, but with a delayed onset of three weeks after isotopic labelling with (H2O)-H-2 (delta H-2 approximate to +6000 parts per thousand), and at low rates. On average, 0.2% of added H-2 excess could be recovered via HR. Fir roots released water under dry-soil conditions that caused some European beech seedlings to permanently wilt. On the basis of these results, we concluded that HR by silver fir does occur, but the potential for mitigating drought stress in beech is limited. Admixing silver fir into beech stands as a climate change adaptation strategy needs to be assessed in field studies with sufficient monitoring time.","[Toechterle, Paul; Rehschuh, Stephanie; Rehschuh, Romy; Ruehr, Nadine K.; Dannenmann, Michael] KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Atmospher Environm Res IMK IFU, Kreuzeckbahnstr 19, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Toechterle, Paul] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Geol, Innrain 52f, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Yang, Fengli; Rennenberg, Heinz] Freiburg Univ, Inst Forstbot & Baumphysiol, Georges Kohler Allee 53-54, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Innsbruck; University of Freiburg,"Tochterle, P (corresponding author), KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Atmospher Environm Res IMK IFU, Kreuzeckbahnstr 19, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany.;Tochterle, P (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Geol, Innrain 52f, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",paul.toechterle@kit.edu; fengli.yang@ctp.uni-freiburg.de; stephanie.rehschuh@kit.edu; romy.rehschuh@kit.edu; nadine.ruehr@kit.edu; heinz.rennenberg@ctp.uni-freiburg.de; michael.dannenmann@kit.edu,"Dannenmann, Michael/A-7278-2013; Ruehr, Nadine/C-6986-2011","Ruehr, Nadine/0000-0001-5989-7463; Dannenmann, Michael/0000-0001-5924-7612; Tochterle, Paul/0000-0003-1738-5771",Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) within the Waldklimafonds program; Buchen-Tannen-Mischwalder zur Anpassung von Wirtschaftswaldern an Extremereignisse des Klimawandels (BuTaKli) project; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the Helmholtz Association and its ATMO research program; German Research Foundation through its Emmy Noether Program [RU 1657/2-1],Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) within the Waldklimafonds program; Buchen-Tannen-Mischwalder zur Anpassung von Wirtschaftswaldern an Extremereignisse des Klimawandels (BuTaKli) project; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the Helmholtz Association and its ATMO research program(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Research Foundation through its Emmy Noether Program(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This study was funded by the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) within the Waldklimafonds program and the Buchen-Tannen-Mischwalder zur Anpassung von Wirtschaftswaldern an Extremereignisse des Klimawandels (BuTaKli) project; their support is gratefully acknowledged.

Land and water interventions form a crucial part of a climate-smart agricultural practices portfolio, with water availability being the key limiting factor of crop growth. To aid in this decision-making process of prioritizing land and water interventions, a simple and robust spreadsheet tool based on a water balance is developed. The tool integrates and simulates impacts of land and water interventions on the water balance to determine their impact across climate-smart agricultural objectives of agricultural productivity, climate change adaptation and mitigation. The tool was implemented in two villages in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. The tool performs well in simulating village water balance and its impact on the yield of rainfed and irrigated crop areas. Results show that considerable differences exist within the portfolio of land and water interventions, with only a combination of supply, demand and moisture conservation practices being able to help achieve climate-smart agricultural objectives. In the best case scenario, yield can be increased by up to 10% and greenhouse gas emission intensity reduced up to 17%. Comparison with stakeholder perception analysis highlights the utility of this tool in providing additional quantitative information in the decision-making process.

However, existing literature over-relies upon theoretical arguments rather than empirical evidence, and until now the emphasis has been on potential positive linkages. We address these weaknesses by empirically examining the role of microfinance in adaptation, drawing from household-level quantitative and qualitative data gathered from Satkhira District, Southwest Bangladesh. We find evidence that microfinance facilitates coping by reducing sensitivity to environmental and climate hazards. Credit is especially important because its availability is uncorrelated with the occurrence of flooding, unlike many other traditional coping responses. We also find evidence that microfinance facilitates adaptation by helping households to overcome financial barriers of adopting adaptation options which reduce exposure or sensitivity. However, credit limits are likely to restrict its role to incremental adaptations, which may not meaningfully reduce vulnerability. Transformational adaptations at times required access to bank credit which the poorest cannot access. This restricts their ability to effectively adapt and are penalized financially by having to obtain loans to cope. We also find evidence that microfinance can lead to maladaptation when used in non-profit generating activities as income streams are not produced to help repay associated costs. Almost a fifth of all loans were obtained for repaying existing loans. Thus microfinance may undermine longer term adaptive capacity. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Understanding plant-climate interactions and the impact of climate change, rising CO2, land use change, deforestation and fire on vegetation has become a major challenge for ecologists. Therefore, developing the capacity to project vegetation change is of critical importance if we are to mitigate and efficiently adapt to climate change impacts. The lack of an accurate representation of different vegetation types and ecosystem processes at regional scale is a main source of uncertainty in Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs). This manifests in a lack of key growth forms such as bamboo, lianas and mangroves and biome types such as savanna which are essential components of ecosystems in South Asia. Plant communities like mangroves and bamboos, despite covering just small areas, account for high carbon sequestration whereas lianas can decrease carbon sequestration capacity of host trees. Here, we review the current state of vegetation modeling for South Asia and we propose a research agenda for an improved representation of biome diversity in DGVMs. We account for both the traditional plant functional type (PFT) approach and for the functional trait (FT) approach that considers growing knowledge on plant-trait variability and eco-evolutionary principles of different plant communities. We argue that an adequate representation of different vegetation types and growth forms characteristic of South Asian biomes is necessary in DGVMs for robust assessments of climate change impacts on their distribution, diversity and carbon budget.

For studying the impacts of the changing climate on hydrological systems, General Circulation Model (GCM)/Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulated precipitation are used. However, these products should be bias-corrected before used in hydrological simulations to predict hydrological extremes. Most of the existing bias-correction techniques suffer from either of two limitations - (a) they only reduce bias in selected precipitation quantile (either mean or extreme values), and/or (b) they exclude zero values from the analysis, even though their presence is significant in daily precipitation. In this study, a stochastic copula-based bias-correction method (Maity et al., J. Hydrometeorol., 20, 2019, 595), henceforth RMPH method, is used that corrects the bias in any quantile (mean and/or extreme values) of daily precipitation including zero values. The RMPH method is applied across Indian mainland to correct bias in simulated precipitation from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX). Due to diverse climatic conditions across India, the quality of bias-corrected precipitation is studied separately for different meteorologically homogenous regions of the country. Despite non-uniform distribution of raingauge stations for observed precipitation, the superiority of the bias-corrected precipitation (from RMPH method) in correcting bias and retaining the seasonal variation across the country is evident when compared with tradition bias-correction approach like quantile mapping. The new bias-corrected precipitation dataset developed is particularly suited for hydrological simulations, formulating extreme event mitigation strategies and climate change adaptation strategies.","[Suman, Mayank] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Sch Water Resources, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India; [Maity, Rajib] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Kunstmann, Harald] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK IFU, Campus Alpin IMK IFU, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Kunstmann, Harald] Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Augsburg, Germany",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Augsburg,"Maity, R (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",rajib@civil.iitkgp.ac.in,"Kunstmann, Harald/A-7071-2013; Suman, Mayank/AAB-1555-2020; Maity, Rajib/AAP-9797-2020","Kunstmann, Harald/0000-0001-9573-1743; Suman, Mayank/0000-0002-1402-8982; Maity, Rajib/0000-0001-5631-9553","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology [DST/CCP/CoE/79/2017(G)]; Helmholtz-Association of German Research Centres (HGF)","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology(Department of Science & Technology (DOST), Philippines); Helmholtz-Association of German Research Centres (HGF)(Helmholtz Association)","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Grant/ Award Number: DST/CCP/CoE/79/2017(G) and Helmholtz--Association of German Research Centres (HGF).",,37,3,3,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2049-6060,,,GEOSCI DATA J,Geosci.

To investigate the impact of temporary grassland management practices on SOC storage of croplands, we used a spatially resolved sampling approach combined with geostatistical analyses across an agricultural experiment. The experiment included blocks (0.4- to 3-ha blocks) of continuous grassland, continuous cropping and temporary grasslands with different durations and N-fertilizations on a 23-ha site in western France. We measured changes in SOC storage over this 9-year experiment on loamy soil and investigated physicochemical soil parameters. In the soil profiles (0-90 cm), SOC stocks ranged from 82.7 to 98.5 t ha(-1) in 2005 and from 81.3 to 103.9 t ha(-1) in 2014. On 0.4-ha blocks, the continuous grassland increased SOC in the soil profile with highest gains in the first 30 cm, while losses were recorded under continuous cropping. Where temporary grasslands were introduced into cropping cycles, SOC stocks were maintained. These observations were only partly confirmed when changing the scale of observation to 3-ha blocks. At the 3-ha scale, most grassland treatments exhibited both gains and losses of SOC, which could be partly related to soil physicochemical properties. Overall, our data suggest that both management practices and soil characteristics determine if carbon will accumulate in SOC pools. For detailed understanding of SOC changes, a combination of measurements at different scales is necessary.","[Creme, Alexandra; Chabbi, Abad] Inst Natl Rech Agronom & Environm INRAE, Pluridisciplinaire Prairies & Plantes Fourrageres, F-86600 Lusignan, France; [Creme, Alexandra; Vaudour, Emmanuelle; Chabbi, Abad] UParis Saclay, Inst Natl Rech Agronom & Environm INRAE, Ecol Fonct & Ecotoxicol Agroecosyst ECOSYS, UMR 1402,INRAE,Agroparistech, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France; [Creme, Alexandra; Rumpel, Cornelia] SorbonneU, CNRS, UMR 7618, Inst Ecol & Sci Environm Paris,UPEC,IRD,INRAE, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France; [Malone, Sparkle L.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Saby, Nicolas P.

The decline was usually ended up with attribution to climate change and underlying surface changes, without further exploring the effects of natural and anthropogenic components in climate. It might lead to overestimation for human-induced climate change impacts and inappropriate adaptation. The identification of the anthropogenic elements in streamflow change is very crucial and increasingly required by water management planning, climate mitigation and adaptation actions. A novel framework is proposed for streamflow change attribution in terms of three sources of natural climate variability (NCV), anthropogenic climate change (ACC) and the underlying surface changes in basins. The results suggest that the role of the underlying surface changes in basins overwhelms that of climate change in the recent historical period. However, the natural climate variability could not be neglected since it may play the dominant role in streamflow change, compared with that of the anthropogenic climate change. The results also highlight that we need to clarify the effects of human-induced climate change and the underlying surface changes, which are the goals of climate change adaptation and mitigation. The uncertainties of the attribution are analyzed in contrast with other attribution work in the same study case, and the sources are presented explicitly. The conclusion could facilitate a better understanding of the hydrological processes as a result of environmental changes and provide an efficient reference for administrators and decision makers.","[Liu, Yanli; Zhang, Jianyun; Wang, Guoqing; Wang, Gaoxu; Jin, Junliang; Liu, Cuishan; He, Ruimin] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yanli; Zhang, Jianyun; Wang, Guoqing; Jin, Junliang; Liu, Cuishan; He, Ruimin] Minist Water Resources, Res Ctr Climate Change, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China; [Wan, Sicheng] HoHai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China",Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute; Hohai University,"Liu, YL (corresponding author), Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.",ylliu@nhri.cn,"Wang, Guoqing/AAM-8111-2020","Wang, Guoqing/0000-0002-9121-9571","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51679145, 91747103, 41330854, 51779144, 51679144, 51779145]; National Non-profit Institute Basic Research Foundation [Y514007]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Non-profit Institute Basic Research Foundation,"This work was jointly financed by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51679145, No. 91747103, No. 41330854, No. 51779144, No. 51679144, No. 51779145), and National Non-profit Institute Basic Research Foundation funded special project (No. Y514007).

We examine the capacity of adaptation in the Concepcion Metropolitan Area, Chile. A flexible methodology based on spatial fuzzy modelling was developed to standardise and aggregate, through a stepwise approach, seventeen indicators derived from widely available census statistical data into an adaptive capacity index. The results indicate'that all the municipalities in the CMA increased their level of adaptive capacity between 1992 and 2002. However, the relative differences between municipalities did not change significantly over the studied timeframe. Fuzzy overlay allowed us to standardise and to effectively aggregate indicators with differing ranges and granularities of attribute values into an overall index. It also provided a conceptually sound and reproducible means of exploring the interplay of many indicators that individually influence adaptive capacity. Furthermore, it captured the complex, aggregated and continued nature of the adaptive capacity, favouring to deal with gaps of data and knowledge associated with the concept of adaptive capacity. The resulting maps can help identify municipalities where adaptive capacity is weak and identify which components of adaptive capacity need strengthening.

We identify smart water research trends over time, relationships with climate adaptation and mitigation goals, and applicability to places with developed or developing water and electrical infrastructure. To do so, we systematically review the literature, identifying research on Information Communication Technology-enabled technologies related to water supply, wastewater, and stormwater management. We assess the relationship between each study and climate adaptation and mitigation objectives: managing greater variation in water quantity, leading to scarcity and increased stormwater; managing declining water quality; and low-carbon water systems. We find 96 relevant studies and identify five major categories of research addressing climate adaptation and mitigation: monitoring, modeling, system design, system feedbacks, and uptake and implementation. We find there is a recent acceleration in smart water research, with a concentration of studies focused on modeling. There is an emphasis on water efficiency using data from Advanced Metering Infrastructure, which is most applicable to cities with developed water grids and consistent electrical supplies. Secondarily, there is a concentration of work using distributed sensors for early detection of water quality degradation, which is being done in all municipal contexts. There is far less research on uptake and implementation of smart approaches, especially at the institutional level. In addition, there is relatively little work that explicitly relates smart water technologies to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While smart water approaches are applicable everywhere, there is a need to for expanded focus on areas without developed water grids or consistent electricity for smart water to meaningfully contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 6.","[Lassiter, Allison; Leonard, Nicole] Univ Penn, Weitzman Sch Design, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Lassiter, A (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Weitzman Sch Design, City & Reg Planning, 210 S 34th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",alass@design.upenn.edu,,,Integrating Sustainability Across the Curriculum (ISAC) Initiative at University of Pennsylvania's Office of Sustainability,Integrating Sustainability Across the Curriculum (ISAC) Initiative at University of Pennsylvania's Office of Sustainability,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by funding from the Integrating Sustainability Across the Curriculum (ISAC) Initiative at University of Pennsylvania's Office of Sustainability.",,121,1,1,7,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2399-8083,2399-8091,,ENVIRON PLAN B-URBAN,Env.

The enabling legislation for the Basin Plan, the Water Act, gains its constitutional legitimacy from international treaties such as the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. This Act mandated that water be returned from consumptive uses to the environment. An allocation of 2,750 GL/yr was set but has been reduced by the 'Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment Mechanism' (SDLAM), intended to achieve equivalent environmental benefits with less water. We present a synthesis of changes in decision contexts that have led to water reforms being 'watered down'. We analysed the policy discourse of water reform to assess whether SDLAM projects will achieve outcomes congruent with Australia's international treaty obligations. We found little or no alignment between the purpose of the SDLAM projects and the principles of the treaties and the Water Act. As water scarcity increases under climate change, attempting to conserve wetlands (including rivers) with less water while maintaining or increasing irrigation diversions is likely to prove maladaptive. A major reframing of environmental water policy and management is required to enable meaningful and effective adaptation to climate change.","[Bender, Isobel; Colloff, Matthew J.; Pittock, Jamie; Wyborn, Carina] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Colloff, MJ (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",Matthew.Colloff@anu.edu.au,"; Pittock, Jamie/N-1541-2018","Wyborn, Carina/0000-0002-4314-347X; Pittock, Jamie/0000-0001-6293-996X",,,,,91,4,4,5,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",1324-1583,2204-227X,,AUSTRALAS J WAT RESO,Australas.

In the last decade, an effort has been made to build city resilience and improve cities' capacity to respond to, recover from and adapt to climate change. However, certain city stakeholders' lack of proactive behavior has resulted in less effective city resilience-building strategies. In this sense, the importance of developing stakeholders' awareness of climate change in order to ensure proactivity is documented in the literature. However, there is a lack of studies that define how, when and what should be done to develop stakeholders' climate change awareness at a city scale. This paper presents a framework to develop stakeholders climate change awareness as a result of a systematic literature review and a co-creation process with the participation of 47 experts through a focus group and a Delphi study. The framework defines a four-step process and includes nine policies that seek to develop stakeholders' climate change awareness. The framework concludes determining the responsibilities of each stakeholder by defining the policies they should implement, and the effect one policy might cause on other stakeholders and among policies.","[Iturriza, Marta; Hernantes, Josune; Labaka, Leire] Univ Navarra, Dept Ind Management, 2018 TECNUN Escuela Ingenieros, Pamplona 31009, Spain; [Abdelgawad, Ahmed A.] Univ Agder, Dept ICT, N-4879 Grimstad, Norway",University of Navarra; University of Agder,"Iturriza, M (corresponding author), Univ Navarra, Dept Ind Management, 2018 TECNUN Escuela Ingenieros, Pamplona 31009, Spain.",miturriza@tecnun.es; jhernantes@tecnun.es; ahmedg@uia.no; llabaka@tecnun.es,"Labaka, Leire/H-9744-2014","Labaka, Leire/0000-0002-1721-0624; Aboughonim, Ahmed/0000-0002-1174-9151; ITURRIZA, MARTA/0000-0002-1645-7385",LIFE IP URBAN KLIMA [LIFE18 IPC/ES/000001],LIFE IP URBAN KLIMA,"This research was funded by LIFE IP URBAN KLIMA 2050, grant number LIFE18 IPC/ES/000001.",,95,3,3,4,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR 2,2020,12,6,,,,,,,2168,10.3390/su12062168,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12062168,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LA1YW,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000523751400015,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is a need for more studies on the social basis for climate change asking why people hold the attitudes they do, rather than the dominant tendency to ask how to change attitudes and behavior. Research in different fields show that fundamental life values and worldviews are shaped through life and heavily influenced by early life socialization and culture, which in turn can shape attitudes toward specific phenomena like climate change. We surveyed a representative sample of the Norwegian public and examined how cultural resources and trust in environmental governance institutions are related to attitudes toward climate change. High levels of trust are associated with a tendency to perceive climate change as human caused, and low levels of trust correspond with stronger beliefs that climate change are natural phenomena. High levels of cultural resources are found among climate change deniers as well as believers, indicating that groups with different political, professional and intellectual orientations, as well as life histories, may not trust climate change science. We argue that improved knowledge about the social basis for climate change is an imperative part of futures-oriented expertise.","[Kaltenborn, Bjorn P.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, N-2624 Storhove, Lillehammer, Norway; [Krange, Olve] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway; [Tangeland, Torvald] Oslo & Akershus Univ Coll Appl Sci, Consumpt Res Norway SIFO, Postboks 4,St Olavs Plass, N-0130 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet),"Kaltenborn, BP (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res, N-2624 Storhove, Lillehammer, Norway.",bjom.kaltenborn@nina.no; olve.krange@nina.no; torvald.tangeland@sifo.hioa.no,,"Tangeland, Torvald/0000-0002-6742-6407",,,,,60,7,7,1,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,MAY,2017,89,,,,,,1,13,,10.1016/j.futures.2017.04.005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2017.04.005,,,13,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,EX0XE,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000402943300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, public perception of water infrastructure at risk of flooding has not been explicitly addressed. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate flood risk perception, the factors that influence it, and evaluations of water infrastructure systems. To examine this, data were obtained from a public survey of 755 respondents in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. Risk perception is measured as three components: worry, awareness, and preparedness. Structural equation modeling was used to develop and test a model tracing the interrelationships between risk perception, disaster experience, satisfaction with infrastructure services, knowledge of water infrastructure, socioeconomic characteristics, and political views. Results show that flood risk perception elements (awareness, worry, preparedness) significantly influence public evaluation of water infrastructure conditions and mediate the impact of flood experience, service satisfaction, and knowledge. Evaluation of water infrastructure is positively associated with knowledge and service satisfaction but negatively with flood experience. The study also confirms the importance of socio-economic characteristics in shaping public risk perception and evaluation of infrastructure. These findings imply multiple ways that decision-makers may enhance flood risk management plans and adaptation processes of water infrastructure systems in coastal urban areas.","[Ridha, Tamarah; Mostafavi, Ali] Texas A&M Univ, Zachry Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Ross, Ashley D.] Texas A&M Univ, Marine & Coastal Environm Sci, Galveston, TX 77550 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System,"Ridha, T (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Zachry Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",tamarah.ridha@tamm.edu; ashleydross@tanrug.edu; aruostafavi@civil.tamu.edu,,"Ross, Ashley/0000-0002-8415-3383","National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Gulf Research Program","National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Gulf Research Program","The authors would like to acknowledge that data collection of this research was funded by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Gulf Research Program.",,74,5,5,9,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

Europe notably leads scientific production. Keyword evolution shows that CE has been influenced by more lines of research than climate change. We also found that waste management is the CE approach most associated with climate change, mitigation is the climate action most impacted by CE, and food is the most reported greenhouse gas (GHG)-emitting material. However, there are knowledge gaps in the integration of the social dimension, the promotion of climate change adaptation, and the association of sustainable development goal (SDG) 13. Finally, we identified four potentially valuable directions for future studies: (i) CE practices, (ii) bioeconomy, (iii) climate and energy, and (iv) sustainability and natural resources, in which carbon recovery technologies, green materials, regional supply chains, circular agriculture models, and nature-based solutions are promising themes.","[Romero-Perdomo, Felipe; Carvajalino-Umana, Juan David; Gonzalez-Curbelo, Miguel Angel] Univ EAN, Fac Ingn, Dept Ciencias Basicas, Bogota 110221, Colombia; [Romero-Perdomo, Felipe] Corp Colombiana Invest Agr AGROSAVIA Tibaitata, Mosquera 250047, Colombia; [Moreno-Gallego, Jaime Leonardo] Univ Andes, Dept Biol Sci, Max Planck Tandem Grp Computat Biol, Bogota 111711, Colombia; [Moreno-Gallego, Jaime Leonardo] Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, Dept Microbiome Sci, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Ardila, Natalia] Org Naciones Unidas, Pacto Global Red Colombia, Bogota 110221, Colombia","Corporacion Colombiana de Investigacion Agropecuaria, AGROSAVIA; Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Max Planck Society","Gonzalez-Curbelo, MA (corresponding author), Univ EAN, Fac Ingn, Dept Ciencias Basicas, Bogota 110221, Colombia.",fromero44146@universidadean.edu.co; jcarvaj14023@universidadean.edu.co; jl.moreno116@uniandes.edu.co; natalia.ardila@pactoglobal-colombia.org; magonzalez@universidadean.edu.co,"Curbelo, Miguel Ángel González/I-7165-2016","Curbelo, Miguel Ángel González/0000-0001-6047-4302; Romero-Perdomo, Felipe/0000-0002-4277-1925",Universidad EAN,Universidad EAN,This research was funded by Universidad EAN.,,63,6,6,11,30,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2022,14,1,,,,,,,521,10.3390/su14010521,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14010521,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZE8YW,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000759165000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ws together with AGs were crucial to maintaining a high level of diversity at the landscape scale and also contributed to preserving the ecological structure. UWs and UPs had no outstanding impact on ELQ, mainly due to their high level of anthropogenic transformation.

Here, we contribute to close these gaps, advancing principles, and processes that may be used to guide the trajectory for adaptation pathways, without having to rely on data-rich or resource-intensive methods. To achieve this, concepts and practices from the broad pathways literature is combined with our own experience in developing adaptation pathways for primary industries facing the combined impacts of climate change and other, nonclimatic stressors.

A lot of researches had been focused on the wetland cooling effect, especially in mitigating urban heat island effect. However, the intensity and influencing factors of wetland cooling effect currently cannot be thorough explained. In this study, we assessed the cooling effect of wetlands with different types in rural area of Northeast China by using split-window algorithm (SWA) to estimate land surface temperatures (LST) from Landsat-8 thermal infrared sensor. We used correlation analysis to examine the relationships between characteristics of wetlands and cooling effect. Our results showed that paddy fields had the largest cooling effects than lakes followed by marshes for human disturbance. Size and shaped complexity were important characteristics to determine wetland cooling effects. Although our results suggested that larger size of wetlands might have higher intensity and spatial extent of cooling effects, small size of wetlands might have large or almost similar amount of cooling effects with the larger ones. Our findings have important implications for land managers and policy makers to design effective plans for conservation and climate change adaptation.","[Zhang, Wenguang; Wang, Wenjuan; Hou, Guanglei; Gong, Chao; Jiang, Ming; Lyu, Xianguo] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Environm, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography & Agroecology, CAS","Zhang, WG (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Environm, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China.",zhangwenguang@iga.ac.cn,,,"National Science Foundation of China [NSFC41371193, NSFC41101091, NSFC41471080]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The study was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC41371193, NSFC41101091, and NSFC41471080).",,54,2,2,4,47,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

The speed and magnitude of climate-induced changes may seriously challenge their ability to adapt. Participatory group discussions and 271 household surveys in three villages highlight the current level of vulnerability and adaptive capacity towards climatic variability and risks. This paper visualizes three dimensions of the vulnerability framework at two levels using the Community Climate Vulnerability Index and household climate vulnerability cube. Results show that not only poor households are most at risk from climate change challenges, but also those better-off households highly dependent on specialized agricultural production are locally exposed to climate change risks. The majority of vulnerable households are characterized by low adaptive capacity. Floods and drought regularly put the poor under stress, which has led to various coping mechanisms; but capability of applying long-term adaptive strategies remains low among all households. The outcome of the participatory consultation underlines local community preference for an integrated approach to mainstream climate change adaptation into community natural resource management and livelihood improvement that may lead to better adaptive capacity building.","[Jiao, Xi] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Moinuddin, Hasan] Management Consultant, GMS Environm Operat Ctr, Bangkok, Thailand",University of Copenhagen,"Jiao, X (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark.",xj@ifro.ku.dk,,,Government of Sweden; Government of Finland; PR China's Poverty Reduction Fund; Government of the Netherlands; European Commission,Government of Sweden; Government of Finland; PR China's Poverty Reduction Fund; Government of the Netherlands(Netherlands Government); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"The Asian Development Bank's GMS Core Environment Program and Biodiversity Conservation Corridors Initiative supported by the Governments of Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands and the PR China's Poverty Reduction Fund must be thanked for the financial assistance in carrying out this study as part of its Activity on: Climate Change Impacts, Vulnerability, and Adaptation in Agriculture Areas in BCI Pilot Sites.

There is a limited body of literature (in English) addressing decay and fire, but a richer one referring to floods. The analysis highlights the fact that there is a gap between theory and practice within contemporary adaptation measures (which is also highlighted by previous studies).

Little attention has been paid to attitudes of other important actors in the knowledge transfer chain. Evidence indeed suggests that adoption rarely happens at the farm level, but requires the right inputs from science and extension services. Divergent attitudes among actors in the knowledge transfer chain may hence contribute to low adoption rates by transferring insufficient, outdated, irrelevant and/or incorrect information. This study is an investigation on attitudes towards climate change mitigation and adaptation of three classes of actors: sheep farmers, researchers involved in fields related to sheep farming and extension officers from private companies and public agencies. The investigation is based on data collected through self-administered questionnaires submitted to 165 participants to agricultural field days in Sardinia (Italy). The sample consists of sheep farmers (37,5%), researchers (16,4%), extension officers (32,1%) and other agricultural workers or students (14 %). In order to assess differences in attitude and identify the sources of attitudinal divergence, the study adopts Kolmogorov - Smirnov (KS) equality-of-distribution tests and Partial-least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Comparing and contrasting attitudes towards several topics related to GHG emission mitigation and adaptation to climate change reveal that researchers and extension officers have different attitudes towards innovation for mitigating GHG, that in turn depend on different information and beliefs on the causes and effects of climate change. This context is less than optimal to promote adoption of climate change mitigation or adaptation strategies. Climate change science and policy design need to recognise the complexity of knowledge transmission and the multiplicity of attitudes and beliefs that inform and affect the process. To mitigate the impact of diverging attitudes and beliefs among researchers and extension officers tailored communication strategies should avoid controversial issues and focus on benefits of innovation on farm efficiency. In turn, this would build trust and cooperation among all the actors in the knowledge transfer chain. Only when cooperation is assured, one could be confident that the information delivered to farmers is scientifically sound, relevant, value-neutral and useful in changing farmers' behaviour.","[Concu, Giovanni Battista; Atzeni, Gianfranco; Meleddu, Marta; Vannini, Marco] Univ Sassari, Sassari, Italy; [Concu, Giovanni Battista; Atzeni, Gianfranco; Meleddu, Marta; Vannini, Marco] CRENoS, Cagliari, Italy",University of Sassari,"Concu, GB (corresponding author), Univ Sassari, Sassari, Italy.",gbconcu@uniss.it,"Meleddu, Marta/HFZ-7852-2022","Vannini, Marco/0000-0001-9685-0736",European Union [LIFE15 CCM/IT/000123],European Union(European Commission),"This study was supported by the LIFE financial instrument of the European Union (project SheepToShip LIFE - Looking for an eco-sustainable sheep supply chain: environmental benefits and implications, LIFE15 CCM/IT/000123)",,68,10,11,1,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Our results indicate that NPP had obvious spatial differentiation, an overall increasing trend was identified and this trend will continue in the future for more than half of the pixels. Land use and Land cover and precipitation were the main factors regulating NPP variation at both the national scale and the sub-region scale, except in southwest China, which was dominated by altitude and temperature. Moreover, an interactive effect between each pair of factors was observed and the effect of any pair of driving factors was greater than that of any single factor, manifested as either bivariate enhancement or nonlinear enhancement.

Today, in response to intersecting pressures from climate change, soil fertility loss, and socioeconomic change associated with globalization, these farmers are working to build more resilient livelihood systems. This study examines farmers' perceptions of environmental change and socioeconomic transition in Senegal and the drivers and constraints on their adaptive responses, with particular attention to the interplay of on- and non-farm livelihood strategies amid concerns about changing weather. Semi-structured interviews with 47 farmers provide insight into individual lived experiences while surveys and multinomial regression drawing data from approximately 500 farmers point to broader patterns in perceptions and adaptive strategies. The findings indicate that most Senegalese farmers perceive substantial environmental change that is amplifying ongoing processes of agrarian change, increasing reliance on non-farm livelihoods and youth migration in particular. While the most resource-constrained farmers rely primarily on prayer-likely an expression of limited alternative strategies-those most concerned about weather changes turn to diversified livelihood strategies. This study illustrates an evolving relationship between farmers and non-farm work amid environmental and socioeconomic change in rural Africa, with implications for development initiatives aimed at supporting farmer adaptation to climate change.","[Voss, Rachel C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Voss, RC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",rvoss@ucsc.edu,,"Voss, Rachel/0000-0002-0890-830X",National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE1339067]; University of California at Santa Cruz; New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition's ICT Extension Challenge in Senegal under United States Agency for International Development [AID-OAA-A-15-00010],National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of California at Santa Cruz; New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition's ICT Extension Challenge in Senegal under United States Agency for International Development,"This work was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant No. DGE1339067, the University of California at Santa Cruz, and, in part, by the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition's ICT Extension Challenge in Senegal under United States Agency for International Development Cooperative Agreement No. AID-OAA-A-15-00010.

However, we found little evidence of concern regarding climate change impacts on forest ecosystems and forestry among the participants. Instead, the majority regarded climate change more as an opportunity for the Norwegian forest-based sector than a threat. A minority had implemented proactive practices motivated by climate change but in all but one case, the adjustments were adaptation of forest infrastructure. In general, the participants agreed that the uncertainty associated with the effects of climate change and the (economical) uncertainty associated with adaptation of forest ecosystems were too large to change forest management practices at present.

Communicating that science is complicated by the politicization of the topic. In two studies, we ask how political cues, designed to evoke individuals' sense of identity as believers or nonbelievers in global warming, affect a hypothetical decision: buying a home vulnerable to coastal flooding exacerbated by global warming using the Zillow (R) real estate website. In both studies, we manipulate participants' frame of reference by focusing them on risks due to 'elevation', 'global warming', or both, or mentioning neither. We also examine how immersion in practical details affects the power of these cues by manipulating whether participants have access to Risk Finder (http://sealevel.climatecentral.org), an interactive decision aid. Study 1 asks about global warming beliefs after their decision; Study 2 asks beforehand. Both find that immersion in practical information, using Risk Finder, overrode political identity cues. When framed in terms of both elevation and global warming and without explicit expression of global warming beliefs (Study 1), participants' responses reflected their beliefs. The results suggest that communications should acknowledge political differences and then focus on practical decisions and the science that can inform them.","[Wong-Parodi, Gabrielle; Fischhoff, Baruch] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Fischhoff, Baruch] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Social & Decis Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University; Carnegie Mellon University,"Wong-Parodi, G (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, 129 Baker Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",gwongpar@cmu.edu,"Fischhoff, Baruch/I-9859-2014","Fischhoff, Baruch/0000-0002-3030-6874; Wong-Parodi, Gabrielle/0000-0001-5207-7489","Rockefeller Foundation; Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making [NSF/SES-0949710]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0949710, 1463492] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Rockefeller Foundation; Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This work was supported by a research grant from the Rockefeller Foundation and by the Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making (NSF/SES-0949710).

There are a number of key morphological and physiological traits, such as disease resistance and yield that need to be maintained and improved upon if a commercial variety is to be successful. Computational tools that provide the ability to integrate and visualize this data with pedigree structure, will enable breeders to make better decisions on the lines that are used in crossings to meet both the demands for increased yield/production and adaptation to climate change. Results: We have used a large and unique set of experimental barley (H. vulgare) data to develop a prototype pedigree visualization system. We then used this prototype to perform a subjective user evaluation with domain experts to guide and direct the development of an interactive pedigree visualization tool called Helium. Conclusions: We show that Helium allows users to easily integrate a number of data types along with large plant pedigrees to offer an integrated environment in which they can explore pedigree data.

An irrigated system based on direct seeding on wet land is used. Occurrence of cold periods throughout the crop cycle (April/May-September/October) and the risk of soil salinization are the most important constraints. Since 1988, CIRAD and CFR have been implementing a rice breeding program for the Camargue. It aims at creating cultivars fitting the needs of rice farmers (yield potential and stability), the rice industry (milling and processing qualities) and consumers (cooking and taste qualities). Varieties grown in the region belong to the japonica subspecies of Oryza sativa. Hybridization is the basis for creation of variability. Progenies are selected using the pedigree method associated or not with haploidipolidisation applied to the first generation. Marker-assisted selection has recently been introduced to improve selection efficacy for resistance to fungal diseases occurring erratically in relation to climate. So far, 25 varieties have been registered in the European Official Catalogue, of which 5 have proven particularly successful among farmers. Progress achieved for germination in anaerobic conditions, resistance to stem borers, grain shape and other qualities, including aroma, are presented.

Its key innovations include the fact that it comes with all data required for application, is very high spatial resolution (1 km or 1-hectare resolution) and yet global in extent and is particularly well suited to heterogeneous environments with little or no available data. The model, WaterWorld, is capable of producing a hydrological baseline representing the mean water balance for 1950-2000 and allows users to apply ensemble scenarios for climate change or examine the impact of policy options for land cover change or land management interventions. WaterWorld is focused on policy support, especially in conservation hydrology and development applications and is delivered through a simple web interface, requiring little local capacity for use. The paper discusses the paucity of hydrological data and the urgency of hydrological problems in much of the less-developed world, which reinforce the need for tools like WaterWorld. We discuss the types of hydrological problems that models might contribute to managing and the requirements of models applied to such problems.

Hatching of cold-sensitised eggs is concentrated in spring, while alternative hatching of non-cold-sensitised eggs in autumn mitigates the risk of poor conditions for hatching in spring or host absence during peak larval availability. Isolates from Scotland showed much less propensity to hatch without chilling than the previously characterised isolate from southern England. Nematodirus battus eggs from a hill farm in Scotland showed intermediate proportions of non-chilled hatching, perhaps related to unpredictability of climate at higher altitudes. Geographic polymorphism in larval behaviour appears to be present in the form of differing chilling requirements for egg hatching. Since bet-hedging through trait diversification is a plausible and demonstrated strategy for coping with environmental unpredictability, it is a likely target for adaptation to climate change. Predictions of disease epidemiology in a changing climate should incorporate parasite adaptation, but further theoretical and empirical characterisations of likely evolutionary responses are needed before this is possible for the most economically important systems.

The seedlings were exposed to 65 ppb ozone (AOT40 ( accumulated over a threshold of 40 ppb) exposure of 10.7 ppm center dot h) over 62 d in climate chambers, simulating spring conditions, and to -2 degrees C over two consecutive nights 33 d after the start of the experiment. The plants were measured for net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and concentrations of photosynthetic pigments, Rubisco, soluble proteins, carbohydrates, and macronutrients. Frost treatment caused a rapid 60%-77% decline in net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance rates. Recovery of net photosynthesis from frost was not complete during the subsequent 14 d, mainly because of impaired light capture through significant pigment loss and structural injuries. Concomitant ozone enrichment exacerbated the negative effect of frost on pigments and stomatal conductance. Both frost and ozone caused nutrient imbalance and increase in soluble proteins in leaves, whereas metabolism of carbohydrates was disturbed only when ozone was present. Responses to ozone and frost varied greatly among the genotypes, suggesting that there is a high capacity within the birch population to adapt to climate change through  preadapted individuals.","Univ Kuopio, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, FI-70211 Kuopio, Finland; Finish Forest Res Inst, Punkaharju Res Stn, FI-58450 Punkaharju, Finland",University of Eastern Finland; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Oksanen, E (corresponding author), Univ Joensuu, Dept Biol, POB 111, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland.",Elina.Oksanen@uku.fi,"Prozherina, Nadezda/A-5917-2013","Prozherina, Nadezhda/0000-0002-5067-7007; Oksanen, Elina/0000-0002-1866-736X",,,,,53,26,26,0,13,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

The technical efficiency scores were estimated using the stochastic meta-frontier approach because it allows addressing the expected differences in production technologies. Tobit regression framework was applied to identify factors related to farm inefficiency. Results showed mean technical efficiency of 58%, implying that the farm households can improve cereal output by about 36% with the current level of input mix and technologies. The t-test results revealed farm households who adopted high-yielding varieties with research-based recommended production practices were technically more efficient than their counterparts. Our econometric model results also indicated that the use of high-yielding varieties and research-based recommended seed rate affects the technical efficiency of farm households positively and significantly. In addition, we find gender, age, mobile telephone ownership, cooperative membership, access to input market, and crop damage as significant factors affecting the efficiency of farm households.

This study combined top-down ski season modelling and bottom-up semi-structured interviews with Swedish ski industry stakeholders to examine changing market dynamics, climate change risk perceptions, and current and future adaptations under the backdrop of Sweden's potential climatic advantage. Findings indicate that despite a belief of having greater climate change recognition and preparedness than other international ski regions, stakeholders were reticent to link local conditions to anthropogenic climate change. Snowmaking was the most utilised adaptation option, and consistent with other regions was not explicitly seen as a climate change adaptation rather a prudent business decision. A gap between tourists' demand for increased resort sustainability and the actions of resorts was also evident in several locations. Market dynamics are also considered as capitalising on Sweden's potential climatic advantage will likely necessitate increased aviation travel and associated emissions, a potential barrier to the country's ability to become a 'last resort' for European skiing due to Sweden's ambitious, legally binding net-zero policy target of 2045.","[Rice, Harald; Cohen, Scott Allen] Univ Surrey, Sch Hospitality & Tourism Management, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Scott, Daniel] Univ Surrey, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Scott, Daniel] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Surrey; University of Surrey; University of Waterloo,"Rice, H (corresponding author), Univ Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, England.",h.rice@surrey.ac.uk,,"Scott, Daniel/0000-0001-7825-9301; Cohen, Scott/0000-0003-1260-8577",,,,,63,0,0,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-9582,1747-7646,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

To perform this task, a social vulnerability assessment was conducted in two different fishing areas: one in Spain and the other one in Turkey. The vulnerability was measured using the collected data and information through a structured questionnaire, and surveys were carried out among fishers in the Castello (Spain) and the Aegean Sea (Turkey) between 2018 and 2019. Overall, the results indicated that the two studied regions have a moderate to high vulnerability and that the Aegean Sea was slightly more vulnerable than Castello. It was also found that storms and temperature are the main climatic stressors that affect the fishing sector, and the economic indicators such as revenue from fishing in both regions showed high degrees of sensitivity. To reduce the vulnerability to climate change, adaptive measures should be implemented while taking into consideration the specific socio-economic and institutional characteristics of each region. In conclusion, the effects of climate change on the fishing sector and their social vulnerability are diverse. Consequently, there is no single climate measure that can minimize the vulnerability of fishing sectors in different regions.","[Gomez Murciano, Mauro; Sanchez LIzaso, Jose Luis] Univ Alicante, Dept Marine Sci & Appl Biol, Alicante, Spain; [Liu, Yajie] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Fac Biosci Fisheries & Econ, Tromso, Norway; [Unal, Vahdet] Ege Univ, Fac Fisheries, Izmir, Turkey",Universitat d'Alacant; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; Ege University,"Liu, YJ (corresponding author), UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Fac Biosci Fisheries & Econ, Tromso, Norway.",yajie.liu@uit.no,"Ünal, Vahdet/W-2486-2017","Ünal, Vahdet/0000-0001-6157-0590","Faculty of Fisheries, EGE University","Faculty of Fisheries, EGE University","The authors acknowledge the cooperation of the fishers from the three different regions studied for their important role in collecting the data.

Green infrastructure (GI) has been increasingly recognized as a promising nature-based solution for climate change adaptation, mitigation, and other societal objectives for sustainable development. Although the climate contribution of GI has been extensively addressed in the literature, the linkages between the climate benefits and associated co-benefits and trade-offs remain unclear. We systematically reviewed the evidence from 141 papers, focusing on their climate benefits, relevant co-benefits and trade-offs, and the GI types that provide such climate (co-)benefits. This study presents a comprehensive overview of the links between climate benefits, co-benefits and types of GI, categorized along a green-grey continuum so that researchers/practitioners can find information according to their topic of interest. We further provide an analysis of trade-offs between various GI benefits. 'Bundles' of major co-benefits and trade-offs for each climate benefit can be identified with recommendations for strategies to maximize benefits and minimize trade-offs. To promote climate-resilient pathways through GI, it is crucial for decision-makers to identify opportunities to deliver multiple ecosystem services and benefits while recognizing disservices and trade-offs that need to be avoided or managed.","[Choi, Changsoon; Berry, Pam; Smith, Alison] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Dyson Perrins Bldg,South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of Oxford,"Choi, C (corresponding author), Green Templeton Coll, 43 Woodstock RD, Oxford OX2 6HG, England.",changsoon.choi@ouce.ox.ac.uk,,"Choi, Changsoon/0000-0002-7777-8895; Smith, Alison/0000-0003-2649-2202",,,,,119,29,29,45,161,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Several studies have investigated factors influencing farmers' climate change adaptation behaviors in the region; however, little is known about the effectiveness of such measures. This paper examines the determinants of adaptation strategies among VMD rice farmers and assesses the impacts of such practices on rice yield. Design/methodology/approach Endogenous switching regressions were employed using a survey data of 300 rice-producing households in An Giang and Tra Vinh provinces in 2016. Findings The results show that farmers receiving early disaster warnings are more likely to adopt adaptation measures to climate change. If nonadaptors had chosen to respond, their rice yield would have increased by 0.932 tons/ha/season. Research limitations/implications The data sample is small and collected from two provinces in the VMD only; therefore, the results may be specific for the study sites. However, future research can adopt the proposed method for other regions. Originality/value The study estimates the production impacts of farmers' decisions on whether or not to adapt to extreme climate events. The proposed approach allows for capturing both observed and unobserved behaviors.","[Kim Dang, Khoi; Do, Thiep Huy; Pham, Thinh Duc] Vietnam Natl Univ Agr, Agr Market & Inst Res Inst, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Kim Dang, Khoi] Australian Inst Hlth & Welf, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Le, Thi Ha Lien] Inst Policy & Strategy Agr & Rural Dev, Ctr Agr Policy, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Le, Thi Thu Hang] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Vietnam National University of Agriculture (VNUA); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Dang, KK (corresponding author), Vietnam Natl Univ Agr, Agr Market & Inst Res Inst, Hanoi, Vietnam.;Dang, KK (corresponding author), Australian Inst Hlth & Welf, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",khoidk@gmail.com; thiepdo.ami@vnua.edu.vn; lien.le@cap.gov.vn; thi.thu.hang.le@rmit.edu.au; thinhpham.ami@vnua.edu.vn,,"Le, Thi Thu Hang/0000-0001-9614-1198; Khoi, Dang Kim/0000-0003-1668-7014",Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) [ADP/2011/039],Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)(Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res),"The research activities are supported by the project ACIAR Project ADP/2011/039: Assessing Farmer Responses to Climate Change - Adjustment Policy Options, funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR).",,33,8,8,2,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2044-0839,2044-0847,,J AGRIBUS DEV EMERG,J.

This paper explores the impacts of this phenomenon on farmer innovations under recurrent environmental changes. Using a case study of zai, an indigenous innovative farming practice, the paper makes two interrelated arguments. Firstly, it shows that the pervasive enclosures coerced by the Ghanaian state undermine how indigenous knowledge could be proactively deployed for climate risk management. Secondly, ISLAs produce a social barrier to climate change adaptation, as they lead to heightened uncertainty and apprehension among farmers, which affects decisions on climate risk management. More specifically, land expropriation is an example of how adaptation could be hindered by governance, institutions, and policy at the extra-local scale, including not only existing land use laws, but also the constitutional guarantee of private property. The evidence supporting these arguments come from survey data on 619 plots, 70 in-depth interviews, village-level transect walks, and participant observations. Overall, the paper contributes to emerging debates at the interface of land use policy, climate justice, and sustainable adaptation. Theoretically, it also contributes to understanding State-society relations, as well as the political economy of eminent domain, often justified through discourses of public benefits.","[Nyantakyi-Frimpong, Hanson] Univ Denver, Dept Geog & Environm, 2050 East Iliff Ave Denver, Denver, CO 80210 USA",University of Denver,"Nyantakyi-Frimpong, H (corresponding author), Univ Denver, Dept Geog & Environm, 2050 East Iliff Ave Denver, Denver, CO 80210 USA.",hnyanta2@du.edu,,"Nyantakyi-Frimpong, Hanson/0000-0002-6407-1970","International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada [106690-99906075-013]; Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), Canada; Land Deal Politics Initiative (LDPI), International Institute of Social Studies, The Netherlands; University of Denver's Faculty Research Fund [86906-145015]; Department of Geography and the Environment, University of Denve; Public Good Fund from the University of Denver's Center for Community Engagement to advance Scholarship and Learning (CCESL) [86847]","International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada(CGIAR); Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), Canada; Land Deal Politics Initiative (LDPI), International Institute of Social Studies, The Netherlands; University of Denver's Faculty Research Fund; Department of Geography and the Environment, University of Denve; Public Good Fund from the University of Denver's Center for Community Engagement to advance Scholarship and Learning (CCESL)","This paper is based on long-term fieldwork that has been supported by different organizations.

The assessment obtained both community and external stakeholder perceptions of challenges in the neighbourhood, accompanied by a description of how floods have affected infrastructure such as drainage and sanitation, services such as pit emptying and solid waste collection, and localised infrastructure solutions developed by the community as a coping mechanism. The assessment highlighted the need for collaboration with community members to co-develop appropriate flood risk management strategies and infrastructure solutions.

In a context where Indigenous peoples and perspectives are poorly represented in global climate politics, it is important to understand how Pacific people represent their own interests and imagine their own futures as pressures to move due to climate change take hold. We examine political action outside of formal governance spaces and processes, in order to understand how Indigenous people are challenging state-centric approaches to climate change adaptation. We do so by studying the works of Pacific activists and artists who engage with climate change. We find that *banua - an expansive concept, inclusive of people and their place, attentive to both mobility and immobility, and distributed across the Pacific Islands region - is essential for the existential security of Pacific people and central to contemporary climate activism. We find that Pacific activists/artists are challenging the status quo by invoking *banua. In doing so, they are politicising (im)mobility. These mobilisations are coalescing into an Oceanic cosmopolitanism that confronts two mutually reinforcing features of contemporary global climate politics: the subordination of Indigenous peoples, perspectives and worldviews; and the marginalisation of (im)mobility concerns within the global climate agenda.","[Suliman, Samid] Griffith Univ, Sch Humanities Languages & Social Sci, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Farbotko, Carol] Griffith Univ, Griffith Ctr Social & Cultural Res, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Ransan-Cooper, Hedda] Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Engn & Comp Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [McNamara, Karen Elizabeth] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Thornton, Fanny] Univ Canberra, Sch Law & Justice, Bruce, Australia; [McMichael, Celia] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Kitara, Taukiei] Pacific Isl Council Queensland, Runcorn, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Australian National University; University of Queensland; University of Canberra; University of Melbourne,"Suliman, S (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Humanities Languages & Social Sci, Nathan, Qld, Australia.",s.suliman@griffith.edu.au,"mcmichael, celia/ABD-3118-2020; Farbotko, Carol/K-2592-2014; McNamara, Karen/D-7322-2013","mcmichael, celia/0000-0002-4572-602X; Farbotko, Carol/0000-0001-8257-2085; Thornton, Dr Fanny/0000-0001-9823-8903; Suliman, Samid/0000-0001-6354-1750; McNamara, Karen/0000-0002-4511-8403; Ransan-Cooper, Hedda/0000-0002-9053-0229",,,,,107,39,39,2,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1745-0101,1745-011X,,MOBILITIES-UK,Mobilities,MAY 4,2019,14,3,,,SI,,298,318,,10.1080/17450101.2019.1601828,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17450101.2019.1601828,,APR 2019,21,Geography; Transportation,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography; Transportation,IS9QC,,Green Accepted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000469596300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

China, as the largest GHG emitter in the world, is committed to introducing an ETS to reduce emissions. Here we reviewed existing ETSs and sustainable energy policies worldwide as well as China's pilot programs. These studies were conducted in order to propose recommendations for national initiatives and strategies to be implemented in China in relation to climate change adaptation and mitigation. It has been shown that setting emission caps in the context of a national emission intensity target is difficult. However, implementing reliable systems for measurement, reporting, and verification of emissions are essential. A two-level management system (by central and provincial governments) for carbon trading is beneficial to ensure uniform standards and compliance while maintaining flexibility. Persistent political support from, and effective coordination of, policies by the government are crucial. In addition, strengthening of institutional innovation, and the establishment of a national GHG emissions information system, are of equal importance. This vital information could provide a great opportunity for China to re-define its economic growth and take global leadership in combatting climate change.","[Ning, Bolun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Ning, Bolun] Chinese Acad Sci, Bur Int Cooperat, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China; [Ning, Bolun; Xu, Zhihong] Griffith Univ, Sch Biomol & Phys Sci, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Ning, Bolun; Zhu, Yongguan; Fu, Bojie] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yongguan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Urban Environm, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Griffith University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Urban Environment, CAS","Fu, BJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.",bfu@rcees.ac.cn,"Fu, Bojie/B-1493-2009; Xu, Zhihong/B-3223-2009","Xu, Zhihong/0000-0002-6768-0720",National Key Research & Development Program of China [2017YFA0604700],National Key Research & Development Program of China,Under the auspices of the National Key Research & Development Program of China (No. 2017YFA0604700),,32,3,3,0,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1002-0063,1993-064X,,CHINESE GEOGR SCI,Chin.

We facilitated workshops in the Mixteca Alta region of Oaxaca, Mexico, in which groups of small farmers described how they had adapted to and prepared for past climate challenges. Farmers reported that their cropping systems were changing for multiple reasons: more drought, later rainfall onset, decreased rural labor, and introduced labor-saving technologies. Examination of climate data found that farmers' climate narratives were largely consistent with the observational record. There have been increases in temperature and rainfall intensity, and an increase in rainfall seasonality that may be perceived as later rainfall onset. Farmers also identified 14 indicators that they subsequently used to evaluate the condition of their agroecosystems. Farmers ranked landscape-scale indicators as more marginal than farmer management or soil quality indicators. From this analysis, farmers proposed strategies to improve the ability of their agroecosystems to cope with climatic variability. Notably, they recognized that social organizing and education are required for landscape-scale indicators to be improved. This outcome suggests that climate change adaptation by small farmers involves much more than just a set of farming practices, but also community action to tackle collective problems.","[Roge, Paul] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Soil & Microbial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Friedman, Andrew Ronald] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Geog, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Astier, Marta] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Invest Geog Ambiental, Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico; [Altieri, Miguel A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Michigan State University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Roge, P (corresponding author), Plant & Soil Sci Bldg,1066 Bogue St,Room A286, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",proge@msu.edu,,"Astier, Marta/0000-0002-6620-2356; Friedman, Andrew/0000-0001-6994-2037; Roge, Paul/0000-0003-2298-5958",Garcia Robles-Fulbright; UC MEXUS; CONACYT,Garcia Robles-Fulbright; UC MEXUS; CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),"Financial support for this project was provided by Garcia Robles-Fulbright, UC MEXUS, and CONACYT.",,44,33,34,0,47,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",2168-3565,2168-3573,,AGROECOL SUST FOOD,Agroecol.

Research shows that excess morbidity and mortality occurs during cold weather periods. We critically reviewed evidence relating temperature variability, health outcomes, and adaptation strategies to cold weather. Health outcomes included cardiovascular-, respiratory-, cerebrovascular-, and all-cause morbidity and mortality. Individual and contextual risk factors were assessed to highlight associations between individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics that contribute to a person's vulnerability to variability in cold weather events. Epidemiologic studies indicate that the populations most vulnerable to variations in cold winter weather are the elderly, rural and, generally, populations living in moderate winter climates. Fortunately, cold-related morbidity and mortality are preventable and strategies exist for protecting populations from these adverse health outcomes. We present a range of adaptation strategies that can be implemented at the individual, building, and neighborhood level to protect vulnerable populations from cold-related morbidity and mortality. The existing research justifies the need for increased outreach to individuals and communities for education on protective adaptations in cold weather. We propose that future climate change adaptation research couple building energy and thermal comfort models with epidemiological data to evaluate and quantify the impacts of adaptation strategies.

While the two concepts are closely interconnected, they are nonetheless distinct. A conceptual understanding of the relationship between vulnerability and poverty is presented, and the types of responses that can address both of these challenges are identified. An empirical example from Kenya is used to show how climate change adaptation can potentially reconcile the objectives of both poverty reduction and vulnerability reduction. Significantly, each and every poverty reduction measure does not reduce vulnerability to climate change, just as each and every adaptation measure does not automatically contribute to poverty reduction. It is argued that adaptation measures need to specifically target vulnerability-poverty linkages. Although most adaptation efforts have been focused on reducing risk, there is a need to address local capacity to adapt, as well as the societal processes generating vulnerability. An implication is that the mode of implementing adaptation measures must capture the specificity of both the vulnerability and poverty context. Furthermore, adaptation is not simply a local activity, since targeting the processes generating vulnerability and poverty often entails addressing political and economic structures.","[Eriksen, Siri H.; O'Brien, Karen] Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, N-0317 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Eriksen, SH (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, POB 1096, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",siri.eriksen@sgeo.uio.no,,,,,,,72,163,167,6,114,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

In this study, we collected data from monthly cruises on the inner shelf, continuous nearshore moorings inside and outside a small coastal upwelling embayment (San Luis Obispo Bay in Central California), and weekly phytoplankton measurements inside the bay during the upwelling season. Nearshore DO was generally domi-nated by low-frequency synoptic variability, with increased DO variance near the surface relative to the bottom and inside the bay compared to outside. Two nearshore hypoxic regimes were identified. In the first regime, which occurred during periods of strong upwelling in the spring across all nearshore sites, the nearshore bottom water temperature-DO (T-DO) relationship was aligned with that found offshore, suggesting hypoxia was driven by the direct advection and cross-shelf exchange of low DO subthermocline waters from the shelf. This period also coincided with minimal water-column stratification, small vertical DO differences, and a diatom-dominated phytoplankton assemblage. In the second regime, which occurred during summer months and was characterized by weaker upwelling, strong stratification, and dinoflagellate-dominated phytoplankton assemblage, the near -bottom T-DO relationship inside the bay deviated significantly from that on the shelf offshore. These hypoxic events inside the bay were likely driven by localized respiration and lack of ventilation of bottom waters due to strong stratification. Collectively, these observations reveal a shift in the strength and magnitude of physical versus biological processes driving nearshore DO dynamics. The high spatiotemporal variability of DO dynamics in upwelling bays means that they are likely to be at the forefront of ecosystem impacts of and adaptions to climate change, and may act as sentinel systems or canaries on the coast.","[Walter, Ryan K.; Huie, Stephen A.; Abraham, Jon Christian P.; Robbins, Ian] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Phys Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Pasulka, Alexis] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Biol Sci Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Davis, Kristen A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA USA; [Davis, Kristen A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA USA; [Connolly, Thomas P.] Moss Landing Marine Labs, Moss Landing, CA USA; [Mazzini, Piero L.

Accurately assessing and projecting the changing climate extremes at the local (station) scale required for climate risk management are therefore highly important. However, global and regional climate models often fail to represent the statistical distributions of observed daily extreme variables and hence extremes in complex terrain. In this work, we developed a statistical downscaling (SD) model to project summer daily maximum temperature (Tmax) and heatwave indices for 65 meteorological stations in CA toward 2100. The SD model involves first-order autoregression and multiple linear regression using large-scale Tmax and circulation indices (CIs) as predictors, and the model is cross-validated against historical observations. The local Tmax and heatwave indices are then projected for 2015-2100 driven by the output of a global climate model (CNRM-CM6-1) under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585). The application of the SD model significantly improves forecasting of the probability distribution (10th/90th percentiles) of Tmax at stations, particularly across mountainous regions. The model also captures interannual variability and the long-term trend in Tmax, consistent with synoptic-scale inputs. SD projections demonstrate strong warming trends of summer Tmax in CA toward 2100 with rates between 0.35-0.64 degrees C per decade based on the SSP245 and SSP370 scenarios. Consequently, heatwave occurrence is projected to rise by 1.0-5.0 and 2.0-7.0 d per decade under the SSP245 and SSP370 scenarios, respectively, by 2100. Duration, intensity, and amplitude of heatwaves rise at greater rates under higher-emission scenarios, particularly in southeastern CA. The proposed SD model serves as a useful tool for assessing local climate extremes, which are needed for regional risk management and policymaking for adaption to climate change.","[Fan, Li-Jun; Yan, Zhong-Wei; LI, Zhen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Res Temperate East A, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Chen, Deliang] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, Reg Climate Grp, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; University of Gothenburg","Fan, LJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Res Temperate East A, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",fanlj@tea.ac.cn,"Yan, Zhongwei/AAF-7451-2020","Yan, Zhongwei/0000-0003-0638-137X","Strategic Pri-ority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20020201, XDA19030402]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41775077, 41975115]",Strategic Pri-ority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was jointly sponsored by the Strategic Pri-ority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA20020201, XDA19030402) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41775077, 41975115) .",,63,0,0,3,7,KEAI PUBLISHING LTD,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING, DONGCHENG DISTRICT 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1674-9278,,,ADV CLIM CHANG RES,Adv.

Thus, there is an urgent need for spatially-detailed information of current thermal growing season (GS) conditions and their past changes. Here, we deployed a large network of weather stations, high-resolution geospatial environmental data and semi-parametric regression to model the spatial variation in multiple GS variables (i.e. beginning, end, length, degree day sum [GDDS, base temperature + 5 degrees C]) and their intra-annual variability and temporal trends in respect to geographical location, topography, water and forest cover, and urban land use variables over northern Europe. Our analyses revealed substantial spatial variability in average GS conditions (1990-2019) and consistent temporal trends (1950-2019). We showed that there have been significant changes in thermal GS towards earlier beginnings (on average 15 days over the study period), increased length (23 days) and GDDS (287 degrees C days). By using a spatial interpolation of weather station data to a regular grid we predicted current GS conditions at high resolution (100 m x 100 m) and with high accuracy (correlation >= 0.92 between observed and predicted mean GS values), whereas spatial variation in temporal trends and interannual variability were more demanding to predict. The spatial variation in GS variables was mostly driven by latitudinal and elevational gradients, albeit they were constrained by local scale variables. The proximity of sea and lakes, and high forest cover suppressed temporal trends and inter-annual variability potentially indicating local climate buffering.

Early-warning systems are an important aspect of adapting to climate change. Weather forecasting relies on the use of numerical weather prediction models and these need to be configured properly. In this study, we investigate the effects of using multi-nests and a convection scheme on the simulation of a heavy rainfall event over the north-western region of Kunene, Namibia. The event, which was associated with a cut-off low system, was short-lived and resulted in over 45 mm of rainfall in one hour. For the multi-nest, a 9 km grid-length parent domain is nested within the Global Forecast System (GFS) simulations, which in turn forces a 3 km grid spacing child domain. A different set of simulations are produced using a single nest of 3 km grid spacing, nested directly inside the GFS data. The simulations are produced with the convection scheme switched on and off. The impact of a single versus multi-nest is found to be small in general, with slight differences in the location of high rainfall intensity. Switching off the convection schemes results in high rainfall intensity and increased detail in the simulations, including when a grid spacing of 9 km is used. Using a grid spacing of 3 km with the convection scheme on, results in a loss of detail in the simulations as well as lower rainfall amounts. The study shows a need for different configurations to be tested before an optimum configuration can be selected for operational forecasting. We recommend further tests with different synoptic forcing and convection schemes to be conducted to identify a suitable configuration for Namibia.","[Somses, Sieglinde] Namibia Meteorol Serv, Private Bag 13224, Windhoek, Namibia; [Bopape, Mary-Jane M.; Phaduli, Elelwani; Maisha, Robert] South African Weather Serv, Private Bag X097, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Ndarana, Thando] Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa; [Fridlind, Ann] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, 2880 Broadway, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Matsui, Toshihisa] NASA, Mesoscale Dynam & Precipitat Lab, Global Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Matsui, Toshihisa] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr ESSIC, 5825 Univ Res Court,Suite 4000, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Limbo, Anton; Maikhudumu, Shaka] Univ Namibia, Informat Technol Dept, Private Bag 13301, Windhoek, Namibia; [Rakate, Edward] CSIR, Ctr High Performance Comp, POB 395, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa",South African Weather Service (SAWS); University of Pretoria; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Namibia; Council for Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - South Africa,"Somses, S (corresponding author), Namibia Meteorol Serv, Private Bag 13224, Windhoek, Namibia.",sieglinde.somses@mwt.gov.na; Mary-Jane.Bopape@weathersa.co.za; thando.ndarana@up.ac.za; ann.fridlind@nasa.gov; Toshihisa.Matsui-1@nasa.gov; Elelwani.Phaduli@weathersa.co.za; ALimbo@unam.na; Shaka.Maikhudumu@mme.gov.na; Robert.Maisha@weathersa.co.za; ERakate@csir.co.za,"Fridlind, Ann M/E-1495-2012; Ndarana, Thando/AAE-2516-2021; Bopape, Mary-Jane/HNT-0344-2023","Fridlind, Ann M/0000-0002-9020-0852; Bopape, Mary-Jane/0000-0003-2111-4595; Maisha, T.

This article presents the concept of forest use regulation promoting the sustainable forestry development in forest management planning. A method for defining a synthetic criterion of assessing important features of stand structure was proposed, which would enable the classification of stands in terms of needs and the urgency of their transformation (reconstruction) or suitability for longer standing. As a result, such a concept may ensure the preservation of the relative uniformity of logging use and the improvement of age structure as well as an increase of natural values of the forest, regardless of a stand's age. The concept was tested on a large forest complex (over 0.5 million hectares) subjected to intense environmental pressure (Silesian Region in Poland). We prepared long-term individualistic development forecasts, separately for area and volume. Based on this, we followed the cutting uniformity principle in the analysed time period by calculating a long-term average of cutting allowance. It was determined by averaging the projected usage size in moving window and eventually was adopted as the cutting upper limit in the whole analysed period. The proposed size of cuts in each period resulted from the relation between the average value and the forecast. Three sets of stands of the differentiated urgency of interventions were distinguished: I-well-stocked and stable stands (no need of intervention)-55% of stands area, II - acceptable stands (not urgent intervention needed)-35% and III-poor stands (urgent intervention needed)-10%. This concept joins top-down and bottom-up approach of cutting uniformity that focuses stand's status instead of its age or dimensions.","[Borecki, Tomasz; Kedziora, Wojciech; Orzechowski, Michal; Wojcik, Roman; Stepien, Edward] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Dept Forest Management Planning, Fac Forestry, Nowoursynowska 159, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland; [Lopinski, Lukasz] Lochow Forest Dist, Wyszkowska 28, PL-07130 Lochow, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Kedziora, W (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Dept Forest Management Planning, Fac Forestry, Nowoursynowska 159, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland.",tomasz.borecki@wl.sggw.pl; lukasz.lopinski@warszawa.lasy.gov.pl; wojciech.kedziora@wl.sggw.pl; michal.orzechowski@wl.sggw.pl; roman.wojcik@wl.sggw.pl; edward.stepien@wl.sggw.pl,"Kędziora, Wojciech/K-7097-2019","Kędziora, Wojciech/0000-0002-1469-9532; Borecki, Tomasz/0000-0001-9669-9191; Wojcik, Roman/0000-0001-5334-7559; Orzechowski, Michal/0000-0002-3618-3107",Polish State Forests research grant [OR.271.3.8.2015],Polish State Forests research grant,"This research was funded by the Polish State Forests research grant OR.271.3.8.2015 from 9 March 2015 to the Department of Forestry Management Planning, WULS-SGGW Faculty of Forestry.",,84,4,4,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,SEP,2018,9,9,,,,,,,539,10.3390/f9090539,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f9090539,,,17,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,GY2UC,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000448398100035,View Full Record in Web of Science

The current impasse over taking action may lie in the very different ways people view the world and their place in it. The aim is to explore some profound contradictions within differing strands of knowledge feeding into common understandings of climate justice. Design/methodology/approach - A literature review of appropriate peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted with a view to defining the term climate justice. Findings - In addition to there being no single, clear definition of climate justice, a fundamental schism was found between what indigenous peoples want to see happen and what industrialised nations can do with respect to both the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change. Research limitations/implications - One limitation to defining climate justice, and reason for publishing, is the lack of peer-reviewed work on this topic. Practical implications - This paper has many practical implications, the most fundamental of which is the need to reach a consensus over rights to the Earth's resources. If humanity, within which there are many societies, chooses to follow a truly equitable path post 2015, industrialised countries and corporations will need to move away from endless growth economics. The ways in which climate justice might be operationalised in future are considered, including the concept of a climate-justice checklist. Originality/value - While the reconciliation proposed in this paper might be considered idealistic, unless it is acknowledged the Earth's resources are limited, over-exploited and for all people to use sustainably, thus requiring a reduction in consumption by individuals relatively affluent in global terms, climate negotiators will continue talking about the same issues without achieving meaningful change.","[Meikle, Mandy; Wilson, Jake; Jafry, Tahseen] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Glasgow Caledonian University,"Jafry, T (corresponding author), Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",t.jafry@gcu.ac.uk,"Wilson, Jake/HHC-3292-2022","Jafry, Tahseen/0000-0003-1191-0029",,,,,57,13,13,7,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

The policy responses are based on an understanding of the determinants of vulnerability identified in research conducted with 15 Inuit communities. A consistent approach was used in each case study where vulnerability is conceptualized as a function of exposure-sensitivity to climatic risks and adaptive capacity to deal with those risks. This conceptualization focuses on the biophysical and human determinants of vulnerability and how they are influenced by processes and conditions operating at multiple spatial-temporal scales. Case studies involved close collaboration with community members and policy makers to identify conditions to which each community is currently vulnerable, characterize the factors that shape vulnerability and how they have changed over time, identify opportunities for adaptation policy, and examine how adaptation can be mainstreamed. Fieldwork, conducted between 2006 and 2009, included 443 semi-structured interviews, 20 focus groups/community workshops, and 65 interviews with policy makers at local, regional, and national levels. Synthesizing findings consistent across the case studies we document significant vulnerabilities, a function of socio-economic stresses and change, continuing and pervasive inequality, and magnitude of climate change. Nevertheless, adaptations are available, feasible, and Inuit have considerable adaptive capacity. Realizing this adaptive capacity and overcoming adaptation barriers requires policy intervention to: (i) support the teaching and transmission of environmental knowledge and land skills, (ii) enhance and review emergency management capability, (iii) ensure the flexibility of resource management regimes, (iv) provide economic support to facilitate adaptation for groups with limited household income, (v) increase research effort to identify short and long term risk factors and adaptive response options, (vi) protect key infrastructure, and (vii) promote awareness of climate change impacts and adaptation among policy makers.

There, Parties have reported the national greenhouse gas inventories, policies, and measures to address climate change, the greenhouse gas emissions projections, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change, and education and public awareness. Implementation of policies and measures to address climate change in economies in transition (EIT) is very complicated due to the experienced deep economic crisis. It is important to outline the efforts of EIT countries to identify their climate change policy and to recognize the most effective policies and measures achieved under these countries' special circumstances. This paper compiles information from the policies and measures section of the National Communications of nine EIT countries. The analysis has been carried out in the framework of overall policy context and the national circumstances of EIT countries in terms of energy and economy development. In general, policies and measures in EIT countries tend to follow the trends observed in the other Annex I Parties to the FCCC. They address primarily carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion as the most important greenhouse gas and the energy transformation sector as the major greenhouse emissions source. The most effective mitigation measures - in terms of both greenhouse gas emission reduction and costs were energy efficiency and the promotion of non-fossil energy sources. A prevailing part of policies and measures implemented or under implementation in EIT countries were cost-effective and no-regret measures. It was considered very difficult in these countries to go beyond no-regret measures in a situation of deep economic crisis and insufficient investments.

These conflicts might be exacerbated by climate change, which could bring a drier climate and thus increase irrigation water demands while lowering supplies. These issues were addressed when designing a climate change adaptation plan for water resources in the Algarve region (southern Portugal), which was co-created between hydrologists and local stakeholders and policy-makers, by using the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) approach to synthetize and communicate the results from hydrological modelling of future scenarios. The evolution of water availability and irrigation demands for key water assets in Algarve (southern Portugal) were simulated until 2100 for climate scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, using a modified version of Thornthwaite-Mather. The results show an increase in water stress, mainly in the RCP8.5 scenario. The results and need for adaptation were discussed with local and regional decision-makers and other stakeholders, and a set of adaptation measures was agreed upon. The discussed adaptation measures were then modelled and integrated the design of tailor-made DAPP. Finally, decision-makers and stakeholders were presented with DAPP and selected the most suitable and political reliable adaptation pathway that tackles projected climate change impacts in water resources until the end of the 21 st century. Stakeholders showed a strong preference for incremental and distributed small-scale measures, including the promotion of water use efficiency and landscape water retention, to large-scale measures such as wastewater recycling or new dams. A decrease in irrigation water use for agriculture was not considered socially desirable. Desalination was considered too costly for irrigation in the short term but kept in reserve in case other measures fail to keep water supplies at an acceptable level.","[Dias, Luis Filipe; Aparicio, Bruno A.; Nunes, Joao Pedro; Morais, Ines; Fonseca, Ana Lucia; Pastor, Amandine Valerie; Santos, Filipe Duarte] Univ Lisbon, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes cE3c, Fac Ciencias, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Pastor, Amandine Valerie] Univ Montpellier, INRA, Montpellier SupAgro, IRD,LISAH, F-34060 Montpellier, France",Universidade de Lisboa; INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier,"Nunes, JP (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes cE3c, Fac Ciencias, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.",jpcnunes@fc.ul.pt,"Aparício, Bruno Almeida/AAD-2818-2020; Nunes, Joao Pedro/A-5497-2011; Santos, Filipe/M-7709-2013","Aparício, Bruno Almeida/0000-0002-2958-1430; Antunes Dias, Luis Filipe/0000-0001-7899-8075; Nunes, Joao Pedro/0000-0002-0164-249X; Santos, Filipe/0000-0001-7316-1479","European Union (EU)under PO SEUR -Operational Programme for Sustainability and Efficient Use of Resources; Comunidade Intermunicipal do Algarve; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [UID/BIA/00329/2019, IF/00586/2015]",European Union (EU)under PO SEUR -Operational Programme for Sustainability and Efficient Use of Resources; Comunidade Intermunicipal do Algarve; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"This work was supported by the European Union (EU)under PO SEUR -Operational Programme for Sustainability and Efficient Use of Resources, and Comunidade Intermunicipal do Algarve.

Many governments are interested in adaptation policies that target those especially vulnerable to the risks, but there are important questions about how to effectively identify and support communities most in need of heat adaptations. Here, we use an equity-oriented adaptation program from the state of California as a case study to evaluate the implications of the currently used environmental justice index (CalEnviroScreen 3.0) for the identification of socially vulnerable communities with climate change adaptation needs. As CalEnviroScreen is geared towards air and water pollution, we assess how community heat risks and adaptation needs would be evaluated differently under two more adaptation-relevant vulnerability indices: the Social Vulnerability Index and the Heat-Health Action Index. Our analysis considers communities at the census tract scale, as well as the patterns emerging at the regional scale. Using the current index, the state designates 25% of its census tracts as disadvantaged communities eligible for special adaptation funds. However, an additional 12.6% of the state's communities could be considered vulnerable if the two other indices were considered instead. Only 13.4% of communities are vulnerable across all three vulnerability indices studied. Choice of vulnerability index shapes statewide trends in extreme heat risk and is linked to a community's likelihood of receiving heat-related California Climate Investments (CCI) projects. Tracts that are vulnerable under the current pollution-focused index, but not under the heat-health specific index, received four times the number of heat-related interventions as tracts vulnerable under the reverse scenario. This study demonstrates important nuances relevant to implementing equity-oriented adaptation and explores the challenges, trade-offs, and opportunities in quantifying vulnerability.","[Turek-Hankins, Lynee L.] Stanford Univ, Stanford Woods Inst Environm, Mentoring Undergrad Interdisciplinary Res MUIR Pr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Turek-Hankins, Lynee L.] Univ Miami, Environm Sci & Policy Grad Program, Leonard & Jayne Abess Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Policy, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA; [Hino, Miyuki] Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Hino, Miyuki] Univ N Carolina, Environm Ecol & Energy Program, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Turek-Hankins, Lynee L.; Mach, Katharine J.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Mach, Katharine J.] Univ Miami, Leonard & Jayne Abess Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Policy, Coral Gables, FL USA",Stanford University; University of Miami; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of Miami; University of Miami,"Turek-Hankins, LL (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Stanford Woods Inst Environm, Mentoring Undergrad Interdisciplinary Res MUIR Pr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Turek-Hankins, LL (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Environm Sci & Policy Grad Program, Leonard & Jayne Abess Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Policy, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA.;Turek-Hankins, LL (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",lturek@miami.edu,", 莺瑰之殇/ABG-2761-2020","Turek-Hankins, Lynee/0000-0003-3356-3283",Mentoring Undergraduates in Interdisciplinary Research (MUIR) Program at Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment; Abess Center for Ecosystem Science and Policy at the University of Miami; Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at University of Miami,Mentoring Undergraduates in Interdisciplinary Research (MUIR) Program at Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment; Abess Center for Ecosystem Science and Policy at the University of Miami; Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at University of Miami,"This research was funded by the Mentoring Undergraduates in Interdisciplinary Research (MUIR) Program at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at the University of Miami, and the Abess Center for Ecosystem Science and Policy at the University of Miami.",,69,1,1,2,8,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,NOV 4,2020,15,11,,,,,,,e0240841,10.1371/journal.pone.0240841,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240841,,,20,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,OR6WM,33147245,"Green Accepted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000589609300032,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the understanding of these processes in snowpacks around the world, including the polar regions that are experiencing unprecedented warming and melting, remains limited despite being instrumental in supporting climate change adaptation. In this study, data collected from a snowmelt lysimeter and snowpits at meadow and forest-gap sites in a high elevation watershed in Colorado were combined with the PULSE multi-phase snowpack chemistry model to investigate the controls of meltwater chemistry and preferential elution. The snowdepth at the meadow site was 64% of that at the forest-gap site, and the snowmelt rate was greater there (meadow snowpit) due to higher solar irradiance. Cations such as Ca2+ and NH4+ were deposited mostly within the upper layers of both the meadow and forest-gap snowpacks, and acid anions such as NO3- and SO42- were more evenly distributed. The snow ion concentrations were generally greater at the forest-gap snowpit, except for NH4-, which indicates that wind erosion of wet and dry deposited ions from the meadow may have reduced concentrations of residual snow. Furthermore, at the forest-gap site, snow interception and scavenging processes such as sublimation, ventilation, and throughfall led to particular ion enrichment of Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Cl, SO42- and NO3-. Model simulations and observations highlight that preferential elution is enhanced by low snowmelt rates, with the model indicating that this is due to lower dilution rates and increased contact time and area between the percolating meltwater and the snow. Results suggest that low snowmelt rates can cause multiple early meltwater ionic pulses for ions subject to lower ion exclusion. Ion exclusion rates at the grain-size level have been estimated for the first time. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It situates this as part of a wider geographical project of rendering climate change locally meaningful, and story-telling multiple climate change narratives, including Christian ones. It identifies one of the major obstacles to this spiritualisation: the treatment of religious thought as a barrier to climate change action by much of the existing social science research in the Pacific Islands. Rather than attempting to purify scientific and religious knowledge, this paper proposes an alternative approach, tufala save: the balancing of multiple epistemologies of climate change, exploring their convergences and tensions. This paper draws on four months of ethnographic fieldwork in Vanuatu, and over 60 semi-structured interviews with religious figures and individuals engaged in climate change adaptation and advocacy across the Pacific Island region. It applies the tufala save approach in order to explore one recurring narrative, the biblical story of Noah and the flood, due to the contentious associations between this story and climate change denial in Oceania. The paper traces three discursive manifestations of the Noah story within the Pacific Islands: rainbow covenant as a basis for denial, Noah as an icon of preparation, and Islanders as unjustly outside of the ark. The contrasts between these three articulations - in terms of the relations between the different knowledges and the possibilities for climate change action they encourage and foreclose - demonstrate the heterogeneity of religious responses to climate change and the potential for fruitful connections between religious and scientific knowledges. They highlight the potential for more-than-scientific yet not anti-scientific responses to climate change that are locally meaningful and morally compelling.","[Fair, Hannah] Brunel Univ, Dept Social Sci Media & Commun Anthropol, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Fair, Hannah] UCL, Dept Geog, London, England",Brunel University; University of London; University College London,"Fair, H (corresponding author), Brunel Univ, Dept Social Sci Media & Commun Anthropol, Uxbridge, Middx, England.;Fair, H (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Geog, London, England.",hannah.fair@brunel.ac.uk,,"Fair, Hannah/0000-0002-1758-778X",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J500185/1],Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Economic and Social Research Council, Grant/Award Number: ES/J500185/1",,71,23,23,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2054-4049,,,GEO-GEOGR ENVIRON,Geo-Geogr.

In the absence of adequate international responses to climate change and the need for place-based adaptation, local governments have a pivotal role in fostering sustainability transitions. In this context, the importance of ecosystem-based adaptation is increasingly recognized as a multi-benefit approach that utilizes ecosystem services to harmonize human-environment systems. Although research advocates the mainstreaming of ecosystem-based adaptation to advance sustainable planning, the pathways for its systematic implementation are missing and it remains unclear how local authorities can best integrate this new approach into their core work. The purpose of this study is to increase knowledge of the potential ways to mainstream ecosystem-based adaptation into municipal planning. We investigate four coastal municipalities in southern Sweden (Malmo, Helsingborg, Lomma and Kristianstad) and examine, based on vertical and horizontal integration processes, the key characteristics of existing mainstreaming strategies. Results show that, although ecosystem service planning and climate change adaptation planning together establish the conceptual foundation for ecosystem-based adaptation, related activities are often implemented separately and are rarely comprehensive. We illustrate how combined mainstreaming strategies can reinforce and complement each other and how strong leadership in the integration of processes has the ability to compensate for a lack of guidance or supporting legislation from higher decision-making levels. Finally, we conclude that systemic mainstreaming of sustainability issues is a promising avenue for initiating and promoting sustainability transitions and has the potential to address the criticism that other mainstreaming topics have faced. On this basis, we specify the core characteristics necessary to ensure its effective and meaningful application. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We have used the GRAZPLAN biophysical simulation models to assess a range of pasture management practices as adaptation options under the SRES A2 global change scenario. The modelling analysis spanned four dimensions: space (25 representative locations), time (2030, 2050, 2070, and a historical reference period of 1970-99), livestock enterprises (five), and management (four adaptation options at different levels). Climate projection uncertainty was taken into account by considering climates from four global climate models. The effectiveness of adaptation options varied widely among enterprises and locations, over time, and under the four projected future climates. Increased soil fertility by adding phosphorus and addition of an area of lucerne to the feed-base were predicted to have the greatest effect in recovering from the negative impact of climate change on profitability. In high-rainfall zones in particular, and compared with the historical period, the most profitable option could return the profitability of livestock production systems to historical levels at 68%, 52%, and 32% of the representative locations at 2030, 2050, and 2070, respectively. At 2030, increased soil fertility, adding lucerne to the feed-base, and confinement feeding in summer recovered overall profit fully at 52%, 28%, and 12% of locations. Removing annual legumes in an attempt to preserve ground cover was ineffective as an adaptation to changing climate. For the majority of location x livestock enterprise combinations, there was at least one individual incremental adaptation that could recover the declines in the profitability at 2030, but effectiveness decreased over time after 2030. It is unlikely that the examined single climate change adaptations to the feed-base of southern Australian livestock production systems can return them to profitability in the second half of the century.","[Ghahramani, Afshin; Moore, Andrew D.] CSIRO, Climate Adaptat Natl Res Flagship, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Ghahramani, Afshin; Moore, Andrew D.] CSIRO, Plant Ind, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Ghahramani, A (corresponding author), CSIRO, Climate Adaptat Natl Res Flagship, GPO Box 1600, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",af.ghahramani@csiro.au,"Moore, Andrew/D-3418-2009; Ghahramani, Afshin/C-4169-2012","Moore, Andrew/0000-0002-5675-4720; Ghahramani, Afshin/0000-0002-9648-4606","Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry under its Climate Change Research Program; Meat & Livestock Australia; Dairy Australia; Australian Wool Innovation","Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry under its Climate Change Research Program(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Agriculture and Water Resources); Meat & Livestock Australia(Meat and Livestock Australia); Dairy Australia(Dairy Australia); Australian Wool Innovation(Australian Wool Innovation)","This research was supported by funding from the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry under its Climate Change Research Program; Meat & Livestock Australia; Dairy Australia; and Australian Wool Innovation.

This study extracted cultivated land information based on multi-source remote sensing data, and analyzed the geomorphic differentiation of cultivated land distribution and climate response from 2000 to 2020 using the Gini coefficient, spatial autocorrelation analysis and geographic detector. The results show that cultivated land is mainly distributed in low-altitude hills and low-altitude small undulating mountains, and secondarily in low-altitude alluvial and proluvial plains and platforms. Moreover, from 2000 to 2020, the cultivated land in the high-altitude and high-altitude undulating mountains and medium and high-altitude undulating mountains in the Northwest Plateau of Sichuan showed an upward trend, while the cultivated land in the Sichuan Basin mainly increased from the north and south to the middle of the basin. In addition, the highest temperature has the strongest ability to explain the spatial heterogeneity of cultivated land. From the calculation results of the influence coefficient of a single climatic factor and the combined effect of multiple climatic factors, the main factors that affect the distribution of cultivated land are different in different geomorphological regions. Finally, it is proposed to formulate a long-term strategy for agricultural production to adapt to climate change in complex geomorphic areas in order to reduce the negative impact of environmental change on agricultural production.","[Xiang, Qing; Yu, Huan] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Earth Sci, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xiaoyu] Southern Illinois Univ Carbondale, Dept Geog & Environm Resources & Environm Resourc, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Huang, Hong] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Tourism & Urban Rural Planning, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China",Chengdu University of Technology; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University; Chengdu University of Technology,"Yu, H (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Earth Sci, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China.",xiangqing950211@163.com; yuhuan10@cdut.edu.cn; xiaoyu.xu@siu.edu; huanghong940325@163.com,,"Xu, Xiaoyu/0000-0001-5451-470X",,,,,29,3,3,5,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,FEB,2022,11,2,,,,,,,271,10.3390/land11020271,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11020271,,,18,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZM7YF,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000764567100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Limited water resources restrict local farmers as the opportunities for cultivation in the fields are reduced. This makes rural areas increasingly unattractive. To strengthen rural areas, sustainable water management with a focus on water-reuse is required. Since treated wastewater is a daily resource with calculable quantities available, reused water can contribute to the sustainable strengthening of a region. Therefore, an analysis of water-reuse potentials must be conducted to develop a water-reuse concept and thus increase the application of reused water. For this purpose, a case study of Wuwei as a rural and water-scarce region in China was chosen. By using a geoinformation system, the unfulfilled water-reuse potential can be identified by intersecting the results of the analysis regarding the current water supply and disposal situation with spatial and regional information, such as population data. Hence, the study presents the potential to increase wastewater treatment and water-reuse for, e.g., agricultural irrigation. It is shown that, in the best case, reused water can be increased from 5479 m(3) per day to 207,461 m(3) per day. Resource efficiency can be further increased by combining water-reuse concepts with land-use strategies adapted to climate change. This will ensure a more sustainable water supply in the future.","[Bauer, Sonja] Hsch Tech Stuttgart, Fac Geomat Comp Sci & Math, Schellingstr 24, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany",,"Bauer, S (corresponding author), Hsch Tech Stuttgart, Fac Geomat Comp Sci & Math, Schellingstr 24, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany.",sonja.bauer@hft-stuttgart.de,,"Bauer, Sonja/0000-0001-5549-6830",,,,,40,3,3,2,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,DEC,2020,9,12,,,,,,,492,10.3390/land9120492,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land9120492,,,21,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PK0JD,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000602140900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These basins are host to three large urban centers, namely Dar es Salaam, Dodoma and Morogoro, with a combined total of more than 7 million people. Increased demand for ecosystem services from the available surface water resources and a decreasing supply of clean and safe water are exacerbating the vulnerability of communities in these basins. Several studies have analyzed climate projects in the two basins but little attention has been paid to identify locations that have vulnerable communities in a spatially-explicit form. To address this gap, we worked with stakeholders from national and local government agencies, basin water boards and the Water Resources Integration Development Initiative (WARIDI) project funded by USAID to map the vulnerability of communities to climate variability and change in the two basins. A generalized methodology for mapping social vulnerability to climate change was used to integrate biophysical and socioeconomic indicators of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity and produced climate vulnerability index maps. Our analysis identified vulnerability hotspots where communities are at a greater risk from climate stressors. The results from this study were used to identify priority sites and adaptation measures for the implementation of resilience building interventions and to train local government agencies and communities on climate change adaptation measures in the two basins.","[Macharia, Denis; Koech, Grace; Ndungu, Lilian; Wahome, Anastasia; Mugo, Robinson] Reg Ctr Mapping Resources Dev, Nairobi 00618, Kenya; [Kaijage, Erneus; Kindberg, Leif] USAID Tanzania Water Resources Integrat Dev Initi, Morogoro 768, Tanzania",,"Macharia, D (corresponding author), Reg Ctr Mapping Resources Dev, Nairobi 00618, Kenya.",dmacharia85@gmail.com; ekaijage@gmail.com; Leif.Kindberg@tetratech.com; gkoech@rcmrd.org; lndungu@rcmrd.org; awahome@rcmrd.org; rmugo@rcmrd.org,"Macharia, Denis/AAU-6073-2020; BITOUN, RACHEL Elisabeth/AAC-9538-2021","Macharia, Denis/0000-0002-1964-7301; BITOUN, RACHEL Elisabeth/0000-0002-3614-9910; NDUNGU, LILIAN/0000-0002-9239-2210; Wahome, Anastasia/0000-0002-0471-0697; JEROTICH KOECH, GRACE/0000-0001-8214-3213","United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the SERVIR Eastern and Southern Africa project [AID-EGEE-IO-15-00002]; Tetra Tech Inc. through the Water and Development IDIQ [AID-OAA-I-14-00068, AID-621-TO-16-00003]",United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the SERVIR Eastern and Southern Africa project(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Tetra Tech Inc. through the Water and Development IDIQ,"This research was supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the SERVIR Eastern and Southern Africa project implemented by the Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) under the Cooperative Agreement No. AID-EGEE-IO-15-00002 and Tetra Tech Inc. through the Water and Development IDIQ (Contract No. AID-OAA-I-14-00068), Task Order No. AID-621-TO-16-00003.",,70,7,7,3,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2020,12,10,,,,,,,4102,10.3390/su12104102,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12104102,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MC6VG,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000543421400160,View Full Record in Web of Science

Drawing on the experiences of farmers from the Savelugu Municipal Assembly in Ghana, the paper investigates whether the adaptation practices by NGOs are localized and sufficiently progressive to ensure sustainable adaptation. The study is situated within the interpretive paradigm using a qualitative approach. Data was collected through interviews and focus group discussions with NGOs and farmers in the municipality. The study finds that institutions, particularly international NGOs and the various interventions they led, have been very critical for developing potential of farmers to be actively involved in the processes of change to minimize the negative impacts of climate change. They provide direct and indirect capacity building activities such as providing farmers with information on climate change and its impact on their yields and livelihoods, building farmers skills and knowledge to deal adequately with climate variability, laying the foundations for individuals to build various capitals, directly assisting in coping and adaptive livelihood activities, financial assistance to build livelihood capitals and engaging in impact offsetting strategies. These determinants of the adaptive capacity provide interesting input in terms of guidance for management options to enhance the adaptive capacity of the communities in the face of climate change. Such results are significant in informing policy and practice at the national and local levels.","[Tahiru (Dallas), Abdallah; Sackey, Brigid] Univ Ghana, CSPS, Legon, Ghana; [Owusu, George; Bawakyillenuo, Simon] Univ Ghana, ISSER, Legon, Ghana",University of Ghana; University of Ghana,"Tahiru, A (corresponding author), Univ Ghana, CSPS, Legon, Ghana.",dallasdon2@gmail.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Owusu, George/AAI-3380-2020","Owusu, George/0000-0003-3859-5540",,,,,69,9,9,2,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

The situation denotes important interdependencies between science, society, and ecosystems, yet integrative approaches to the study of adaptation to such changes remain scarce in both the mountain- and non-mountain-focused adaptation scholarship. Using the example of glacio-hydrological change, it is argued here that this analytical limitation impedes the identification, development, and implementation of successful adaptations. In response, the paper introduces three guiding principles for robust adaptation research in glaciated mountain regions. Principle 1: Adaptation research should integrate detailed analyses of watershed-specific glaciological and hydro-meteorological conditions; glacio-hydrological changes are context-specific and therefore cannot be assumed to follow idealized trajectories of peak water. Principle 2: Adaptation research should consider the complex interplay between glacio-hydrological changes and socio-economic, cultural, and political conditions; responses to environmental changes are non-deterministic and therefore not deducible from hydrological changes alone. Principle 3: Adaptation research should be attentive to interdependencies, feedbacks, and tradeoffs between human and ecological responses to glacio-hydrological change; research that does not evaluate these socio-ecological dynamics may lead to maladaptive adaptation plans. These principles call attention to the linked scientific, social, and ecological dimensions of adaptation, and offer a point of departure for future climate change adaptation research in high mountains.","[McDowell, Graham] Univ British Columbia, IRES, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Koppes, Michele] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"McDowell, G (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, IRES, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",grahammcdowell@gmail.com; koppes@geog.ubc.ca,,"McDowell, Graham/0000-0003-2302-2598; Koppes, Michele/0000-0003-0580-2718",Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC-Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship); Canadian Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC),Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC-Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship); Canadian Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),This research was supported by funding from the Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC-Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship to G.M.) and the Canadian Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC-Discovery Grant and Canada Research Chair to M.K.).

Building adaptive capacity should be an important component of projects supporting CBA. The literature establishes that adaptive capacity is highly context and culture specific. However, to date, there has been little research into the factors and processes that enable adaptive capacity in Pacific island communities. This paper discusses the Pacific Adaptive Capacity Analysis Framework, a theoretical framework developed to guide assessment of adaptive capacity for the purposes of supporting CBA projects. The framework identifies seven broad factors and several sub-factors of Pacific-specific adaptive capacity: (1) human capital; (2) social capital; (3) belief systems, worldviews, and values; (4) resources and their distribution; (5) options for adaptation, livelihood, and food supply; (6) information and awareness; and (7) history of dealing with climate stress. The paper presents a case study of adaptive capacity from a community in the Solomon Islands and concludes that unlike many adaptive capacity determinants identified in the broader international literature, function-based (factors shaping ability to access and use resources) and cognitive (for example, values and belief systems) determinants are of particular relevance in the Pacific community social and cultural context. The key to building upon cognitive and function-based aspects of adaptive capacity is increasing the ability of people to liaise with external support organisations to plan and acquire resources for adaptation on their own terms.","[Warrick, Olivia] Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Ctr, 15 D Glentui Lane, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Aalbersberg, William; Dumaru, Patrina] Univ South Pacific, Inst Appl Sci, Suva, Fiji; [McNaught, Rebecca] Independent Consultant, Suva, Fiji; [Teperman, Kate] Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic, Australia",University of the South Pacific; University of Melbourne,"Warrick, O (corresponding author), Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Ctr, 15 D Glentui Lane, Hamilton, New Zealand.",warrick@climatecentre.org; william.aalbersberg@usp.ac.fj; dumaru_p@usp.ac.fj; beckmcn@hotmail.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; McNaught, Rebecca/AAF-2668-2020","McNaught, Rebecca/0000-0002-9393-6398",Australian Government under the Pacific Australia Climate Change Science and Adaptation Planning (PACCSAP) Program,Australian Government under the Pacific Australia Climate Change Science and Adaptation Planning (PACCSAP) Program(Australian Government),"The authors would like to acknowledge and sincerely thank the following: the Pileni Island community; Cameron Vudi Ngatulu (SIRC), George Tego (SIRC), and Tim Lewis-Nicholson (IFRC), the co-authors of the Pileni study project report; members of the PACAF development team; Francisna Christmarine L.

Pressure from urban development, land use and land cover change along the western coast of Taiwan not only has caused the loss of ecosystem services in pen-urban environments, but has also resulted in an increase in urban flooding vulnerability. This paper develops a framework, which incorporates the interaction among exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity for assessing the vulnerability to flooding. To achieve this aim, this research interprets urban flooding vulnerability based on emergy concepts and develops emergy indices to assess the spatiality of urban flooding vulnerability in Taiwan's western coastal plain via GIS. Based on the results of the emergy evaluation of the three components of vulnerability and five emergy indices for urban flooding vulnerability, the areas with intense urbanization are characterized with high potential impact to flood. However, cities with higher potential impact do not necessarily lead to higher vulnerability for urban flooding because adaptive capacity can also mitigate the vulnerability of cities to extreme climate events. Using the framework developed by this research we show that the emergy concept can effectively provide a common measuring unit for evaluating exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of urban flooding vulnerability.

The results indicated that the annual total rainfall, the extreme daily rainfall and the maximum length of consecutive wet/dry days would decline, while the number of annual rainfall days would slightly increase (correspondingly rainfall intensity would decrease) in the NCP, in comparison with the base period (1961-2010). Moreover, the summer monsoon rainfall, which accounted for 50-75 % of the total annual rainfalls in NCP, was projected to decrease in the latter half of twenty-first century. The spatial patterns of change showed generally north-south gradients with relatively larger magnitude decrease in the northern NCP and less decrease (or even slightly increase) in the southern NCP. This could result in decline of the annual runoff by -5.5 % (A1B), -3.3 % (A2) and -4.1 % (B1) for 2046-2065 and -5.3 % (A1B), -4.6 % (A2) and -1.9 % (B1) decrease for 2081-2100. These rainfall changes, combined with the warming temperature, could lead to drier catchment soil profiles and further reduce runoff potential, would hence provide valuable references for the water availability and related climate change adaption in the NCP.","[Liu, Wenbin; Liu, Changming; Ouyang, Rulin] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Liu, Wenbin; Song, Xiaoyan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Fu, Guobin] CSIRO Land & Water, Wembley, WA 6913, Australia; [Song, Xiaoyan] Chinese Acad Sci, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Secur, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Liu, WB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",wenbinliu_sky@163.com,"Fu, Guobin/A-3243-2008; Liu, Wenbin/AAB-2665-2021","Fu, Guobin/0000-0002-3968-4871; Liu, Wenbin/0000-0002-9569-6762",National Basic Research Program of China [2010CB428406]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA 05090309],National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (2010CB428406) and Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA 05090309).

Several researchers have underscored the importance of community-based adaptation in achieving this. This article examines community-based approaches in order to build an understanding of community vulnerability to current and future climate risks in eastern Uganda. Primary data were collected at the community and household level applying participatory vulnerability and capacity assessment, in-depth household, and key informant interviews. Major climate risks in eastern Uganda that exacerbate community and household vulnerability are heavy and erratic rainfall leading to landslides in hilly areas and floods in low-lying areas, and droughts within the year and mid-season, affecting crop and livestock yields. Communities and households have innovative coping mechanisms based on past experiences, local knowledge and expertise albeit in an ad hoc manner. Household labour endowment, farm size, livestock ownership, access to weather information and credit positively and significantly affect the adoption of adaptation technologies by households. At community level, inherent knowledge and skills, and social and financial capital, play a critical role in shaping adaptation to climate risks. This study therefore strongly suggests that analyses of climate change impacts and design of adaptation projects should take into account community perspectives, knowledge and resources. Government and other stakeholders should identify and evaluate potential, location-specific adaptation measures, and incorporate them into the country's development policy and management practices particularly national development plan.","Oxfam GB Uganda, Kampala, Uganda",,"Kansiime, MK (corresponding author), Oxfam GB Uganda, POB 6228, Kampala, Uganda.",monkansiime@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,58,9,9,1,64,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Nature-based solutions, i.e., afforestation, reforestation or agroforestry supplying wood energy, halting food insecurity, restoring land desertification and fostering mitigation and adaptation to climate warming, have been increasingly used in the past decades. Within this framework, Congolese coastal plains have been afforested using fast growing trees since the early 1950s. Due to the low forest productivity and soil fertility, sustainable management of these forest ecosystems (trees, soils and environment) have been performed. Improved germplasms, increased stand wood biomass and healthier soils have the potential to enhance wood and fuel wood energy supply, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, food security, restoration of land and ecosystem biodiversity.

The aim of our study was to derive a long-term vision of the desirable agricultural sector in Poland and prioritize research areas required to make Polish agriculture sustainable. We applied the living lab approach and, by conducting a backcasting exercise with the lab members, we identified a desirable vision of agriculture in Poland and the research areas needed to realize this vision. Using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Cumulative Voting (CV), we prioritized these research areas. Our results show that adaptation to climate changes is the most important area of research, having 38.6% of the total possible number of points using AHP and 29.7% in the case of CV. The analysis of the Polish strategic documents related to agriculture and agricultural research shows that, to some extent, these key research areas are already part of the national policy, but there is not sufficient funding and coordination to tackle all aspects of sustainability in agriculture.","[Wieliczko, Barbara] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Rural & Agr Dev, Nowy Swiat 72, PL-00330 Warsaw, Poland; [Wieliczko, Barbara; Florianczyk, Zbigniew] European Rural Dev Network, Owocowa 8, PL-05822 Milanowek, Poland; [Florianczyk, Zbigniew] Natl Res Inst, Inst Agr & Food Econ, Swietokrzyska 20, PL-00002 Warsaw, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Rural & Agricultural Development PAS; Institute of Agricultural & Food Economy,"Wieliczko, B (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Rural & Agr Dev, Nowy Swiat 72, PL-00330 Warsaw, Poland.;Wieliczko, B (corresponding author), European Rural Dev Network, Owocowa 8, PL-05822 Milanowek, Poland.",bwieliczko@irwirpan.waw.pl; florianczyk@ierigz.waw.pl,,"Wieliczko, Barbara/0000-0003-3770-0409",Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1193397],Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationCGIAR),"This research was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, grant number OPP1193397.",,62,3,3,5,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,JAN,2022,15,1,,,,,,,257,10.3390/en15010257,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15010257,,,21,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Energy & Fuels,YT3VH,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000751290900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To promote these changes, governments, non-profits and multilateral institutions have invested in a range of adaptation projects. Yet there is little empirical evidence about which project components are effective in changing human behaviour(1,2). This lack of evidence is concerning, given that the failure of adaptation initiatives has been described as the global risk with the highest likelihood of occurring and with the largest negative impacts(3). Here we report on a scholar-practitioner collaboration in which a simple one-day workshop delivering two ubiquitous components of adaptation projects(4)-capacity building and the dissemination of climate science-was randomly assigned among the management councils of over 200 community water systems in an arid region of Central America. The workshop was based on more than three years of scientific research and local collaborations, and it aimed to convey downscaled climate modelling and locally informed, expert-recommended adaptation practices. Two years later, we detect no differences in pricing and non-pricing management practices of participant versus non-participant councils. These results suggest weaknesses in the common practice of using simple workshops for delivering capacity building and climate science.","[Alpizar, Francisco] CATIE, Environm Dev Ctr, Turrialba, Costa Rica; [Del Carpio, Maria Bernedo] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA; [Ferraro, Paul J.; Meiselman, Ben S.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County; Johns Hopkins University,"Ferraro, PJ (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",pferraro@jhu.edu,"Ferraro, Paul J/B-4435-2014","Ferraro, Paul J/0000-0002-4777-5108; Alpizar, Francisco/0000-0001-8479-081X; Meiselman, Ben/0000-0001-9297-8871","International Development Research Center, Canada","International Development Research Center, Canada","This project was conducted with the help of a grant from the International Development Research Center, Canada.

While economic growth lowers the risk of conflict, it is generally associated with increased greenhouse gas emissions and costs of climate mitigation policies. This study investigates the links between growth, climate change, and conflict by simulating future civil conflict using new scenario data for five alternative socioeconomic pathways with different mitigation and adaptation assumptions, known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). We develop a statistical model of the historical effect of key socioeconomic variables on country-specific conflict incidence, 1960-2013. We then forecast the annual incidence of conflict, 2014-2100, along the five SSPs. We find that SSPs with high investments in broad societal development are associated with the largest reduction in conflict risk. This is most pronounced for the least developed countries-poverty alleviation and human capital investments in poor countries are much more effective instruments to attain global peace and stability than further improvements to wealthier economies. Moreover, the SSP that describes a sustainability pathway, which poses the lowest climate change challenges, is as conducive to global peace as the conventional development pathway.","[Hegre, Havard; Waldhoff, Stephanie T.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Peace & Conflict Res, POB 541, SE-75105 Uppsala, Sweden; [Hegre, Havard; Buhaug, Halvard; Nordkvelle, Jonas] Peace Res Inst Oslo, POB 9229, NO-0134 Oslo, Norway; [Buhaug, Halvard] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Calvin, Katherine V.] Pacific NW Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Nordkvelle, Jonas] Univ Oslo, Dept Polit Sci, POB 1072 Blindern, NO-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Gilmore, Elisabeth] Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Uppsala University; Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; University of Oslo; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Hegre, H (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Peace & Conflict Res, POB 541, SE-75105 Uppsala, Sweden.;Hegre, H (corresponding author), Peace Res Inst Oslo, POB 9229, NO-0134 Oslo, Norway.",havard.hegre@pcr.uu.se,"Hegre, Håvard/A-8204-2008; Buhaug, Halvard/E-8814-2011; Gilmore, Elisabeth/HLQ-7712-2023","Hegre, Håvard/0000-0002-5076-0994; Buhaug, Halvard/0000-0002-6432-5985; ",US Army Research Laboratory; US Army Research Office via the Minerva Initiative grant [W911NF-13-1-0307]; European Research Council [648291]; Research Council of Norway [217995/V10],US Army Research Laboratory(United States Department of DefenseUS Army Research Laboratory (ARL)); US Army Research Office via the Minerva Initiative grant; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"This work is supported by the US Army Research Laboratory and the US Army Research Office via the Minerva Initiative grant no.

If nations fail to regulate greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, or use alternative strategies for addressing the problem, the damages could be significant, and perhaps catastrophic. In this Essay, I argue that the range of effective options to address this problem is likely to be quite limited for the foreseeable future. The primary reason is that national leaders appear to lack the political will to achieve global emission reductions in a timely, manner. This observation does not mean that we should do nothing. It does mean that we should focus on what is likely to be sensible and doable. I argue that it makes little sense to try to bring all countries into a binding international agreement to reduce emissions at this time, because such agreements are not likely to be workable. It makes sense, instead, for interested countries to take some action now to limit greenhouse gas emissions, including putting a price on emissions. It also makes sense to focus on research and development - including how best to adapt to climate change, improve our understanding of geoengineering, and improve the cost effectiveness of carbon capture. In addition, countries should continue to experiment with institutions that will be needed to manage a portfolio of solutions for addressing climate change over the longer term.

We investigate the drivers behind common bean variety selection and diversification in one of the most important common bean production regions in Colombia -Santander. The effects of climate change on this region are expected to be elevation driven. Exploiting the relationship between elevation-driven weather variations and climate change perception in Santander, we estimate an alternative-specific conditional logistic regression model to identify the determinants of common bean variety selection from a survey of producers. Using an ordered-logistic regression model, we also investigate the drivers behind common bean variety diversification within this farming community. We find that farms' elevation, household composition, and seed certification are some of the most important drivers behind farmers' common bean variety selection in Santander. We also find that varieties that sell at higher prices and have shorter vegetative cycles tend to be more preferred by farmers. Finally, farmers who receive more help from family members and own a tractor tend to grow more than one variety in the same production cycle. Common bean breeding programmes can exploit these drivers to design communication strategies to maximize uptake of newly developed common bean phenotypes.","[Botero, Hernan] Environm & Soc Res Grp, Postdoctoral Res Rural Econ REES, Kings Bldg Campus,West Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland; [Barnes, Andrew P.] SRUC, Dept Rural Econ Environm & Soc REES, Kings Bldg Campus,West Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland; [Perez, Lisset; Rios, David; Ramirez-Villegas, Julian] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Km 17 Recta Cali Palmira, Cali 763537, Colombia; [Perez, Lisset; Rios, David; Ramirez-Villegas, Julian] CIAT, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Cali, Colombia; [Ramirez-Villegas, Julian] Biovers Int, Rome, Italy; [Ramirez-Villegas, Julian] Wageningen Univ, Plant Prod Syst Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Perez, Lisset] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; CGIAR; Alliance; Bioversity International; Wageningen University & Research; University of Copenhagen,"Botero, H (corresponding author), Environm & Soc Res Grp, Postdoctoral Res Rural Econ REES, Kings Bldg Campus,West Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland.",hernan.degiovanni@sruc.ac.uk; andrew.barnes@sruc.ac.uk; Lisset.Perez@CGIAR.ORG; D.Rios@cgiar.org; J.R.Villegas@CGIAR.ORG,,"Botero, Hernan/0000-0003-3461-5313; Rios Segura, David Andres/0000-0002-2349-2285; Barnes, Andrew/0000-0001-9368-148X",BBSRC grant Bean Breeding for Adaptation to a Changing Climate and Post-Conflict Colombia (BBACO) [BB/S018964/1]; BBSRC [BB/S018964/1] Funding Source: UKRI,BBSRC grant Bean Breeding for Adaptation to a Changing Climate and Post-Conflict Colombia (BBACO)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),The authors are grateful for funding under the BBSRC grant Bean Breeding for Adaptation to a Changing Climate and Post-Conflict Colombia (BBACO) (BB/S018964/1).,,85,1,1,3,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The evaluation process utilises an entirely spatially distributed, continuous hydrological model. The model provides a gridded output of the main hydrological balance components, as well as vegetation water deficit and irrigation water requirements, on a daily temporal step on a country scale. It provides information at the farm level and facilitates the estimation of water abstractions in agriculture, taking into consideration all the pertinent information included in the Integrated Administration and Control System database that is maintained by RDPs in Europe. Remote sensing data also are used to validate crop patterns. The obtained results were analysed to estimate the net effect of the RDP to the reduction of water abstractions in agriculture.

To gauge the state of the field, we reviewed and coded a sample set of papers (n = 105) concerning farmers' perceptions of climate change. Crosstabulation analysis reveals that: 1) researching farmer perception of climate change seems to be more frequent in the Global South, as opposed to the North, where other terms are used; 2) farmers are rarely described within their social-ecological contexts, and often simply have their observations segmented and assessed for verification against historical data or quantitative measurements; and 3) the broader dynamics of research practice may perpetuate extractive and colonial patterns of exchange between the Global North and South. We find that farmers from the Global South are rarely described, but often evaluated in their perceptions. We conclude that, with some exceptions, the field does not substantively embrace farmers' perceptions as a contribution to adaptation discourse. We posit that the lack of in-depth qualitative methods in our sample may be correlated with the perception of farmers as passive and vulnerable, rather than viably adapting.","[Soubry, Bernard; Thornton, Thomas F.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Sherren, Kate] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Studies, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada",University of Oxford; Dalhousie University,"Soubry, B (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",bemard.soubry@ouce.ox.ac.uk,,"Sherren, Kate/0000-0003-1576-9878; Soubry, Bernard/0000-0003-3361-3754",Rhodes Trust (UK); Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation (Canada),Rhodes Trust (UK); Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation (Canada),"Thanks to the team at Community Forests International, which provided essential desk and thinking space in the early days of this analysis.

By using a mixed research method, this study examines the types and determinants of climate change-induced impacts on smallholder rural farmers in drought-prone low lands of Sidama, Southern Ethiopia. Randomly selected (401) households were surveyed on climate change-induced impacts. Longitudinal climatic data were also collected from the Ethiopian National Meteorological Agency to assess the trend of rainfall (RF), temperature and drought incidents. The analyses of the data revealed that RF and temperature had shown decreasing and increasing trends, respectively, during the three decades under consideration (1983-2014). These changes in RF and temperature exposed farmers to climate-related epidemics, drought, harvest loss, and hunger. The logit model results revealed that different factors control the likelihood of exposure to climate change-induced impacts. The findings revealed that literacy level, involving women in family decisions and farmers' involvement in adaptation planning, reduces the likelihood of exposure to climate change-induced hunger.

This study examines the attitudes of rural people in South Africa towards the management of tribal forests. Attitude towards forest management was analysed with respect to five forest management objectives: 1, forest management for rural livelihood resilience to climate change; 2, forest management for reduction and management of forest fire risk; 3, forest management for sustainable forest-based livelihood; 4, forest management for household socioeconomic well-being; and 5, forest management for community-based climate change adaptation initiative. A household questionnaire survey was used to elicit information from 155 rural households using the proportionate random sampling procedure. Chi-square test was used to analyse data from the household survey. Factorial analysis was used to analyse variance in attitude towards forest management. The results showed that rural people generally have positive attitudes toward the management of tribal forests. Factor analysis isolated 2 major factors that explained 61% variance in attitude. Based on the findings we conclude that centralising forest management around the four management objectives (1, 3, 4 & 5) are likely to promote inclusive forest-based development in the study communities.","[Ofoegbu, Chidiebere; Chirwa, P.

Ecological vulnerability approaches have been the dominant framework, but these approaches have significant limitations for fully understanding vulnerability in complex social-ecological systems in and around multiple-use public lands. In this paper, we describe the context of United States federal public lands management with an emphasis on the Bureau of Land Management to highlight this unique decision-making context. We then assess the strengths and weaknesses of an ecological vulnerability approach for informing decision-making. Next, we review social vulnerability methods in the context of public lands to demonstrate what these approaches can contribute to our understanding of vulnerability, as well as their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we suggest some key design principles for integrated social-ecological vulnerability assessments considering the context of public lands management, the limits of ecological vulnerability assessment, and existing approaches to social vulnerability assessment. We argue for the necessity of including social vulnerability in a more integrated social-ecological approach in order to better inform climate change adaptation. (C) 2017 The Authors.

One of their greatest assets is the large number of locally adapted livestock breeds they have developed, which represent a major resource for climate change adaptation as well as mitigation. Pastoralists are beginning to position themselves as providers of ecological services as well as of livestock products that represent a healthy and eco-friendly alternative to the products from industrial production systems. Nevertheless, many governments continue with antagonistic policies, being unaware of the ecological and economic significance of their pastoral populations. Biocultural Community Protocols, as specified in the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-Sharing to the Convention on Biological Diversity, are emerging as an important tool for setting the record straight about the role of pastoralists in food security and biodiversity conservation. There is a need for increased recognition of the inherent 'modernity' of pastoralism and the role it can play in creating a more green economy. If this recognition is forthcoming and is rewarded appropriately with government support, this may also overcome the current problem of finding enough capable young people interested in pursuing pastoralist careers.","[Koehler-Rollefson, I.] League Pastoral Peoples & Endogenous Livestock De, Pragelatostr 20, D-64372 Ober Ramstadt, Germany",,"Kohler-Rollefson, I (corresponding author), League Pastoral Peoples & Endogenous Livestock De, Pragelatostr 20, D-64372 Ober Ramstadt, Germany.",ilse@pastoralpeoples.org,,,,,,,27,4,4,4,37,OFFICE INT EPIZOOTIES,PARIS,"12 RUE DE PRONY, 75017 PARIS, FRANCE",0253-1933,,,REV SCI TECH OIE,Rev.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the expected probability and magnitude of threatening climate conditions that are of primary importance in terms of forest management. Until 2100, precipitation and temperature results of an ensemble of 12 regional climate model simulations as well as derived indicators (e.g., Forestry Aridity Index and Ellenberg's climate quotient) have been analyzed for the A1B emission scenario. For the case study area in Southwest Hungary (Zala County), projections indicate an increasing tendency of warming and drying of summers towards the end of the 21st century. In the period 2071-2100, decrease of summer precipitation sum may exceed 25% compared to 1981-2010. Both extreme droughts and heavy precipitation events are expected to be more frequent. Consequently, the already observed climate change impacts and damages in forestry are very likely to occur with higher probability and severity. Including these results, a GIS-based Agroclimate decision support system is under development that contains a coherent data chain from climate change simulations, through impact assessments to adaptation support in order to provide quantified information on the possible yield potential and production risk for sustainable forest management.","[Galos, Borbala; Gulyas, Krisztina; Bidlo, Andras; Matyas, Csaba] Univ West Hungary, Fac Forestiy, Inst Environm & Earth Sci, H-9400 Sopron, Hungary; [Fuehrer, Erno] Natl Agr Res & Innovat Ctr, Forest Res Inst, H-9400 Sopron, Hungary; [Czimber, Kornel] Univ West Hungary, Fac Forestiy, Inst Geomat & Civil Engn, H-9400 Sopron, Hungary; [Haensler, Andreas; Jacob, Daniela] Climate Serv Ctr 2 0, Munich, Germany; [Haensler, Andreas; Jacob, Daniela] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung,"Galos, B (corresponding author), Univ West Hungary, Fac Forestiy, Inst Environm & Earth Sci, Bajcsy Zs U 4, H-9400 Sopron, Hungary.",galos.borbala@emk.nyme.hu,"Führer, Ernő/AAI-2453-2019","Haensler, Andreas/0000-0002-3471-7523; Gulyas, Krisztina/0000-0001-7683-3656","EU FP6 Integrated Project ENSEMBLES [505539]; EU [TAMOP-4.2.2.A-11/1/KONV, VKSZ_12-1-2013-0034]",EU FP6 Integrated Project ENSEMBLES(European Commission); EU(European Commission),Climate data are derived from the regional climate model simulation results of the EU FP6 Integrated Project ENSEMBLES (Contract number 505539; www.ensembles-eu.org).

The issue of climate change and its impact on planetary health is vital to public health, and therefore, it is critical that climate change is regarded as within the veterinary scope of practice. However, climate change is a multi-faceted issue which requires interdisciplinary collaboration and integrated stakeholder involvement in order to establish effective solutions and impactful policies. As a result, in this perspective, we discuss how policy is critical to support veterinarians in the climate change space and argue that more explicit support is needed for veterinarians to take an active role in climate change adaption, resilience, and mitigation. We address the discrepancies between the human health and veterinary professions with respect to providing policy support and capacity for practitioners to be stewards to promote planetary health and shed light on the lack of veterinary capacity in this area. We stress that veterinary professional societies are well equipped to bolster their policies, expand education for veterinary professionals and students in policy and advocacy, and establish calls to action to address climate change and planetary health issues. Ultimately, as public health professionals, veterinarians are uniquely poised to be contributors to climate change solutions and they should be actively involved in policy decision-making and empowered to take active roles in interdisciplinary conversations surrounding this important issue.","[Kiran, Dilara; Duncan, Colleen] Colorado State Univ, Coll Vet Med & Biomed Sci, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Pathol, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Sander, William E.

Therefore, a multi-model assessment of three glacio-hydrological models of different complexity was conducted thoroughly analyzing model performance, flow signatures and runoff components. New hydrological insights for the region: In data-scarce catchments, such as in the tropical Andes, parsimonious glacio-hydrological models can provide more robust results than complex models. While the overall performance of all models was reasonably good (R-2: 0.65-0.70, Nash-Sutcliffe: 0.65-0.73, Nash-Sutcliffe-ln: 0.73-0.78), with increasing data scarcity more complex models involve higher uncertainties. Furthermore, complex models require substantial understanding of the underpinning hydrological processes and a comprehensive calibration strategy to avoid apparently high model performance driven by inadequate assumptions. Based on these insights we present a framework for robust glacio-hydrological simulation under data scarcity. This stepwise approach includes, among others, a multi-model focus with a comprehensive assessment of flow signatures and runoff components. Future modeling needs to be further supported by alternative data collection strategies to substantially improve knowledge and process understanding. Therefore, the extension of sensor and station networks combined with the integration of co-produced knowledge represents a meaningful measure to robust decision-making for climate change adaptation and water management under high uncertainty.","[Munoz, Randy; Huggel, Christian; Drenkhan, Fabian; Vis, Marc; Viviroli, Daniel] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Drenkhan, Fabian] Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Drenkhan, Fabian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Dept Humanidades, Lima, Peru",University of Zurich; Imperial College London; Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Munoz, R (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Glaciol & Geomorphodynam Grp 3G, Environm & Climate Impacts Risks & Adaptat EClim, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",randy.munoz@geo.uzh.ch,"Viviroli, Daniel/A-6720-2008","Viviroli, Daniel/0000-0002-1214-8657; Drenkhan, Fabian/0000-0002-9443-9596; Munoz, Randy/0000-0001-6797-3999",Swiss Government Excellence Scholarships for Foreign Scholars and Artists; AguaFuturo project - Swiss National Science Foundation [205121L_166272],Swiss Government Excellence Scholarships for Foreign Scholars and Artists; AguaFuturo project - Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),This work is part of a PhD project funded by the Swiss Government Excellence Scholarships for Foreign Scholars and Artists and the AguaFuturo project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (project no. 205121L_166272) .,,110,4,4,2,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2214-5818,,J HYDROL-REG STUD,J.

Countries in the BCLME region have responded to international calls to develop national climate change policies, adaptation strategies and plans to respond to these threats. These high-level documents recognize the need to better understand the vulnerabilities facing poor and marginalized communities in high risk areas and develop adaptive capacity to build resilience. However, small-scale fisheries are seldom explicitly mentioned. Furthermore, there is very little guidance on how vulnerability assessments should be conducted and how this information could inform adaptation planning. This paper reports on a community based, participatory and rapid vulnerability assessment methodology that was developed, tested and then applied in 15 communities in the BCLME region. The outcomes of these vulnerability assessments were then used to inform the development of local adaptation plans in five of these communities. Key findings from these local vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning processes are then presented. The discussion centers on the value, benefits and limitations of the participatory and rapid vulnerability assessment process, the need to take a holistic approach to understanding vulnerability, the ongoing and iterative nature of adaptation planning, the power of partnerships and networks, and the need to integrate community-based plans into other sector and climate change adaptation strategies and plans at all levels of governance.","[Sowman, Merle] Univ Cape Town, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Sowman, M (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa.",Merle.Sowman@uct.ac.za,,"Sowman, Merle/0000-0001-8156-8121",Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); Global Environment Facility (GEF); National Research Foundation in South Africa; Benguela Current Convention (BCC),Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); Global Environment Facility (GEF); National Research Foundation in South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa); Benguela Current Convention (BCC),"This work was supported by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Benguela Current Convention (BCC) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF).

How they learnt from them in the past should indicate how they will respond in the more climate-stressed future. National typhoon disaster politics arise when citizens demand disaster protection from their state. Design/methodology/approach The paper analyzes one episode of typhoon politics in each of three Asian countries before 1945: the Philippines (1928), India (1942) and Japan (1934). These three countries show high variance in state capacity and level of democracy. Discourse data are found in contemporary newspaper accounts. Findings In each case, the typhoon disaster politics were shaped by the distance (geographical, institutional, class and cultural) between citizen-victims and the state. Where that distance was great (rural Philippines, Bengal-India), the state tended to minimise victimhood. Where it was small (urban Japan), adaptation was serious and rapid. Social implications The findings should stimulate public discussion of the way in which past social relations and power dynamics surrounding climate-related disasters might influence the present. As the political character of climate change adaptation grows clearer, so does the need for debate to be well-informed. Originality/value Most historical work on climate-related disasters has focused either on the natural phenomena, or on their societal impact. The present paper's focus on adaptation is part of a small but growing scholarly effort to bend the debate towards the evolution of adaptive capacity.","[van Klinken, Gerry] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Anthropol, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Klinken, Gerry] KITLV, Leiden, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian & Caribbean Studies (KITLV-KNAW),"van Klinken, G (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Anthropol, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;van Klinken, G (corresponding author), KITLV, Leiden, Netherlands.",g.a.vanklinken@uva.nl,,,"KITLV; ARC Linkage Project Hazards, tipping points, adaptation and collapse in the Indo-Pacific world, post-1000 C.E","KITLV; ARC Linkage Project Hazards, tipping points, adaptation and collapse in the Indo-Pacific world, post-1000 C.E(Australian Research Council)","Thanks to participants in meetings where versions of this paper were presented: Ateneo de Manila University, Manila, 29 January 2018; KITLV, Leiden, 7 March 2019; Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta, 29 August 2019.

Water for the downstream countries is mainly supplied through the Syrdarya River that originates at the confluence of the Naryn and Karadarya rivers in the Ferghana Valley. Runoff generation from glaciers plays a crucial role, although a considerable number of small tributaries supply the river with additional runoff from snowmelt and rain in the mountains surrounding the Ferghana Valley. Observations of rising air temperature and accelerated glacier shrinkage make it most likely that the relative contributions of the smaller tributaries will increase. Hitherto, assessments of climate change effects on the water resource availability have largely neglected the growing importance of the runoff from smaller tributaries. We used a dynamically down-scaled A1B SRES scenario for climate change effects for the period 2071-2100 in relation to the reference period of 1971-2000 and a version of the conceptual hydrological Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenavdelning model (HBV-light) to estimate runoff contributions with particular respect to the small tributaries. The simulations showed a 12-42% decrease in summer runoff; and a 44-107% increase in winter-spring runoff. This indicates the hydrological regime is shifting towards a runoff from snowmelt earlier in the year. The study suggests that actions for climate change adaptation should be complemented by land management configured to secure optimal runoff supplement from the smaller catchments.","[Radchenko, Iuliia; Frede, Hans-Georg; Breuer, Lutz] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Chair Landscape Water & Biogeochem Cycles, Res Ctr BioSyst Land Use & Nutr, Giessen, Germany; [Dernedde, Yvonne] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Ctr Int Dev & Environm Res ZEU, Giessen, Germany; [Mannig, Birgit] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, Wurzburg, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen; Justus Liebig University Giessen; University of Wurzburg,"Radchenko, I (corresponding author), Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Chair Landscape Water & Biogeochem Cycles, Res Ctr BioSyst Land Use & Nutr, Giessen, Germany.",yulia.rad@gmail.com; yvonne.dernedde@gmx.de; Birgit.Mannig@uni-wuerzburg.de; Hans-Georg.Frede@umwelt.uni-giessen.de; Lutz.Breuer@umwelt.uni-giessen.de,"Radchenko, Iuliia/AAF-4852-2019; Breuer, Lutz/C-6652-2013","Breuer, Lutz/0000-0001-9720-1076",DAAD [09/04755]; CAWa (Water in Central Asia),DAAD(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); CAWa (Water in Central Asia),IR is grateful to the DAAD for funding this work in the frame of the CliNCA (Climate Change Network for Central Asia) project (09/04755) and YD for funding in the frame of the CAWa (Water in Central Asia) project.

Particularly low-lying atoll countries are at risk of becoming uninhabitable. People in these islands may have to prepare for a life away from their homes and migrate to places where survival is feasible and where life in dignity is possible. The removal of obstacles to the mobility of people has been seen as an important step to economic and social development. Mobility helps to balance labour shortages, transfer skills and generate remittances. Successful mobility helps also to adapt to climate risks. Moving away means much more than just finding a country and a piece of land where one can settle. Livelihood, legal and social recognition and integration relate to dignity. From the perspective of receiving countries greater acceptance depends on migrants' skills and how easy they can integrate in labour markets and society. To facilitate this institutional changes as well as bi- and multilateral agreements are needed to enable concrete measures, but also to show political will and generate trust among the weakest in this challenge-the migrants. Recent negotiations concerning labour mobility, unskilled and skilled, temporary and permanent, do not relate directly to climate change adaptation. Favourable outcomes, however, can provide opportunities to SIDS in the Pacific that strengthen adaptive capacities.","[Weber, Eberhard] Univ South Pacific, Sch Geog Earth Sci & Environm, Laucala Campus, Suva, Fiji",University of the South Pacific,"Weber, E (corresponding author), Univ South Pacific, Sch Geog Earth Sci & Environm, Laucala Campus, Suva, Fiji.",weber_e@usp.ac.fj,,,,,,,131,3,3,2,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Through the lens of Ethiopia's flagship Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP), we trace the role of climate discourses in impeding progress towards socially transformative outcomes, despite the importance of social protection for building resilience. We argue that intertwining narratives of moral leadership and green growth associated with Ethiopia's national climate strategy shape how the PSNP is rendered 'climate-smart'. These narratives, however, are embedded within politics that have historically underpinned the country's drive for modernisation and growth-oriented policies, particularly in dealing with food insecurity. Like pre-existing narratives on development and the environment, they rationalise the presence of a strong central State and its control over natural resources and rural livelihoods. The PSNP is thus conditioned to favour technocratic, productivist approaches to adapting to climate change that may help reproduce, rather than challenge the entrenched politics at the root of vulnerability. Ultimately, this case study demonstrates how climate discourses risk diluting core rights-based dimensions of social protection, contradicting efforts to address the structural dimensions of vulnerability to climate change.","[Tenzing, Janna] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Tenzing, Janna; Conway, Declan] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Tenzing, J (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Tenzing, J (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",j.d.tenzing@lse.ac.uk; d.conway@lse.ac.uk,"Conway, Declan/HCH-7778-2022","Tenzing, Janna/0000-0002-6202-6412",UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy [ES/R009708/1]; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; London School of Economics and Political Science,UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; London School of Economics and Political Science,"London School of Economics and Political Science; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) (ES/R009708/1) through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, and the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment.",,129,1,1,4,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

The virus may have emerged from wildlife reservoirs linked to environmental disruption, was transmitted to humans via the wildlife trade, and its spread was facilitated by economic globalization. The pandemic arrived at a time when wildfires, high temperatures, floods, and storms amplified human suffering. These challenges call for a powerful response to COVID-19 that addresses social and economic development, climate change, and biodiversity together, offering an opportunity to bring transformational change to the structure and functioning of the global economy. This biodefense can include a One Health approach in all relevant sectors; a greener approach to agriculture that minimizes greenhouse gas emissions and leads to healthier diets; sustainable forms of energy; more effective international environmental agreements; post-COVID development that is equitable and sustainable; and nature-compatible international trade. Restoring and enhancing protected areas as part of devoting 50% of the planet's land to environmentally sound management that conserves biodiversity would also support adaptation to climate change and limit human contact with zoonotic pathogens.

Three scenarios were simulated: one without temperature change, one with temperature change but rice cultivars unchanged, and one with both an increase in temperature and the adoption of high temperature-tolerant rice varieties. Our simulations indicate that new rice cultivars with high temperature tolerance would reduce economic welfare losses from 264 to 118 billion yen during the simulation period. Paddy-rice farming production increased because product prices increased. Farming inputs also rose correspondingly, triggering an increase in agricultural land rents. Non-agricultural household and small-scale paddy rice-growing household suffered welfare loss. Conversely, medium- and large-scale paddy rice-growing and other farming households saw their welfare boosted. These differences were attributable to the impact of changes in agricultural land rents to their total income. All impacts, not only on economic welfare but also production in the case with new cultivars of high temperature-tolerant rice were smaller than in the those without such cultivars, which indicates that adopting new adaptive technologies eases the economic impact of a warmer climate.","[Akune, Yuko; Okiyama, Mitsuru; Tokunaga, Suminori] Reitaku Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778686, Japan",,"Akune, Y (corresponding author), Reitaku Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778686, Japan.",yakune@reitaku-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,11,7,7,0,5,JAPAN INT RESEARCH CENTER AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,IBARAKI,"TSUKUBA, IBARAKI, 305-8686, JAPAN",0021-3551,,,JARQ-JPN AGR RES Q,Jarq - Jpn.

Hurricane intensity or/and frequency may change as a result of increased CO2 emissions. This paper proposes six climatic adaptation strategies for timber distribution poles that may aid in mitigating the hurricane damage costs that may be expected to increase because of global climate change. The effectiveness of adaptation is assessed through a life-cycle cost analysis, which includes direct cost (e.g. cost of pole replacement, maintenance, and adaptation) and indirect cost (e.g. cost of power outage to customers). The viability of the adaptation strategies is examined considering three CO2 emission scenarios. Furthermore, the scenario of no climate change is considered in this paper to show the applicability the proposed framework for hurricane risk mitigation under current conditions (i.e. wind speeds remain stationary). This paper finds that certain adaptation measures can effectively reduce costs, resulting in more resilient power distribution systems.","[Bjarnadottir, Sigridur] Univ Hartford, Dept Civil Environm & Biomed Engn, Hartford, CT 06117 USA; [Li, Yue] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Reynisson, Oskar] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Stewart, Mark G.] Univ Newcastle, Sch Engn, Ctr Infrastruct Performance & Reliabil, Callaghan, NSW, Australia",University of Hartford; Case Western Reserve University; Michigan Technological University; University of Newcastle,"Bjarnadottir, S (corresponding author), Univ Hartford, Dept Civil Environm & Biomed Engn, Hartford, CT 06117 USA.",bjarnadot@hartford.edu,,"Stewart, Mark/0000-0001-6887-6533",National Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF-1050443],National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The research described in this paper was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Catalyzing New International Collaborations Program, and Infrastructure Management and Extreme Events Program under grant number NSF-1050443.

To cope within these issues, urban food systems need to become more sustainable in their practices, as well as resilient in the face of extreme weather events. While scholars have started to investigate this topic, no comprehensive analysis has yet addressed what entails sustainable and resilient urban food systems. Through a systematic review of the literature, this paper aims to improve our understanding of the key components of sustainable and resilient urban food systems. This study reviewed 53 publications and identified components related to the health, social, economy, environment, and governance domains. Only 5 of the works included in the review discussed sustainability and resilience to the impacts of climate change in urban food systems simultaneously, so there is an opportunity for original research and analysis. The most frequently identified components of urban food systems relate to: access to healthy food; connectivity between urban and rural areas; having a strong local food economy and food production; reducing food waste; and, having active participation of all actors in decision making. There is some level of consensus on linking sustainability and resilience, but diversity in food sources and the development of social capabilities need to be emphasised for climate change adaptation.

Adolescents are typically more receptive to climate change messages than adults, but educators and communicators need research-based strategies for optimizing engagement, including information about what factors are most influential in changing behaviours. To better understand how communication with teachers, friends and family, climate change knowledge and climate change concern predict climate change behaviour, we administered a survey to a random sample of middle school students in North Carolina, USA (n = 1371). We measured climate change behaviour with a multi-item scale asking respondents about energy conservation, alternative transportation and engagement with environmental issues. We found that climate change concern and discussing climate change with family and friends predicted climate change behaviour. We also found that students from urban, high socioeconomic status schools were more likely to engage in climate change behaviour than students in urban, low socioeconomic status schools or rural schools. These results suggest that education efforts should leverage communication with family and friends in programming designed to encourage climate change behaviour. Further, efforts to promote climate change behaviour among low socioeconomic status urban and rural adolescents may be warranted, but would benefit from further investigation into the ideological, physical and knowledge-based drivers of behaviour differences documented in this study.","[Valdez, Rene X.; Peterson, M.

Farmers' understanding of climate change differs amid these discussions because of individual experiences and perceptions after many years of farming. Rainfall is declining, and the temperature is rising are the common perceptions farmers hold on climate change which they see as adversely affecting agriculture. In moments of such adversity, farmers think about what adaptation measures to implement. The objectives of this study were to find out what farmers perceive as climate change, what they consider as the causes of the change, and how they adapt to climate change. Methods used for collecting data were administering questionnaires to farmers in six towns in the Yendi Municipality, obtaining information through focused group discussions, and talking to agricultural extension officers. Data analysis was done using Excel software. The results show farmers are aware that the climate is changing. The changes are perceived as a result of bad farming practices, including cutting down trees, the influence of supernatural forces in preventing rainfall, and changes in wind direction which deprive communities of rainfall. Adaptation measures to cope with climate change mentioned by the farmers include crop diversification to plant drought-resistant crops and diversify from high grass consuming ruminants to low grass consuming ones.

The case study of this research includes the Khersan 1, Karoon 4, and Karoon 3 reservoirs in Iran. The HADCM3 climate model with A2 greenhouse gas emission scenario is coupled with proportional downscaling to assess the impact of climate change on river discharge and reservoir hydropower production. The IHACRES rainfall- runoff model is implemented for calculating river discharge under climate-change conditions. Reservoir simulation and optimization models are implemented to calculate hydropower production in the base period (1986-2000), future period 1 (2025-2039), future period 2 (2055-2069), and future period 3 (2085-2099). The power production and performance criteria of the reservoirs are calculated using simulation (standard operating policy) and optimization models in the considered periods. Our results show that the largest reductions of reservoir discharge correspond, in decreasing order, to the future periods 3, 1, and 2, respectively. Moreover, the hydropower production obtained with the optimization model is found to be larger than that obtained with the simulation model. The calculated increase in power production in the base period and future periods 1, 2, and 3 is equal to 6, 19, 10, and 22 %, respectively. These results demonstrate the benefit of applying optimization modeling for hydropower production in the Khersan -Karoon reservoir system to mitigate and adapt to climate-change impacts on river discharge.","[Jahandideh-Tehrani, Mahsa; Bozorg-Haddad, Omid] Univ Tehran, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Fac Agr Engn & Technol, Dept Irrigat & Reclamat Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Loaiciga, Hugo A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of Tehran; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Bozorg-Haddad, O (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Fac Agr Engn & Technol, Dept Irrigat & Reclamat Engn, Tehran, Iran.",Jahandideh.T@ut.ac.ir; OBHaddad@ut.ac.ir; Hugo.Loaiciga@ucsb.edu,"Tehrani, Mahsa Jahandideh/L-4847-2019; Bozorg-Haddad, Omid/F-5710-2015","Tehrani, Mahsa Jahandideh/0000-0003-1763-2023; Bozorg-Haddad, Omid/0000-0001-6607-9581",,,,,40,65,65,4,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

These challenges necessitate a re-thinking of existing notions of urban governance in order to account for the practices that emerge from governments and a plethora of other actors in the context of uncertainty. We understand these practices to constitute adaptive governance, underpinned by social learning guiding the actions of the multiplicity of actors. The aim here is to unpack how social learning for adaptive governance requires attention to competing understandings of risk and identity, and the multiplicity of mechanisms in which change occurs or is blocked in urban climate governance. We adopt a novel lens of 'environmentalities' which allows us to assess the historical and institutional context and power relations in the informal settlements of Maputo, Mozambique. Our findings highlight how environmental identities around urban adaptation to climate change are constituted in the social and physical divisions between the formal and informal settlements, whilst existing knowledge models prioritise dominant economic and political interests and lead to the construction of new environmental subjects. While the findings of this study are contextually distinct, the generalizable lessons are that governance of urban adaptation occurs and is solidified within a complex multiplicity of socio-ecological relations.

It is difficult to predict what new agronomic technologies will be necessary for crop production under future climatic conditions. The purpose of this work was to develop an approach useful in identifying crop technologies for future climatic conditions. As an example of the approach, we used response surface methodology (RSM) in connection with the CERES-Wheat model and the HADCM2 climate simulation model to identify optimal configurations of plant traits and management practices that maximize yield of winter wheat in high CO2 environments. The simulations were conducted for three Nebraska locations differing in altitude and rainfall (Lincoln, Dickens and Alliance), which were considered representative of winter wheat growing areas in the central Great Plains. At all locations, the identified optimal winter wheat cultivar under high CO2 conditions had a larger number of tillers, larger kernel size, fewer days to flower, grew faster and had more kernels m(-2) than the check cultivar under normal CO, conditions. In addition, optimal sowing dates were later and optimal plant densities were smaller than under normal conditions. We concluded that RSM used in conjunction with crop and climate simulation models was useful in understanding the complex relationship between wheat genotypes, climate and management practices.

This Review discusses the mechanisms explaining the diagonal orientation of the South Pacific Convergence Zone, its variability and projected changes under anthropogenic warming. The South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) is a diagonal band of intense rainfall and deep atmospheric convection extending from the equator to the subtropical South Pacific. Displacement of the SPCZ causes variability in rainfall, tropical-cyclone activity and sea level that affects South Pacific island populations and surrounding ecosystems. In this Review, we synthesize recent advances in understanding the physical mechanisms responsible for the SPCZ location and orientation, its interactions with the principal drivers of tropical climate variability, regional and global effects of the SPCZ and its response to anthropogenic climate change. Emerging insight is beginning to provide a coherent description of the character and variability of the SPCZ over synoptic, intraseasonal, interannual and longer timescales. For example, the diagonal orientation of the SPCZ and its natural variability are both the result of a subtle chain of interactions between the tropical and extratropical atmosphere, forced and modulated by the underlying sea surface temperature gradients. However, persistent biases in, and deficiencies of, existing models limit confidence in future projections. Improved climate models and new methods for regional modelling might better constrain future SPCZ projections, aiding climate change adaptation and planning among vulnerable South Pacific communities.","[Brown, Josephine R.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Lengaigne, Matthieu; Dutheil, Cyril] Sorbonne Univ, Inst Rech Dev, Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS,Inst Pierre Simon Laplace,Lab Oceanog & Clim, Paris, France; [Lintner, Benjamin R.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Widlansky, Matthew J.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [van der Wiel, Karin] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, De Bilt, Netherlands; [Dutheil, Cyril] Inst Rech Dev IRD, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Linsley, Braddock K.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY USA; [Matthews, Adrian J.] Univ East Anglia, Ctr Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Matthews, Adrian J.] Univ East Anglia, Sch Math, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Renwick, James] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Wellington, New Zealand",University of Melbourne; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Saclay; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Columbia University; University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia; Victoria University Wellington,"Brown, JR (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia.",josephine.brown@unimelb.edu.au,"Matthews, Adrian J/A-6444-2011; Dutheil, Cyril/AAG-1761-2021; van der Wiel, Karin/AAJ-8827-2021; Lengaigne, Matthieu/M-8321-2014","Matthews, Adrian J/0000-0003-0492-1168; Dutheil, Cyril/0000-0001-6891-2389; Brown, Josephine/0000-0002-1100-7457; Linsley, Braddock/0000-0003-2085-0662; van der Wiel, Karin/0000-0001-9365-5759; Lengaigne, Matthieu/0000-0002-0044-036X; Widlansky, Matthew/0000-0002-3765-7327",ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes [CE170100023],ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes,J.

Drought is the most relevant hazard in Cabo Verde in terms of economic losses. This archipelagic country experiences extreme drought conditions regularly with particular impact on the agricultural sector. Although climate variability is a significant source of risk, the impact of drought on agriculture and society does not only depend on the inherent hydrometeorological characteristics of a region, but also the levels of exposure and the vulnerability of people, political, and agricultural systems. In this regard, and in light of global changes, the understanding of emerging political perspectives to deal with climate-related risks is essential to benefit planning and decision-making processes. In this qualitative descriptive research, we seek to provide policymakers and civil society with an up-to-date outline of crucial developments and factors that links disaster reduction and climate change adaptation mainstreaming into development. The study considers Cabo Verde, with particular emphasis on the 2017-18 drought emergency response. It seeks to discuss the observed impacts of climate change on territorial development, as it provides the basis for understanding innovative approaches for drought risk and supporting activities towards drought risk reduction, aimed at increasing the Disaster Risk Reduction knowledge base by capturing issues that have emerged from national efforts making sure they inform international processes in order to enable climate-resilient pathways.","[Ferreira Costa, Carlos Germano] Minist Ciencia Tecnol Inovacoes & Comunicacoes, Comissao Interminist Mudanca Global Clima, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",,"Costa, CGF (corresponding author), Minist Ciencia Tecnol Inovacoes & Comunicacoes, Comissao Interminist Mudanca Global Clima, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",carloscostainspira@gmail.com,"Costa, Carlos Germano Ferreira/M-6964-2015","Costa, Carlos Germano Ferreira/0000-0003-0280-7281",,,,,24,1,1,0,3,CONSEJO SUPERIOR INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS-CSIC,MADRID,"VITRUVIO 8, 28006 MADRID, SPAIN",0014-1496,1988-8546,,ESTUD GEOGR,Estud.

Also, the effect of temperature and planting dates scenario on potato crop growth was evaluated by using 30 years historical weather data of the aforesaid districts. Field experiments were conducted on potato crops of cultivar Kufri Jyoti under two planting dates (10th and 25th of December) and different fertilizer treatments in the years 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, respectively. The statistical results showed the satisfactory performance of the model with an R-2 of 0.82 to 0.98 and d-stat of 0.94 to 0.98 for the year 2013-2014 and an R-2 of 0.89 to 0.98 and d-stat of 0.97 to 0.98 for the year 2014-2015. Evaluation of planting dates with past 30years historical data showed planting dates 20th and 30th of November resulted in average higher yield than planting dates 10th, 25th and 30th of December, respectively, in current climate scenario.

Triggered by the soaring need for such information, we performed a high-resolution evaluation and projection of the spatial vulnerability of thermoelectric power generation to water scarcity problems. The study provides a comprehensive assessment by incorporating thermoelectric plants' reliance on water, local water supply stress and future impacts brought about by planning and climate change into the analysis simultaneously. To measure the vulnerability of thermoelectric plants to water scarcity, a vulnerability index was constructed and multi-disciplinary approaches were integrated to quantify this index. Seven hotpots in North China were highlighted as power-vulnerable to water scarcity currently. In order to fulfill the power generation target in the future, less-vulnerable watersheds identified by this study are suggested to become the sites of future power plants. Besides, lowering the water withdrawal intensity of power plants alone is not enough to solve the vulnerability concerns. Instead, it is necessary to implement other water management, including water rights allocation in the trans boundary river basins.

It has been shown before that private building precautionary measures are able to significantly mitigate flood losses. The purpose of this paper is to investigate which factors are motivating people to undertake mitigation measures, with a particular focus on the perceptions of climate change. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 605 households in Dresden have been interviewed and their answers statistically analysed. Findings - Correlation and principal component analysis show a slight influence of the perception about consequences of climate change on the motivation to undertake flood emergency measures. However, other socio-economic factors such as the ownership of the residential building and the size of the household are much more important. Practical implications - In order to improve the uptake of flood mitigation and climate change adaptation measures, public awareness raising campaigns and schemes utilizing financial and non-financial incentives should be undertaken. Such campaigns should particularly focus on specific social-groups, like tenants or singles. Awareness raising campaigns focusing on the causes and consequences of climate change are expected to have little effect on peoples' motivation to act. Originality/value - This study has discovered very weak links between perceptions of climate change and the motivation of households to undertake precautionary measures, which is important for the design of awareness raising campaigns.","German Res Ctr Geosci GFZ, Hydrol Sect, Potsdam, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences,"Kreibich, H (corresponding author), German Res Ctr Geosci GFZ, Hydrol Sect, Potsdam, Germany.",kreib@gfz-potsdam.de,"Kreibich, Heidi/HNR-9624-2023","Kreibich, Heidi/0000-0001-6274-3625",,,,,23,26,26,1,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Iteration of the deliberative dialogue process is critical for allowing enough time for meaningful change and constructive communication to occur. Understanding where the community is starting from is important when tensions are high or deeply held values are challenged. Older techniques may need to be used to prepare the community for full participation in a deliberative process.

In the last few years, tunnel house has been increasingly promoted as tools to enhance smallholder farmers' livelihood and tackle climate adversaries. However, little is known about what factor determines its adoption and whether it helps smallholders adapt to climate change and experience better livelihood. We address these gaps using the cross-sectional survey data collected from 62 adopters and 92 non-adopters in three municipalities of Bagmati Province. We employed descriptive analysis and probit model and found out that age, farm size, and ethnicity strongly influence the technology adoption amongst smallholder farmers. Additionally, treatment model and ordinary least square (OLS) regression were utilized to examine tunnel technology's effect. Our study shows that tunnel significantly increases production by 32 tons/year/hectare and protects crops from climate change effects such as heavy rainfall and temperature change. Likewise, tunnel technology increases the net crop income by $1700/year/hectare. However, the economic benefit is not substantial compared to technology's adoption cost as adopters incur enormous costs of $12,000/year/hectare on equipment, labor and resources. These results suggest policymakers should concentrate on reducing the technology's cost, which could be achieved through subsidies, financial support, or price control mechanisms. Ensuring technology's affordability can contribute to smallholder farmers' sustainable livelihood in Nepal and countries with similar contexts.","[Diwakar, K.

From 1961 to 2017, the annual air temperature increased by 0.32 degrees C/decade over the Tibetan Plateau, which is the highest in the whole of China. Furthermore, this is a trend that is projected to continue by 0.30 degrees C/decade from 2018 to 2050 due to global warming using the Regional Climate Model version 4 (RegCM4). The increased temperature trend in recent decades has been highest in winter, which has been positive for the safe dormancy of winter wheat. In order to investigate agricultural adaptation to climate change in the Tibetan plateau, we used the World Food Studies (WOFOST) cropping systems model and weather data from the regional climate model RegCM4, to simulate winter wheat production in Guide county between 2018 and 2050. The simulated winter wheat potential yields amounted to 6698.3 kg/ha from 2018 to 2050, which showed the wheat yields would increase by 81%, if winter wheat was planted instead of spring wheat in the Tibetan Plateau with the correct amount of irrigation water. These results indicate that there are not only risks to crop yields from climate change, but also potential benefits. Global warming introduced the possibility to plant winter wheat instead of spring wheat over the Tibetan Plateau. These findings are very important for farmers and government agencies dealing with agricultural adaptation in a warmer climate.","[Song, Yanling; Wang, Chunyi] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Linderholm, Hans W.] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Linderholm, Hans W.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Tian, Jinfeng] Univ Kiel, Fac Agr & Nutr Sci, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Shi, Ying; Liu, Yanju] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jinxia] China Meteorol Adm, Climate Ctr Sichuan Prov, Chengdu 610072, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Gothenburg; University of Cambridge; University of Kiel; China Meteorological Administration; China Meteorological Administration,"Wang, CY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",songyl@cma.gov.cn; wangcy@cma.gov.cn; hansl@gvc.gu.se; stu115178@mail.uni-kiel.de; shiying@cma.gov.cn; xuransige@sina.cn; liuyanj@cma.gov.cn,"Linderholm, Hans W/N-1020-2013","Linderholm, Hans W/0000-0002-1522-8919","National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC1505605, 2017YFC1502402]; China Special Fund for Meteorological Research in the Public Interest [GYHY201506019]",National Key R&D Program of China; China Special Fund for Meteorological Research in the Public Interest,"This work is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFC1505605, 2017YFC1502402) and the China Special Fund for Meteorological Research in the Public Interest (GYHY201506019).",,29,8,8,10,47,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Studies of how LEK can help adapt to increasing climate variability remain limited. This article develops an approach through which the process of adaptation can be tracked at a community level. We describe how community residents in the Amazon floodplains incorporate natural hydrologic and ecological processes into their management systems to optimize ecosystem functioning. We describe two case studies where LEK is used as a resource by small-scale fisher-farmers in the Amazon floodplains to adapt to the increasing impacts on their livelihoods generated by changing climate patterns. This article draws on local histories and seeks to identify the critical factors that either facilitate or impede household ability to reduce their vulnerability. We found that the LEK of small fisher-farmers has facilitated the adaptation of a resource management system to optimize production across a broad range of floodplain habitats and conditions. There are, however, significant challenges to operationalizing these approaches, including an absence of systematically collected data on adaptation strategies and outcomes. In addition, local people must be integrated into policymaking processes so their knowledge can contribute to the design of locally appropriate policies for adapting to-the impacts of climate related events.

Management in Australia relies on biocontrol using the nematode, Deladenus (= Beddingia) siricidicola (Bedding), which infects and sterilises females who then further disperse the nematode. This pest is spreading into warmer regions in Australia and South America and coupled with the threat of global climate change, there is uncertainty as to how increasing temperatures will affect the biocontrol program. S. noctilio within nematode-inoculated wood were reared at four temperatures (24, 25.3, 26.6 and 28 degrees C) to investigate the effects of elevated temperatures on wasp development (emergence time, sex ratio and size), development of eggs (number, size, and maturation) and infection by the nematode. At 24 degrees C, which reflects current field temperature, S. noctilio were bigger in size and all the eggs were normal and all were infected with nematodes. Modest rises in temperature reflecting climate change scenarios resulted in smaller sized S. noctilio, disrupted egg development and maturation, and lowered the nematode sterilisation rate in females. Reduced S. noctilio female body size and egg infection will likely compromise biocontrol by D. siricidicola in its current distribution, but disrupted egg development may act directly on the pest, limiting dispersal of S. noctilio into subtropical pine plantations and adaptation to climate change.

Here we demonstrate climate change in the last 60 years using meteorological data (1951-2009) in the region. Both of the temperature and precipitation show a remarkable rise before and after year 1990 and these changes are much more significant in North Xinjiang than it is in South Xinjiang. Response of water systems towards climate change is then assessed by comparing annual discharge change of Urumqi River (10.0%) in the North and Kumalak River (38.7%) in South Xinjiang. We found significant inconsistency of the climate change impact on water resources. Furthermore, we quantitatively determine the ratio of ice-melt water using isotope hydrograph separation as well as other conservative tracers. Results show that Urumqi River is recharged by less than 9% of ice-melt water, while Kumalak River contains more than 57% of ice-melt water in their discharges. The extent of glacier input to a water system governs its sensitivity towards climate change. The method has overwhelming potential for un-gauged watersheds and may offer ways of adaptation to climate change in terms of water resources management for flood control and sustainable agriculture.

It discusses the challenges of exchanging knowledge between the science and policy communities, given their different languages and cultures, highlighting the need for greater mutual understanding of roles and responsibilities. It draws on experience in the Scottish Government of developing the government's 'Recipe for Success - Scotland's National Food and Drink Policy' through engagement with stakeholders, scientists and analysts and touches on the more complex nature of the Department for International Development's contribution to meeting the first Millennium Development Goal. It compares the need for collation and analysis of existing evidence during the development of policy, with the desirability of providing policy direction for longer-term strategic research and the challenges of connecting the policy expectations with researchable questions. The paper concludes by emphasising the need to focus research in the short-term on mitigation of climate change through decreasing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of food, while also taking an account of economic, health and broader environmental sustainability objectives. A further challenge is to communicate complexity and uncertainty in ways which enable decision-makers from the consumer to policy-makers to make informed choices. Longer-term research needs to focus on the opportunities and risks associated with adapting to climate change.","[Gill, M.] Univ Aberdeen, Aberdeen Ctr Environm Sustainabil, Sch Geosci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland; [Gill, M.; Johnston, K.] Scottish Govt, Rural & Environm Res & Anal Directorate, Edinburgh EH11 3XD, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Aberdeen,"Gill, M (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Aberdeen Ctr Environm Sustainabil, Sch Geosci, Tillydrone Ave, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland.",m.gill@abdn.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,4,4,1,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0029-6651,,,P NUTR SOC,Proc.

Streamflow was simulated from two CORDEX-Africa regional climate models (RCMs) forced by the 5th phase of the Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Project (CMIP5) Global Climate Models (GCMs), namely, the CanESM2m and IPSL-CM5A-MR climate models. Three climate projection time intervals were considered spanning from 2006 to 2099 and delineated as follows: current climatology (2006-2035), near future (2036-2065) and end of century future projection (2070-2099). Statistical metrics derived from the projected streamflow were used to assess the impacts of the changing climate on water-linked sectors. These metrics included streamflow trends, low and high flow quantile probabilities, the Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) trends and the proportion (%) of dry and wet years, as well as drought monitoring indicators. Based on the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test, the LRB is projected to experience reduced streamflow in both the near and the distant future. The basin is projected to experience frequent dry and wet conditions that can translate to drought and flash floods, respectively. In particular, a high proportion of dry and a few incidences of wet years are expected in the basin in the future. In general, the findings of this research study will inform and enhance climate change adaptation and mitigation policy decisions and implementation thereof, to sustain the livelihoods of vulnerable communities.","[Botai, Christina M.; Botai, Joel O.; Zwane, Nosipho N.; Makgoale, Thabo; Murambadoro, Miriam D.; Adeola, Abiodun M.; Ncongwane, Katlego P.; de Wit, Jaco P.; Mengistu, Michael G.; Tazvinga, Henerica] South African Weather Serv, Private Bag X097, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Botai, Joel O.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield Pretoria, South Africa; [Botai, Joel O.] Cent Univ Technol, Dept Informat Technol, Free State Private Bag X20539, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Botai, Joel O.; Mengistu, Michael G.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa; [Hayombe, Patrick; Wamiti, Eric K.] Kenya Water Inst, POB 60013-00200, Nairobi, Kenya; [Murambadoro, Miriam D.] Univ Witwatersrand, Global Change Inst, Private Bag 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Adeola, Abiodun M.] Univ Pretoria, Sch Hlth Syst & Publ Hlth, Fac Hlth Sci, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield Pretoria, South Africa; [Ncongwane, Katlego P.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa",South African Weather Service (SAWS); University of Pretoria; Central University of Technology; University of Kwazulu Natal; University of Witwatersrand; University of Pretoria; University of Kwazulu Natal,"Botai, CM (corresponding author), South African Weather Serv, Private Bag X097, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",Christina.Botai@weathersa.co.za; Joel.Botai@weathersa.co.za; Nosipho.Zwane@weathersa.co.za; rapospat@yahoo.com; dwamiti@gmail.com; Thabo.Makgoale@weathersa.co.za; Miriam.Murambadoro@weathersa.co.za; abiodun.adeola@weathersa.co.za; Katlego.ncongwane@weathersa.co.za; Jaco.deWit@weathersa.co.za; Michael.Mengistu@weathersa.co.za; Henerica.Tazvinga@weathersa.co.za,"Mengistu, Michael/HLP-9735-2023; Adeola, Abiodun Morakinyo/M-6094-2019","Wamiti, Eric Kuria/0000-0002-8159-5645; Tazvinga, Henerica/0000-0002-7538-6169; Botai, Christina/0000-0003-3498-539X; Botai, Joel/0000-0003-4355-0662; Murambadoro, Miriam/0000-0001-5238-4235; Mengistu, Michael Ghebrekidan/0000-0002-8097-5267; Adeola, Abiodun Morakinyo/0000-0002-6105-7110; Ncongwane, Katlego/0000-0002-3923-1530",Water Research Commission (WRC) of South Africa [C2019/2020-00017],Water Research Commission (WRC) of South Africa,"This research is part of the on-going project no.

Methods We used the Moran's I tests to evaluate spatial clusters of diseases and applied multilevel negative binomial regression models using the Bayesian framework to analyse the association between socioecological factors and the diseases queried by oral, airborne, vector-borne, and animal transmission diseases. Results and significance The study found that oral-transmission diseases were spatially distributed across the country; whereas, the airborne-transmission diseases were more clustered in the Northwest and vector-borne transmission diseases were more clustered in the South. Most of diseases were sensitive with climatic factors. For instance, a 1 degrees C increase in average temperature is significantly associated with 0.4% ( 95CI, 0.3 +/- 0.5), 2.5% ( 95% CI, 1.4 +/- 3.6), 0.9% ( 95% CI, 0.6 +/- 1.4), 1.1% ( 95% CI), 5% ( 95% CI, 3-.7.4), 0.4% ( 95% CI, 0.2 +/- 0.7), and 2% ( 95% CI, 1.5 +/- 2.8) increase in risk of diarrhoea, shigellosis, mumps, influenza, dengue, malaria, and rabies respectively. The influences of socio-economic factors on risk of communicable diseases are varied by factors with the biggest influence of population density. The research findings reflect an important implication for the climate change adaptation strategies of health sectors. A development of weather-based early warning systems should be considered to strengthen communicable disease prevention in Vietnam.","[Dung Phung; Chu, Cordia] Griffith Univ, Menzies Hlth Inst Queensland, Ctr Environm & Populat Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Huong Xuan Nguyen] Da Nang Univ Med Technol & Pharm, Da Nang, Vietnam; [Huong Lien Thi Nguyen; Anh Mai Luong; Cuong Manh Do] Minist Hlth, Hlth Environm Management Agcy, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Quang Dai Tran] Minist Hlth, Gen Dept Prevent Med, Hanoi, Vietnam",Griffith University; Menzies Health Institute Queensland; Danang University of Medical Technology & Pharmacy,"Phung, D (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Menzies Hlth Inst Queensland, Ctr Environm & Populat Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",d.phung@griffith.edu.au,"Xuan Huong, Nguyen/GRR-6055-2022; Phung, Dung/ABC-9218-2021","Phung, Dung/0000-0002-1615-3234; Chu, Cordia/0000-0002-3683-5638",,,,,62,3,3,5,13,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,MAR 1,2018,13,3,,,,,,,e0193246,10.1371/journal.pone.0193246,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0193246,,,14,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,FX8RR,29494623,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000426363200032,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such events or their probability of occurring may be, or are, changing due to climate change with consequent changes in the associated risks. To adapt to, or to address loss and damage from, this changing risk we need to understand the effects of climate change on extreme weather events and their impacts. The emerging science of probabilistic event attribution can provide scientific evidence about the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to changes in risk of extreme events. This research has the potential to be useful for climate change adaptation, but there is a need to explore its application in vulnerable developing countries, particularly those in Africa, since the majority of existing event attribution studies have focused on mid-latitude events. Here we explain the methods of, and implications of, different approaches to attributing extreme weather events in an African context. The analysis demonstrates that different ways of framing attribution questions can lead to very different assessments of change in risk. Crucially, defining the most appropriate attribution question to ask is not a science decision but one that needs to be made in dialogue with those stakeholders who will use the answers. This is true of all attribution studies but may be particularly relevant in a tropical context, suggesting that collaboration between scientists and policy-makers is a priority for Africa.","[Otto, Friederike E.

Trust in managing authorities and knowledge about forest management have proven influential in shaping public support for policy across different forest managemen contexts. However, little is known about the relationship between public trust and knowledge as it relates to policy support for emerging management strategies for climate adaptation in forests. We use the example of genomics-based assisted migration (within and outside of natural range) in British Columbia's (BC) forests to examine the relative roles of and interactions between trust in different forestry actors and knowledge of forestry in shaping public support for this new and potentially controversial management alternative. Our results, based on an online survey (n = 1953 BC residents), reveal low public trust in governments and the forest industry combined with low levels of public knowledge about forest management. We find that individuals who are more trusting of decision-makers and other important forestry actors hold higher levels of support for assisted migration. Higher levels of forestry knowledge are linked with support for assisted migration within native range, whereas no knowledge effect is observed for assisted migration outside of native range. We discuss the implications of these observations and provide recommendations to more fully engage with the challenges of low levels of trust and knowledge in this context.<bold> </bold>","[St-Laurent, Guillaume Peterson; Hagerman, Shannon; Findlater, Kieran M.; Kozak, Robert] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, 2900-2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Findlater, Kieran M.] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, 2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"St-Laurent, GP (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, 2900-2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",guillaume.peterson@ubc.ca,"St-Laurent, Guillaume Peterson/AAU-3089-2020","St-Laurent, Guillaume Peterson/0000-0002-1329-0954; Findlater, Kieran/0000-0002-6818-5588; Hagerman, Shannon/0000-0002-1830-6126",Genome Canada [241REF]; Genome BC,Genome Canada(Genome Canada); Genome BC,"The CoAdapTree project is funded by Genome Canada (241REF), Genome BC and 16 other sponsors (http://coadaptree.forestry.ubc.ca/sponsors/).

Adaptation has recently become a mandatory planning theme for Danish municipalities, which in the absence of established practices are struggling to find the best institutional set-up to address adaptation as an integrated issue. Based on a case study of an integrated project organised as a partnership, this article identifies and discusses governance challenges that must be addressed if municipalities are to benefit from synergies through integrated projects. The municipality in question has established a partnership with housing organisations, foundations, and a utility company as well as facilitated a dialogue with citizens and institutions to address flooding threats and social issues at the neighbourhood scale. Because of strong political and leadership support, funding from partners, and good project facilitation both partners and politicians are enthusiastic about the project and its potential. Several challenges, however, needed to be addressed, particularly in relation to clashing norms from different governance paradigms.

In East Africa, diversification of maize-based cropping systems by intercropping with grain and tree legumes may foster productivity and resilience to adverse weather conditions. We tested whether intercropping enhances drought resistance and crop and whole-system yields by imposing drought in monocultures and additive intercrops along a crop diversity gradient-sole maize (Zea mays), sole pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), maize-pigeonpea, maize-gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium, a woody perennial), and maize-pigeonpea-gliricidia-with and without fertilizer application. We developed and tested a novel low-cost, above-canopy rainout shelter design for drought experiments made with locally-sourced materials that successfully reduced soil moisture without creating sizeable artifacts for the crop microenvironment. Drought reduced maize grain yield under fertilized conditions in some cropping systems but did not impact pigeonpea grain yield. Whole-system grain yield and theoretical caloric and protein yields in two intercropping systems, maize-pigeonpea and maize-gliricidia, were similar to the standard sole maize system. Maize-pigeonepea performed most strongly compared to other systems in terms of protein yield. Maize-pigeonpea was the only intercrop that consistently required less land than its corresponding monocultures to produce the same yield (Land Equivalent Ratio >1), particularly under drought. Despite intercropping systems having greater planting density than sole maize and theoretically greater competition for water, they were not more prone to yield loss with drought.

In the context of unstable supply of new and renewable energies, it is imperative to strengthen the ability of the energy system to adapt to climate change. This study first simulated climate change in Beijing based on regional climate data. At the same time, the Statistical Program for Social Sciences was used to perform multiple linear regression analysis on Beijing's future power demand and to analyze the impact of climate change on electricity supply in both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (representative concentration pathway 4.5 and 8.5) scenarios. Based on the analysis of the impact of climate change on energy supply, a multi-objective optimization model for new and renewable energy structure adjustment combined with climate change was proposed. The model was then used to predict the optimal power generation of the five energy types under different conditions in 2020. Through comparison of the results, it was found that the development amount and development ratio of various energy forms underwent certain changes. In the case of climate change, the priority development order of new and renewable energies in Beijing was: external electricity > other renewable energy > solar energy > wind energy > biomass energy. The energy structure adjustment program in the context of climate change will contribute to accelerating the development and utilization of new and renewable energies, alleviating the imbalance between power supply and demand and improving energy security.","[Ding, Xiaowen; Liu, Lin; Xu, Ye; Guo, Junhong] North China Elect Power Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Key Lab Resources & Environm Syst Optimizat, MOE, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Huang, Guohe] Univ Regina, Fac Engn, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada",North China Electric Power University; University of Regina,"Xu, Y (corresponding author), North China Elect Power Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Key Lab Resources & Environm Syst Optimizat, MOE, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",xiaowending@ncepu.edu.cn; liulin@ncepu.edu.cn; guohe.huang@outlook.com; xuye@ncepu.edu.cn; handangjh@163.com,"xu, ye/GQO-8972-2022; Huang, Guohe/H-5306-2011; Huang, Guohe/AAA-7305-2019","Huang, Guohe/0000-0003-4974-3019; ","National Key R&D Program of China CERC-WET Project [SQ2018YFE010367, 2016YFE0102400]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017MS050]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of PRC [2017YQ002]; National key scientific and technological projects of the PRC [2014ZX07104-005]",National Key R&D Program of China CERC-WET Project; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of PRC; National key scientific and technological projects of the PRC,This research was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China CERC-WET Project under Grant [number SQ2018YFE010367& 2016YFE0102400]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant [number 2017MS050]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of PRC (2017YQ002); and the National key scientific and technological projects of the PRC (2014ZX07104-005).,,40,4,4,6,33,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,MAY 1,2019,12,9,,,,,,,1692,10.3390/en12091692,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12091692,,,21,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Energy & Fuels,IA7UD,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000469761700108,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, mountain regions worldwide are impacted by climate change and at the same time represent distinctive area for the assessment of climate related impacts. Climate change impacts in Himalayan region have its implications on food production, natural ecosystems, retreat of glacier, water supply, human and animal health and overall human well being. The livelihood and food security of the people inhabited in region largely depend on climate sensitive sectors i.e. agriculture, livestock, forestry and their interlinkages with each other, and has the potential to break down food and nutritional security as well as livelihood support systems. People's perception and understanding of climate can be an important asset when it comes to adaptation to climate change impact; however it is not taken into consideration for the development of policy design and implementation of modern mitigation and adaptation strategies by governments and other civil society organizations. The knowledge of local people and farming communities for rural landscape management and sustainable use of bioresources is gaining credence as a key strategy to cope up with the climate change. Therefore, the present study analyzes the indigenous knowledge of local people and their perceptions on climate change, and also documented adaptation approaches at local level in mountain ecosystem of western Himalaya.

A better understanding of the impacts of drought and the responses of West African populations is indispensable for researchers and decision makers in the current and future context of multiple socioeconomic and environmental changes, including climate change. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on drought in West Africa. In this paper, we highlight controversial issues and identify knowledge gaps. Although drought has been widely considered as a major problem in West Africa, there is a need to frame it within a set of multiple threats faced by local populations and to understand how droughts act as a trigger in economic, societal, and environmental contexts. The literature on responses to drought focuses on agricultural and individual responses, while diversification, migration, and tree-based or livestock-based responses are less frequently addressed. More research is needed on the effectiveness and on the unexpected effects of responses of populations, states, and NGOs, as well as on the interactions between different responses. To understand the complexity of impacts and responses, the context in which they occur and how individual and collective actions interact within households or communities needs to be taken into account. Ecosystems and agriculture offer many goods and services that are suitable for adaptation and the different landscape components should be analyzed together. Such historical, contextual, and integrated analyses would better inform new policies and projects for adaptation to climate change.

However, understanding of future seasonal changes of streamflow over Pakistan remains limited. This study assessed the past and future changes in streamflow timing along the four major rivers of Pakistan (Upper Indus, Kabul, Jhelum, and Chenab River basins), using observational data and bias-corrected hydrological projections. Firstly, the VIC-river routing model was simulated forced by simulated daily surface and base runoff data from six CORDEX-South Asia regional climate models (1962-2099). Secondly, the minimum and seasonality bias in simulated daily streamflow data were corrected based on observational records. To quantify seasonal changes of the hydrologic regime, half of annual cumulative streamflows (HCSs) and center-of-volume dates (CVDs) were computed from observed and bias-corrected simulated streamflow data. Over 1962-2019, observational records showed a significant decreasing trend in CVD (that is, an earlier onset of the wet season) by a range between -4.5 and -12.6 days across the three river basins, except for Chenab River basin. Bias-corrected hydrologic projections showed decreased CVD across the four study river basins by -4.2 to -6.3 days during the record period (1962-2019). The decreased CVDs ranges from -5 to -20 days in the near future (the 2050-2059 average) and -11 days to -37 days in the far future (the 2090-2099 average). This study reported diverse hydrologic responses to a similar magnitude of near-surface temperature in Pakistan, highlighting a need to develop basin-specific water resources mamangement and policies for climate change adaptation.","[Ali, Shahid; Kim, Byeong-Hee; Kam, Jonghun] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Div Environm Sci & Engn, Pohang 37673, South Korea; [Kam, Jonghun] Yonsei Univ, Inst Convergence Res & Educ Adv Technol, Seoul, South Korea; [Akhtar, Taimoor] Univ Guelph, Coll Engn & Phys Sci, Guelph, ON, Canada",Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH); Yonsei University; University of Guelph,"Kam, J (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Div Environm Sci & Engn, Pohang 37673, South Korea.",jhkam@postech.ac.kr,"; Kam, Jonghun/G-3550-2012","Kim, Byeong-Hee/0000-0001-8634-2885; Kam, Jonghun/0000-0002-7967-7705",CORDEX South Asia system; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2021R1A2C1093866]; Globla Korea Scholarship (GKS) Program of the National Institute for International Education (NIIED); Ministry of Education in the Republic of Korea,"CORDEX South Asia system; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Globla Korea Scholarship (GKS) Program of the National Institute for International Education (NIIED); Ministry of Education in the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea)","We acknowledge the agencies that support the CORDEX South Asia system, and we thank the CORDEX South Asia-participant climate modeling groups for producing and making available their model output.

Furthermore, climate change and the need for the efficient use of resources are providing additional pressures that cannot be addressed solely with Business-as-usual solutions. In this paper, the consequences of such problems and limitations on the urban environment have been assessed through the identification of linked major impacts (e.g., urban flooding and pollution events) and societal externalities (e.g., economic losses, health and social issues, and environmental risks). Since Nature-based Solutions (NBS) consider human well-being, socio-economic development, and governance principles, they open new perspectives regarding urban sustainability, quality of life, and climate change adaptation. To highlight their added value to existing Urban Drainage Systems (UDS), the synergies that result from implementing NBS with traditional urban drainage systems were identified and assessed. Based on a comprehensive framework, for both wastewater and stormwater, the relevant opportunities for rethinking UDS and NBS were identified. Most relevant positive effects go beyond the mitigation of existing intrinsic constraints of traditional systems (e.g., dealing with the control of pollutants or stormwater management) since NBS also provide important economic, social, and environmental co-benefits by including water in urban planning and providing greener open spaces. This integrated and complementary solution not only represents a contribution to the sustainable management of urban water, but also enables an increase in the resilience of urban areas and, in particular, water services against climate change and for additional social co-benefits.","[Ramisio, Paulo J.] Univ Minho, Ctr Terr, Sch Engn, Dept Civil Engn, P-471005 Guimardes, Portugal; [Brito, Rita Salgado; Beceiro, Paula] Portuguese Natl Lab Civil Engn, Urban Drainage Unit, Dept Hydraul & Environm, P-1700111 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade do Minho,"Ramisio, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Ctr Terr, Sch Engn, Dept Civil Engn, P-471005 Guimardes, Portugal.",pramisio@civil.uminho.pt,"Ramisio, Paulo J./M-9213-2013","Ramisio, Paulo J./0000-0002-6439-0648",,,,,70,0,0,11,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2022,14,24,,,,,,,16906,10.3390/su142416906,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142416906,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,7G8ET,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000902750900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent studies show that this region is experiencing increasing trends in total precipitation and extreme precipitation events. To assess the impact of this and other possible climatic changes on the water supply, there is a need to develop future climate scenarios that can be used as input to hydrological and reservoir models. Recently, stochastic weather generators (SWGs) have been used in climate change adaptation studies because of their ability to produce synthetic weather time series. This study examines the performance of a set of SWGs with varying levels of complexity to simulate daily precipitation characteristics, with a focus on extreme events. To generate precipitation occurrence, three Markov chain models (first, second, and third orders) were evaluated in terms of simulating average and extreme wet days and dry/wet spell lengths. For precipitation magnitude, seven models were investigated, including five parametric distributions, one resampling technique, and a polynomial-based curve fitting technique. The methodology applied here to evaluate SWGs combines several different types of metrics that are not typically combined in a single analysis. It is found that the first-order Markov chain performs as well as higher orders for simulating precipitation occurrence, and two parametric distribution models (skewed normal and mixed exponential) are deemed best for simulating precipitation magnitudes. The specific models that were found to be most applicable to the region may be valuable in bottom-up vulnerability studies for the watershed, as well as for other nearby basins.","[Acharya, Nachiketa; Frei, Allan] CUNY, Inst Sustainable Cities, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Frei, Allan] CUNY Hunter Coll, Dept Geog, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Chen, Jie] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [DeCristofaro, Leslie] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Amherst, MA USA; [Owens, Emmet M.] New York City Dept Environm Protect, Water Qual Modeling Sect, Bur Water Supply, Kingston, NY USA; [Acharya, Nachiketa] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Palisades, NY USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY); Wuhan University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Columbia University,"Chen, J (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",jiechen@whu.edu.cn,"Acharya, Nachiketa/C-9756-2013",,"Bureau of Water Supply, New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP)","Bureau of Water Supply, New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP)","The study was conducted as part of the Climate Change Integrated Modeling Project sponsored by the Bureau of Water Supply, New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP).

For rural communities in fire-prone landscapes, current resilience strategies may prove insufficient in light of increasing wildfire risks due to climate change. It is argued that, given the complexity of climate change, adaptations are best addressed at local levels where specific social, cultural, political, and economic conditions are matched with local risks and opportunities. Despite the importance of social networks as key attributes of community resilience, research using social network analysis on coupled human and natural systems is scarce. Furthermore, the extent to which local communities in fire-prone areas understand climate change risks, accept the likelihood of potential changes, and have the capacity to develop collaborative mitigation strategies is underexamined, yet these factors are imperative to community resiliency. We apply a social network framework to examine information networks that affect perceptions of wildfire and climate change in Central Oregon. Data were collected using a mailed questionnaire. Analysis focused on the residents' information networks that are used to gain awareness of governmental activities and measures of community social capital. A two-mode network analysis was used to uncover information exchanges. Results suggest that the general public develops perceptions about climate change based on complex social and cultural systems rather than as patrons of scientific inquiry and understanding. It appears that perceptions about climate change itself may not be the limiting factor in these communities' adaptive capacity, but rather how they perceive local risks. We provide a novel methodological approach in understanding rural community adaptation and resilience in fire-prone landscapes and offer a framework for future studies.","[Jacobs, Derric B.; Cramer, Lori A.] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University,"Jacobs, DB (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",,,,National Science Foundation's Coupled Human and Natural Systems Program (NSF) [CHH-1013296]; USDA Forest Service PNW Research Station,National Science Foundation's Coupled Human and Natural Systems Program (NSF); USDA Forest Service PNW Research Station,This research was funded by the National Science Foundation's Coupled Human and Natural Systems Program (NSF Grant CHH-1013296) and the USDA Forest Service PNW Research Station.,,88,12,13,3,33,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

The homes, livelihoods, and cultures of these environmental justice (EJ) communities are threatened not only by climate disasters and ecological degradation, but also by adaptation projects proposed and backed by the state and federal governments and restoration nonprofit organizations. Drawing on 74 in-depth interviews, I analyze discourses from adaptation actors (government staff, scientists, engineers, and restoration advocates) and from coastal community leaders. Findings from the case study reveal how climate adaptation actors reference a socially constructed bigger picture to justify negative externalities of coastal projects while also undermining community concerns regarding their own survival. Findings also show how members of coastal communities discuss their survival, resist harmful narratives, and assert their indispensability. I conclude by connecting these themes to critical EJ research, particularly the racist underpinnings of utilitarian environmental decision making. This case study demonstrates the need to examine institutional actors' resistance to integrating justice into climate adaptation planning and action.","[Domingue, Simone Justine] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Geog & Environm Sustainabil, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Domingue, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Geog & Environm Sustainabil, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",simone.domingue@ou.edu,,,,,,,56,0,0,5,10,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1939-4071,1937-5174,,ENVIRON JUSTICE,Environ.

In some cases, an individual may be motivated by appeals that highlight benefits to others, rather than to oneself. We test whether such prosocial framing influences information-seeking behavior to address wildfire risk among homeowners. In a field experiment across ten communities in western Colorado, property owners (n = 2977) received a postcard from their local fire department highlighting the impact of risk mitigation to either your property (private benefits) or our community (social benefits). The postcard directed recipients to visit a personalized webpage on wildfire risk. Overall, 10.5% of property owners visited their personalized risk webpage. There was little difference in webpage visitation between those who received the social (11.3%) rather than the private (9.7%) benefits message (chi(2) = 1.74, p = 0.19). However, response may depend on a property owner's relationship to the community. Those who reside within the community (as opposed to out-of-town owners) or who were in an evacuation zone during a recent wildfire were more likely to visit their webpages after receiving the social benefits message. How homeowners view their contributions to shared risk and whether simple changes in messaging influence prosocial behavior can inform efforts to address climate-exacerbated hazards.","[Flint, Hilary Byerly; Brenkert-Smith, Hannah] Univ Colorado, Inst Behav Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Cada, Paul] Vail Fire & Emergency Serv, Vail, CO 81657 USA; [Champ, Patricia A.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Gomez, Jamie] West Reg Wildfire Council, Montrose, CO 81401 USA; [Margoles, Danny] Dolores Watershed Resilience Forest Collaborat, Cortez, CO 81321 USA; [Meldrum, James R.] US Geol Survey, Ft Collins Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Flint, Hilary Byerly] Univ Wyoming, Haub Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Laramie, WY 82072 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Wyoming,"Flint, HB (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Inst Behav Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Flint, HB (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Haub Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Laramie, WY 82072 USA.",hflint1@uwyo.edu,"Meldrum, James R./W-4994-2019","Meldrum, James R./0000-0001-5250-3759; Flint, Hilary/0000-0002-7445-2099",National Science Foundation (NSF) [SES-1823509]; United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station,National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea); United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station,"This research was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Grant SES-1823509, United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station, and the authors' organizations.",,78,0,0,5,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Green infrastructure (GI) in cities could reduce the UHI by regulating and reducing ambient temperatures. Forest cities (i.e., Melbourne, Australia) aimed for large-scale planting of trees to adapt to climate change in the next decade. Therefore, monitoring cities' green infrastructure requires close assessment of growth and water status at the tree-by-tree resolution for its proper maintenance and needs to be automated and efficient. This project proposed a novel monitoring system using an integrated visible and infrared thermal camera mounted on top of moving vehicles. Automated computer vision algorithms were used to analyze data gathered at an Elm trees avenue in the city of Melbourne, Australia (n = 172 trees) to obtain tree growth in the form of effective leaf area index (LAIe) and tree water stress index (TWSI), among other parameters. Results showed the tree-by-tree variation of trees monitored (5.04 km) between 2016-2017. The growth and water stress parameters obtained were mapped using customized codes and corresponded with weather trends and urban management. The proposed urban tree monitoring system could be a useful tool for city planning and GI monitoring, which can graphically show the diurnal, spatial, and temporal patterns of change of LAIe and TWSI to monitor the effects of climate change on the GI of cities.","[Fuentes, Sigfredo; Tongson, Eden; Gonzalez Viejo, Claudia] Sch Agr & Food, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Digital Agr Food & Wine Sci Grp, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",,"Fuentes, S (corresponding author), Sch Agr & Food, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Digital Agr Food & Wine Sci Grp, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",sfuentes@unimelb.edu.au; eden.tongson@unimelb.edu.au; cgonzalez2@unimelb.edu.au,"; Fuentes, Sigfredo/J-6238-2015","Gonzalez Viejo, Claudia/0000-0001-9207-9307; Fuentes, Sigfredo/0000-0002-0377-5085","Melbourne Network Society, University of Melbourne","Melbourne Network Society, University of Melbourne","This research was partially funded by the Melbourne Network Society, belonging to The University of Melbourne.",,63,5,5,3,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,JAN,2021,21,1,,,,,,,295,10.3390/s21010295,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21010295,,,16,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,PP8KZ,33406717,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000606106200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In parallel, all regions of the world are projected to urbanise further. Consequently, sustainable development challenges will be increasingly concentrated in cities. A resulting impact is the increment of expected urban flood risk in many areas around the globe. Adaptation to climate change is an opportunity to improve urban conditions through the implementation of green-blue infrastructures, which provide multiple benefits besides flood mitigation. However, this is not an easy task since urban drainage systems are complex structures. This work focuses on a method to analyse the trade-offs when different benefits are pursued in stormwater infrastructure planning. A hydrodynamic model was coupled with an evolutionary optimisation algorithm to evaluate different green-blue-grey measures combinations. This evaluation includes flood mitigation as well as the enhancement of co-benefits. We confirmed optimisation as a helpful decision-making tool to visualise trade-offs among flood management strategies. Our results show that considering co-benefits enhancement as an objective boosts the selection of green-blue infrastructure. However, flood mitigation effectiveness can be diminished when extra benefits are pursued. Finally, we proved that combining green-blue-grey measures is particularly important in urban spaces when several benefits are considered simultaneously. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

However, groundwater dynamics, such as groundwater recharge, cannot be measured directly and is influenced by spatially and temporally complex processes, models are therefore required to capture the dynamics and provide scientific advice for decision-making. This paper developed, estimated and compared the performance of linear regression, multi-layer perception (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models in predicting groundwater recharge. The experimental dataset consists of time series of annual recharge from the year 1970 to 2012, based on water table fluctuation estimates from 465 bores in the states of South Australia and Victoria, Australia. We identified the factors that influenced groundwater recharge and found that the correlation between rainfall and groundwater recharge was strongest. The linear regression model had the poorest fitting performance, with the root mean squared error (RMSE) being greater than 0.19 when various proportions of training data were considered. The MLP model outperformed the linear regression in the prediction capability, achieving RMSE = 0.11 when 80% of training data was considered. The LSTM model was found to have the best performance, whose root mean squared errors were less than 0.12 when various proportions of training data were applied.

In spite of this, to date, few studies have examined the impacts of climate change on agriculture and the adaptation strategies of vulnerable farmers from emerging semi-arid regions with dualist agriculture, in which subsistence farms coexist with commercial farms. This study aims to assess the micro-level impact of climate change and the farm household adaptation strategies in a semi-arid region in Central Chile. To this end, we develop a modelling framework that allows for (1) the assessment of farm-household responses to both climate change effects and adaptation policy scenarios and (2) the identification of local capacities and adaptation strategies. Aggregated results indicate that climate change has a substantial economic impact on regional agricultural income, while the micro-level analysis shows that small-scale farm households are the most vulnerable group. We observe that household characteristics determine to a large extent the adaptation capacity, while an unexpected result indicates that off-farm labour emerges as a powerful option for adapting to climate change. As such, our approach is well suited for ex ante micro-level adaptation analysis and can thereby provide useful insights to guide smart climate policy-making.","[Fernandez, Francisco J.; Blanco, Maria] Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSIAAB, Dept Agr Econ, Madrid, Spain; [Fernandez, Francisco J.] Univ Mayor, Fac Sci, Sch Agron, Santiago, Chile; [Ponce, Roberto D.; Vasquez-Lavin, Felipe] Univ Desarrollo CONICYT FONDAP, Sch Business & Econ, Concepcion 15130015, Chile; [Vasquez-Lavin, Felipe] CESIEP, Millennium Nucleus Ctr Socioecon Impact Environm, Santiago, Chile; [Roco, Lisandro] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Econ, Av Angamos 610, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile; [Roco, Lisandro] Univ Catolica Norte, Inst Appl Reg Econ IDEAR, Av Angamos 610, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidad Mayor; Universidad Catolica del Norte; Universidad Catolica del Norte,"Fernandez, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSIAAB, Dept Agr Econ, Madrid, Spain.",francisco.fernandez@umayor.cl; maria.blanco@upm.es; robertoponce@udd.cl; fvasquez@udd.cl; lisandro.roco@ucn.cl,"Oliva, Roberto D.

Promoting adaptation interventions at local scale is unlikely to be effective without understanding farmers' views on climate change. Our study analyzes climate change perceptions and responses by maize-dependent smallholders in Ethiopia. Household-level data on farmers' climate change perceptions and adaptation strategies were collected. In addition, meteorological data were obtained from local weather stations for the period 1985-2015. Descriptive statistics, standard rainfall anomalies, thematic content methods and binary logistic models were used to analyze the relationship between climate change perceptions and adaptations. Findings show that nearly all farmers perceived climate change through increased hot and warm days and nights as well as decreased precipitation volumes. Results indicate that farmers perceive shortened seasonal rainfall duration in terms of both late start and early end. Farmers employ a range of strategies, notably cropping date adjustment, improved crop variety use, crop diversification, agroforestry practices and seasonal migration to adapt to climate change. Farmers' adaptation decisions were mainly associated with their climate change perceptions as well as socio-economic factors such as education level and farm experience. It is, therefore, suggested that recognizing farmers' knowledge and experience on climate change would help develop context-specific, flexible adaptation strategies that better build resilience capacity.","[Bedeke, Sisay B.; Vanhove, Wouter; Van Damme, Patrick] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Lab Trop & Subtrop Agr & Ethnobot, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Wordofa, Muluken G.] Univ Pavia, Ctr Int Cooperat & Dev, Str Nuova 65, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Natarajan, Kolandavel] Wolaita Sodo Univ, Coll Agr, Wolaita Sodo 138, Ethiopia; [Van Damme, Patrick] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Trop AgriSci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Ghent University; University of Pavia; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Bedeke, SB (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Lab Trop & Subtrop Agr & Ethnobot, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",belaysisay@gmail.com,", Patrick/AAI-8779-2020; Van Damme, Patrick/H-6693-2018; Wordofa, Muluken Gezahegn/N-6082-2019","Van Damme, Patrick/0000-0002-2548-633X; Wordofa, Muluken Gezahegn/0000-0002-5143-180X; Vanhove, Wouter/0000-0002-1697-2475; Bedeke, Sisay Belay/0000-0001-9452-6895","Ghent University (Special Research Fund, BOF); International Foundation for Science [01W00514, 5664]","Ghent University (Special Research Fund, BOF)(Ghent University); International Foundation for Science(International Foundation for Science)","The authors thank all farmers who participated in this study through answering questions.

Climate change will challenge the current water resources management practices and threaten water security through acceleration of the hydrological cycle. Historical variation of recorded runoff on main streams and influence of climate change on water resources in the Huang-huai-hai area (including the Yellow River, Hai River, and the Huai River) were analyzed with statistical methods and a hydrological simulation approach. Results indicate that the recorded runoff showed a significant decreasing trend during past 50 years for the Hai River and the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, with insignificant change occurring in the Huai River basin and the upstream of the Yellow River basin. Temperature was projected to steadily rise in the next 30-50 years while precipitation was expected to increase slightly. Water resources in 2021-2050 under the three scenarios of RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 were estimated to change -1.3%, 1.0% and -2.3% relative to the reference period of 1961-1990, respectively. The water shortage for the Huang-huai- hai area might be aggravated due to climate change. It is therefore of significance to enhance water saving construction, make full use of non- traditional water sources, and speed up water conservancy project planning and implementation for adaptation to climate change.

Specifically, the development of the Online Synthesis System for Sustainability and Resilience, which integrates different disciplines, and the fostering of Facilitators, whose role is to interlink the science community and society, were implemented in a co-designing manner by the collective governance body. The development of basin- and barangay-scale hydrological models realized real-time flood forecasting and climate change impact assessment to identify intensified flood risk under the future climate. Co-designed e-learning workshops were held to foster about thirty Facilitators and help them produce twenty-one risk communication plans and workshop designs for fourteen barangays considering geographic, demographic, economic, and social features that they can utilize for public dissemination related to climate change adaptation to the target audiences in society.

Increasing temporal plant diversity through crop rotation diversification increases yields of some crops under drought, but its potential to enhance crop drought resistance and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We conducted a drought manipulation experiment using rainout shelters embedded within a 36-year crop rotation diversity and no-till experiment in a temperate climate and measured a suite of soil and crop developmental and eco-physiological traits in the field and laboratory. We show that diversifying maize-soybean rotations with small grain cereals and cover crops mitigated maize water stress at the leaf and canopy scales and reduced yield losses to drought by 17.1 +/- 6.1%, while no-till did not affect maize drought resistance. Path analysis showed a strong correlation between soil organic matter and lower maize water stress despite no significant differences in soil organic matter between rotations or tillage treatments. This positive relationship between soil organic matter and maize water status was not mediated by higher soil water retention or infiltration as often hypothesized, nor differential depth of root water uptake as measured with stable isotopes, suggesting that other mechanisms are at play. Crop rotation diversification is an underappreciated drought management tool to adapt crop production to climate change through managing for soil organic matter.","[Renwick, Leah L.

Therefore, the current study aimed at socio-cognitive perceptions and extended protection motivation theory (PMT) as the basis. This paper estimated the influence of cognitive factors on individuals & apos; views and decisions regarding climate change adaptation. Data from this study came from a survey with 245 rural farmers in temperate mount areas of Fars province, Iran. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to estimate the different factors. Results showed that three core elements of the theory, namely, risk evaluation, adaptation evaluation, and maladaptation, were the statistically significant factors that could directly explain farmers & apos; adaptation decisions to adopt appropriate coping strategies under changing climate. Findings also suggested that another structural factor, adaptation incentives, had a statistically significant influence on adaptation decision-making among farmers. The study proposed valuable insights on social discourse to promote adaptation. Findings strongly offered that social discourse should focus more strongly on confirming the truth and timeliness of information that individuals gained. Eventually, further investigations are necessary to conduct the measurement model in other cultures and geographical areas and see how socio-environmental components can influence risk evaluation and adaptation evaluation.","[Ghazali, Samane] Shiraz Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Shiraz, Iran; [Azadi, Hossein; Witlox, Frank] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Ghent, Belgium; [Azadi, Hossein; Kurban, Alishir] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, 818 South Beijing Rd, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Azadi, Hossein] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Kurban, Alishir] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecol & Environm Cent Asia, 818 South Beijing Rd, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Kurban, Alishir] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Kurban, Alishir] Sinobelgian Joint Lab Geoinformat, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Ajtai, Nicolae] Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Environm Sci & Engn, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Pietrzykowski, Marcin] Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Forest Ecol & Silviculture, Krakow, Poland; [Witlox, Frank] Univ Tartu, Dept Geog, Tartu, Estonia; [Witlox, Frank] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Civil Aviat, Nanjing, Peoples R China","Shiraz University; Ghent University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xinjiang Institute of Ecology & Geography, CAS; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Agricultural University Krakow; University of Tartu; Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics","Azadi, H (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Ghent, Belgium.;Azadi, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, 818 South Beijing Rd, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.;Azadi, H (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Prague, Czech Republic.",hossein.azadi@ugent.be,"Azadi, Hossein/E-2361-2011; Witlox, Frank/A-5143-2008; Ajtai, Nicolae/B-9453-2012; Kurban, Alishir/AGK-9193-2022","Azadi, Hossein/0000-0002-5108-1993; Witlox, Frank/0000-0002-8966-6823; Ajtai, Nicolae/0000-0002-2042-1967; Kurban, Alishir/0000-0001-9387-8127",Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20060303]; Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI) [2021VCA0004],Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI),This research paper was partly funded by the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA20060303) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI grant no. 2021VCA0004).,,63,0,0,5,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Correspondingly, the present study implements a generative approach to link urban physical density to performative urban design to investigate the environmental impacts of urban morphology. This approach could be beneficial to implement performance-based planning (PBP), as a method for climate change adaptation and environmental resilience, to improve citizens' wellbeing. Selected performance measures for this study are: nocturnal Urban Heat Island effect, outdoor solar access (for winter and summer) and indoor daylight availability. The results are analyzed based on the mathematical correlations between building form factors and environmental qualifies, within varying range of generated building densities. The study shows that, in the case of buildings with square foot print, maximum potential UHI is highly dependent on height of the urban canyon and optimum outdoor solar access during summer is achievable with intermediate canyon width. Daylight variations mainly depend on window to wall ratio (WWR). In addition, with high WWR values (0.7), canyon height and building geometry sequentially have the highest influence on indoor daylight availability.","[Chokhachian, Ata; Auer, Thomas] Tech Univ Munich, Fac Architecture, Chair Bldg Technol & Climate Respons Design, Munich, Germany; [Perini, Katia; Giulini, Saverio] Univ Genoa, Architecture & Design Dept, Genoa, Italy",Technical University of Munich; University of Genoa,"Chokhachian, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Fac Architecture, Chair Bldg Technol & Climate Respons Design, Munich, Germany.",ata.chokhachian@tum.de,"Perini, Katia/AAI-5414-2021; Chokhachian, Ata/I-9073-2017","Perini, Katia/0000-0003-0415-8246; Chokhachian, Ata/0000-0002-2543-6893; Auer, Thomas/0000-0001-7682-0652",,,,,44,26,26,8,57,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

However, many coastal hazard mitigation plans do not consider sea level rise when assessing storm surge risk. Here we apply a GIS-based approach to quantify potential changes in storm surge risk due to sea level rise on Long Island, New York. We demonstrate a method for combining hazard exposure and community vulnerability to spatially characterize risk for both present and future sea level conditions using commonly available national data sets. Our results show that sea level rise will likely increase risk in many coastal areas and will potentially create risk where it was not before. We find that even modest and probable sea level rise (.5 m by 2080) vastly increases the numbers of people (47% increase) and property loss (73% increase) impacted by storm surge. In addition, the resulting maps of hazard exposure and community vulnerability provide a clear and useful example of the visual representation of the spatial distribution of the components of risk that can be helpful for developing targeted hazard mitigation and climate change adaptation strategies.

One of the main drivers of adaptation is climate change, caused primarily by man-made greenhouse gases. Climate change is impacting on urban areas largely through drought, flooding from extreme precipitation, and heat stress. Climate change not only threatens the building stock, but also the quality of life of people living and working in urban environments. In the Netherlands, housing associations have strong interests in and responsibilities for managing the social housing stock and maintaining quality of life, but they seem scarcely aware of the challenge that lies ahead in terms of adapting their stock to the impacts of climate change. This paper focuses on physical adaptations to the housing stock and discusses the likelihood of the adoption of five implementation strategies for climate adaptation measures as assessed by decision-makers in Dutch housing associations in an online survey. The strategies combine conceptual approaches in policymaking, involvement of external players, and the execution of construction projects in a partnering approach, with the addition of one extra strategy that assigns a central position to the tenants. There was no strategy that stood out clearly as the one most likely to guide the implementation of measures. Many housing associations do, however, see opportunities in this area and might be persuaded to take action if they were provided with a wide palette of implementation strategies from which they could select the most suitable combination.

As a result, the onus of responding to climate change impacts through planning policies and practice falls on local government decision-makers. This qualitative study, based in Charlottetown, Canada, utilizes the framework of resilience theory to examine the relationship between systems, agents, and institutions in addressing climate vulnerability to build community resilience. Findings suggest that while non-municipal agents such as senior orders of government and external organizations are championing proactive adaptation through climate impact research and adaptation initiatives, the municipality has taken a non-urgent, reactionary approach in the face of climate stressors, often implementing initiatives that further exacerbate climate vulnerability. In the face of system vulnerabilities and cascading failures, deep institutional barriers, influencing and influenced by agents, contribute to the low prioritization of climate adaptation action. Institutional and agent-induced constraints at the municipal scale have led to the lack of internal initiative to act within the municipality, undermining the efforts of external organizations and senior orders of government. This study highlights the importance of robust local government agents and institutions as a prerequisite to enable local-scale climate adaptation.","[Birchall, S.

Therefore, local governments are increasingly establishing local climate adaptation networks through which collective knowledge and action can be developed. We aim to understand how these networks can initiate institutional change that enables a climate-proof city. To this end, we theorize that boundary objects - either conceptual or material artifacts - that allow different groups to work together without consensus are important instruments of institutional work strategies that aim to change or disrupt established institutional structures. Our case study of Amsterdam Rainproof in the Netherlands, a frontrunner in urban climate networks, shows that shared concepts and models developed in city networks seem to primarily contribute to capacity building (generating interdisciplinary knowledge about a climate-proof city), agenda-setting (underscoring the urgency of climate adaptation), and the creation of new normative identities (climate adaptation as the joint responsibility of urban actors). Accordingly, boundary objects in the case study transform the cultural-cognitive and normative pillars of institutions, while the regulative pillar (enforcement and sanctioning) is more difficult to change. Altogether, our case study analysis suggests that local climate adaptation networks might not result in a climate-proof city in the short term but can provide a better breeding ground for climate-proofing cities in the long run.","[Willems, Jannes J.; Giezen, Mendel] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Willems, Jannes J.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Social & Behav Sci, Dept Publ Adm & Sociol, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Willems, Jannes J.] POB 15629, NL-1001 NC Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Willems, JJ (corresponding author), POB 15629, NL-1001 NC Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.j.willems@uva.nl,,,Dutch Research Council [438.19.152],Dutch Research Council,This work was supported by the Dutch Research Council [grant number 438.19.152] .,,47,0,0,3,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,JUL,2022,44,,,,,,,,101222,10.1016/j.uclim.2022.101222,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2022.101222,,JUN 2022,13,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,2Z2XZ,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000826447900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Promoting public engagement in water conservation, especially among young people since they will be leading decision making in the near future, is one effective strategy for adapting to the changing climate. This research presented a water footprint adaptation (WF) approach which attempted to link climate adaptation and capacity development with saving water strategy. The approach was tested in cooperation with two universities in Shaanxi province aiming to develop a starting point for WF evaluation and develop an improvement response. The results showed that the college students in our samples reduced their direct and indirect water footprints by 27.39% and 6.50%, respectively, in the post-intervention phase. The evaluation of the improvements proved that the WF approach to be efficient, the awareness of the college students on the matter could be increased. Additionally, the findings of the research indicated that the college students became change agent, expressing the desire to act as multipliers and to help the movement and spread of important knowledge about methods for alleviating water stress and about vulnerability to the changing climate. As expected, the awareness of water scarcity and perceptions of climate change had statistically significant effects on the water footprints, which was consistent with our hypothesis. Our approach helped participants develop capacity by revealing the linkage between their local level actions and the various aspects of adaptation to changing climate at the global level. This strategy will provide a comparative basis for water policy makers to adopt appropriate strategies to address matters related to water shortages and finally enhance sustainable adaptation to changing context.","[Mu, Lan; Liu, Yuhong; Wang, Chencheng] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Northwest Inst Hist Environm & Socioecon Dev, 620,West Changan Ave, Xian 710119, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Qu, Xiaojuan] Shaanxi Radio & TV Univ, Xian 710062, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Yu, Yaochuang] Baoji Univ Arts & Sci, Key Lab Disaster Monitoring & Mech Simulating Sha, Coll Geog & Environm, Baoji 721013, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Shaanxi Normal University; Baoji University of Arts & Sciences,"Mu, L (corresponding author), Shaanxi Normal Univ, Northwest Inst Hist Environm & Socioecon Dev, 620,West Changan Ave, Xian 710119, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",mulan820706@snnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [42001221]; funded Projects for the Academic Leaders and Academic Backbones, Shaanxi Normal University, China [18QNGG011]; National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFD1100901]; Shaanxi Social Science Fund [2019E007, 2018D29]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); funded Projects for the Academic Leaders and Academic Backbones, Shaanxi Normal University, China; National Key R&D Program of China; Shaanxi Social Science Fund","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42001221); the funded Projects for the Academic Leaders and Academic Backbones, Shaanxi Normal University, China (18QNGG011); the National Key R&D Program of China (2019YFD1100901); Shaanxi Social Science Fund (2018D29); and Shaanxi Social Science Fund (2019E007).",,56,0,0,6,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

This is reflected in the growing literature on climate change and the imperative for action including building resilience in our socio-ecological systems. Despite the large body of research that now exists, few studies have considered the resilience of informal rural or peri-urban settlements in mountainous regions. This article considered the resilience of two rural settlements in mountainous areas, namely Konso, Ethiopia, and QwaQwa, South Africa, to the influences of climate change based on the assets available to them. The authors obtained the local communities' perception of their risks throsugh interviews with community leaders and a survey of 384 residents, divided equally between each settlement. Furthermore, the resilience of each community was assessed on the basis of their environmental, social, economic, human, institutional and physical capitals using a climate change resilience indicator. The findings showed that both communities faced major challenges because of climate change, particularly from drought and poverty. We found that both communities retained some forms of indigenous knowledge, but its greater application in Konso appeared to improve resilience to a greater extent than QwaQwa, where it played a lesser role and the community was more dependent on the government. However, indigenous knowledge alone is not sufficient to support these communities in the long term, given the growing aridity of the regions, and other approaches are also necessary, including government support, to enhance and grow their capitals.","[Melore, Tamirat W.; Nel, Verna] Univ Free State, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of the Free State,"Nel, V (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Bloemfontein, South Africa.",nelvj@ufs.ac.za,,,,,,,53,8,8,1,11,AFRICAN CENTRE DISASTER STUDIES,POTCHEFSTROOM,"INTERNAL BOX 265, NORTH-WEST UNIV, PRIVATE BAG X6001, POTCHEFSTROOM, 2520, SOUTH AFRICA",1996-1421,2072-845X,,JAMBA-J DISASTER RIS,Jamba-J.

Tree planting is one of the measures promoted by development programs to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Tree planting is also believed to positively contribute to livelihoods. This paper examines factors influencing smallholders' tree planting activities in four villages in the Ziro province, Southern Burkina Faso. Furthermore, it analyses the challenges encountered and willingness to continue tree planting under current tenure arrangements. The data was obtained through key informants, household interviews, focus group discussions, and field observations. Results indicate that the majority of farmers interviewed planted Mangifera indica (50%), Anacardium occidentale (32%) and Moringa oleifera (30%). In a number of trees planted, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Mangifera indica and Anacardium occidentale dominated. Tree planters were mainly farmers who held large and old farm areas, were literate and relatively wealthy, had favorable attitudes toward tree planting, and with considerable years of participation in a farmers' group. The main reasons for planting trees included income generation from the sale of tree products, access to markets and local support for tree planting. Preference for agriculture, tenure insecurity and lack of sufficient land were the main reasons cited for not planting trees. Farm households that were relatively poor, had smaller workforces and smaller farm sizes were not willing to continue tree planting. To effectively engage farmers in tree planting and to make it more attractive, policies are needed that address tenure insecurity for migrants, enable better access to markets, and support fair pricing structures for wood and other tree resources.","[Etongo, Daniel; Kanninen, Markku; Fobissie, Kalame] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Viikki Trop Resources Inst, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Djenontin, Ida Nadia S.] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR West Africa Reg Off WA, Ouagadougou 06, Burkina Faso",University of Helsinki,"Etongo, D (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Viikki Trop Resources Inst, Latokartanonkaari 7,POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",daniel.etongobau@helsinki.fi; I.Djenontin@cgiar.org; markku.kanninen@helsinki.fi; fobissie.kalame@helsinki.fi,"Djenontin, Ida Nadia Sedjro/AAZ-1473-2021; Kanninen, Markku/AAW-9606-2021; Djenontin, Ida Nadia Sedjro/GXN-1573-2022; Kanninen, Markku T/S-7684-2016","Djenontin, Ida Nadia Sedjro/0000-0003-0991-5701; Kanninen, Markku/0000-0002-5708-9443; Djenontin, Ida Nadia Sedjro/0000-0003-0991-5701; Kanninen, Markku T/0000-0002-5708-9443",Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs; International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO),Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs; International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO),We thank WP3 (National Policies and Capacity Strengthening) of the Building Biocarbon and Rural Development in West Africa (BIODEV) Project funded by the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs and also to the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) for providing funding for this research.

Climate sensitivity depends on the initial climate state, but potentially can be accurately inferred from precise palaeoclimate data. Pleistocene climate oscillations yield a fast-feedback climate sensitivity of 3 +/- 1 degrees C for a 4 W m(-2) CO2 forcing if Holocene warming relative to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is used as calibration, but the error (uncertainty) is substantial and partly subjective because of poorly defined LGM global temperature and possible human influences in the Holocene. Glacial-to-interglacial climate change leading to the prior (Eemian) interglacial is less ambiguous and implies a sensitivity in the upper part of the above range, i.e. 3-4 degrees C for a 4 W m(-2) CO2 forcing. Slow feedbacks, especially change of ice sheet size and atmospheric CO2, amplify the total Earth system sensitivity by an amount that depends on the time scale considered. Ice sheet response time is poorly defined, but we show that the slow response and hysteresis in prevailing ice sheet models are exaggerated. We use a global model, simplified to essential processes, to investigate state dependence of climate sensitivity, finding an increased sensitivity towards warmer climates, as low cloud cover is diminished and increased water vapour elevates the tropopause. Burning all fossil fuels, we conclude, would make most of the planet uninhabitable by humans, thus calling into question strategies that emphasize adaptation to climate change.","[Hansen, James; Sato, Makiko; Kharecha, Pushker] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Russell, Gary; Kharecha, Pushker] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Hansen, J (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jimehansen@gmail.com,,,,,,,137,262,264,16,166,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1364-503X,1471-2962,,PHILOS T R SOC A,Philos.

Despite this situation, a comprehensive overview of the distribution and condition of wetlands across Australia is not available. Regional analyses exist and several exemplary mapping and monitoring exercises have been maintained to complement the more general information sets. It is expected that global climate change will exacerbate the pressures on inland wetlands, while sea level rises will adversely affect coastal wetlands. It is also expected that the exacerbation of these pressures will increase the potential for near-irreversible changes in the ecological state of some wetlands. Concerted institutional responses to such pressures have in the past proven difficult to sustain, although there is some evidence that a more balanced approach to water use and agriculture is being developed with the provision of increasing funds to purchase water for environmental flows being one example. We identify examples from around Australia that illustrate the impacts on wetlands of long-term climate change from palaeoecological records (south-eastern Australia); water allocation (Murray-Darling Basin); dryland salinisation (south-western Australia); and coastal salinisation (northern Australia). These are provided to illustrate both the extent of change in wetlands and the complexity of differentiating the specific effects of climate change.

Although the impact of climate change on dysentery is being studied in specific areas, a study in Iran is lacking. In this study, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios were used to predict the prevalence of dysentery in Iran between 2050 and 2070. This study is a secondary analysis using Geographically Weighted Regression, and 273 cities of Iran were analyzed between March 2011 and March 2017. Bioclimate variables were used as independent variables. Ecological data about the prevalence and incidence of dysentery, which were collected between 2011 and 2017, were used as the dependent variables. The result shows the incidence of dysentery is significantly associated with bioclimate change exposure, in 2050 and 2070, based on RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Our findings showed that in the absence of adaptation of the population, an increase in the risk of bioclimate-related diseases is expected by around 95.6% in the mid-century compared with the beginning of the century with regional variations. Based on these findings, the geographical distribution of the disease will also change. In 2050, the pattern of disease distribution would be changed, and the north of Iran will be included in the vulnerable regions. In 2070, the southeastern and northern parts of Iran will have the most vulnerability to climate change. Our study contributes important knowledge to this perspective by providing insightful findings and pieces of evidence for climate change adaptation and mitigation.","[Bahrami, Giti] Alborz Univ Med Sci, Social Determinants Hlth Res Ctr, Karaj 3149779453, Iran; [Sajadi, Homeira] Univ Social Welf & Rehabil Sci, Dept Social Welf Management, Tehran 1985713834, Iran; [Rafiee, Hassan] Univ Social Welf & Rehabil Sci, Social Welf Management Res Ctr, Tehran 1985713834, Iran; [Norouzi, Mehdi] Univ Social Welf & Rehabil Sci, Social Determinants Hlth Res Ctr, Tehran 1985713834, Iran; [Shakiba, Alireza] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Earth Sci, Ctr Remote Sensing & GIS Res, Tehran 1983969411, Iran",Shahid Beheshti University,"Shakiba, A (corresponding author), Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Earth Sci, Ctr Remote Sensing & GIS Res, Tehran 1983969411, Iran.",bahramigiti@gmail.com; ho.sajjadi@uswr.ac.ir; hassan441015@gmail.com; noroozimehdia04@gmail.com; mypauk28@gmail.com,,"Shakiba, Alireza/0000-0003-1977-3372",,,,,43,0,0,2,2,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2345-7481,2345-752X,,CHIN J URBAN ENV STU,Chin.

While the value of involving communities in risk management is increasingly accepted, the development of appropriate tools to support community engagement in flood risk management projects remains nascent. Using the Revitalising Informal Settlements and their Environments Program as a case study, the article interrogates the potential of citizen science to include disadvantaged urban communities in project-level flood risk reduction planning processes. This project collected more than 5,000 photos taken by 26 community members living in 13 informal settlements in Fiji and Indonesia between 2018 and 2020. The case study documents the method used as well as the results achieved within this two-year project. It discusses the method developed and implemented, outlines the main results, and provides lessons learned for others embarking on citizen science environmental-monitoring projects. The case study indicates that the engagement model and the technology used were key to the success of the flood-monitoring project. The experiences with the practice of monitoring floods in collaboration with communities in Fiji and Indonesia provide insights into how similar projects could advance more participatory risk management practices. The article identifies how this kind of approach can collect valuable flood data while also promoting opportunities for local communities to be heard in the arena of risk reduction and climate change adaptation.","[Wolff, Erich; Ramirez-Lovering, Diego] Monash Univ, Fac Art Design & Architecture, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [French, Matthew] Monash Univ, Monash Sustainable Dev Inst, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Ilhamsyah, Noor] Revitalising Informal Settlements & Their Environ, Bandung, Indonesia; [Sawailau, Mere Jane] Revitalising Informal Settlements & Their Environ, Suva, Fiji",Monash University; Monash University,"Wolff, E (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Fac Art Design & Architecture, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",erich.wolff@monash.edu; matthew.french@monash.edu; noorilhamsyah.rise@gmail.com; merejane.sawailau@livelearn.org; diego.ramirez@monash.edu,"Wolff, Erich/GOE-4190-2022","Wolff, Erich/0000-0001-7420-3546",Wellcome Trust (OPOH) [205222/Z/16/Z]; New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Asian Development Bank; Government of Fiji; City of Makassar; Monash University,Wellcome Trust (OPOH)(Wellcome Trust); New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade(Australian Government); Asian Development Bank; Government of Fiji; City of Makassar; Monash University(Monash University),"The authors acknowledge the contributions of the colleagues within the RISE consortium, particularly the researchers and staff members involved in the flood-monitoring project in Fiji and Indonesia, including Isoa Vakarewa, Alex Wilson, Mosese Walesi, and Intan Putri, without which the flood-monitoring program here discussed would not have been possible.

Here, we explore current trends in crop modelling related to these grand challenges by reflecting on research presented at the Second International Crop Modelling Symposium (iCropM2020). A keyword search in the book of abstracts of the symposium revealed a strong focus on 'climate change', 'adaptation' and 'impact assessment' and much less on 'food security' or 'policy'. Most research focused on field-level investigations and far fewer on farm(ing) systems levels - the levels at which management decisions are made by farmers. Experimentation is key to development and testing of crop models, yet the term 'simulation' outweighed by far the terms 'experiments' and 'trials', and few contributions dealt with model improvement. Cereals are intensively researched, whereas roots, tubers and tropical perennials are under-researched. Little attention is paid to nutrient limitations apart from nitrogen or to pests and diseases. The aforementioned aspects represent opportunities for future research where crop models can help in devising hypotheses and driving new experimentation. We must also ensure that crop models are fit for their intended purposes, especially if they are to provide advice to policymakers. The latter, together with cross-scale and interdisciplinary efforts with direct engagement of stakeholders are needed to address the grand challenges faced by food and agricultural systems in the next century.","[Silva, Joao Vasco; Giller, Ken E.] Wageningen Univ, Plant Prod Syst, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Silva, Joao Vasco] CIMMYT Zimbabwe, Sustainable Intensificat Program, Harare, Zimbabwe",Wageningen University & Research,"Silva, JV (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Plant Prod Syst, Wageningen, Netherlands.;Silva, JV (corresponding author), CIMMYT Zimbabwe, Sustainable Intensificat Program, Harare, Zimbabwe.",j.silva@cgiar.org,"Giller, Ken E/K-2799-2012","Giller, Ken E/0000-0002-5998-4652; Silva, Joao Vasco/0000-0002-3019-5895",,,,,107,16,16,6,22,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0021-8596,1469-5146,,J AGR SCI-CAMBRIDGE,J.

This study evaluates the impact of climate change on streamflow in South Korea using downscaled climate change information based on the global climate model (GCM) and hydrological simulation program-FORTRAN model. Representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios 4.5 and 8.5 W/m(2)were employed in this study. During the distant future (2071-2099), the flow increased by 15.11% and 24.40% for RCP scenarios 4.5 and 8.5 W/m(2), respectively. The flow is highly dependent on precipitation and evapotranspiration. Both precipitation and evapotranspiration increased, but the relative change of precipitation was greater than the relative change of evapotranspiration. For this reason, the flow would show a significant increase. Additionally, for RCP 8.5 W/m(2), the variability of the flow according to the GCM also increased because the variability of precipitation increased. Moreover, for RCP 8.5 W/m(2), the summer and autumn flow increased significantly, and the winter flow decreased in both scenarios. The variability in autumn and winter was so great that the occurrence of extreme flow could intensify further. These projections indicated the possibility of future flooding and drought in summer and winter. Regionally, the flow was expected to show a significant increase in the southeastern region. The findings presented for South Korea could be used as primary data in establishing national climate change adaptation measures.","[Park, Jihoon] APEC Climate Ctr, Climate Serv & Res Div, Predict Res Dept, Busan 48058, South Korea; [Jung, Euntae] Dong A Univ, Civil Engn, Busan 49315, South Korea; [Jung, Imgook] APEC Climate Ctr, Climate Serv & Res Div, Climate Predict Dept, Busan 48058, South Korea; [Cho, Jaepil] Integrated Watershed Management Inst, Convergence Ctr Watershed Management, Suwon 16489, South Korea",Dong A University,"Jung, ET (corresponding author), Dong A Univ, Civil Engn, Busan 49315, South Korea.",gtjihoon@gmail.com; etjung@donga.ac.kr; igjung@apcc21.org; jpcho89@gmail.com,,"Park, Jihoon/0000-0003-4150-2886",APEC Climate Center,APEC Climate Center,The APC was funded by the APEC Climate Center.,,28,5,5,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUL,2020,12,7,,,,,,,1884,10.3390/w12071884,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12071884,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,MV7DM,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000556513700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is the first temporal climate change analogue study to use higher resolution daily performance data at the individual ski area scale, including reported snow quality, ski lift operations, slope openings, and water usage for snowmaking. The record warm winter of 2011-2012 in the Ontario ski tourism market (Eastern Canada) is representative of projected future average winter conditions under a mid-century, high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (RCP 8.5), which was compared to the 2010-2011 season which was climatically normal (for the 1981-2010 period). Supply-side impacts across the 17 ski areas during the analogue winter included a total average decrease in the ski season length (-17% days), operating ski lifts (-3%), skiable terrain (-9%), reduced snow quality (e.g., -46% days with packed powder), snowmaking days (-18%), and an increase in water usage for snowmaking (e.g., +300% in December). Demand-side impacts include a 10% decrease in overall skier visits, with a resort size-correlation (small -20%, intermediate -14%, large -8%). With reduced operational ski terrain and more frequent marginal snow conditions, visitor experience is adversely affected more frequently. Collectively, these findings identify differential impacts in the ski tourism market and can assist ski area managers, communities, investors and governments with developing climate change adaptation plans.

This paper focuses on one particular resource of utmost necessity and vulnerability to climate change: namely, the provisioning of safe drinking water. From a critical perspective on the role of expertise in risk debates, this paper looks at how Swedish experts understand risk to drinking water in a climate change scenario and how they reason about challenges to risk management and adaptation strategies. The empirical material derives from ten in-depth semi-structured interviews with experts, employed both at government agencies and at universities, and with disciplinary backgrounds in a variety of fields (water engineering, planning, geology and environmental chemistry). The experts understand risk factors affecting both drinking water quality and availability as complex and systemically interrelated. A lack of political saliency of drinking water as a public service is identified as an obstacle to the development of robust adaptation strategies. Another area of concern relates to the geographical, organizational and institutional boundaries (regulatory, political and epistemological) between the plethora of public actors with partly overlapping and sometimes unclear responsibilities for the provisioning of safe drinking water. The study concludes that climate change adaptation regarding drinking water provisioning will require a new integration of the knowledge of systemic risk relations, in combination with more efficient agency collaboration based on a clear demarcation of responsibility between actors.

The high-resolution (30 x 30?m grid cells) probability model for the southern Yukon and northern British Columbia presented in this paper (regional model) is a combination of seven local empirical-statistical models, each developed from basal temperature of snow measurements in winter and ground-truthing of frozen-ground presence in summer. The models were blended using a distance-decay power approach to generate a map of permafrost probability over an area of almost 500 000?km2 between 59 degrees N and 65 degrees N. The result is broadly similar to previous permafrost maps with an average permafrost probability of 58 per cent for the region as a whole. There are notable differences in detail, however, because the main predictive variable used in the local models is equivalent elevation, which incorporates the effects of gentle or inverted surface lapse rates in the forest zone. Most of the region shows permafrost distribution patterns that are non-linear, resembling those from continental areas such as Mongolia. Only the southwestern area shows a similar mountain permafrost distribution to that in the European Alps with a well-defined lower limit and a linear increase in probability with elevation. The results of the modelling can be presented on paper using traditional classifications into permafrost zones but given the level of detail, they will be more useful as an interactive online map.

Ecosystem services analysis can provide quantifiable goals for urban ecological regeneration that are determined by the site-specific ecology and climate of an urban area. In this research, the ecosystem service of habitat provision is the key focus. The role of urban green space and urban forests is crucial within this. Setting ambitious targets for urban ecological performance and ecosystem services provision is of great importance due to the large negative environmental impact that cities currently have on ecosystems and, therefore, ecosystem service provision, and because healthier ecosystems enable humans to better adapt to climate change through creating potentials for increased resilience. A comparative case study analysing the ecosystem service of habitat provision in two existing urban environments with similar climates (Cfb according to the Koppen Climate Classification System) but in different parts of the world, namely Wellington, New Zealand and Curitiba, Brazil, was conducted to examine how the ecosystem services analysis concept can used to devise urban habitat provision goals. The paper concludes that, although achieving habitat provision goals derived from ecosystem services analysis in urban areas is likely to be difficult, determining quantitative site- and climate-specific staged goals could enable urban design professionals to increase the effectiveness of conservation and regeneration efforts in terms of ecosystem service provision from urban green and blue spaces.","[Zari, Maibritt Pedersen] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Architecture, Wellington 6011, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"Zari, MP (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Architecture, Wellington 6011, New Zealand.",maibritt.pedersen@vuw.ac.nz,,"Pedersen Zari, Maibritt/0000-0003-4664-7558",,,,,59,6,6,7,37,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,MAY,2019,10,5,,,,,,,391,10.3390/f10050391,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f10050391,,,17,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Forestry,IN6TS,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000478814700030,View Full Record in Web of Science

The fragile environment and the presence of nature-based livelihoods and indigenous communities pose challenges for mining development. Mining operations should be optimized so that the profitability is maintained in changing market conditions and to meet increasing societal and environmental demands. In this study we present the current understanding on the interplay between mining and the surrounding socio-ecological systems in the Arctic region. The existing academic literature on the Arctic region was reviewed, covering 127 peer-reviewed publications since 2000. We investigated the mining activities from four perspectives examining: 1) environmental, 2) economic, 3) social and 4) legal dimensions, covering three life-cycle stages: 1) pre-mining, 2) mining, and 3) post-mining. The publications on the environmental and economic aspects focused principally on the impacts of mining, whereas social and legal publications discussed the interaction between people and their rights and ways of controlling their environment. Besides the need for more balanced research between different life-cycle stages we uncovered five research gaps concerning the knowledge base needed to increase the sustainability of Arctic mining: 1) impacts and adaptation to climate change, 2) monitoring the sustainability of mining using standardized indicators, 3) holistic economic assessment of mining, 4) social sustainability and conflict management, and 5) mechanisms that mitigate or compensate for the adverse effects of mining on biodiversity.","[Tolvanen, Anne; Juutinen, Artti; Kangas, Katja] Univ Oulu, Nat Resources Inst Finland, POB 413, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Tolvanen, Anne] Univ Oulu, Dept Ecol & Genet, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Eilu, Pasi; Kivinen, Mari; Markovaara-Koivisto, Mira] Geol Survey Finland, POB 96, FI-02151 Espoo, Finland; [Juutinen, Artti] Univ Oulu, Dept Econ, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Naskali, Arto; Tuulentie, Seija] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Etelaranta 55, FI-96300 Rovaniemi, Finland; [Salokannel, Veera; Simila, Jukka] Univ Lapland, Fac Law, POB 122, FI-96101 Rovaniemi, Finland",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Oulu; University of Oulu; Geological Survey of Finland (GTK); University of Oulu; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Lapland,"Tolvanen, A (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Nat Resources Inst Finland, POB 413, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland.",anne.tolvanen@luke.fi; pasi.eilu@gtk.fi; artti.juutinen@luke.fi; katja.kangas@luke.fi; mari.kivinen@gtk.fi; mira.markovaara-koivisto@gtk.fi; arto.naskali@luke.fi; veera.salokannel@ulapland.fi; seija.tuulentie@luke.fi; jukka.simila@ulapland.fi,"Tolvanen, Anne/AAY-3765-2020; Tolvanen, Anne/AAP-8246-2020; Eilu, Pasi/AAK-8074-2020; Eilu, Pasi/AAE-6184-2020; Tolvanen, Anne/I-5873-2015","Tolvanen, Anne/0000-0002-5304-7510; Markovaara-Koivisto, Mira/0000-0002-1766-2292; Simila, Jukka/0000-0002-9722-5200; Juutinen, Artti/0000-0003-4300-5365; Eilu, Pasi/0000-0002-6342-8907",Natural Resources Institute Finland; University of Lapland; Finnish Geological Survey; Academy of Finland [283153]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [283153] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Natural Resources Institute Finland; University of Lapland; Finnish Geological Survey; Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Academy of FinlandFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES)),"This work was financially supported by the Natural Resources Institute Finland, University of Lapland, Finnish Geological Survey, and Project 283153 funded by the Academy of Finland.",,196,41,43,8,67,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

In view of current climate variability and change, and projected increases in extreme events, adaptation to climate risks is vital. Policies have been put in place to enhance adaptation across sub-Saharan Africa in accordance with international agreements. At the same time, local people, through experience, have learned to adapt. This paper examines current policy actions and their implementation alongside an assessment of barriers to local adaptation. In doing so it links adaptation policy and practice. Policy documents were analysed that covered key livelihood sectors, which were identified as climate sensitive. These included agriculture, water, housing and health policies, as well as the National Climate Change Policy. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were also held with key stakeholders in the Upper East Region of Ghana. Analyses were carried using thematic content analysis. Although policies and actions complement each other, their integration is weak. Financial, institutional, social, and technological barriers hinder successful local implementation of some policy actions, while lack of local involvement in policy formulation also hinders adaptation practice. Integration of local perspectives into policy needs to be strengthened in order to enhance adaptation. Coupled with this is a need to consider adaptation to climate change in development policies and to pursue efforts to reduce or remove the key barriers to implementation at the local level.","[Yiran, Gerald A.

However, harmful environmental consequences have been recognized. Integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS) are now being reconsidered as a means of improving farm and land sustainability. We suggest that understanding interrelations of ICLS to achieve sustainability requires scrutinizing the way farmers exploit them to adapt their farming system. We used six different case studies covering maritime and semi-maritime regions of France (beef and dairy + crop systems) to describe factors influencing production, environmental, and socio-economic considerations for change in farming practices. Farm surveys and analysis of farmers' practices and farm time-course of change were framed within the European farming system approach. Transition in the medium-term pointed out new interactions at stake between crops and livestock when farmers developed adaptation to climate changes, introduced grassland in contrast to the general trend of specialization and enhanced feed self-sufficiency. In the medium- and short-term, multifunctionality of crops and crop rotation adjustments, as well as regulation of cropping systems by livestock classes are the main levers of system flexibility. We showed how ICLS increased sustainability and began to notice the positive effects of farm collaboration. Further research is needed in partnership with additional stakeholders to support sustainable development of agriculture at the landscape level. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It requires systemic climate change adaptation to address the complexity of risks across multiple domains and tackle the uncertainties of future scenarios. This paper introduces a multirisk analysis of climate hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and risk severity, specifically designed to hotspot geographic locations and prioritize system receptors that are affected by climate-related extremes. The analysis is demonstrated for the Metropolitan City of Venice. Representative scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) of climate threats (i.e., storm surges, pluvial flood, heat waves, and drought) are selected and represented by projections of Regional Climate Models for a 30-year period (2021-2050). A sample of results is as follows. First, an increase in the risk is largely due to drought, pluvial flood, and storm surge, depending on the areas of interest, with the overall situation worsening under the RCP8.5 scenario. Second, particular locations have colocated vulnerable receptors at higher risk, concentrated in the urban centers (e.g., housing, railways, roads) and along the coast (e.g., beaches, wetlands, primary sector). Third, risk communication of potential environmental and socio-economic losses via the multirisk maps is useful to stakeholders and public administration. Fourth, the multirisk maps recommend priorities for future investigation and risk management, such as collection of sensor data, elaboration of mitigations, and adaptation plans at hotspot locations.","[Sambo, Beatrice; Bonato, Marta; Sperotto, Anna; Critto, Andrea] Univ Ca Foscari, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Venice, Italy; [Sambo, Beatrice; Torresan, Silvia; Furlan, Elisa; Critto, Andrea] Fdn Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat Fdn C, RAAS Div, Lecce, Italy; [Bonato, Marta] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Leipzig, Germany; [Sperotto, Anna] Univ Basque Country, Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Sci Campus, Biscay, Spain; [Lambert, James H.

However, EBM requires the realization of co-benefits of biodiversity and human wellbeing improvement. Furthermore, overall and internal knowledge of the ecoregion of interest is essential. With this knowledge, EBM can be integrated better into the spatial planning process. The present study proposes a dual service strategy for ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA): the ecosystem-based adaptation for human index (EbA-HI) and the ecosystem-based adaptation for biodiversity index (EbA-BI), which are examined at finer spatial scales. The Qilian Mountain protected area was used as an example to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of the two indices. Panel quantile regression was used to identify factors influencing the spatial distribution variations. Both EbA-HI and EbA-BI increased by 1.87% and 0.84%, respectively, from 2003 to 2019 in the Qilian Mountain Protected Area. Nevertheless, variations in the values of these indices, as well as their factors, were evident in different areas. Higher air temperatures significantly facilitated the increase in both EbA-HI and EbA-BI. A higher degree of land use positively affected EbA-HI but negatively impacted EbA-BI. Our findings illustrate the complexity associated with EbA and elucidate the need for in-depth theoretical thinking and practical adaptation measures for efficient ecosystem management, which will help to sustain and improve both biodiversity and human well-being.","[Yang, Zhenshan; Wang, Jieyong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zhenshan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yilin; Su, Huimin] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Tourism, Xian 710119, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Shaanxi Normal University","Yang, ZS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",yangzs@igsnrr.ac.cn; zhangyilin@snnu.edu.cn; suhm@snnu.edu.cn; wjy@igsnrr.ac.cn,"jieyong, wang/HDN-6930-2022","Yang, Zhenshan/0000-0002-3697-7396",National Key Research and Develop-ment Program of China; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences;  [2019YFC0507802];  [XDA23100402],National Key Research and Develop-ment Program of China; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); ; ,"Declaration of Competing Interest The research is Supported by National Key Research and Develop-ment Program of China (Grant No. 2019YFC0507802) , and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA23100402) .",,91,0,0,18,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

While there are numerous contributing factors behind these changes, the effect of a changing climate has not been thoroughly studied. This paper adds a significant contribution to the knowledge base through analysis from a survey of 186 herder households, interviews with 38 key participants, and four focus group discussions with individuals from three National Parks and Conservation areas in the high-mountain region of Nepal. Additionally, a review of the existing policies and programs on pastoralism was carried out. Results demonstrate several reasons behind the decline of transhumance pastoralism: Policy focus on the establishment of conservation areas, increasing vulnerability to extreme events (avalanches, snowfall, storms, and disappearing water sources), and ineffective government policies and programs. Hardships involved in herding combined with changing social values and the degradation of pasture quality were identified as contributing factors to the growing challenges facing mountain pastoralism. Similarly, the declining interest among herders to continue their profession can be traced to vulnerability associated with escalating climate change impacts. Considerable knowledge gaps regarding threats to high-altitude pastoralism remain, and continued research on pastureland conservation, capacity development, facilitation for climate change adaptation, and coping strategies for herders in the high mountains is urgently needed. Our analysis suggests that non-climatic variables such as policy and globalization were more influential in eroding pastoralism as compared to climate change.","[Tiwari, Krishna Raj; Bhusal, Prabin; Sengel, Mukunda] Tribhuvan Univ, Inst Forestry, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal; [Sitaula, Bishal Kumar] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NBMU, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Bajracharya, Roshan Man; Raut, Nani] Kathmandu Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Dhulikhel 45210, Nepal",Tribhuvan University; Institute of Forestry (IOF) - Nepal; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Tiwari, KR (corresponding author), Tribhuvan Univ, Inst Forestry, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal.",krtiwari@iofpc.edu.np; bishal.sitaula@nmbu.no; roshan.bajracharya@gmail.com; rautnani7@gmail.com; pbhusal@iofpc.edu.np; makusanjel@gmail.com,,"Bhusal, Prabin/0000-0003-2328-239X","sustainable natural resource management for climate change adaptation in the Himalayan region: A collaborative project among Norway, Nepal, Pakistan and Bhutan (SUNREM-Himalaya, NORHED South driven project)","sustainable natural resource management for climate change adaptation in the Himalayan region: A collaborative project among Norway, Nepal, Pakistan and Bhutan (SUNREM-Himalaya, NORHED South driven project)","This research was funded by sustainable natural resource management for climate change adaptation in the Himalayan region: A collaborative project among Norway, Nepal, Pakistan and Bhutan (SUNREM-Himalaya, NORHED South driven project).",,51,6,6,1,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2020,12,7,,,,,,,2737,10.3390/su12072737,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12072737,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LL4WR,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000531558100162,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite the breadth of information to support adaptation planning however, knowledge is fragmented, obscuring information needs, hampering strategic planning and constraining decision-making capacities. In this letter, we present and apply the Adaptation Knowledge Cycle (AKC), a heuristic for rapidly evaluating and systematising adaptation research by analytical foci: Impacts, Implications, Decisions or Actions. We demonstrate its application through an assessment of ten years' climate change adaptation research for New Zealand's primary industries. The letter draws on the results of systematic review, empirical analysis, workshops, interviews, narrative analyses and pathways planning to synthesise information and identify knowledge gaps. Results show the heuristic's simplicity is valuable for cross- and transdisciplinary communication on adaptation in New Zealand's primary industries. Results also provide insight into what we know and need to know with respect to undertaking adaptation planning. With the development of tools and processes to inform decision making under conditions of uncertainty- such as adaptation pathways-it is increasingly important to efficiently and accurately determine knowledge needs. The combination of systematic data collection techniques, and heuristics such as the AKC may provide researchers and stakeholders with an efficient, robust tool to review and synthesise existing knowledge, and identify emerging research priorities.

The monthly rainfall data are for 132 points of 10x10km grids reconstructed from weather stations and meteorological satellite observations, which cover the period between 1983 and 2013. The monthly maximum and minimum temperatures are for the same points and girds, but cover the period 1981-2011. Linear regression is used to each of the 132 grid points to detect changes or trends in rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures and the statistical significance of the trends is determined by the F-distribution test. These points were reclassified into the three districts (Woredas in Amharic) studied having different agroecologies by extraction techniques with ArcGIS 10.1 and converted into raster to generate surface data using simple krigging interpolation technique. Annual and June-September (Kiremt) rainfall exhibit statistically insignificant increasing trends in most of the grid points while March-May (Belg) rainfall shows significant decreasing trends. On the other hand, significant spatiotemporal variability in the maximum and minimum temperatures is observed across the study area. The warming trends in the maximum and minimum temperatures for Basona Werana and Efratana Gidim, respectively, are statistically significant at p=.05 and p=.01 levels. It is concluded that trends of rainfall and temperature vary considerably within the study area. This indicates the need for local-level analysis, and context-specific planning and implementation of climate change adaptation interventions.","[Alemayehu, Arragaw; Bewket, Woldeamlak] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Alemayehu, A (corresponding author), Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",arragawalex@yahoo.com,,,,,,,41,40,40,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0435-3676,1468-0459,,GEOGR ANN A,Geogr.

In support of such adaptation strategies, we conducted a case study for lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.) in Alberta, Canada. We compared the tree height for populations and families planted across 37 progeny and provenance trials when transferred among six physiogeographically and climatically distinct breeding regions. Based on these results we infer how lodgepole populations and families are adapted to current climate conditions and how they might respond to future changes in climate. Interestingly, in almost all regions we found that local populations grew better than introduced sources, suggesting that in the current climate the use of local populations is still an appropriate reforestation strategy with some exceptions. Notably, in cool and wet higher elevation environments (between 1050 and 1650 m), local populations were outgrown by populations originating from warmer lower elevation regions. Moreover, these higher elevation populations were always outgrown when transferred to other regions. A number of transfers among regions were identified that ensure productivity gains under recent climate conditions, and simultaneously represent a short term adaptation measure for warming of about +0.5 degrees C. Further, we provide a database for selection of families within breeding populations to enhance their resilience to climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, a shared response is often promoted in the absence of information regarding actions currently taken; in particular, there is limited knowledge regarding action occurring at the household scale. To address this gap, we examine household actions taken to address climate change and associated hazards in two Australian coastal communities. Mixed methods research is conducted to answer three questions: (1) what actions are currently taken (mitigation, actions to lobby for change or adaptation to climate impacts)? (2) why are these actions taken (e.g. are they consistent with capacity, experience, perceptions of risk); and (3) what are the implications for adaptation? We find that households are predominantly mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and that impact orientated adaptive actions are limited. Coping strategies are considered sufficient to mange climate risks, proving a disincentive for additional adaptive action. Influencing factors differ, but generally, risk perception and climate change belief are associated with action. However, the likelihood of more action is a function of homeownership and a tendency to plan ahead. Addressing factors that support or constrain household adaptive decision-making and action, from the physical (e.g. homeownership) to.the social (e.g. skills in planning and a culture of adapting to change) will be critical in increasing household participation in adaptation.

Subansiri is the largest tributary of Brahmaputra within India and the river system has its practical importance as it holds a high water resources as well as hydropower potential for the country, which still remains highly under-developed. The probable impact of climate change has been analyzed using hypothetical climate scenarios to understand the behavior of total streamflow as well as snowmelt runoff under the changing conditions. Based on the simulations of a daily snowmelt runoff model (SNOWMOD) using six years of data, it has been observed that the total stream flow as well as the snowmelt runoff increase with temperature. Snowmelt runoff was found to increase by about 5% and 12% for the increase of 1 degrees C and 2 degrees C in temperature respectively. However, not much change in snowmelt runoff was observed with changed precipitation scenarios. It has been found from this study that total stream flow changes in all scenarios of temperature (T) and precipitation (P). The observed maximum % increase in mean annual stream flow was about 6% for the T+2 degrees C & P+10% scenario and the minimum % decrease in mean annual stream flow observed was about 11% for T+1 degrees C & P-10% scenario. The present study aims to provide information for planning of climate change adaptation strategies for the Subansiri sub-basin of the Brahmaputra River.","[Sarkar, A.] Natl Inst Hydrol, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Sarkar, A (corresponding author), Natl Inst Hydrol, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India.",archana_sarkar@yahoo.com,,,,,,,17,7,7,0,11,GLOBAL NETWORK ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,ATHENS,"30 VOULGAROKTONOU STR, ATHENS, GR 114 72, GREECE",1790-7632,,,GLOBAL NEST J,Glob.

Coordinating multidisciplinary research teams capable of addressing these priority areas, however, presents its own unique set of challenges, ranging from bridging across multiple disciplinary perspectives to achieve common questions and methods to facilitating engagement in holistic and integrative thinking that promotes linkages from scholarship to societal needs. We propose that structural equation modeling (SEM) can provide a powerful framework for synergizing multidisciplinary research teams around grand challenge issues. Structural equation modeling can integrate both visual and statistical expression of complex hypotheses at all stages of the research process, from planning to analysis. Three elements of the SEM framework are particularly beneficial to multidisciplinary research teams; these include (i) a common graphical language that transcends disciplinary boundaries, (ii) iterative, critical evaluation of complex hypotheses involving manifest and latent variables and direct and indirect interactions, and (iii) enhanced opportunities to discover unanticipated interactions or causal pathways as empirical data are tested statistically against the model. Using our ongoing multidisciplinary, multisite field investigation of climate change adaptation and mitigation in annual row crop agroecosystems as a case study, we demonstrate the value of the SEM framework for project design, coordination, and implementation and provide recommendations for its broader application as a means to more effectively engage and address issues of critical societal concern.","[Smith, Richard.

As agriculture is the primary economy of the province, it is crucial to understand the influence of climate change on drought severity and how the local farmers perceive and adapt to climate change. Therefore, to examine the impacts of climate change on drought in the Tien Giang province in the Mekong Delta, the present study used three General Circulation Models (GCMs)-ACCESS 1.3, CNRM-CM5, and MRI-CGCM3 under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. In addition, the study evaluated household-level adaptation strategies based on structured questionnaire-based household survey data and focus group discussion. This study finds that the drought will be getting more severe in the future in the province based on using three GCMs and two climate change scenarios. The estimated results of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) show that there would be many potential extreme drought years between 2020 and 2050. The results from the questionnaire survey depicted that the household perception of drought is moderate in the Mekong Delta. The current adaptation measures are sufficient to adapt to moderate drought and can be improved to adapt to more potential extreme drought conditions in the future. This study provides important insights for decision-makers to manage future drought situations in the Mekong region.","[Nghia, Bui Phan Quoc; Pal, Indrajit] Asian Inst Technol, Disaster Preparedness Mitigat & Management, Pathum Thani, Thailand; [Pramanik, Malay] Asian Inst Technol, Urban Innovat & Sustainabil, Pathum Thani, Thailand; [Dasgupta, Rajarshi] Indian Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, Delhi, India; [Dasgupta, Rajarshi] Inst Global Environm Strategies, Hayama, Japan",Asian Institute of Technology; Asian Institute of Technology; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi,"Nghia, BPQ (corresponding author), Asian Inst Technol, Disaster Preparedness Mitigat & Management, Pathum Thani, Thailand.",bpqnghia@gmail.com,,"BUI, NGHIA/0000-0002-1344-4300",,,,,47,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

This study systematically mapped the breadth and depth of peer-reviewed literature on the subject and synthesized evidence on what we know, don't know and need to know about successful climate services. The study focusses on services that are based on long-term climate information or aim to inform decision-making on longer time scales and includes papers that inform on success, including evaluation studies, empirical investigations in the factors and practices that influence success, and conceptual discussions on what constitutes success. Results show that insights on climate service success are scattered and most often originate from western and developed countries. Conceptualizations of success in the literature are diverse and focus on processes for production and use, product characteristics and process elements of the service itself, and/or on contextual factors. Studies that assess the results of climate services tend to focus on evaluating (perceived) usability, though uptake, impacts and outcomes of services are rarely assessed systematically. Frequently reported success factors include brokering functions, user-producer interactions and iterative and flexible development processes. To be successful, services themselves should be contextualized and tailored to the user and its decision-making context. We conclude that whilst context emerges as a critical determinant of success, the configuration of factors and processes leading to success demand further investigation.","[Boon, Eva; Ludwig, Fulco] Wageningen Univ & Res, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Boon, Eva; Goosen, Hasse] Fdn Climate Adaptat Serv, Bussummergrindweg 1, NL-1406 NZ Bussum, Netherlands; [Wright, Sarah Judith] Deltares, Boussinesqweg 1, NL-2629 HV Delft, Netherlands; [Biesbroek, Robbert] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Deltares; Wageningen University & Research,"Boon, E (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.;Boon, E (corresponding author), Fdn Climate Adaptat Serv, Bussummergrindweg 1, NL-1406 NZ Bussum, Netherlands.",eva.boon@wur.nl; sarah.wright@deltares.nl; robbert.biesbroek@wur.nl; hasse@climateadaptationservices.com; fulco.ludwig@wur.nl,"Biesbroek, Robbert/GZZ-4476-2022","Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419; LUDWIG, FULCO/0000-0001-6479-9657",Foundation Climate Adaptation Services (CAS); Wageningen University Research (WUR),Foundation Climate Adaptation Services (CAS); Wageningen University Research (WUR),"This work was supported by Foundation Climate Adaptation Services (CAS) and Wageningen University & Research (WUR).

Yet uncertainty remains regarding the variations of climate anxiety across demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, age) and its associations with adaptive (i.e., pro-environmental) behaviors. Moreover, the point-estimate proportion of people frequently experiencing climate anxiety has seldom been probed. In this study, we assessed climate anxiety (including its related functional impairments), along with demographic characteristics, climate change experience, and pro-environmental behaviors, in 2080 French-speaking participants from eight African and European countries. 11.64% of the participants reported experiencing climate anxiety frequently, and 20.72% reported experiencing daily life functional consequences (e.g., impact on the ability to go to work or socialize). Women and younger people exhibited significantly higher levels of climate anxiety. There was no difference between participants from African and European countries, although the sample size of the former was limited, thus precluding any definite conclusion regarding potential geographic differences. Concerning adaptation, climate anxiety was associated with pro-environmental behaviors. However, this association was significantly weaker in people reporting frequent experiences of climate anxiety (i.e., eco-paralysis) than in those with lower levels. Although this observation needs to be confirmed in longitudinal and experimental research, our results suggest that climate anxiety can impede daily life functioning and adaptation to climate change in many people, thus deserving a careful audit by the scientific community and practitioners.","[Heeren, Alexandre; Mouguiama-Daouda, Camille; Contreras, Alba] Catholic Univ Louvain, Psychol Sci Res Inst, Pl Cardinal Mercier 10, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Heeren, Alexandre] Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Neurosci, Brussels, Belgium; [Heeren, Alexandre] Belgian Natl Sci Fdn FRS FNRS, Brussels, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Heeren, A (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Psychol Sci Res Inst, Pl Cardinal Mercier 10, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.;Heeren, A (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Neurosci, Brussels, Belgium.;Heeren, A (corresponding author), Belgian Natl Sci Fdn FRS FNRS, Brussels, Belgium.",alexandre.heeren@uclouvain.be,"Heeren, Alexandre/U-9748-2019","Heeren, Alexandre/0000-0003-0553-6149; Contreras Cuevas, Alba/0000-0001-7292-8770",F.R.S.-FNRS Belgian National Science Foundation; Agence Nationale des Bourses du Gabon; FSR Postdoctoral fellowship (UCLouvain); International Wallonie-Bruxelles International (WBI) Excellence Grant,F.R.S.-FNRS Belgian National Science Foundation; Agence Nationale des Bourses du Gabon(French National Research Agency (ANR)); FSR Postdoctoral fellowship (UCLouvain); International Wallonie-Bruxelles International (WBI) Excellence Grant,Alexandre Heeren is funded by the F.R.S.-FNRS Belgian National Science Foundation (as FRS-FNRS research associate).

However, the existing literature tends to address the general benefits of environmental public participation rather than examine details of how such participation actually occurs and how it differs among nations-even among nations all purportedly pursuing similar public participation goals. This article begins to fill that knowledge gap by examining law's key role in structuring how the public in different countries may actually participate in environmental decision making, including in unfolding national agendas to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change impacts. Both the United States and European Union member states have decades of experience in writing-and rewriting-public participation into their environmental laws. This article actively explores and compares how the laws of the United States, the European Union, and the Netherlands (as an exemplar of an EU member state) structure public participation in environmental decision making in order to assess how far along the scale of public participation categories each government has progressed. It concludes that, for the moment, United States environmental law more often allows for public collaboration and empowers the public to make certain kinds of environmental decisions-although a new law in the Netherlands may soon encourage more creative and collaborative forms of public participation there, as well.","[Akerboom, Sanne] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geo Sci, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands; [Craig, Robin Kundis] Univ Southern Calif, Gould Sch Law, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Craig, Robin Kundis] Univ Utah, SJ Quinney Coll Law, Salt Lake City, UT USA",Utrecht University; University of Southern California; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Akerboom, S (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Fac Geo Sci, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands.",s.akerboom@uu.nl,"Craig, Robin Kundis/GPX-3135-2022","Craig, Robin Kundis/0000-0003-2120-9543; Akerboom, Sanne/0000-0003-0001-7753",University of Utah S.J.

In Colombia, land-use planning processes supported by geographical information systems are a recent phenomenon and the legal instruments of spatial planning are inadequate in most municipalities. Moreover, socio-spatial equity represents a challenge for Latin American cities in which there is increasing awareness of the role that spatial planning plays. Consequently, the question arises as to how the urban spatial structure and organization contribute to an inclusive and equitable socio-spatial evolution, considering climate change impacts. The case study analysed in this article focuses upon the northern limits of the city of Bogota. Therefore, this research aims to define the ideal balance of urban land-use distribution between social stratum classification and the vulnerability of the communities seeking to better adapt to climate change. We propose a methodological approach of analysing spatial syntax and the (social) intensity of activities and infrastructure, which enables us to characterize the urban structure itself and identify vulnerable urban instances. As a result, we find that the urban network with low values presents spatial unpredictability in its pattern, constraining equitable development based on the urban morphology of the city. This research allows us to conclude that the degree of vulnerability encountered by the social urban spatial structure is higher in expansion areas than in central areas of the city.","[Barbosa, Vasco] Univ La Sabana, Fac Engn, Chia, Colombia; [Barbosa, Vasco] Polytech Inst Viana do Castelo, proMetheus, Viana Do Castelo, Portugal; [Barbosa, Vasco] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Sociol, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Suarez Pradilla, Monica Marcela] Colombian Sch Engn Julio Garavito, Dept Civil Engn, Bogota, Colombia",Universidad de La Sabana; Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo; University of Johannesburg,"Barbosa, V (corresponding author), Univ La Sabana, Fac Engn, Chia, Colombia.;Barbosa, V (corresponding author), Polytech Inst Viana do Castelo, proMetheus, Viana Do Castelo, Portugal.;Barbosa, V (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Dept Sociol, Johannesburg, South Africa.",vasco.barbosa@unisabana.edu.co; monica.suarez@escuelaing.edu.co,"Barbosa, Vasco/B-9605-2009","Barbosa, Vasco/0000-0002-0657-3171",,,,,75,4,4,5,9,COGITATIO PRESS,LISBON,"RUA FIALHO ALMEIDA 14, 2 ESQ, LISBON, 1070-129, PORTUGAL",2183-7635,,,URBAN PLAN,Urban Plan.,,2021,6,4,,,,,365,379,,10.17645/up.v6i4.4630,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/up.v6i4.4630,,,15,Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Urban Studies,YH7RW,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000743361500015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since these benefits are derived from damages avoided by any such adaptation, they are critically dependent on the specification of a baseline. The current exercise paper reinforces this point in an environment that superimposes stochastic coastal storm events on two alternative sea level rise scenarios from two different baselines: one assumes perfect economic efficiency of the sort that could be supported by the availability of actuarially fair insurance and a second in which fundamental market imperfections significantly impair society's ability to spread risk. We show that the value of adaptation can be expressed in terms of differences in expected outcomes damages only if the effected community has access to efficient risk-spreading mechanisms or reflects risk neutrality in its decision-making structure. Otherwise, the appropriate metric for measuring the benefits of adaptation must be derived from certainty equivalents. In these cases, increases in decision-makers' aversion to risk increase the economic value of adaptations that reduce expected damages and diminish the variance of their inter-annual variability. For engineering and other adaptations that involve significant up-front expense followed by ongoing operational cost, increases in decision-makers' aversion increase the value of adaptation and therefore move the date of economically efficient implementation closer to the present.","[Yohe, Gary] Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ & Environm Studies, Huffington Fdn, Middletown, CT 06459 USA; [Yohe, Gary; Knee, Kelly] Appl Sci Associates, Wakefield, RI 02879 USA; [Kirshen, Paul] Battelle Mem Inst, Lexington, MA 02421 USA",Wesleyan University; Battelle Memorial Institute,"Yohe, G (corresponding author), Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ & Environm Studies, Huffington Fdn, 238 Church St, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",gyohe@wesleyan.edu; kknee@asasccience.com; KirshenP@BATTELLE.org,,,,,,,22,20,20,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Such is the case for Runde catchment in Zimbabwe, whose rural communities depend on groundwater. Climate change and increased variability pose a threat water availability by affecting groundwater potential and recharge, but the full extent of the threat is not well understood. Thus, the main objective of this study was to assess the impact of climate change on groundwater potential and recharge in the catchment. The groundwater potential mapping was performed using spatially weighted overlay method with inputs: soil type, geology, land use, observed precipitation, topographic wetness index and elevation. This mapping produced a groundwater potential index, classified into groundwater potential zones and cross-validated with borehole yield data, r=0.63 and n=62. The groundwater potential validation showed 1.6% and 4.8% of the total boreholes were in the high (>7 l/s) to very high (4-7 l/s) while 43.5% and 50.1% moderate (1-4 l/s), and low (<1 l/s) groundwater potential zones respectively. The simulated precipitation increased by 23% for 2020-2080s. Climate change impacts decreased average groundwater potential by 30.8% (13,062.90 km(2)) low, 5.8% (2,433.25 km(2)) moderate and increased by 34.8% (14,707 km(2)) high by 1.8% (789.15 km(2)) very high groundwater potential.

A disaster governance paradigm is a comprehensive set of prevailing and institutionalized ideas that shape disaster plans and policies that eventually are implemented on-the-ground. Nepal has prepared various disaster plans and policies at the national, provincial and local level, but there are major gaps in disaster risk preparedness, with annual floods and landslides continuing to be responsible for the loss of lives and heavy infrastructure damages. In this article, we show how disaster governance paradigms have evolved between 1982 and 2019, using policy document analysis and semi-structured interviews with key policy actors. The study found that four major disaster governance paradigms exist in Nepal - (1) response and recovery; (2) disaster risk reduction and management; (3) integrated climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction; and (4) federalized disaster risk reduction. The results of this study show that multiple state and non-state actors such as key government ministries, NGOs, INGOs and other civil society actors are competing over resources and there is an ongoing administrative struggle for promoting different disaster governance paradigms. There has been a push from various civil society actors to prioritize disaster risk reduction in Nepal. Finally, we conclude that it is too early to assert that the decentralization process will be able to reduce disaster risk for vulnerable communities, especially with the federalization of Nepal's disaster governance.","[Vij, Sumit; Dewulf, Art] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Vij, Sumit] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Russell, Caroline] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Human Geog, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Clark, Julian] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Parajuli, Binod Prasad; Shakya, Puja] Pract Act Consulting, Climate & Resilience, Kathmandu, Nepal",Wageningen University & Research; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham,"Vij, S (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",sumit.vij@wur.nl,"Vij, Sumit/AAV-6617-2021","Russell, Caroline/0000-0002-4613-1845; Parajuli, Binod Prasad/0000-0002-3528-6075; Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644","Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Department for International Development (DFID) under the United Kingdom Science for Humanitarian Emergencies and Resilience (SHEAR) program [NE/P000452/1]; NERC [NE/P000207/1, NE/P000452/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Department for International Development (DFID) under the United Kingdom Science for Humanitarian Emergencies and Resilience (SHEAR) program; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The authors acknowledge the financial support from the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and Department for International Development (DFID) under the United Kingdom Science for Humanitarian Emergencies and Resilience (SHEAR) program (Grant Number NE/P000452/1).

However, few empirical studies have considered how smallholders perceive climate change in Central Vietnam. This research investigates the Vietnamese smallholders' views on the causes and indicators of climate change and factors that affect their perceptions of it in Central Vietnam. A sample size of 170 was drawn from a total of 297 smallholders and a structured questionnaire was developed to collect data. Descriptive, chi-square (chi(2)) and logistic regression analyses were used. The research results revealed that most smallholders perceived urbanization (93.5%), followed by deforestation (85.3%), air pollution (84.4%) and unappropriated dealing with agricultural wastes (82.4%) are the causes of climate change. A majority of smallholders perceived that excessive lightening (91.2%), followed by change in rainfall season length (90.6%), frequent droughts (90%), change in temperature (88.2%), uneven rainfall distribution (85.9%), rainfall amount (84.1%) and frequent floods (82.9%) are the most noted indicators of climate change. The success of regression model overall prediction is reported by model chi(2) = 92.69,p < 0.000, showing that the independent variables significantly explained the dependent variable.

It also examines whether action taken thus far to implement Annex 9 indicate a marked improvement in adaptive capacity in addressing climate problems in the Great Lakes Basin. The author argues that the effectiveness of climate action in the Great Lakes Basin depends not only on the domestic efforts of the U.S. and Canadian governments, the responsible parties in implementing binational water agreements. It also hinges on whether they have the institutional capacity and the political will required to help fund and coordinate the actions of the several heterogeneous networks. Between 2012 and 2019, significant progress was made in the areas of information-sharing, network-building, and capacity-building for more effective measurement, monitoring, and analysis of climate change impacts in the Great Lakes Basin. However, the Parties have not yet developed a long-term binational framework for action supporting climate change adaptation and resilience. In the meantime, First Nations and municipal and other networks are implementing their own community-level resilience plans, but these actors cannot fully compensate for weak federal leadership and inadequate human and financial resources.","[Jordan, Pamela A.] Southern New Hampshire Univ, Dept Social Sci, Law & Polit Program, Manchester, NH 03106 USA",,"Jordan, PA (corresponding author), Southern New Hampshire Univ, Dept Social Sci, Law & Polit Program, Manchester, NH 03106 USA.",p.jordan@snhu.edu,,,,,,,88,4,4,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

This study investigates future scenarios for development of shrimp aquaculture using a spatially explicit, agent-based model (ABM) simulating farmers' production system choices. A role playing game (RPG) with farmers was used to calibrate and validate the model. Four scenarios, representing different visions of aquaculture in the next 15 years, were elaborated with decision makers before discussing the different outputs of the model. Iterative consultation with farmers helped to fine-tune the model and identify key parameters and drivers in farmers' decision-making. The recursive process allowed us to construct a model that validly represents reality. Participants stated that use of the RPG improved their insight for planning. Results of the scenarios indicate that (i) intensification of production is unsustainable, (ii) market-based incentives are too limited to stimulate development of an integrated mangrove-shrimp production system and (iii) climate change will cause rapid decline of production in the absence of adaptation measures.

Design/methodology/approach - The research process included fieldwork in the states of Oaxaca, Tabasco and Yucatan, and a historical study of hydrometeorological events in each region. The authors sought to identify a means of interpreting these events linked to climate variability, on the basis of the history of disasters, the environment and the habitat. The local climatic indications were compared to the IPCC's global successes, to show that contradictions do not exist but that it is difficult to apply the IPCC's findings at a local level, given the considerable margin of uncertainty. Findings - The indications of the effects of climate change make it possible to foresee that the most vulnerable populations will be the ones facing the strongest impact in the future. Practical implications - The research has direct implications on urban and housing policies, offering a roadmap to design climate change adaptation strategies; adaptive capacity not only requires political commitment. Social implications - It is also related to social and economic development and an integral risk management approach rather than a civil protection strategy. Originality/value - The main interest of this research is to show that a multidisciplinary approach is essential in order to understand the local implications of climate change.","IPN, ESIA Tecamachalco, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico,"Audefroy, JF (corresponding author), IPN, ESIA Tecamachalco, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",takatitakite@gmail.com,,,,,,,27,6,7,2,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0965-3562,1758-6100,,DISASTER PREV MANAG,Disaster Prev.

Drawing on literature about uptake of CIS for climate risk assessment and adaptation, plus our own practical experiences, this Essay examines modes of user-provider interaction in CIS. By employing a customer-tailor analogy, three overlapping types of CIS transaction are identified: 'off-the-peg', 'outsourced' and 'bespoke'. Evident across all modes are 'loyalty card' customers who return to the same provider(s). We then offer a set of prompts to facilitate more meaningful engagement and dialogue between adaptation actors and providers. These questions could also be used to seed discussions within communities that research and provide training in CIS, as well as amongst stakeholders, funders and other institutions involved in the governance of CIS systems. Such searching and timely conversations could advance a more tailored approach to CIS delivery, regardless of the technical and financial starting point of users and providers.","[Wilby, Robert] Loughborough Univ, Geog & Environm, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Wilby, R (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Geog & Environm, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",R.L.Wilby@lboro.ac.uk,,,,,,,51,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

We evaluated the body of literature surrounding this practice, and found that SOC storage can be higher under no-till management in some soil types and climatic conditions even with redistribution of SOC, and contribute to reducing net greenhouse gas emissions. However, uncertainties tend to be large, which may make this approach less attractive as a contributor to stabilize the climate system compared to other options. Consequently, no-till may be better viewed as a method for reducing soil erosion, adapting to climate change, and ensuring food security, while any increase in SOC storage is a co-benefit for society in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.","[Ogle, Stephen M.; Alsaker, Cody] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Ogle, Stephen M.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Baldock, Jeff] CSIRO Agr & Food, Locked Bag 2, Glen Osmond, SA 5064, Australia; [Bernoux, Martial] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Climate & Environm Div, Rome, Italy; [Breidt, F.

Though, this assumption might have important implications especially for the social desirability of interventions aiming at counteracting time-persistent environmental problems, whose impacts occur in the long- and very long-term, respectively involving the present and future generations. This study analyzes the time sensitivity of social preferences for preservation policies of adaptation to climate change stresses. Results show that stated preferences are time insensitive, due to sustainability issues: individuals show insignificant differences in benefits they can experience within their own lifetimes compared to those which occur in the longer term, and which will instead be enjoyed by future generations. Whilst these results may be specific to the experimental design employed here, they do raise interesting questions regarding choices over time-persistent environmental problems, particularly in terms of the desirability of interventions which produce longer-term benefits.

Little is known, however, about the ostensibly complex relationships linking those elements of culture to climate change risk perceptions, especially in the context of farm level decision in the ground water context. This paper addresses that gap through an analysis of survey data provided by irrigators in the Namoi catchment of Australia's Murray-Darling Basin. We use Values-Beliefs-Norms theory to construct multivariate models of the relationship between ground water irrigators' interpretations of climate change risks and their implementation of adaptive water conservation practices. Results indicate that these cultural factors are important explanations of irrigators' climate change risk perceptions, and these risk perceptions are related to adaptive ground water management strategies at the farm level. The implications of the findings are discussed for research on the culture-environment nexus and for outreach designed to encourage agricultural adaptations to climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We review the literature specifically on water provisioning in this context to see what insights can be derived for achieving better integration across disciplinary and research-practice divides. We identify several disconnects in the climate-vulnerability literature: scale mismatches, missing linkages, multiple stressors and concerns, concepts emerging from different intellectual traditions, and inattention to stakeholder priorities. Recent work attempts to overcome some of these challenges. At the conceptual level, the coupled human-environment systems (CHES) framework forces analysts to address scale mismatches and multiple stressors, although given its breadth, applications of CHES still tend to follow disciplinary divides. At the methodological level, participatory/mediated modelling forces attention to stakeholder priorities while historical/comparative methods provide an empirical assessment of long-term adaptation not just short-term reactive strategies.

However, a recent comprehensive analysis based on various experimental data has revealed that the chemical composition of alite, belite, aluminate, and ferrite implemented by the Bogue models are slightly different than the experimental data, where small amounts of Al2O3 and Fe2O3 existing in alite and belite can change the prediction of cement composition. Since the amounts of cement compound are very important factors in determining the properties of concrete, improvement in the calculation would give more precise prediction for application usages such as climate change adaptable cement and high durable concrete manufacturing. For this purpose, 20 new models are proposed by modifying chemical compositions of the cement compounds and verified with the 50 experimental data sets.

Three composite indicators for financial inclusion are constructed using principal component analysis (PCA) based on normalized variables. To estimate the model, we adopted the Hoechle (2007) procedure which produces Driscoll-Kraay standard errors for linear panel models that are not only heteroskedasticity consistent but also robust to general forms of cross-sectional dependence. We find that income, energy consumption, industrialization, urbanization, FDI and financial inclusion appear to have led to higher emissions of CO2 in the region. Meanwhile, increased openness to trade seems to have reduced CO2 emissions. The findings are qualitatively robust to different proxies of financial inclusions and reasonable modifications to specification of the model. The empirical results imply that there are currently no policy synergies between growing financial inclusion and mitigating CO2 emissions. Thus, financial inclusion should be integrated into climate change adaptation strategies at local, national and regional levels, especially to address the side effect of higher CO2 emissions associated with improved financial inclusion.","[Le, Thai-Ha] Fulbright Univ, Fulbright Sch Publ Policy & Management, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Le, Thai-Ha] IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France; [Le, Ha-Chi] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore; [Taghizadeh-Hesary, Farhad] Tokai Univ, Tokyo, Japan",IPAG Business School; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Tokai University,"Le, TH (corresponding author), Fulbright Univ, Fulbright Sch Publ Policy & Management, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.;Le, TH (corresponding author), IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France.",Ha.le@fulbright.edu.vn,"Taghizadeh-Hesary, Farhad/R-5136-2018","Taghizadeh-Hesary, Farhad/0000-0001-5446-7093; Le, Thai-Ha/0000-0003-1158-7102",,,,,40,153,154,21,95,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1544-6123,1544-6131,,FINANC RES LETT,Financ.

However, the vulnerability of agricultural labor is largely ignored in climate vulnerability and adaptation studies, especially in the context of developed countries. This research examines the drought vulnerability of farmworkers both in the fields and in their communities by analyzing how changes in water resources and agricultural practices impact socioeconomic drought. A combination of surveys and semi-structured interviews with farmworkers, farmers, and social service providers in California's San Joaquin Valley is used to identify the impacts of drought on agricultural labor, water security, food security, and health. Findings demonstrate that drought impacts and vulnerabilities are multi-scalar and uneven. Agricultural drought adaptations, including increase in groundwater pumping and changes in crops, reshapes the vulnerability of farmworkers and rural communities. There is a need for continued interdisciplinary research on the socioeconomic dimensions of drought as well as increased representation of needs and vulnerabilities of farmworkers and rural communities in drought and climate change adaptation planning.","[Greene, Christina] Sch Geog & Dev, POB 210137, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",,"Greene, C (corresponding author), Sch Geog & Dev, POB 210137, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",cgreene@email.arizona.edu,,"Greene, Christina/0000-0003-3767-0932","Climate Assessment for the Southwest (CLIMAS) at the University of Arizona; Social & Behavioral Sciences Research Institute at the University of Arizona; Agriculture and Food Research Initiative from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2017-67011-26037]; NIFA [914540, 2017-67011-26037] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",Climate Assessment for the Southwest (CLIMAS) at the University of Arizona; Social & Behavioral Sciences Research Institute at the University of Arizona; Agriculture and Food Research Initiative from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"Initial research was supported by Climate Assessment for the Southwest (CLIMAS) and Social & Behavioral Sciences Research Institute at the University of Arizona.

In this article, we summarized the general principles and strategies of building resilience, and divide the resilience strategy into five categories: site, energy, water resources, structure and materials, and health. The British BREEAM, the US LEED, and the Chinese green building evaluation standards were selected, and the distribution of the content, quantity, and weight of the indicators invoking resilience strategies in these three types of evaluation systems were compared and analyzed. The resilience strategy of structure and material occupies the largest proportion of content and score in the three types of evaluation systems, followed by the site category. In addition, compared to other systems, the content of building resilience in BREEAM has the largest proportion, and it has set a secondary index to adapt to climate change. Finally, a rationalization proposal for further improving China's existing green building evaluation system in the context of climate change is proposed.","[Hu, Jie] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Management, Xian 710055, Peoples R China",Xi'an University of Architecture & Technology,"Hu, J (corresponding author), Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Management, Xian 710055, Peoples R China.",panghong3372@163.com,,,,,,,22,9,9,2,6,PARLAR SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS (P S P),FREISING,"ANGERSTR. 12, 85354 FREISING, GERMANY",1018-4619,1610-2304,,FRESEN ENVIRON BULL,Fresenius Environ.

International agricultural trade is seen in the literature as a potential adaption to climate change. However, little attention has been paid to the effect of climate change on cereal trade in Central Asia. This study takes Kazakhstan as an example to empirically analyze the effect of climate change on cereal trade by including them as determinants in the gravity model. Our results show that climatic changes in Kazakhstan, measured by precipitation and temperature, could increase the export of wheat and rice and the import of maize, and decrease the import of wheat. Specifically, as a major crop in Kazakhstan, increasing precipitation by 1 millimeter during the major cropping season from May to August, will significantly enhance export of wheat by 0.7% and reduce the import by 1.7%; increasing temperature by 1 degrees C during the same cropping season will significantly increase export of wheat by 21.9% and reduce the import by 49.4%. As an important cereal trade country in the world, the dramatic adjustments of cereal trade patterns resulting from climate change in Kazakhstan might affect global food security.","[Yu, Xiaohua; Luo, Hengrong; Wang, Hanjie; Feil, Jan-Henning] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Wang, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",hanjie.wang@agr.uni-goettingen.de,,"yu, xiaohua/0000-0003-4257-8081",,,,,42,10,10,10,30,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",2096-4129,2332-8878,,ECOSYST HEALTH SUST,Ecosyst.

The conceptual framework is derived from the sociology of knowledge, which treats policy makers as co-producers of knowledge, in interaction with scientists and consultants. The paper considers the framing of the problem, the creation of metrics and their limits, and the validity and legitimacy of such tools in conditions of high uncertainty. While recognising the potential contribution of risk assessment to managing complexity and assessing priorities, it argues that over-reliance on such instruments may risk understating the potential for climate-related disasters, while unintentionally increasing the real risk of failure to act effectively to adapt to inevitable change. Reliance on socio-technical devices entails a top-down approach to policy, which limits engagement with the public in deliberation about social priorities and purposes. Consequently politicians and civil servants may focus on the 'wrong' variables, misunderstand the assumptions and values built in to risk assessments, misuse their outputs, and possibly fail to act on the precautionary principle.","Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh EH8 9LD, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Webb, J (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Chrystal Macmillan Bldg, Edinburgh EH8 9LD, Midlothian, Scotland.",Jan.Webb@ed.ac.uk,,"Webb, Janette/0000-0001-8295-346X",,,,,50,17,17,1,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0302-3427,1471-5430,,SCI PUBL POLICY,Sci.

Yet, issues remain concerning the viability of insurance systems serving the most vulnerable and their potential role in an adaptation regime. Many pilot projects are underway, that can inform debate on these issues. This discussion builds on a recent droughtmicro-insurance project for subsistence farmers in Malawi, which by enabling farmers to access higher yield seeds, raises their productivity and decreases their vulnerability to climate change. Beyond this 'developmental' gain from insurance we show that micro-insurance in Malawi can directly promote adaptation by actually reducing crop losses from drought. This is possible by incorporating seasonal rainfall forecasts, which are strongly related to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), into insurance pricing. This paper describes the Malawi pilot program, its challenges after the first operational year and the potential benefits of ENSO-based pricing. The paper concludes by discussing the outlook for micro-insurance in the emerging climate. (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Then, a first assessment of the spatial-temporal change in national vulnerability from 1996 to 2008 was provided from the global perspective. Finally, 171 countries were grouped, and hotspots of climate change were identified. Based on the results, the earth is more vulnerable than invulnerable, and the average rate of increase in the vulnerability index from 1996 to 2008 was 0.30%. African countries were identified as hotspots of vulnerability and instability in the changing climate, and 8 groups were clustered based on the key influencing index of 171 countries. The results of this new framework are consistent with the previous Fragile State Index and World Risk Index but provide more details and quantitative vulnerability analysis.

Even when a policy may be effective in the short-term, changes in problem or policy contexts may render it ineffective over time. The design of 'robust' policies, meaning those which are able to self-adjust to linear changes in their environment, can be contrasted with 'resilient' ones which are able to adjust not only to linear, but also non-linear shifts in their contexts. Building on Boonstra and de Boer (AMBIO 43:260-274, 2014)'s argument that traps should not be considered as a static phenomenon; rather their emergence and development is often directly influenced by history and path-dependency, this paper elaborates how trap-like situations can emerge with increase in climate uncertainty over time. Three strategies to address policy traps due to climate change form subjects of inquiry in this paper: avoiding traps in the first place, designing against traps, and overcoming traps once in them. Each requires a specific type of design thinking and practice.","[Nair, Sreeja; Howlett, Michael] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, 469 C Bukit Timah Rd,Oei Tiong Ham Bldg, Singapore 259772, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Nair, S (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, 469 C Bukit Timah Rd,Oei Tiong Ham Bldg, Singapore 259772, Singapore.",sreeja.nair@u.nus.edu,"Howlett, Michael/W-7544-2019","Howlett, Michael/0000-0003-4689-740X; Nair, Sreeja/0000-0003-3179-7238",,,,,67,24,24,1,16,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",1862-4065,1862-4057,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

This is surprising because the proportions of individual crops in the total crop area have changed considerably over periods of time much shorter than those typically investigated in climate change studies. The flexibility of farmers to adapt to changing socioeconomic and environmental conditions by changing crop type may therefore also represent an alternative option to adapt to climate change. The objective of this case study was to investigate the potential of crop substitution as an adaptation strategy to climate change. We compared biomass yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of maize (Zea mays L) and pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum L.) grown in the semi-arid northeast of Iran for fodder production under present and potential future climatic conditions. Climate change projections for the baseline period 1970-2005 and two future time periods (2011-2030 and 2080-2099) from two emission scenarios (A2 and B1) and four general circulation models were downscaled to daily time steps using the Long Ashton Research Station-Weather Generator (LARS-WG5). Above-ground biomass was simulated for seven research sites with the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT 4.5) model which was calibrated and tested with independent experimental data from different field experiments in the region. The analysis of observations across all study locations showed an inverse relationship between temperature and biomass yield for both pearl millet and maize. Biomass yield was most sensitive to the duration of the phenological phase from floral initiation to end of leaf growth. For this phase we also found the highest negative correlation between mean temperature and biomass yield, which was more pronounced for pearl millet than for maize. This relationship was well reproduced by the crop model, justifying its use for the assessment. Due to the higher sensitivity of pearl millet to temperature increase, simulations suggest that the maximum benefit of crop substitution for biomass yield and WUE is to be gained for present-day conditions and would decline under future warming. The simulated increase in biomass yield due to substitution of maize by pearl millet was nevertheless larger than the yield decrease from potential climate change. Therefore, substituting maize by pearl millet should be considered as a measure for increasing fodder production in the investigated region. Differences in yields of crops that may substitute for each other because of similar use have been shown for other regions under current and potential future climatic conditions as well, so that we suggest that our findings are of general importance for climate change research. More research is required to quantify the effects for other crop combinations, regions, and interactions with other adaptation measures.","[Rezaei, E.

However, because climate variability is manifesting with more extreme climate impacts, occurring with greater frequency and with more intensity, the necessity for adaptation to minimize risk is becoming more pronounced. Though this is true of coastal communities around the globe, it is an acutely important concern for coastal communities in high northern latitudes, where the impacts of climate change are occurring at a disproportionate rate. With Homer, Alaska, as a case study, and through the lens of evolutionary governance, this research investigates coastal stressors (eg. storm surges, bluff instability) and subsequent decision dynamics around local government policy and planning for climate adaptation. In particular, the paper explores the relationship between actors and institutions, the connection between power and knowledge, as well as the challenges of path and goal dependencies. Narratives from key informants associated with Homer's climate change agenda highlight that while some stakeholders are keen to mainstream adaptation thinking into long-term strategic planning, adaptation policy remains a low priority (with a focus instead on mitigation). Uptake is further hindered by a belief among key decision-makers that the threat of climate change is a concern for the future. This in turn has resulted in diminished internal capacity (eg. institutions, knowledge) to effectively prepare for climate variability in general. Drawing insights through evolutionary governance theory, this study may provide coastal community decision-makers with an appreciation of the value (and nuanced challenges) of embedding climate adaptation thinking into strategic community planning.","[Birchall, S.

We evaluated functionality of a companion cropping system, 'climate-adapted push-pull', developed for control of cereal stemborers in drier agro-ecologies, as an added tool for the management of fall armyworm. The technology comprises intercropping maize with drought-tolerant greenleaf desmodium, Desmodiwn intortwn (Mill.) Urb., and planting Brachiaria cv Mulato II as a border crop around this intercrop. Protection to maize is provided by semiochemicals that are emitted by the intercrop that repel (push) stemborer moths while those released by the border crop attract (pull) them. 250 farmers who had adopted the technology in drier areas of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania were randomly selected for the study during the long rainy season (March-August) of 2017. Each farmer had a set of two plots, a climate-adapted push pull and a maize monocrop. Data were collected in each plot on the number of fall armyworm larvae on maize, percentage of maize plants damaged by the larvae and maize grain yields. Similarly, farmers' perceptions of the impact of the technology on the pest were assessed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Reductions of 82.7% in average number of larvae per plant and 86.7% in plant damage per plot were observed in climate-adapted push-pull compared to maize monocrop plots. Similarly, maize grain yields were significantly higher, 2.7 times, in the climate-adapted push-pull plots. Farmers rated the technology significantly superior in reducing fall armyworm infestation and plant damage rates. These results demonstrate that the technology is effective in controlling fall armyworm with concomitant maize grain yield increases, and represent the first documentation of a technology that can be immediately deployed for management of the pest in East Africa and beyond.","[Midega, Charles A.

This work presents the project 'Mertola, a Lab for the Future' as a learning case of a Transformational Plan in the Mediterranean semi-arid region based on Landsenses Ecology. It is a project of agroecological transition, adaptation to climate change and desertification combat that places the local community leadership in the planning of a more sustainable and resilient future. The paper proposes Transformational Plans as a tool to promote networks for the sharing of technical-scientific, political and practical/lay knowledge enhancing a people-centred and place-based change. The learning case methodology follows an analysis showing a set of good governance practices for sustainability, through six transformation domains: access to natural ecosystems, knowledge and culture, systems of exchange, networks, equity, and discourse. Results show a strong articulation between the learning case and the UN 2030 Agenda, highlighting SDGs location and territorialization practices. This kind of projects, which strongly connects with governance and its multilevel and territorial translation, have a great potential for the Landsenses Ecology, contributing to innovate in governance approaches. The same place-based approach could be used and replicated by other territories in the Mediterranean semi-arid region to develop their Transformational Plans for accelerating transformation towards more sustainable territories.","[Cortegano, Marta] Univ Lisbon FCUP, Fac Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes CE3c, Campo Grande 016, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Cortegano, Marta] Coll Food, Farming & Forestry F3, Lisbon, Portugal; [Cortegano, Marta] Terra Sintrop Assoc, Beja, Mertola, Portugal; [Dias, Ricardo Cunha; Seixas, Paulo Castro] Univ Lisboa UL, Inst Social & Polit Sci ISCSP, Ctr Publ Adm & Publ Policies CAPP, Lisbon, Portugal; [Guedes Vidal, Diogo] Univ Fernando Pessoa UFP, UFP Energy Environm & Hlth Res Unit FP ENAS, Porto, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"Cortegano, M (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon FCUP, Fac Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes CE3c, Campo Grande 016, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.",Marta20@campus.ul.pt,"Seixas, Paulo/AAT-9051-2021; Seixas, Paulo/ABC-5570-2021; Vidal, Diogo Guedes/U-1156-2017","Seixas, Paulo/0000-0001-9209-8188; Vidal, Diogo Guedes/0000-0002-2777-2372; Dias, Ricardo/0000-0002-3801-1851",Leopold Bachmann Stiftung; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UIDB/00713/2020]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [UIDB/00713/2020] Funding Source: FCT,Leopold Bachmann Stiftung; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia,This work was supported by the Leopold Bachmann Stiftung and by the Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia through the project UIDB/00713/2020.,,40,1,1,8,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1350-4509,1745-2627,,INT J SUST DEV WORLD,Int.

However biofortification is a key challenge to satisfy nutritional needs in vitamins for developing countries and new consumer's needs for developed countries. China and the USA lead scientific research in crop editing. Nigeria, being headquarters to numerous research consortia, is the most involved country in Africa. Genome editing in animals including pig, cattle, sheep, and carp, has not merely accelerated research but has made possible research that was previously unfeasible. It has been used to increase disease resistance, to make livestock better adapted to farming or environmental conditions, to increase fertility and growth, and to improve animal welfare. The USA, the UK and China are the most involved countries in animal genome editing. Global food production needs to increase as much as 70 per cent to support the growing population. Genome editing could contribute improving the efficiency of food distribution and reducing waste.

However, the role of livelihood capital in reducing climatic vulnerability is uncertain. This study assesses vulnerability and identifies the effects of common capital indicators on it, using Australian wheat as an example. We calculate exposure (a climate index) and sensitivity (a wheat failure index) to measure vulnerability and classify the resilient and sensitive cases, and express adaptive capacity through financial, human, natural, physical, and social capital indicators for 12 regions in the Australian wheat-sheep production zone from 1991-2010. We identify relationships between 12 indicators of five types of capital and vulnerability with t-tests and six logistic models considering the capital indicator itself, its first-order lag and its square as dependent variables to test the hypothesis that a high level of each capital metric results in low vulnerability. Through differing adaptive capacities between resilient and sensitive groups, we found that only four of the 12 (e.g., the access to finance, cash income level, total crop gross revenues, and family share of farm income) relate to vulnerability, which challenges the hypothesis that increasing capital reduces vulnerability. We conclude that further empirical reexaminations are required to test the relationships between capital measures and vulnerability under the sustainable livelihood framework (SLF).","[Huai, Jianjun] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China,"Huai, JJ (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",h2009j.happy@163.com,,"Huai, Jianjun/0000-0003-4175-2260","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473196]; Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry (SRF for ROCS and SEM); Program of the National Apple Industrial System of China [CARS-28]; CSIRO's Sustainable Agriculture Flagship; Australian National Outlook Initiative; Chinese Scholarship Council","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry (SRF for ROCS and SEM)(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars); Program of the National Apple Industrial System of China; CSIRO's Sustainable Agriculture Flagship; Australian National Outlook Initiative; Chinese Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council)","This work was supported by the Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant No. 71473196, Project Sponsored by the Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry (sponsored by SRF for ROCS and SEM), and the Program of the National Apple Industrial System of China Grant No. CARS-28, the CSIRO's Sustainable Agriculture Flagship and Australian National Outlook Initiative, and the Chinese Scholarship Council.

Rainfall patterns were analyzed in the semi-arid Machakos and Makueni counties of eastern Kenya using historical data. A total of forty-three smallholder farmers implementing soil water management practices were sampled, and an estimate of the seasonal water budget for current crop and livestock production systems computed. Analysis of rainfall amounts and distribution shows increasing variability, with the average annual total amounts decreasing over the past 50 years. Furthermore, the number of rainy days within the March-April-May season that can support crop growth is gradually decreasing. These decreases are however not significant at P < 0.05. There were more seasons with low rainfall amounts compared to those with high rainfall amounts. All these subject the smallholder crop and livestock production system to limited soil moisture. Farmers address the risk by harnessing and utilizing green (rainfall stored in soil) and blue (rainfall collected into storage tanks) water technologies. The study found that farmers in these semi-arid counties practice fifteen diverse soil and water management interventions on their farms. The most popular practices are cut-off drains, retention ditches, terracing, run-off harvesting, and agroforestry. The estimated seasonal water budget indicates the need for integrated soil and water management interventions to address the crop and livestock production constraints.","[Recha, John Walker; Nyasimi, Mary; Kimeli, Philip K.; Kinyangi, James M.; Radeny, Maren] Int Livestock Res Inst, Agr & Food Secur, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change, POB 30709 00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mati, Bancy M.] Jomo Kenyatta Univ Agr & Technol, Water Res & Resource Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture & Technology,"Recha, JW (corresponding author), Int Livestock Res Inst, Agr & Food Secur, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change, POB 30709 00100, Nairobi, Kenya.",j.recha@cgiar.org,"Nyasimi, Mary/T-3724-2019","Nyasimi, Mary/0000-0001-5728-3388; Recha, John/0000-0002-1146-7197","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)","This study was financially supported by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).",,19,13,13,0,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1532-4982,1532-4990,,ARID LAND RES MANAG,Arid Land Res.

Based on the review of the equity and cost-effectiveness literature and relevant policy documents, we identify three potential indicators for equity (vulnerability level, poverty, equal funding per capita), and three indicators for cost-effectiveness (economic savings in absolute and relative terms, human lives saved). Applying these simple indicators to information provided in all 39 project documents considered by the Adaptation Fund Board (AFB) in 2011, we find that projects approved or endorsed by the AFB rank high according to one cost-effectiveness indicator (absolute economic savings), while they rather rank low according to all equity and further cost-effectiveness indicators. Furthermore, we analyze whether equity and cost-effectiveness are two contradicting goals, or whether ways can be found to reconcile both goals in multilateral adaptation finance. We conclude from both the theory and the 39 analyzed project documents that a pure economic definition of cost-effectiveness tends to be in contradiction with equity but that trade-offs between equity and cost-effectiveness can be limited if relative economic savings or human live savings are used as indicator for cost-effectiveness.","[Stadelmann, Martin; Michaelowa, Axel] Univ Zurich, Dept Polit Sci, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Stadelmann, Martin; Michaelowa, Axel] Univ Zurich, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Persson, Asa] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Persson, Asa] Stockholm Environm Inst, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Ratajczak-Juszko, Izabela] RMIT Univ, Global Cities Res Inst, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia",University of Zurich; University of Zurich; Stockholm University; Stockholm Environment Institute; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Stadelmann, M (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Polit Sci, Affolternstr 56, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",martin.stadelmann@pw.uzh.ch,"Persson, Åsa/ABD-8096-2021","Michaelowa, Axel/0000-0001-5053-3700; Persson, Asa/0000-0002-8886-5046",,,,,69,30,31,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Birds use increasing photoperiod during spring as the major cue to time gonadal maturation and breeding so that nestlings are growing during peak food (normally invertebrate) abundance. Climate warming will advance invertebrate abundance, so birds relying entirely on photoperiod will breed too late. Can temperature modulate responses to photoperiod? 2. Common Starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, were kept in two indoor aviaries, in which photoperiod tracked natural changes, but temperature was held at either 20 degrees C or 5 degrees C (year 1), or at 18 degrees C or 8 degrees C (year 2). 3. Despite the large differences in temperature (15 degrees C and 10 degrees C), this had no effect on the rate or timing of testicular maturation. 4. However, unexpectedly, testicular regression occurred significantly earlier at the higher temperatures. Post-nuptial moult also started significantly earlier in both males and females. 5. Therefore, the degree to which birds can advance the timing of egg-laying in response to increasing spring temperature may be constrained. At the same time, increasing spring temperature will advance the end of the breeding season (fewer breeding attempts). The reported advances in median egg-laying dates may, in part, be a consequence of this rather than an indication of successful adaptation. Adaptation to climate change may require evolutionary changes in the physiological responses to photoperiod.","Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Huntingdon PE28 2LS, England",UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH),"Dawson, A (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Huntingdon PE28 2LS, England.",ASDA@ceh.ac.uk,"Dawson, Alistair/B-4221-2012","Dawson, Alistair/0000-0001-6492-872X",,,,,33,73,75,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Additionally, as an NbS, NFM aims to provide further multiple benefits, such as increased biodiversity and improved water quality as well as improved mental health. The implementation of NbS often needs private-owned or managed land, yet can create conflicts between the different stakeholders which can undermine the social consensus required for successful implementation. Consequently, a main question is how the multiple benefits and requirements of NFM can be delivered to meet the different goals of the wide variety of stakeholders who must be involved. This article discusses the challenges and potential of implementing NFM as an alternative to the traditional technical mitigation measures in flood risk management. We outline four opportunities in the implementation of NFM: physical conditions of the catchment, social interaction, financial resources, and institutional setting. Their importance is then demonstrated and compared to different examples across the globe.

We analysed the projected changes in drought characteristics relative to historical drought conditions in Central Asia using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index based on both gridded observations and an ensemble of bias-corrected and spatially disaggregated global circulation models (GCMs) from phase 6 of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The results suggest that precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are projected to increase across Central Asia. Even though the change in wetness may not be significant and robust, a dry gets drier and wet gets wetter pattern may emerge in future under different scenarios. Drought events in Central Asia's semi-arid and arid regions (aridity index <0.5) are projected to become more frequent (>125%), with longer duration (>55%), higher severity (>74%) and intensity (>8%) by the end of the 21st century under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. In the coming period of 2021-2050, Central Asia is expected to have more drought events with a longer duration but lower intensity. Comparisons between different SSP scenarios stress the importance of climate change mitigation strategies to avoid more drought occurrence, longer drought duration and higher drought severity.

Due to the complexity of this process, urban transport planners may not always be aware of all challenges they must face, leading to maladaptation or lack of adaptation of the transport systems of their cities. Recognising this complexity, this paper identifies barriers and opportunities for effective adaptation planning via a socio-technical perspective. An existing analytical framework, previously used in some cities of Latin America and Germany, is adopted and applied to a case study of Bogot ' a, Colombia. Interviews conducted with local professionals and a review of policy documents and technical reports provided insight into city governance processes and the extent to which climate change adaptation shapes transport sector decisions. The study reveals that incomplete or unusable information about climate change and its effects, reduced availability of economic and human resources, and the lack of adequate incentives are limiting adaptation within the transport planning processes of the city. It also demonstrates the critical influence of the institutional structure in determining which infrastructure options are considered feasible and preferable. The study elucidates what levers are available to transport planners and why some solutions are just not considered. There is potential for this study to be replicated in other parts of the world to help support the development of effective systemic intervention to support adaptation.","[Herrera, Juan Sebastian Canavera; MacAskill, Kristen] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England",University of Cambridge,"Herrera, JSC (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England.",jsc80@cantab.ac.uk; kam71@cam.ac.uk,,,CEIBA (Fundacion Ceiba); Cambridge Trust; EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Infrastructure and Built Environment (EPSRC) [EP/L016095/1]; Mayor of Bogota (Alcaldia Mayor de Bogota),CEIBA (Fundacion Ceiba); Cambridge Trust; EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Infrastructure and Built Environment (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Mayor of Bogota (Alcaldia Mayor de Bogota),This research has been funded by the Mayor of Bogota (Alcaldia Mayor de Bogota) and the CEIBA (Fundacion Ceiba) through the scholarship Beca Rodolfo Llin as para la promocion de la formacion avanzada y el espiritu cientifico en Bogota; and by the Cambridge Trust.,,44,1,1,2,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1361-9209,1879-2340,,TRANSPORT RES D-TR E,Transport.

Although many studies have explored the association between increasing temperatures and negative health outcomes, research on the associated costs of heat-related diseases remains relatively sparse. Furthermore, estimations of future costs associated with heat-attributable hospital healthcare have not been well explored. This study used a distributed lag nonlinear model to estimate heat-attributable hospital healthcare costs in Perth, Western Australia. Using 2006-2012 as the baseline, future costings for 2026-2032 and 2046-2052 were estimated under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5.

The total hospital costs attributable to heat over the baseline period 2006-2012 was estimated to be 79.5 million AUD, with costs for mental health hospitalizations being the largest contributor of the heat-related conditions examined. Costs are estimated to increase substantially to 125.8-129.1 million AUD in 2026-2032, and 174.1-190.3 million AUD by midcentury under climate change scenarios. Our findings of a notable burden of heat-attributable healthcare costs now and in the future emphasize the importance of climate change adaptation measures to reduce the adverse health effects of increasing temperatures and heat exposure on the people of Perth.","[Tong, Michael Xiaoliang; Wondmagegn, Berhanu Yazew; Williams, Susan; Hansen, Alana; Dear, Keith; Pisaniello, Dino; Xiang, Jianjun; Nairn, John; Bi, Peng] Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Xiao, Jianguo; Jian, Le; Scalley, Ben] Dept Hlth, Perth, WA 6004, Australia; [Nitschke, Monika] Dept Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Nairn, John] Australian Bur Meteorol, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Bambrick, Hilary] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Publ Hlth & Social Work, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Karnon, Jonathan] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Med & Publ Hlth, Bedford Pk, SA 5001, Australia",University of Adelaide; Bureau of Meteorology - Australia; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Flinders University South Australia,"Bi, P (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",peng.bi@adelaide.edu.au,"Jian, Le/B-9180-2012; Xiao, Jian/GYU-4351-2022; Tong, Michael/I-8808-2012; Nitschke, Monika/GNP-3597-2022","Tong, Michael/0000-0002-9694-9207; Bambrick, Hilary/0000-0001-5361-950X; Dear, Keith/0000-0002-0788-7404; Karnon, Jonathan/0000-0003-3220-2099",National Health and Medical Research Council [APP1145239],National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),"This study was supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council (APP1145239).

Contemporary political geographical scholarship has since called into question the coherency of the state as a unitary entity and as the sole legitimate arbiter of international politics. This article extends these contributions to planetary climate change adaptation. Through discourse analysis and the multi-scalar institutional and political history of climate planning, this article examines how normative discursive parameters enact prevailing political dynamics that script material futures. Drawing on recent climate planning reports of Palestine and Israel, this article investigates how state discourses operate within an asymmetric geopolitical context where issues of territoriality, sovereignty, and statecraft remain fractured and contested. Climate planning in Israel/Palestine exposes two key institutional constraints of climate governance. First, technical-managerial principles prescribe ahistorical adaptation measures that inadequately address inherently political constraints. Second, the elision of politicaleconomic and historical-cultural contingencies in favor of a universalizing geophysical representation of climate change elides the systemic production of differentiated vulnerability. Consequential of an anachronistic politics of recognition within the UNFCCC, the conditions of climate governance may ultimately embolden the asymmetric status quo. I conclude by highlighting the spatial manifestations (both material and symbolic) of Israeli sovereign violence and the chronic indeterminacy of Palestinian territoriality produced by discursive climate futures.","[Weinger, Benjamin Kaplan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, 315 Portola Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Weinger, BK (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, 315 Portola Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",bweinger@ucla.edu,,"Weinger, Benjamin/0000-0002-6317-4206",National Science Foundation [DGE-1650604],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"To Mohammed Rafi Arefin, John Agnew, Rosalind Fredericks, Karen Holmberg and Joseph Kaplan Weinger: for your politics of generosity, your commitments to different ways of being and knowing, and your resolve to keeping afloat in this heavy world, thank you.

Yet the extent to which foresters across the tropics implement adaptation actions in anticipation to climate change impacts remains largely unexplored. In this paper, an assessment of the perceptions of climate risks and the implementation of adaptation actions by forest managers and decision makers dealing with natural and planted tropical forests destined for production purpose; is presented. An electronic questionnaire was disseminated globally during 2009, and 152 responses were received from Africa, the Americas, and Asia and the Pacific. Respondents perceived that natural and planted forests are at risk from being affected by climate change. However, they seemed ambivalent when asked if investing in adaptation was currently justified. The results of this survey provide initial insights into how climate considerations are being anticipated in tropical forest management and planning yet further examination at the national and local levels is warranted on how foresters, including those from the tropics, perceive climate change risks and handle current uncertainties in order to take action. The fact that climate change ranked below other threats to forests such as commercial agriculture and unplanned logging nevertheless suggests that long-term forest planning and management is not perceived by respondents as viable given other major drivers of forest loss and degradation.","[Guariguata, M.

We examine the feasibility of using an international carbon tax to finance an integrated investment programme in sustainable energy technology (including climate change mitigation) and the reduction of poverty (including climate change adaptation). A simple evaluation of responsibility for anthropogenic climate change based on cumulative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to stabilisation per capita (using current populations) suggests that currently India and China remain under-spent by 99% and 78% for stringent, 445-490 ppm CO2-equivalent (CO2-eq) targets, respectively, whilst the USA and EC are already overspent for targets of 710-855 and 545-590 ppm CO2-eq, respectively. It would therefore appear equitable to charge the tax only in developed nations. The potential advantages and disadvantages of an integrated investment programme and available policy instruments for a tax of this type are discussed, drawing on relevant literature. Although a cost-benefit analysis using suitable simulations that include revenue recycling is required, revenues estimated from documented carbon tax simulations appear sufficient to meet a significant proportion of the estimated investment requirement. With increasing public awareness and an integrated campaign, obtaining agreement for this type of ambitious international measures could soon become realistic. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This study assessed the perceptions of coastal communities on climate change, and the contribution of mangroves in their resilience to climate change in the southern Cote d'Ivoire. Individual interviews (n = 120) were conducted in four coastal villages, selected based on their proximity to mangroves. Data were analyzed using the Chi-Square test simple correspondence analysis. Informants' knowledge on climate change was low. However, the scarcity of rainfall (62%), increased temperature (heat) (32%), and the high frequency of high winds (6%) have been cited as indicators of changes in the climate. More than half of respondents (63.3%) agreed that mangroves help people adapt to climate change because they produce more fish, shield people from poverty, and lessen flooding, storms, and erosion in their communities. This study has demonstrated a substantial relationship between the level of mangrove significance knowledge and the profession practiced in terms of whether it is affected by climate change. People with higher levels of education and members of particular professions frequently know more about climate change. The profession is a key driver in the knowledge of the contribution of mangroves in protecting fish fauna against climate change. Mangroves reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities to the effects of climate change through their ecosystem services which include fish productivity (which provides income to fishermen and fish sellers as well as alternative income to farmers), protection against flooding and erosion, and more. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to conserve this ecosystem at all costs.","[Kochoni, Babatonde Innocent] Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, Ctr Excellence Africain Changements Climat Biodive, UFR Biosci, Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire; [Kochoni, Babatonde Innocent; Sinsin, Corine Bitossessi Laurenda] Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Agron Sci, Lab Biomath & Estimat Forestieres, 04 BP 1525, Cotonou, Benin; [Avakoudjo, Hospice Gerard Gracias] Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Agron Sci, Lab Ecol Appl, 01 BP 526, Cotonou, Benin; [Kamelan, Tanoh Marius; Kouamelan, Essetchi Paul] Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, Lab Hydrobiol & Ecotechnol eaux, UFR Biosci, 22, BP 582, Abidjan 22, Cote d'Ivoire",,"Avakoudjo, HGG (corresponding author), Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Agron Sci, Lab Ecol Appl, 01 BP 526, Cotonou, Benin.",babatonde007@gmail.com; graciasavakoudjo@gmail.com; ktmarius@gmail.com; corinesinsin@gmail.com; kessetch2012@gmail.com,,,,,,,75,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0343-2521,1572-9893,,GEOJOURNAL,GeoJournal,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10708-023-10845-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-023-10845-2,,FEB 2023,17,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,9I3CQ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000939393400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Evapotranspiration (ET) data are key in determining the water requirements of crops and set efficient irrigation schedules. Estimating ET at the regional scale (for example, in irrigation districts) is a technically complex task that has been tackled by using data acquired by remote sensors on satellites that can be validated with scaled up field measurements when area sources are matched. Energy and matter flux measurements using the eddy covariance (EC) technique are challenging due to balance closure issues, claimed to be due to the different footprints of the energy-balance components. We describe net radiometer footprints in terms of the sun-sensor geometry to characterize the bidirectional distribution functions of albedo and thermal emissions. In this context, we describe a one-parameter model of the components of net radiation that can be calibrated with a single data point. The model was validated in an experiment with five agricultural crops (bean, sorghum, chickpea, safflower, and wheat) at Valle del Yaqui, in Sonora, Mexico, using different sun-sensor geometry configurations. The results from the experimental fits were satisfactory (R-2 > 0.99) and support the use of the model for albedo and radiative (surface) temperature in order to estimate net radiation. The analysis of the implications regarding a mismatch among footprints of the components of the energy balance showed that net radiometer fluxes are overestimated most of the time, implying that the closure problem could be solved by using a similar footprint as the aerodynamic components of the energy balance.","[Paz, Fernando; Marin, Ma Isabel] Colegio Postgrad, GRENASER, Campus Montecillo, Montecillo 56230, Mexico; [Garatuza, Jaime; Yepez, Enrico A.] Inst Tecnol Sonora, Dept Ciencias Agua & Medio Ambiente, Obregon 85000, Mexico; [Watts, Christopher] Univ Sonora, Dept Fis, Hermosillo 83000, Sonora, Mexico; [Rodriguez, Julio Cesar] Univ Sonora, Dept Agr & Ganaderia, Hermosillo 83323, Sonora, Mexico; [Libert, Antoine] Programa Mexicano Carbono, Texcoco 56225, Mexico; [Bolanos, Martin Alejandro] Colegio Postgrad, Posgrad Hidrociencias, Campus Montecillo, Montecillo 56230, Mexico",Colegio de Postgraduados - Mexico; Universidad de Sonora; Universidad de Sonora; Colegio de Postgraduados - Mexico,"Bolanos, MA (corresponding author), Colegio Postgrad, Posgrad Hidrociencias, Campus Montecillo, Montecillo 56230, Mexico.",christopher.watts@correo.fisica.uson.mx; jcrod2001@yahoo.com; antoinelibert@hotmail.com; martinb72@gmail.com,"Rodriguez, Julio/AHC-8156-2022; Yepez, Enrico/C-2802-2014","Bolanos Gonzalez, Martin Alejandro/0000-0002-8110-1051; Libert, Antoine/0000-0002-9716-0283; Rodriguez, Julio C/0000-0001-9143-9198; Yepez, Enrico/0000-0003-4746-573X; Paz Pellat, Fernando/0000-0002-6697-2238",European Commission,European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),PLEIADES with financial support from the European Commission.,,74,0,0,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2021,13,21,,,,,,,3028,10.3390/w13213028,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13213028,,,22,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,WX3YH,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000718534900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous reviews found little or no soil organic C (SOC) accrual in NT soils as compared with full inversion tillage when soils are sampled deeper than 30 cm. Here, we present the results of a global meta-analysis of studies assessing SOC and total N (TN) storage and dynamics in NT and tilled soils from the most important agricultural regions of the world. Overall, our results show that NT soils stored 6.7 +/- 1.9 Mg C ha(-1) and 1.1 +/- 0.4 Mg N ha(-1) more than tilled soils (0-to-100-cm depth) with an average of 16 yr of NT, in contrast with previous findings. However, C sequestration (+4.7 +/- 1.9 Mg C ha(-1) in the 0-to-60-cm depth with an average of 11 yr of NT) depended on the association of NT with increased crop frequency and the inclusion of legumes cover crops. Single-cropping systems lack the necessary C inputs to offset SOC losses in the soil profile (below 30-cm depth). However, double-cropping systems decreased soil TN that may constrain future C sequestration. The use of legumes alleviated TN loss and supported soil C sequestration. Briefly, our findings indicate that NT can avoid SOC losses from tilled soils, partially offsetting CO2 emissions from agriculture. Moreover, NT with agricultural intensification can promote soil C sequestration, thus contributing to soil quality, food security, and adaptation to climate change.","[Nicoloso, Rodrigo S.] Embrapa Swine & Poultry, C Postal 321,BR 153 Km 110, BR-89715899 Concordia, SC, Brazil; [Rice, Charles W.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agron, 2701 Throckmorton Ctr, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA); Kansas State University,"Nicoloso, RS (corresponding author), Embrapa Swine & Poultry, C Postal 321,BR 153 Km 110, BR-89715899 Concordia, SC, Brazil.",rodrigo.nicoloso@embrapa.br,"Nicoloso, Rodrigo/B-5342-2008","Nicoloso, Rodrigo/0000-0002-6087-3538; Rice, Charles/0000-0002-1782-0908",Bayer Corporation; National Science Foundation [EPS-0903806]; State of Kansas through Kansas Technology Enterprise Corporation,Bayer Corporation(Bayer AG); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); State of Kansas through Kansas Technology Enterprise Corporation,"Bayer Corporation; National Science Foundation, Grant/AwardNumber: EPS-0903806; State of Kansas through Kansas Technology Enterprise Corporation",,63,9,9,5,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0361-5995,1435-0661,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

Recent scientific advances have identified sources of predictability on this time range, and modeling advances are leading to better forecasts. However, much remains to be done to further improve their skill and to develop new climate service forecast products to help countries and sectorial decision makers better manage weather risks and extremes and to adapt to climate change. This paper reviews the history and describes the main challenges and opportunities for the modeling and forecast-applications communities to improve subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) forecasts and products, along with current developments catalyzed by the World Weather Research Programme and World Climate Research Programme's joint Sub-Seasonal to Seasonal Prediction Project. The case of tropical cyclones is highlighted as an illustrative example of the points discussed. Plain Language Summary The forecast range between weather forecasts and seasonal outlooks was long thought to be a predictability desert with little forecast skill. However, many management decisions in agriculture and food security, water, disaster risk reduction, and health fall into this gap in prediction capabilities, so that developing forecast capabilities for this time range would be of considerable societal value. New research and better models have begun to close this gap through increased international collaboration between weather and climate forecasting centers, national research programs, and the academic and user communities. Better understanding of the coupled ocean-atmosphere-land-cryosphere system has identified multiple sources of S2S predictability that are starting to be exploited to fill the prediction gap spurred by creation of new forecast databases.","[Robertson, Andrew W.] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc IRI, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Vitart, Frederic] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF, Reading, Berks, England; [Camargo, Suzana J.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY USA",Columbia University; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); Columbia University,"Robertson, AW (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc IRI, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",awr@iri.columbia.edu,"Camargo, Suzana J./C-6106-2009","Camargo, Suzana J./0000-0002-0802-5160; Robertson, Andrew/0000-0002-9187-3805",Columbia University's Center for Climate and Life; NOAA [NA16OAR4310079],Columbia University's Center for Climate and Life; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"The authors are grateful to their many colleagues and to the members of the S2S steering and liaison groups, without whom the research reported would not have been possible.

Study results demonstrated that the impact of climate change in the increase of watershed sediment yield is more than the stream flow and varies from 35.9 to 47.7% for the period 2040-2069. Implementing conservation practices under climate change can reduce the sediment yield of watershed up to 7.2% and for the sub-basin scale up to 46.4%. Range management practices were found to be the most effective practice in the decrease of sediment at the sub-basin scale and porous gully plugs and terrace construction, the most effective at the watershed scale. The results indicate that soil and water conservation practices will be more effective at reducing sediment yields under anticipated future climates. Though, implementation of each conservation practice solely was not sufficient to compensate for climate change-driven increases in sediment yield. This study provides valuable information for watershed managers and decision makers regarding selection of soil and water conservation practices for adaptation to climate change.","[Azari, Mahmood] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Dept Range & Watershed Management, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, Mashhad, Khorasan Razavi, Iran; [Saghafian, Bahram] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Tech & Engn, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Moradi, Hamid Reza] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Watershed Management Engn, Coll Nat Resources, Noor, Mazandaran Prov, Iran; [Faramarzi, Monireh] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada",Ferdowsi University Mashhad; Islamic Azad University; Tarbiat Modares University; University of Alberta,"Azari, M (corresponding author), Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Dept Range & Watershed Management, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, Mashhad, Khorasan Razavi, Iran.",m.azari@Ferdowsi.um.ac.ir,"Saghafian, Bahram/AAT-9822-2021; Azari, Mahmood/AAA-9521-2020","Azari, Mahmood/0000-0002-8736-5867; Faramarzi, Monireh/0000-0001-9190-2824",Tarbiat Modarres University,Tarbiat Modarres University,"The authors would like to thank Tarbiat Modarres University for financially supporting this publication.

This paper presents an assessment framework that allows the identification of adaptation strategies that are robust (i.e. insensitive) to climate change uncertainties. The framework is applied to a case study of water resources management in the East of England, more specifically to the Anglian Water Services' 25 year Water Resource Plan (WRP). The paper presents a local sensitivity analysis (a 'one-at-a-time' experiment) of the various elements of the modelling framework (e.g., emissions of greenhouse gases, climate sensitivity and global climate models) in order to determine whether or not a decision to adapt to climate change is sensitive to uncertainty in those elements. Water resources are found to be sensitive to uncertainties in regional climate response (from general circulation models and dynamical downscaling), in climate sensitivity and in climate impacts. Aerosol forcing and greenhouse gas emissions uncertainties are also important, whereas uncertainties from ocean mixing and the carbon cycle are not. Despite these large uncertainties, Anglian Water Services' WRP remains robust to the climate change uncertainties sampled because of the adaptation options being considered (e.g. extension of water treatment works), because the climate model used for their planning (HadCM3) predicts drier conditions than other models, and because 'one-at-a-time' experiments do not sample the combination of different extremes in the uncertainty range of parameters. This research raises the question of how much certainty is required in climate change projections to justify investment in adaptation measures, and whether such certainty can be delivered.

Early warning systems (EWS) are a key climate change adaptation strategy for the health sector. An EWS can integrate climate information in forecasting models to predict the risk of disease outbreaks several weeks or months in advance. In this article, we share our experiences of co-learning during the process of co-creating a dengue EWS for the health sector in Barbados, and we discuss barriers to implementation as well as key opportunities. This process has involved bringing together health and climate practitioners with transdisciplinary researchers to jointly identify needs and priorities, assess available data, co-create an early warning tool, gather feedback via national and regional consultations and conduct trainings. Implementation is ongoing and our team continues to be committed to a long-term process of collaboration. Developing strong partnerships, particularly between the climate and health sectors in Barbados, has been a critical part of the research and development. In many countries, the national climate and health sectors have not worked together in a sustained or formal manner. This collaborative process has purposefully pushed us out of our comfort zone, challenging us to venture beyond our institutional and disciplinary silos. Through the co-creation of the EWS, we anticipate that the Barbados health system will be better able to mainstream climate information into decision-making processes using tailored tools, such as epidemic forecast reports, risk maps and climate-health bulletins, ultimately increasing the resilience of the health system.","[Stewart-Ibarra, Anna M.] Interamer Inst Global Change Res, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Rollock, Leslie] Minist Hlth & Wellness, St Michael, Barbados; [Best, Sabu; Brown, Tia] Barbados Meteorol Serv, Christ Church, Barbados; [Diaz, Avriel R.] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc IRI, Climate Sch, New York, NY USA; [Dunbar, Willy] Florida Int Univ, Dept Hlth Promot & Dis Prevent, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Lippi, Catherine A.; Ryan, Sadie J.] Univ Florida, Dept Geog & Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL USA; [Mahon, Roche; Trotman, Adrian; Van Meerbeeck, Cedric J.] Caribbean Inst Meteorol & Hydrol, Bridgetown, Parish Of Saint, Barbados; [Lowe, Rachel] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Ctr Climate Change & Planetary Hlth, London, England; [Lowe, Rachel] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Ctr Math Modelling Infect Dis, London, England; [Lowe, Rachel] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Earth Sci Dept, Barcelona, Spain; [Lowe, Rachel] Catalan Inst Res & Adv Studies ICREA, Barcelona, Spain",Columbia University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC-CNS); ICREA,"Stewart-Ibarra, AM (corresponding author), Interamer Inst Global Change Res, Montevideo, Uruguay.",astewart@dir.iai.int,"Lowe, Rachel/GXN-3278-2022; Ryan, Sadie Jane/H-7488-2019","Ryan, Sadie Jane/0000-0002-4308-6321; Dunbar, Willy/0000-0002-9134-9288; Lippi, Catherine/0000-0002-7988-0324",,,,,35,0,0,4,7,BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND",2059-7908,,,BMJ GLOB HEALTH,BMJ Glob.

This study aims to better understand the co-evolution of human-water systems in floodplains. Specifically, farmers' opinions on flooding, dike effects, and living conditions in different dike systems in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta floodplain are compared to explore possible connections between human perceptions and dike development processes by employing in-depth interviews of 7 officials and oral surveys of 100 farmers supported by a literature review. Local specific contexts have resulted in various dike systems. One mixed-low-dike-dominant, two mixed-high-dike -domi-nant, and one only-high-dike zones are found in the research area. High dikes have been operating in an ad hoc re-sponse to short-term demands in the mixed-dike zones while strictly following a provincial schedule in the only-high-dike zone. The Fisher-Freeman-Halton test was used to compare the farmers' opinions on diverse questions be-tween the zones. Dike development processes are suggested to influence livelihood, transportation, perceived flood peak changes and perceived causes for declining fish stocks. Although it remains challenging to directly attribute these differences to the dike development processes themselves, a new interrelated dike-flood-livelihood feedback loop is proposed for floodplains. Insights obtained are expected to support decision makers formulating tailored climate change adaptation policies to the different socio-hydrological zones. Our findings also contribute to the current understanding of international scientific communities on the human-water system and provide materials to further develop socio-hydrological models that strengthen our predictive capability on how the complex system evolves in flood plains.","[Tang Luu; Dung Duc Tran; Hong Quan Nguyen] Vietnam Natl Univ, Ctr Water Management & Climate Change, Inst Environm & Resources, VNU HCM, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Verhallen, Mark] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Sea, William B.] Bemidji State Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies, Bemidji, MN USA; [Thanh Binh Nguyen] Can Tho Univ, Mekong Delta Dev Res Inst, Can Tho, Vietnam; [Hong Quan Nguyen] VNU HCM, Inst Circular Econ Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Vietnam National University Hochiminh City; Wageningen University & Research; Minnesota State Colleges & Universities; Bemidji State University; Can Tho University; Vietnam National University Hochiminh City,"Tran, DD (corresponding author), Vietnam Natl Univ, Ctr Water Management & Climate Change, Inst Environm & Resources, VNU HCM, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",luuthitang@gmail.com; mark.verhallen@wur.nl; dungtranducvn@yahoo.com; william.sea@bemidjistate.edu; ntbinh02@ctu.edu.vn; nh.quan@iced.org.vn,"Luu, Tang/HLQ-6954-2023; Duc Tran, Dung/J-2496-2015","Luu, Tang/0000-0001-7760-1400; Duc Tran, Dung/0000-0003-2331-4996",Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands via IHE Delft Institute for Water Education (DUPC2) [108 474],Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands via IHE Delft Institute for Water Education (DUPC2),"This research is executed under the project entitled Flood-based farming systems for enhancing livelihood resilience in thefloodplain of upper Mekong delta.

Although scholarship on maladaptation highlights the dangers of path dependency, the concept is under-applied for understanding the potential outcomes of development trajectories that result in what we call an adaptation-constrained space. By conducting case-study analysis based on secondary review, we trace implications of particular development trajectories, in urban and rural India. The first case examines how urbanization in Bangalore city has decreased the capacity to respond to concurrent risks of flooding and water scarcity while the second charts how agricultural policies in India have narrowed local capacity to deal with climatic and non-climatic uncertainties. Using a historical perspective, we identify triggers of change in local and regional development, which have led to an adaptation-constrained space. We find that both pathways display irreversible lock-ins and inherent trade-offs which entrench inequities (through differential capacity and agency to access resources and influence future development). We argue that such development pathways are potentially maladaptive. Whether they are expected to deal with climate impacts or to meet development goals, the fact that they constrain current and future adaptive capacity at multiple levels, is why we consider them maladaptive. As India undertakes large investments in development and climate change adaptation, this paper adds to the relatively low policy debate on how development trajectories, physically and socially, limit the possibilities for future adaptation. We propose that policy-makers and planners first acknowledge how development trajectories acquire dominance, and then begin empowering normative alternatives that open future adaptation options.","[Gajjar, Sumetee Pahwa; Singh, Chandni; Deshpande, Tanvi] Indian Inst Human Settlements, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS),"Singh, C (corresponding author), Indian Inst Human Settlements, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",csingh@iihs.ac.in,"Singh, Chandni/H-8384-2019; Deshpande, Tanvi V/GRF-5418-2022","Singh, Chandni/0000-0001-6842-6735; Deshpande, Tanvi V/0000-0003-4188-8483","Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA); UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada","Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA); UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada(CGIAR)","This work was carried out under the Adaptation at Scale in Semi-Arid Regions project (ASSAR).

This work can help obtain a deeper understanding of the scientific discourses in terms of identifying research trends and reasons behind these trends, as a possible way forward for research. Scientific publications (N = 519) issued during the period 1988-2014 (and as listed in the SCOPUS database) were analysed with the aims to 1) systematically identify and describe scientific urban forestry discourses, 2) discuss implications of these findings for scientific practice, and 3) propose ways forward. Six discourses of various strength and geographical distribution were identified. Scientific production was found to be dominated by North American and European authors with modest contributions from authors from other continents. Scientific discourses proved mostly expert driven and reflecting the positivist scientific paradigm. Prevailingly managerial orientation and absence of qualitative approaches indicate a lack of deeper understanding of human-environment relations. Studies related to active participation of citizens and partnerships in urban forestry have been missing. More emphasis should be placed on the testing of existing, and developing new methods and modalities of public participation, and on the value of civic involvement for the decision making. Moreover, a more solid evidence base is needed for benefits from urban forests, while economic aspects of biodiversity and other ecosystem services are still insufficiently explored. Study findings also call for more research on urban forest governance and relation between urban forest benefits and existing policies (e.g. climate change adaptation, energy policy or health).

The uncertainties of regional-scale climate models, local-scale climate variability, emissions scenarios, and crop growth models are combined to explore the possible range of climate change effects on rainfed corn yield in central Illinois in 2055. The results show that a drier and warmer summer during the corn growth season and wetter and warmer precrop and postcrop seasons will likely occur. Greater temperature and precipitation variability may lead to more variable soil moisture and crop yield, and larger soil moisture deficit and crop yield reduction are likely to occur more frequently. The increased water stress is likely to be most pronounced during the flowering and yield formation stages. The expected rainfed corn yield in 2055 is likely to decline by 23%-34%, and the probability that the yield may not reach 50% of the potential yield ranges from 32% to 70% if no adaptation measures are instituted. Among the multiple uncertainty sources, the greenhouse gas emissions projection may have the strongest effect on the risk estimate of crop yield reduction. The effects from the various uncertainties can be offset to some degree when the uncertainties are considered jointly. An ensemble of GCMs with an equal weight may overestimate the risk of soil moisture deficits and crop yield reduction in comparison with an ensemble of GCMs with different weight determined by the root-mean-square error minimization method. The risk estimate presented in this paper implies that climate change adaptation is needed to avoid reduced corn yields and the resulting profit losses in central Illinois.","[Cai, Ximing; Wang, Dingbao; Laurent, Romain] Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ven Te Chow Hydrosyst Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Cai, XM (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ven Te Chow Hydrosyst Lab, 205 N Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",xmcai@uiuc.edu,"Wang, Dingbao/B-6948-2012","Wang, Dingbao/0000-0003-4822-7485; Cai, Ximing/0000-0002-7342-4512","U.

Yet structures created under the Kyoto Protocol, like the Adaptation Fund, were left in a state of unprecedented ambiguity because parties had to actively approve their continuation under the Paris Agreement, or risk seeing them fade into history. Drawing on narrative political analysis of negotiating texts and observations at meetings of the Conference of the Parties (COP), we argue that the Adaptation Fund negotiations became a particularly intense site for the contestation of justice-based norms in international climate policy. Developing countries' ardent and almost unanimous support for the continuation of the Adaptation Fund, despite the Fund's relatively small share of international climate finance, provides important insights into processes of norm contestation in international climate negotiations since the Paris Agreement, which marked a significant transition toward liberal norm structures. We explore how this unwavering support for the Adaptation Fund-and the claims to distributive and procedural justice it represents-could impact not only Fund governance and structure in the post-Paris Agreement period, but also the success of future adaptation efforts and the Paris Agreement itself. Key policy insights As global environmental governance moves towards a more liberal conception of justice, developing countries are holding on to specific issues, such as adaptation finance, to preserve distributive justice-based norms, deeply rooted in the history of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). A critical tension in international adaptation finance is contrasting conceptualizations of justice and responsibility. While developed countries increasingly see their climate financing decisions as optional and in the same vein as development aid, developing countries argue that financing is an obligation for countries with historic responsibility for climate change.

The analysis is done at the country, sectoral and product levels, worldwide, and over the 1992-2014 period. I find a negative effect of temperature variations in the exporter country and in the difference between exporter and importer countries, on bilateral trade, at the country level. At the product level, both negative and positive effects arise, but the negative effect of temperature dominates. The temperature effects are on the agricultural and manufacturing sectors, especially in the textile and metals sectors. I show that possible channels are the impact of temperature on output and labour productivity. The negative impacts are larger in exporter countries that are closer to the Equator, that have lower quality of institutions, and that export to more remote countries. If countries are able to adapt to climate change, the long term effects of temperature variations should be lower than the contemporaneous effect. Nevertheless, my results on the long term effects analysis do not support this hypothesis, suggesting no or very low adaptation. Moreover, the negative effect of temperature is persistent and cumulative through several years after the temperature shock. Concerning precipitation variation effects, they are found mainly at the product level, with the positive effect dominating for the affected products.","[Dallmann, Ingrid] Univ Paris Saclay, RITM, Univ Paris Sud, 54 Blvd Desgranges, F-92330 Sceaux, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Dallmann, I (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, RITM, Univ Paris Sud, 54 Blvd Desgranges, F-92330 Sceaux, France.",ingriddallmann@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,11,11,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

People and places vulnerable to climate change have been the focus of many discussions. However, in the forestry sector, limited studies have been conducted that link human vulnerability to recent initiatives, such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation or REDD+, especially in highly vulnerable countries. Using case studies from the Philippines, this paper focuses on the vulnerability of two community-based forest management (CBFM) organizations, with and without REDD+ readiness intervention, to show the impacts of climate variability and extremes. Two balance-weighted approaches, the livelihood vulnerability index and the IPCC-framework, were used in the vulnerability assessments. Results revealed high vulnerability of both CBFM organizations, although Malitbog Upland Developers for Sustainable Association (MUDSA) livelihood vulnerability is largely aggravated by its exposure to disaster, climate variability and extremes, accessibility to health facilities and water supply. The long history of CBFM implementation in both organizations have minimal contribution in enhancing the adaptive capacity of members to cope with and adapt to climate change impacts. REDD+ (readiness), does not insure reduced vulnerability to climate change, unless sustainable livelihood is achieved. As the State controls forest resources, the rights of CBFM-organizations to commercially benefit from these resources are limited, a disincentive to the development of new and viable development programs in CBFM areas, such as REDD+. This also constrains the achievement of climate resiliency.","[Peras, Rose Jane J.; Pulhin, Juan M.] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Los Banos, Laguna, Philippines; [Peras, Rose Jane J.; Pulhin, Juan M.; Inoue, Makoto] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos; University of Tokyo,"Peras, RJJ (corresponding author), Univ Philippines Los Banos, Los Banos, Laguna, Philippines.;Peras, RJJ (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.",rjperas@up.edu.ph,"Pulhin, Juan Magboo/AAV-6489-2021","Inoue, Makoto/0000-0002-6625-7293",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Ronpaku,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Ronpaku(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","The authors would like to give special thanks to the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Ronpaku (PhD Dissertation) Program Scholarship for providing funding support for the dissertation of the main author from which this paper is taken.

Special attention in this study was paid to the aspects linked to climate change, namely socio-cultural issues, views and awareness, beliefs about causes, concerns, and lifestyle adjustments that people are prepared to make. Vegetation type was considered as the major criterion when selecting Makhado, Mutale and Thulamela municipalities, which together with Musina, constitute Vhembe District in Limpopo Province. Seven rural communities in each municipality were selected. Using stratified proportionate random sampling in combination with weighted enumeration area (EA) for these communities, 366 households were chosen and interviewed. It was found that although awareness of 'climate change' was poor, most respondents understood what it meant and its associated challenges. Increasing occurrence of erratic rainfall and forest fires were regarded as visible manifestations of climate change. There was also strong concern about the effects of climate change on forests and forest-related products. The respondents expressed a desire to adopt responsible behaviour towards the use and management of forests as a climate-change intervention strategy. However, most community members were sceptical about the causes of climate change. Taking all these issues into account, it was clear that activities that would enlighten the people on the causes and consequences of climate change regarding their livelihoods should be carried out. This would help promote awareness of climate change and encourage people's participation in crafting measures that might help mitigate and adapt to climate change.","[Ofoegbu, C.; Chirwa, P.

However, there is limited literature explaining the elements that influence decision-making processes for sustainable coffee production; therefore, this study aimed at identifying and modeling the factors driving this sector toward decisions for sustainable coffee practices. The Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) method allowed to represent a comprehensive model of the factors. In addition, a case study of six shaded-coffee farms using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Environmental Life Cycle costing (E-LCC) provided a contextualized analysis. Main findings stress that the farm stage is the highest contributor to the cost and environmental impacts in green coffee production. Moreover, the model undertook outcomes of the LCA, E-LCC and literature reviews, detecting knowledge and costs as key driving factors for farmers' decisions, followed by the certification schemes, policies and the cooperative system as elements that influence decisions. Emissions, biodiversity and climate change adaptation behave as linking factors, while the use of water resources is the most dependent factor. This research establishes a first model to understand and address the factors that influence how decisions are taken in small-coffee farms when moving toward more sustainable coffee production, opening opportunities for further research as well as improved and tailored policy interventions in similar contexts.","[Brenes-Peralta, Laura; De Menna, Fabio; Vittuari, Matteo] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol Agroalimentari, Bologna, Italy; [Brenes-Peralta, Laura] Tecnol Costa Rica, Escuela Agronegocios, Cartago, Costa Rica",University of Bologna; Instituto Tecnologico de Costa Rica,"De Menna, F (corresponding author), Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol Agroalimentari, Bologna, Italy.",fabio.demenna2@unibo.it,,,Tecnologico de Costa Rica;  [1431012],Tecnologico de Costa Rica; ,This study is part of project no. 1431012 funded by Tecnologico de Costa Rica.,,85,0,0,7,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

However, the effects of OCRs on aboveground biomass production and soil C and N stock as well as the potential links between them remain poorly understood. In this study in Denmark, we harvested all aboveground biomass and simultaneously investigated soil C and N content and stock in two continuous monocultures (CMs) as well as in four OCRs. Across five-year continuous observations, OCRs significantly increased cumulative aboveground biomass production by 23% compared to CMs. There was no significant difference between OCRs and CMs in soil C and N content in any of the soil layers (0-20, 20-50, and 50-100 cm) after the five years. Moreover, OCRs had no effect on top layer soil C and N stock compared to CMs, even when examined by equivalent soil mass. Slight reductions in soil C and N stock after five years in both OCRs and CMs did not relate to the changes in aboveground biomass production. Our results highlight that it is feasible to produce more biomass for biorefineries in OCRs than in CMs and the reductions in soil C and N stock over time seem similar for the two systems. Longer-term continuous observations are called for to underpin these results.","[Chen, Ji; Laerke, Poul Erik; Jorgensen, Uffe] Aarhus Univ, Dept Agroecol, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark; [Chen, Ji; Laerke, Poul Erik; Jorgensen, Uffe] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Circular Bioecon, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark; [Chen, Ji; Laerke, Poul Erik] Aarhus Univ, iCLIMATE Interdisciplinary Ctr Climate Change, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",Aarhus University; Aarhus University; Aarhus University,"Chen, J (corresponding author), Blichers Alle 20,Postboks 50, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark.",ji.chen@agro.au.dk,"Chen, Ji/A-6299-2018; Jorgensen, Uffe/G-9507-2013; Laerke, Poul Erik/F-2954-2016","Chen, Ji/0000-0001-7026-6312; Laerke, Poul Erik/0000-0002-2224-3893; Jorgensen, Uffe/0000-0002-5930-3124","BioValue-Strategic Platform for Innovation and Research on value added products from biomass, Innovation Fund Denmark [0603-00522B]; Aarhus University Centre for Circular Bioeconomy, Aarhus University Research Foundation AUFF Starting Grants [AUFF-E-2019-7-1]; Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship H2020-MSCA-IF-2018 [839806]; Swedish University of Agricultural Science (SLU); Nordic Committee of Agriculture and Food Research (NKJ)","BioValue-Strategic Platform for Innovation and Research on value added products from biomass, Innovation Fund Denmark; Aarhus University Centre for Circular Bioeconomy, Aarhus University Research Foundation AUFF Starting Grants; Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship H2020-MSCA-IF-2018; Swedish University of Agricultural Science (SLU); Nordic Committee of Agriculture and Food Research (NKJ)","This study was funded by BioValue-Strategic Platform for Innovation and Research on value added products from biomass, Innovation Fund Denmark (No. 0603-00522B), Aarhus University Centre for Circular Bioeconomy, Aarhus University Research Foundation AUFF Starting Grants (AUFF-E-2019-7-1), and Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship H2020-MSCA-IF-2018 (No. 839806).

We propose machine-learning approaches to study the long-term impacts of flood protection in Bangladesh. Available data include socio-economic survey and events data (death, migration, etc.) from 1983-2014. These multidecadal data, rare in their extent and quality, provide a basis for using machine-learning approaches even though the data were not collected or designed to assess the impact of the flood control investments. We test whether the embankment has affected the welfare of people over time, benefiting those living inside more than those living outside. Machine-learning approaches enable learning patterns in data to help discriminate between two groups: here households living inside vs. outside. They also help identify the most informative indicators of discrimination and provide robust metrics to evaluate the quality of the model. Overall, we find no significant difference between inside/outside populations based on welfare, migration, or mortality indicators. However, we note a significant difference in inward/outward movement with respect to the embankment. While certain data gaps and spatial heterogeneity in sampled populations suggest caution in any conclusive interpretation of the flood protection infrastructure, we do not see higher benefits accruing to those living with higher levels of protection.

To better understand how longleaf pine copes with drought, leaf water relations, sap flow, canopy stomatal conductance (Gs), and growth were studied over three growing seasons in response to ambient throughfall (ambient treatment) versus an approximate 40% reduction in throughfall (drought treatment) in a 13-year-old plantation. An exceptional drought occurred the first year of the study and decreased mean predawn (Psi(PD)) and midday (Psi(MD)) leaf water potential to -2.9 MPa and -3.6 MPa, respectively, and decreased average monthly midday Gs to near zero for at least one month in both treatments. Stomatal closure occurred at a Psi(MD) of -3.0 MPa in both treatments. Leaf water potentials and transpiration recovered quickly following significant rain events that terminated the drought and mortality was similar among years and treatments (2.8%). Longleaf pine responded to drought treatment with greater stomatal control of plant water loss rather than adjustments in leaf area, the sapwood to leaf area ratio, or leaf water potential at the turgor loss point (Psi(TLP)). Annual transpiration per unit leaf area was reduced 16% by drought treatment, but greater stomatal control of water loss in response to drought treatment was associated with decreases in growth efficiency and volume, and no improvement in water use efficiency.","[Samuelson, Lisa J.; Stokes, Tom A.; Ramirez, Michael R.; Mendonca, Caren C.] Auburn Univ, Ctr Longleaf Pine Ecosyst, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Samuelson, LJ (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Ctr Longleaf Pine Ecosyst, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",sarnuell@aubum.edu,,,USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntire Stennis project [1018413]; Auburn University Intramural Grants Program Award [180286]; Nature Conservancy [2282-1],USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntire Stennis project; Auburn University Intramural Grants Program Award; Nature Conservancy,"This work was supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntire Stennis project #1018413 and Auburn University Intramural Grants Program Award #180286.

To be able to make such evaluations, robust (scientifically based), transparent and systematic assessments and valuations are required. This article describes a framework to assess the cause-and-effect relationships and how to estimate the costs and benefits as a basis to assess and prioritize measures for climate adaptation of roads and railways. The framework includes hazard identification, risk analysis and risk assessment, identification, monetary and non-monetary evaluation of possible risk reduction measures and a step regarding distribution-, goal- and sensitivity analyses.

Based on historical weather and crop data from 1981 to 2015, we evaluated the economic benefit and environmental cost for single and double rice cropping systems (SRCS and DRCS) in areas that are sensitive to climate variability in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The five chosen indices were: net profit, agronomic nitrogen use efficiency (ANUE), water use efficiency (WUE), total amount, and global warming potential (GWP) of greenhouse gas (GHG). The goal of this study is to provide scientific evidence for local policymakers to use in selecting the most suitable rice cropping systems to maximize economic profits while adapting to climate change. The results showed that net profit was $171.4 per hectare higher for DRCS than for SRCS in the study region. In addition, output per unit nitrogen usage was $0.25 per kg N higher for DRCS than for SRCS. Net profit would increase if DRCS replaced SRCS, and the maximum amplitude of increase in net profit for this replacement occurred under the settings of 150 kg ha(-1) nitrogen fertilizer level and continuous irrigation when the paddy water layer started to fade. On the other hand, annual variation in net profit for SRCS was consistently smaller than DRCS, regardless of changes in nitrogen fertilizer level and irrigation regime settings. SRCS showed better WUE than DRCS in both rainfed and irrigated situations, as well as lower seasonal CH4 and N2O emissions during the study period. Therefore, we conclude that SRCS is superior to DRCS for the sake of maximizing economic profit while maintaining sustainable agriculture in areas that are sensitive to climate variability in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.","[Ye, Qing; Wang, Yan] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Nanchang 330045, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xiaoguang] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Li, Yong] Guizhou Meteorol Bur, Guiyang 550002, Peoples R China; [Huang, Wanghua; Wang, Tianying] Hunan Inst Meteorol Sci, Changsha 410118, Peoples R China; [Xie, Wenjuan] Hebei Meteorol Disaster Prevent Ctr, Shijiazhuang 050021, Hebei, Peoples R China",Jiangxi Agricultural University; China Agricultural University,"Yang, XG (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",yeqing@jxau.edu.cn; yangxg@cau.edu.cn; zynjw@cau.edu.cn; huangwh2020@gmail.com; xiewenjuanwork@gmail.com; wangty196@gmail.com; yan987806@gmail.com,"Ye, Qing/G-8558-2018; yang, xiao/HJI-7815-2023","Ye, Qing/0000-0003-0373-7502; ",Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2016YFD0300101]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31560337],"Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, grant number 2016YFD0300101and the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 31560337.",,77,1,1,7,23,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,OCT,2020,11,10,,,,,,,1048,10.3390/atmos11101048,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11101048,,,21,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,OJ6YD,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000584103200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A new approach integrating hazard, sensitivity, resilience, exposure and risk is developed to assess the VRWR from climate change. Drought is regarded as the key hazard, with its frequency and severity defined using a surface humidity index. Exposure is quantitatively linked with indicators of population and social and economic characteristics using statistical and Geographical Information System (GIS) methodologies. Risk is defined as the product of hazard, exposure and vulnerability, while vulnerability is treated as a function of sensitivity and adaptation. Vulnerability and risk in the water resources system in the coming 20 years are assessed for the RCP 4.5 scenario. The results reveal that both hazard and exposure of water resources display strong spatial variation in the study area. High hazard and exposure are found in the northern Tianshan Mountain as well as the eastern part of Hexi Corridor. Water resources are particularly sensitive to variation in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in the upstream areas of Hexi Corridor, rivers in Central Asia, headwater streams of Tarim River and most of Chang Tang Plateau. Our assessment shows that there is high vulnerability of and risk to water resources in the study area, especially in the areas of Hexi Corridor, northern Tianshan Mountain and Tarim River. Under the RCP 4.5 climate change scenario, the vulnerability and risk decline over the entire area but remain at a serious level in inland rivers in Hexi Corridor, northern Tianshan Mountain and headwater streams of Tarim River. Thus, these areas are the highest priority for strengthening policy measures to adapt to climate change and reduce exposure and vulnerability and their risk to water resources.","[Xia, Jun] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Xia, Jun; Ning, Like; Hong, Si] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Ning, Like; Hong, Si] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wang, Quan] Shizuoka Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan; [Chen, Junxu] Yunnan Univ, Sch Resource Environm & Earth Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Wan, Long] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Wuhan University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Shizuoka University; Yunnan University; Beijing Forestry University","Ning, L (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Ning, L (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",ninglk@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Ning, Like/F-5434-2011; Wang, Quan/M-2011-2019; Xia, Jun/G-5095-2018; Wang, Quan/F-5424-2013","Ning, Like/0000-0002-5017-7467; Wang, Quan/0000-0001-5483-0243; Wang, Quan/0000-0001-5483-0243",National Program on Key Basic Research Project of China [2012CB956204],National Program on Key Basic Research Project of China(National Basic Research Program of China),This work was supported by National Program on Key Basic Research Project of China (2012CB956204).,,46,39,48,11,106,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Based on climatic indices such as growing degree-day (GDD), extreme degree-day (EDD), and precipitation (P), this study assessed the sensitivity of maize (Zea mays L.) yield to a changing climate for seven diverse cropping areas from 1981 to 2013 across Kansas. Our results indicated that maize yield increased by 2.4 and 3.4% per annum 100 GDD increase under non-irrigated (i.e. rainfed) and irrigated environments, respectively. Maize yield positive response to changes in GDD during the pre-silking period was more significantly pronounced for irrigated environments than rainfed sites. Rainfed yields showed a significantly negative response to EDD (-3.0% per + 10 EDD) compared with irrigated environments (-1.2% per + 10 EDD). This EDD negative effect was more pronounced during post-silking growth as compared with the pre-silking period for both irrigated and non-irrigated conditions. Yield sensitivity to a unit change of P (mm) was less than the sensitivity to a unit change of GDD (in degrees C days) and EDD (in degrees C days) indices. Nonetheless, maize productivity has a positive response to post-silking P with a greater yield gain at rainfed sites compared with irrigated sites. Irrigation could partially mitigate the effect of extreme heat on maize yield potential. Because the frequency of extreme temperatures and P are predicted to increase in Kansas and the Great Plains region, this study might provide guidelines to farmers, crop consultants, and agronomists to manage maize production thereby providing the ability to mitigate or adapt to climate change impacts.","[Ye, Qing; Lin, Xiaomao] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agron, Kansas Climate Ctr, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Adee, Eric; Min, Doohong; Mulisa, Yared Assefa; Ciampitti, Ignacio A.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agron, Throckmorton Plant Sci Ctr 2004, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [O'Brien, Dan] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University; Kansas State University; Kansas State University,"Lin, XM (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Kansas Climate Ctr, Dept Agron, Throckmorton Plant Sci Ctr 2108, 1712 Claflin Rd, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.;Ciampitti, IA (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Dept Agron, Throckmorton Plant Sci Ctr 2014E, 1712 Claflin Rd, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",xlin@ksu.edu; Ciampitti@ksu.edu,"Ye, Qing/G-8558-2018","Ye, Qing/0000-0003-0373-7502; Assefa, Yared/0000-0001-7351-3606; Ciampitti, Ignacio/0000-0001-9619-5129",Kansas Corn Commission,Kansas Corn Commission,"Mr G.

Research exploring such linkages in India is sparse. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association between extreme precipitation and gastrointestinal (GI) illness-related hospital admissions in Chennai, India, from 2004 to 2007. METHODS: Daily hospital admissions were extracted from two government hospitals in Chennai, India, and meteorological data were retrieved from the Chennai International Airport. We evaluated the association between extreme precipitation (>= 90th percentile) and hospital admissions using generalized additive models. Both single-day and distributed lag models were explored over a 15-day period, controlling for apparent temperature, day of week, and long-term time trends. We used a stratified analysis to explore the association across age and season. RESULTS: Extreme precipitation was consistently associated with GI-related hospital admissions. The cumulative summary of risk ratios estimated for a 15-day period corresponding to an extreme event (relative to no precipitation) was 1.60 (95% CI: 1.29, 1.98) among all ages, 2.72 (95% CI: 1.25, 5.92) among the young (<= 5 years of age), and 1.62 (95% CI: 0.97, 2.70) among the old (>= 65 years of age). The association was stronger during the pre-monsoon season (March-May), with a cumulative risk ratio of 6.50 (95% CI: 2.22, 19.04) for all ages combined compared with other seasons. CONCLUSION: Hospital admissions related to GI illness were positively associated with extreme precipitation in Chennai, India, with positive cumulative risk ratios for a 15-day period following an extreme event in all age groups. Projected changes in precipitation and extreme weather events suggest that climate change will have important implications for human health in India, where health disparities already exist.","[Bush, Kathleen F.; O'Neill, Marie S.] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [O'Neill, Marie S.] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [O'Neill, Marie S.] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Risk Sci Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Li, Shi; Mukherjee, Bhramar] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hu, Howard] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Div Global Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Hu, Howard] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Hu, Howard] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Div Occupat & Environm Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Ghosh, Santu; Balakrishnan, Kalpana] Sri Ramachandra Univ, Dept Environm Hlth Engn, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education & Research,"Bush, KF (corresponding author), Plymouth State Univ, MSC 63,17 High St, Plymouth, NH 03264 USA.",kfb1010@plymouth.edu,"Hu, Howard/AAV-5360-2021; Balakrishnan, Kalpana/B-6653-2015; Ghosh, Santu/GQQ-0168-2022","Balakrishnan, Kalpana/0000-0002-5905-1801; Ghosh, Santu/0000-0002-9373-9570; Hu, Howard/0000-0002-3676-2707; Ghosh, Santu/0000-0003-1358-3471","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency STAR grant [R83275201]; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health [R-01 ES016932]; University of Michigan Center for Global Health; University of Michigan School of Public Health, Department of Environmental Health Sciences; Graham Environmental Sustainability Institute Doctoral Fellowship","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency STAR grant; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)); University of Michigan Center for Global Health; University of Michigan School of Public Health, Department of Environmental Health Sciences; Graham Environmental Sustainability Institute Doctoral Fellowship","This research was supported by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency STAR grant R83275201; the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, grant R-01 ES016932; and a pilot grant from the University of Michigan Center for Global Health.

Within the reference climate (1961-1990), the model high 2 m temperatures (T2m) were reduced and low temperatures were increased relative to verification in a large portion of the domain. Precipitation was underestimated in summer over the Mediterranean region but was overestimated over western Europe in winter, probably due to excessive westerlies in the global model. When RegCM was forced by ERA-40, the dominant errors in the summer T2m appear to be genuine RegCM errors, but a large fraction of errors in winter precipitation was imported from the lateral boundaries. In the near future (2011-2040), the summer T2m is projected to increase by +1.8 degrees C over southwest Europe. The simulated change in precipitation is small and is significant only in regions around the Mediterranean. The wetter north and drier south, a major feature in projections of the European winter climate in the late 21st century, is not predicted for the near future. Similarly, summer drying is confined to western Europe in contrast to nearly continental scale drying observed in projections of the late 21st century. This finding may influence the approaches for adaptation to climate change in the first half and at the end of this century. The effects of downscaling at small scales are analysed for the case of Croatia. The spatial distribution of the number of days with extreme T2m and precipitation in RegCM is consistent with observations. However, this metric is generally underestimated, indicating that over complex orography, even higher horizontal resolution is needed to better resolve climate extremes.","[Brankovic, Cedo; Patarcic, Mirta; Guettler, Ivan; Srnec, Lidija] Croatian Meteorol & Hydrol Serv DHMZ, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",,"Brankovic, C (corresponding author), Croatian Meteorol & Hydrol Serv DHMZ, Gric 3, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",cedo.brankovic@cirus.dhz.hr,"Branković, Čedo/F-9069-2018","Guttler, Ivan/0000-0002-9189-5510","Ministry of Science, Education and Sports of the Republic of Croatia [004-1193086-3035]","Ministry of Science, Education and Sports of the Republic of Croatia(Ministry of Science, Education and Sports, Republic of Croatia)","We acknowledge the World Data Center for Climate (WDCC) in Hamburg, Germany for making the ECHAM5/MPI-OM model data available for downscaling, (via the Climate and Environmental Retrieving and Archive, CERA database).

The ecological impacts and costs of predicted weather-related extreme events, such as extreme temperatures, are not fully understood and may present unexpected challenges to conservationists that require solutions. In Portugal, provisioning of artificial nests has been the main driver of the spectacular increase in the endangered lesser kestrel population. Nevertheless, atypically high temperatures recorded during the 2009 breeding season coincided with a mortality of 22% of surveyed chicks in provided nests. Hot days did not affected prey delivery rates to the nestlings, suggesting that the die-off was due to chicks' acute dehydration. Chick mortality was significantly higher amongst younger individuals. Within survivors, physiological costs of high temperatures significantly affected chick growth and body condition at fledging. Nest-site microclimate was influenced by nest-type and compass orientation: wooden nest-boxes attained the highest temperatures, exceeding 55 degrees C when facing south, so explaining the recorded higher mortality, lower growth rates and lower fledging body condition among broods in these nests. Simulated scenarios of global warming with increasing occupation rate of artificial nests due to reductions in alternatives predicted a reduction in population growth rate. In the worst scenario, with a 100% occupancy of nest-boxes, the population growth would decline on average 7% per year. The impact of high temperatures on lesser kestrel breeding success highlights a need for actions to modify and research to adapt conservation efforts and future planning to account for climate change.

Salinity and climate change are a threat to agricultural productivity worldwide. However, the combined effects of climate change and salinity impacts on farmers' income are not well understood, particularly in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach The response-yield function and general maximum entropy methods were used to predict the impact of temperature, precipitation and salinity on crop yield. The target minimization of total absolute deviations (MOTAD)-positive mathematical programming model was used to simulate the impact of climate change and salinity on socioeconomic and environmental indicators. In the end, a multicriteria decision-making model was used, aiming at the selection of suitable climate scenarios. Findings The results revealed that precipitation shows a significantly decreasing trend, while temperature and groundwater salinity (EC) illustrate a significantly increasing trend. Climate change and EC negatively impact the farmer's income and water shadow prices. Maximum reduction in income and water shadow prices was observed for A2 scenario (-12.4% and 19.4%) during 2050. The environmental index was the most important, with priority of 43.4% compared to socioeconomic indicators. Subindex amount of water used was also significant in study area, with 28.1% priority. The technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution ranking system found that B1 was the best climatic scenario for adopting climate change adaptation in the research region. Originality/value In this study, farmers' income threats were assessed with the aspects of different climate scenario (A1, A1B and B1) over the horizons of 2030, 2040 and 2050 and three different indicators (economic, social and environmental) in Northwestern region of Pakistan. Only in arid and semiarid regions has climate change raised temperature and reduced rainfall, which are preliminary symptoms of growing salinity.","[Khan, Arshad Ahmad; Khan, Aftab; Luo, Jianchao] Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling, Xianyang, Peoples R China; [Khan, Arshad Ahmad; Luo, Jianchao] Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ, Shaanxi Rural Financial Res Ctr, Yangling, Xianyang, Peoples R China; [Khan, Sufyan Ullah] Univ Stavanger, Business Sch, Stavanger, Norway; [Khan, Sufyan Ullah] Xian Int Univ, Coll Int Cooperat, Xian, Peoples R China; [Ali, Muhammad Abu Sufyan] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Postdoctoral Studies Int Business Sch, Xian, Peoples R China; [Hayat, Yousaf] Univ Agr, Dept Math Stat & Comp Sci, Peshawar, Pakistan",Northwest A&F University - China; Northwest A&F University - China; Universitetet i Stavanger; Shaanxi Normal University; Agricultural University Peshawar; University of Agriculture Faisalabad,"Luo, JC (corresponding author), Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling, Xianyang, Peoples R China.;Luo, JC (corresponding author), Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ, Shaanxi Rural Financial Res Ctr, Yangling, Xianyang, Peoples R China.",jchluo@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,"khan, aftab/0000-0002-9946-9030","Research on the Effectiveness Evaluation, Risk Control and System Construction of the Agricultural Credit Guarantee Policy, National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71873100]; Research on the Policy Orientation and Implementation Path of Financial Empowerment of Rural Revitalization; Soft Science Project of the Central Agricultural Office; Rural Revitalization Expert Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs [rkx20221801]; Rural Revitalization Financial Policy Innovation Team, Chinese Universities Scientific Fund [2452022074]","Research on the Effectiveness Evaluation, Risk Control and System Construction of the Agricultural Credit Guarantee Policy, National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research on the Policy Orientation and Implementation Path of Financial Empowerment of Rural Revitalization; Soft Science Project of the Central Agricultural Office; Rural Revitalization Expert Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs; Rural Revitalization Financial Policy Innovation Team, Chinese Universities Scientific Fund","This paper was supported by Research on the Effectiveness Evaluation, Risk Control and System Construction of the Agricultural Credit Guarantee Policy, National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), January 2019-December 2022, No. 71873100.

Despite recent expansion in the literature that evaluates vulnerability at the local level, approaches to understanding future scenarios and to integrating climatic and nonclimatic factors are inconsistent and often lack clear methodological information. This study utilized systematic review methods to characterize and compare future scenarios and the integration of climatic and nonclimatic stimuli in community-focused VAs published over the last five years. Five common methods for assessing future dimensions of vulnerability were characterized. Key challenges regarding sources and scales of information were highlighted alongside methods to integrate data spanning climatic and nonclimatic information at scales ranging from local to global. The majority of VAs considered current and past vulnerability; few VAs incorporated future scenarios and these studies focused on future climatic conditions while largely overlooking changes in nonclimatic drivers of vulnerability. Approaches to evaluate future dimensions of vulnerability included climate model projections, socioeconomic model projections, temporal analogue approaches, longitudinal approaches, and local perceptions. These methods often failed to capture the dynamic interactions between variables through time, as future impacts are unlikely to follow previous patterns of change. To combine datasets of different scales, VAs created vulnerability indices, overlaid spatial datasets, or used expert judgement. These approaches tended to aggregate local characteristics to the regional level at the expense of community specificity. There is a need for methodological advances to assess future scenarios and to combine datasets in the field of community-level climate change VAs to make these studies more responsive to local realities and relevant to the development of climate change adaptation strategies.","[Windfeld, Emma J.] McGill Univ, Sch Environm, Montreal, PQ H3A 2A7, Canada; [Ford, James D.; Berrang-Ford, Lea] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [Ford, James D.; Berrang-Ford, Lea] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [McDowell, Graham] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",McGill University; McGill University; University of Leeds; University of British Columbia,"Windfeld, EJ (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Sch Environm, Montreal, PQ H3A 2A7, Canada.",emma.windfeld@mail.mcgill.ca,"Ford, James/A-4284-2013","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; McDowell, Graham/0000-0003-2302-2598",,,,,63,3,3,7,53,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",1208-6053,1181-8700,,ENVIRON REV,Environ.

In 2014, we held six workshops across estuaries along the Pacific coast of North America with over 150 participants to evaluate resource managers' perceived level of understanding of climate change science, where they obtain information, how they use this knowledge, and their preparedness for incorporating climate change into their management decisions. We found that most resource managers understood the types of climate change impacts likely to occur in their estuaries, but often lacked the scientific information to make decisions and plan effectively. Managers stated that time, money, and staff resources were the largest obstacles in their efforts. Managers identified that they learned most of their information from peers, scientific journals, and the Internet and indicated that sea-level rise was their greatest concern. There was, however, variation in managers' levels of readiness and perceived knowledge within and among workshop locations. The workshops revealed that some regions don't have the information they need or the planning capacity to effectively integrate climate change into their management, with eight out of fifteen site comparisons showing a significant difference between their level of preparedness (F-5,F-26 = 6.852; p = 0.0003), and their willingness to formally plan (F-5,F-26 = 12.84; p = 0.000002). We found that Urban estuaries were significantly different from Mixed Use and Rural estuaries, in having access to information and feeling more prepared to conduct climate change planning and implementation (F-2,F-29 = 17.34; p = 0.00001). To facilitate climate change preparedness more comprehensive integration of science into management decisions is essential.

Less intrusive alternatives, specifically marsh plantings with and without sills, have the potential to better sustain marsh habitat and support its ecosystem services, yet their shoreline protection capabilities during storms have not been evaluated. In this study, the performances of alternative shoreline protection approaches during Hurricane Irene (Category 1 storm) were compared by 1) classifying resultant damage to shorelines with different types of shoreline protection in three NC coastal regions after Irene; and 2) quantifying shoreline erosion at marshes with and without sills in one NC region by using repeated measurements of marsh surface elevation and marsh vegetation stem density before and after Irene. In the central Outer Banks, NC, where the strongest sustained winds blew across the longest fetch; Irene damaged 76% of bulkheads surveyed, while no damage to other shoreline protection options was detected. Across marsh sites within 25 km of its landfall, Hurricane Irene had no effect on marsh surface elevations behind sills or along marsh shorelines without sills. Although Irene temporarily reduced marsh vegetation density at sites with and without sills, vegetation recovered to pre-hurricane levels within a year. Storm responses suggest that marshes with and without sills are more durable and may protect shorelines from erosion better than the bulkheads in a Category 1 storm.

In this paper, forest policy making in the light of climate change is analyzed in two German Laender, Bavaria and North Rhine Westphalia, drawing on the Multiple Streams Framework. Empirically, document analysis and expert interviews substantiate this analysis. The formation of climate change related forest policy occurred differently in both Laender. In Bavaria, several factors triggered a successful integration of climate change adaptation measures related to forests into one program, the Bavarian Climate Programme 2020. These factors were, for instance, an early problematization of climate change by forest science, a 'condensation' of the problem into particular areas of high need for action, the possibility to rely on already available (in parts, implemented), well-proven, and applicable forest policy measures, and the coordinated and entrepreneurial activities of the forest sector as a whole. In North Rhine Westphalia, the political framework conditions for a formation of climate change related forest policy were less favorable, and, hence, no broader forest policy on the issue occurred. Recent political changes, however, may allow for new prospects. We conclude that the extent to which the issue of climate change is integrated into forest policy depends on the overall framing of climate policy and the opportunities for the forest sector to substantiate the necessity of such a link. The preparedness and activities of the latter are then needed in order to utilize possible policy windows and to receive resources for forest climate policy measures. Forest science plays an important role by influencing the agenda, indicating challenges and providing scientific criteria to determine and rationalize specific measures. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: Block group-level tree canopy and impervious surface estimates were derived from the 2001 National Land Cover Dataset for densely populated urban areas of the United States and Puerto Rico, and linked to demographic characteristics from the 2000 Census. Racial/ethnic groups in a given block group were considered to live in HRRLC if at least half their population experienced the absence of tree canopy and at least half of the ground was covered by impervious surface (roofs, driveways, sidewalks, roads). Residential segregation was characterized for metropolitan areas in the United States and Puerto Rico using the multigroup dissimilarity index. RESULTS: After adjustment for ecoregion and precipitation, holding segregation level constant, non-Hispanic blacks were 52% more likely (95% CI: 37%, 69%), non-Hispanic Asians 32% more likely (95% CI: 18%, 47%), and Hispanics 21% more likely (95% CI: 8%, 35%) to live in HRRLC conditions compared with non-Hispanic whites. Within each racial/ethnic group, HRRLC conditions increased with increasing degrees of metropolitan area-level segregation. Further adjustment for home ownership and poverty did not substantially alter these results, but adjustment for population density and metropolitan area population attenuated the segregation effects, suggesting a mediating or confounding role. CONCLUSIONS: Land cover was associated with segregation within each racial/ethnic group, which may be explained partly by the concentration of racial/ethnic minorities into densely populated neighborhoods within larger, more segregated cities. In anticipation of greater frequency and duration of extreme heat events, climate change adaptation strategies, such as planting trees in urban areas, should explicitly incorporate an environmental justice framework that addresses racial/ethnic disparities in HRRLC.","[Jesdale, Bill M.; Morello-Frosch, Rachel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Morello-Frosch, Rachel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cushing, Lara] Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Jesdale, BM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 130 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",bill.jesdale@gmail.com,,"Morello-Frosch, Rachel/0000-0003-1153-7287; Cushing, Lara/0000-0003-0640-6450; Jesdale, William/0000-0002-2697-3279",Hewlett Foundation; California Environmental Protection Agency [07-020],Hewlett Foundation; California Environmental Protection Agency,Support for this research was provided by the Hewlett Foundation and the California Environmental Protection Agency (no. 07-020).,,82,124,124,0,72,US DEPT HEALTH HUMAN SCIENCES PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCE,RES TRIANGLE PK,"NATL INST HEALTH, NATL INST ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES, PO BOX 12233, RES TRIANGLE PK, NC 27709-2233 USA",0091-6765,1552-9924,,ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP,Environ.

In the past decades, the typical winter wheat- summer maize rotation system in the North China Plain (NCP) has produced high yield, but the overuse of nitrogen fertilizer and over-pumping of groundwater for irrigation have caused severe environmental problems. It is necessary to develop climate-smart agricultural systems through a comprehensive multiple-objective assessment and optimization of alternative cropping systems and agronomic managements. Here, with the agricultural system model of APSIM, eight alternative cropping systems at four typical sites across the NCP under two climate change scenarios and two tillage managements were comprehensively evaluated in terms of crop yield, water use efficiency (WUE), nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), evapotranspiration (ET), groundwater recharge (GWR), N2O emission, N leaching, surface soil organic carbon (SOC), and carbon footprint (CF). The results showed that under both baseline and future climate scenarios, the currently dominant winter wheat- summer maize rotation system had the largest ET, N leaching and N2O emission, a medium crop yield, WUE, and SOC, however a low NUE, and GWR. The rotation/intercropping systems could have higher grain yields, while the monoculture cropping systems could have advantage on water conservation. Maize had relatively higher yield, WUE, NUE, GWR, and SOC, and lower N loss and CF than wheat and soybean because it could have a high yield without irrigation. The optimized winter wheat-summer maize rotation system, with the optimal irrigation, fertilizer and cultivar, had the greatest advantage over other seven systems with the highest yields, WUE, NUE, high ET, GWR, and SOC, and the lowest N losses and CF. Compared with conventional tillage, each cropping system would have a little bit less negative response to future climate change with conservation tillage. The study demonstrated a useful framework to develop climate-smart agricultural systems and sustainable agricultural strategies to meet the challenges of global climate change, which can be widely applied to other cropping systems and regions.","[Xin, Yue; Tao, Fulu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Xin, Yue; Tao, Fulu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Tao, Fulu] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke)","Tao, FL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",taofl@igsnrr.ac.cn,,", FL/0000-0002-8576-4012; Tao, F/0000-0001-8574-0080","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0604700, 2016YFD0300201, 2017YFD0300301]; National Science Foundation of China [41571088, 31761143006, 41977405]; Academy of Finland [316172, 316215]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [316215, 316172] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)",National Key R&D Program of China; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Academy of FinlandFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES)),"This study is supported by The National Key R&D Program of China (Project No. 2017YFA0604700, 2016YFD0300201, 2017YFD0300301) and the National Science Foundation of China (Project Nos. 41571088, 31761143006, 41977405).

Although much is known about how these contribute to this adaptive capacity, research focusing on their interaction is limited. In order to close this the gap, this study seeks to explore how socio-demographic, governance and institutional factors influence adaptive capacity in Exchange, Insukamini and Ruchanyu irrigation schemes. Questionnaire-based interviews, group discussions and key informant interviews were used for data collection. Adaptive capacity calculated using the livelihood vulnerability model was used as the dependent variable for this study. Ordinary least square regression was used to assess socio-demographic, institutional and governance factors influencing adaptive capacity in the smallholder irrigation scheme. The study reveals that adaptive capacity is influenced by age, gender, education, land tenure security, irrigation committee satisfaction, cooperatives, and interaction of factors. The link between age and gender were negatively moderated by awareness of irrigation policies, access to credit and land tenure security. Assessing factors influencing adaptive capacity help to improve the livelihoods of scheme farmers in the face of climate change.","[Mwadzingeni, Liboster; Mafongoya, Paramu L.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Mugandani, Raymond] Midlands State Univ, Fac Agr Environm & Nat Resources Management, Dept Land & Water Resources, Gweru, Zimbabwe",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Mwadzingeni, L (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",libomwadzi@gmail.com,,"Mugandani, Raymond/0000-0002-8280-4170; Mwadzingeni, Liboster/0000-0002-8015-7010",South Africa's National Research Foundation (NRF) [86893],South Africa's National Research Foundation (NRF)(National Research Foundation - South Africa),"The authors acknowledge the facilitation done by the Provincial AGRITEX, Gweru, Kwekwe and Shurugwi District offices.

The GR2M model was used to project changes in the streamflow of the Daule River. The climate projection was based on the four rigorously selected models to represent the climate of the study area. On average, an increase in temperature (~2 & DEG;C) and precipitation (~6%) is expected. A 7% increase in precipitation would result in a 10% increase in streamflow for flood periods, while an 8% decrease in precipitation could result in approximately a 60% reduction in flow for dry periods. The analysis of droughts shows that they will be more frequent and prolonged in the highlands (Andes) and the middle part of the basin. In the future, wet periods will be less frequent but of greater duration and intensity on the Ecuadorian coast. These results point to future problems such as water deficit in the dry season but also increased streamflow for floods during the wet season.

This study compares Xiamen Island and Kinmen Island, two neighboring islands with pronounced differences in urban density, adopting a Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) to describe the spatiotemporal differences in island ecological quality. The results show that the RSEI was positively correlated with greenness and humidity and negatively correlated with heat and dryness. Despite the fact that Xiamen Island has experienced extensive urban expansion and rapid population growth, its ecological quality has remained stable and even improved slightly, which mainly due to scientific urban planning. Despite the ecological advantages of its less urban setting, Kinmen Island has suffered reduced ecological quality due to deterioration of natural conditions, climate warming, and increasing human activity.

This study examines two large cascade hydropower systems in Yunnan province in southwest China for 10 climate change projections made with 5 global climate models (GCMs) and 2 representative concentration pathways (RCPs) under Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). First, a back propagation neural network rain-runoff model is built for each hydropower station to estimate inflows with climate change. Then, a progressive optimality algorithm maximizes hydropower generation for each projection. The results show generation increasing in each GCM projection, but increasing more in GCMs under scenario RCP8.5. However, yearly generation fluctuates more: generation decreases dramatically with potential for electricity shortages in dry years and more electricity as well as spill during wet years. Average annual spill, average annual inflow and average storage have similar trends. The analysis indicates that a planned large dam on the upper Jinsha River would increase seasonal regulation ability, increase hydropower generation, and decrease spill.

However, there is less information on the change trends in both climate and land cover in LBB and thus less understanding of the watershed sensitivity and adaptability to climate change. Here we identified the spatial and temporal patterns of changes in climate (from 1979 to 2016), land cover, and vegetation (from 2000 to 2010) in the LBB. During the past 40years, there was a little increase in precipitation while air temperature has increased by 1.4 degrees C. During the past 10years, land cover has changed significantly. Herein grassland, water bodies, permanent snow, and ice decreased by 485.40km(2), 161.55km(2) and 2.83km(2), respectively. However, forest and wetland increased by 111.40km(2) and 202.90km(2), respectively. About 83.67km(2) area of water bodies has been converted into the wetland. Also, there was a significant change in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the NDVI maximum value was 1 in 2000, decreased to 0.9 in 2010. Evidently, it was in the mountainous areas and in the river basin that the vegetation shifted. Our findings have implications for predicting the safety of water resources and water eco-environment in LBB under global change.","[Dorjsuren, Batsuren; Yan, Denghua; Wang, Hao; Girma, Abel; Abiyu, Asaminew; Gedefaw, Mohammed] Donghua Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China; [Yan, Denghua; Wang, Hao] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res IWHR, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Yan, Denghua; Wang, Hao] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res IWHR, Water Resources Dept, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Dorjsuren, Batsuren; Chonokhuu, Sonomdagva] Natl Univ Mongolia, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Environm & Forest Engn, Ulaanbaatar 210646, Mongolia; [Enkhbold, Altanbold; Davaasuren, Davaadorj] Natl Univ Mongolia, Sch Art & Sci, Dept Geog, Ulaanbaatar 210646, Mongolia; [Jing, Lanshu] Hebei Univ Engn, Coll Water Conservancy & Hydropower Engn, Handan 056001, Hebei, Peoples R China",Donghua University; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research; National University of Mongolia; National University of Mongolia; Hebei University of Engineering,"Yan, DH (corresponding author), Donghua Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China.;Yan, DH (corresponding author), China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res IWHR, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.;Yan, DH (corresponding author), China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res IWHR, Water Resources Dept, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.",Yandh@iwhr.com,"Chonokhuu, Sonomdagva/GQY-9193-2022; Purevsuren, Tseveg/O-6645-2019; Dorjsuren, Batsuren/Q-6986-2018; Chonokhuu, Sonomdagva/AAK-8941-2021; Cherinet, Asaminew Abiyu/AFV-4937-2022","Chonokhuu, Sonomdagva/0000-0003-2724-9263; Dorjsuren, Batsuren/0000-0002-7864-8291; Chonokhuu, Sonomdagva/0000-0003-2724-9263; Cherinet, Asaminew Abiyu/0000-0002-2412-1507",National Key Research and Development Project [2016YFA0601503],National Key Research and Development Project,The researchers would like to extend their thanks to the National Key Research and Development Project (Grant no. 2016YFA0601503).

Such growing concerns demonstrate a need to assess how farmers simultaneously cope with extreme events and adapt to climatic variability. Based on household surveys of 2660 farm families conducted in Nepal's Terai, coastal Bangladesh, and the Indian state of Bihar, this paper seeks to (1) explore farmers' coping strategies under adverse weather events; (2) identify key adaptation measures used by farmers; and (3) explore the policy interventions required to adjust agriculture to climatic variability. The study reveals that migration is the most important coping strategy of the households in Bihar and coastal Bangladesh, while reliance on credit markets is the most important in Terai. Farmers in the areas with higher rainfall variability pursue a higher number of coping strategies compared to farmers in areas with lower rainfall variability. Food available months are also higher in areas with higher rainfall variability. Across all sites, the most frequently mentioned adaptive practices are changing cropping patterns and adoption of resilient crop varieties. A large number of farmers place emphasis on breeding crop varieties that tolerate adverse weather. Governments should implement a number of planned activities to cope with adverse events, with the aim that these activities would be synergistic with adaptation to climate change.","[Bhatta, Gopal Datt; Aggarwal, Pramod Kumar] CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, IWMI, New Delhi Off, NASC Complex,DPS Marg, New Delhi 110012, India; [Bhatta, Gopal Datt] Res & Strategy Community & Neighbourhood Serv, Calgary, AB, Canada",CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI),"Bhatta, GD (corresponding author), CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, IWMI, New Delhi Off, NASC Complex,DPS Marg, New Delhi 110012, India.",bhattagopal@gmail.com,,,European Union (EU),European Union (EU)(CGIAREuropean Commission),"The authors would like to thank all members of each site survey team for collecting data.

Known records suggest intimate relationship of adaptations, mitigations and migrations to climate extremes leaving their im- pacts on human societies. The northwestern part of India provides such an example, where human civilizations flourished in the early Holocene along the major fluvial systems when the Indian summer (southwest) monsoon was much stronger and rainfall was higher over the Indian land mass. Summers were thus wetter, conducive to agriculture and ecodiversity. Changes in the early civilizations in the Indian subcontinent had a close relation to changes in the monsoon climate over the past 10,000 years. The summer monsoon has weak- ened over the last 7000 years since its peak intensification in the early Holocene (10,000-7000 cal yrS BP). Discrete intervals of dry phases in the summer monsoon are visible in the proxy record of the monsoon winds from the marine sediments of the Arabian Sea, which had significant impact on human settlements in South Asia. The strongest aridity in the Indian subcontinent and extended periods of droughts at ca 5000-4000 cal yrS BP seems to have triggered eastward human migrations towards the Ganga plain. Other times of monsoon weakening during the Holocene are coincident with the initial development of ponds, reservoirs and other rainwater harvesting structures that may have served as an adaptation to climate change.","Indian Inst Technol, Dept Geol & Geophys, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; NOAA Paleoclimatol Program, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; Forest Dept, Jaipur 302005, Rajasthan, India; Phys Res Lab, Ahmadabad 380009, Gujarat, India","Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Physical Research Laboratory - India","Gupta, AK (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Geol & Geophys, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",anilg@gg.iitkgp.ernet.in,"Pandey, Deep Narayan/F-7703-2010; anderson, david/E-6416-2011","Gupta, Anil/0000-0003-0536-3911; Pandey, Deep Narayan/0000-0002-6514-2152",,,,,60,62,65,2,26,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, SADASHIVANAGAR, P B #8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",0011-3891,,,CURR SCI INDIA,Curr.

Flood forecasting tools and flood risk models have to be compared to observe flooding patterns for training, calibration, validation, and benchmarking. At the regional to continental scales, satellite earth observation (EO) is the established method for surface water extent (SWE) mapping, and several operational global-scale data products are available. However, the spatial resolution of satellite-derived SWE maps remains a limiting factor, especially in low-lying areas with complex hydrography, such as Denmark. We collected thermal imagery using an unmanned airborne system (UAS) for three areas in Denmark shortly after major flooding events. We combined the thermal imagery with an airborne lidar-derived high-resolution digital surface model of the country to retrieve high-resolution (40 cm) SWE maps. The resulting SWE maps were compared with low-resolution SWE maps derived from satellite earth observation and with potential flooded areas derived from the high-resolution digital elevation model. We conclude that UASs have significant potential for SWE mapping at intermediate scales (up to a few square kilometers), can bridge the scale gap between ground observations and satellite EO, and can be used to benchmark and validate SWE mapping products derived from satellite EO as well as models predicting inundation.","[Bauer-Gottwein, Peter; Lowe, Roland] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm & Resource Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Grosen, Henrik] Drone Syst, DK-8200 Aarhus, Denmark; [Druce, Daniel; Tottrup, Christian] DHI, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark; Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI),"Bauer-Gottwein, P (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm & Resource Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",pbau@dtu.dk,"; Bauer-Gottwein, Peter/G-8725-2011","Lowe, Roland/0000-0002-5549-5456; Bauer-Gottwein, Peter/0000-0002-9861-4240",Innovation Fund Denmark through the ChinaWaterSense project [8087-00002B]; Danish Agency for Digital Government (Digitaliseringsstyrelsen) [2020-6726],Innovation Fund Denmark through the ChinaWaterSense project; Danish Agency for Digital Government (Digitaliseringsstyrelsen),"This study was supported by Innovation Fund Denmark through the ChinaWaterSense project (file number: 8087-00002B).

However, despite the high level of interest and research in climate change risks on socioeconomic, urban and natural systems, studies that assess climate change impacts on urban cultural heritage and contribute to a holistic understanding on the subject present noticeable gaps in knowledge. A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to assess the state -of-the-art of cultural heritage risk assessment methodologies within urban systems in the context of climate change, specifically historic urban areas. For this purpose, a systematic search was applied using Web of Science and Scopus. The search identified and characterized existing methodologies on vulnerability and risk assessment for cultural heritage in a changing climate following the PRISMA protocol, and it synthesized knowledge gaps to be addressed in the near future. This study aims to bring risk assessment methodologies closer to urban planners for more efficient climate change adaptation policies. The research concluded that there is an unbalance between the amount of methodologies for the different climate change derived hazards and their impacts on historic urban areas. The amount of methodologies focused on flooding highlights that further research is needed for other relevant hazards, like heat and cold waves, that contribute to a holistic perspective.","[Quesada-Ganuza, Laura; Garmendia, Leire; Roji, Eduardo] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Sch Engn Bilbao, Mech Engn Dept, Plaza Ingeniero Torres Quevedo S-N, Bilbao 48013, Spain; [Gandini, Alessandra] Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, TECNALIA, Parque Tecnol Bizkaia,Edificio 700, Derio 48160, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Quesada-Ganuza, L (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Sch Engn Bilbao, Mech Engn Dept, Plaza Ingeniero Torres Quevedo S-N, Bilbao 48013, Spain.",laura.quesada@ehu.eus; leire.garmendia@ehu.eus; eduardo.roji@ehu.eus; alessandra.gandini@tecnalia.com,"Gandini, Alessandra/ADO-3635-2022; Garmendia, Leire/O-8006-2015","Gandini, Alessandra/0000-0001-5872-5774; Garmendia, Leire/0000-0002-3363-1015; ROJI CHANDRO, EDUARDO/0000-0003-3322-5524; Quesada-Ganuza, Laura/0000-0001-8225-575X","European Commission through the SHELTER project [821282]; University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU [PPGA20/26, GIU19/029]; Basque Government [IT1314-19]; SAREN of the Faculty of Engineering in Bilbao",European Commission through the SHELTER project; University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU; Basque Government(Basque Government); SAREN of the Faculty of Engineering in Bilbao,"The authors wish to acknowledge funding from the European Commission through the SHELTER project (GA 821282) and from the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU (PPGA20/26), as well as the support of research groups IT1314-19 of the Basque Government, GIU19/029 of the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU and SAREN of the Faculty of Engineering in Bilbao.",,76,3,3,17,35,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

The backgrounding of a gender-specific perspective in REDD+ research is often justified from the premise that forests are an inherently male business and REDD+ is only a technical issue. Although millions of women, predominantly indigenous women, are involved in forest work and forestry their importance for natural resource management has been systematically devalued and invisibilized. This paper reviews the gender literature on climate change and REDD +-projects to elaborate on gender-specific subordination of women, with a closer attention to indigenous women, which hinder effective forest protection, fair resource allocation, gender equality and social justice. The paper integrates an autonomous model for climate change adaption lead by indigenous women, that documents not only the local climatic effects on agriculture and forests but develops responses beyond the top downmodel of REDD+.

An original quasi-ergodic analysis of variance was applied to quantify uncertainties related to General Circulation Models (GCMs), Statistical Downscaling Models (SDMs) and the internal variability of each GCM/SDM simulation chain. For temperature, GCM uncertainty prevails and SDM uncertainty is nonnegligible. Significant warming and in turn significant changes are predicted for evaporation, snow cover and seasonality of discharges. For precipitation, GCM and SDM uncertainty components are of the same order. A high contribution of the large and small-scale components of internal variability is also obtained, inherited, respectively, from the GCMs and the different replicates of a given SDM. The same applies for annual discharge. The uncertainty in values that could be experienced for any given future period is therefore very high. For both discharge and precipitation, even the sign of future realizations is uncertain at a 90% confidence level. These findings have important implications. Similarly to GCM uncertainty, SDM uncertainty cannot be neglected. The same applies for both components of internal variability. Climate change impact studies based on a single SDM realization are likely to be no more relevant than those based on a single GCM run. They may lead to poor decisions for climate change adaptation.","[Lafaysse, M.; Hingray, B.; Mezghani, A.] Univ Grenoble Alpes, LTHE UMR 5564, Grenoble, France; [Lafaysse, M.] Meteo France, CNRS, CNRM GAME, CEN, St Martin Dheres, France; [Hingray, B.; Mezghani, A.] CNRS, LTHE UMR 5564, Grenoble, France; [Gailhard, J.] EDF DTG, Grenoble, France; [Terray, L.] CERFACS Sci Univers, CERFACS, CNRS, URA 1875, Toulouse, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CERFACS,"Lafaysse, M (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, LTHE UMR 5564, Grenoble, France.",matthieu.lafaysse@meteo.fr,"Terray, Laurent/B-8056-2008","Terray, Laurent/0000-0001-5512-7074",Meteo-France; Electricite de France (EDF); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); French National Research Agency (ANR),Meteo-France; Electricite de France (EDF)(Electricite de France (EDF)); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); French National Research Agency (ANR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"This work is part of a PhD research project funded by Meteo-France.

Climate action is mainstreamed in various public policies in which spatial planning has a key role and operates as a coordinating framework as well as one that enables specific interventions. At the same time, land, an indispensable element of spatial planning, is gaining attention as a natural resource that is closely related to climate change. Increasing need for land protection raises the need for a renewed role of spatial planning of all types and levels. This paper examines issues of land protection related to climate change in a peri-urban area of the Thessaloniki metropolitan area in Greece and seeks to identify how the types of spatial planning contribute to land protection. It is argued that when viewing land protection from a climate adaptation perspective, a renewed relationship between the types and levels of spatial planning that demands emphasis be placed on their cooperation and the enabling of novel approaches such as nature-based solutions becomes apparent.","[Thoidou, Elisavet] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Fac Engn, Sch Spatial Planning & Dev, GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Thoidou, E (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Fac Engn, Sch Spatial Planning & Dev, GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Greece.",thoidouel@auth.gr,,"THOIDOU, ELISAVET/0000-0002-5805-0946",,,,,60,3,3,3,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2021,13,8,,,,,,,4456,10.3390/su13084456,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13084456,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RU8DO,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000645372200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The current forest damages sparked a nationwide debate about the role of forests and their adaptation to climate change. Echoing back to the debate on the German forest dieback in the 1980s, the current situation is commonly framed as forest dieback 2.0. As mass media possess discursive power in attributing specific meaning to topics, it influences public opinion and decision-making processes. Therefore, we conducted a frame analysis of newspaper articles on the impact of the drought years between 2018 and 2020 on forests. The aim was to identify the dominant actors in the debate and how they frame the current damages to German forests. Our results show that the forestry sector, politicians and journalists dominate the debate. Despite the low standing of nature conservationists in the debate, we observed a balanced, yet polarized presentation of forest and nature conservation frames. Whereas environmental factors are depicted as the main cause of forest damages, nature conservationists also blame the forestry sector. At the same time, forests are presented as the main affected as well as the most important factor to solve the crisis in relation to its climate mitigation potential. Forest management practices are identified as key instruments contributing to those solutions. In this regard, actors in the debate instrumentalize forests through dominant climate change discourses in order to legitimize their perspectives. In contrast, the societal responsibility and consequences of the forest damages are neglected.","[Mack, Philipp; Kremer, Jakob; Kleinschmit, Daniela] Univ Freiburg, Inst Environm Social Sci, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Chair Forest & Environm Policy, Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Mack, P (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Environm Social Sci, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Chair Forest & Environm Policy, Freiburg, Germany.",philipp.mack@confobi.uni-freiburg.de,,,German Research Foundation (DFG) through the Research Training Group ConFoBi (Conservation of Forest Biodiversity in Multiple-Use Landscapes Central Europe);  [GRK 2123/2],German Research Foundation (DFG) through the Research Training Group ConFoBi (Conservation of Forest Biodiversity in Multiple-Use Landscapes Central Europe); ,Funding sources Funding for this research was provided by the German Research Foundation (DFG) through the Research Training Group ConFoBi (Conservation of Forest Biodiversity in Multiple-Use Landscapes Central Europe) [Grant number GRK 2123/2] .,,113,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,FEB,2023,147,,,,,,,,102883,10.1016/j.forpol.2022.102883,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2022.102883,,,14,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,6X9EP,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000896709800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent evidence on the significant impacts of climate change and natural disasters on firms, banks and other financial institutions call for a prompt policy response. In this paper, we employ a macro-financial agent-based model to study the interaction between climate change, credit and economic dynamics and test a mix of policy interven-tions. We first show that financial constraints exacerbate the impact of climate shocks on the economy while, at the same time, climate damages to firms make the banking sector more prone to crises. We find that credit provision can both increase firms' productivity and their financial fragility, with such a trade-off being exacerbated by the effects of climate change. We then test a set of green finance policies addressing these risks, while fostering climate change mitigation: i) green Basel-type capital requirements, ii) green public guarantees to credit, and iii) carbon-risk adjustment in credit ratings. All the policies reduce carbon emissions and the resulting climate impacts, though moderately. However, their effects on financial and real dynamics is not straightforwardly positive. Some combinations of policies fuel credit booms, exacerbating financial instability and increasing public debt. We show that the combination of the three policies leads to a virtuous cycle of (mild) emission reductions, stable financial sector and high economic growth. Additional tools would be needed to fully adapt to climate change. Hence, our results point to the need to complement financial policies cooling down climate-related risks with mitigation policies curbing emissions from real economic activities.

Fecundity results showed that egg laying at 32 degrees C was higher than at 28 and 14 degrees C. Free sterols, free fatty acids, and triacylglycerols were quantified at 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of the experiment using Analtech channeled high performance silica gel plates with a preadsorbent zone. Plates were developed using the Mangold mobile phase, petroleum ether-diethyl ether-glacial acetic acid (80:20:1), and after treatment with 5% ethanolic phosphomolybdic acid spray reagent and 10min of heating at 110 degrees C, neutral lipids appeared as blue zones on a yellow background. Quantitative densitometric analysis was performed using a CAMAG TLC Scanner II with the tungsten light source set at 610nm. Quantitative identification was based on correspondence of Rf values of sample and neutral lipid standard zones. At week 2 after the initiation of the experiment, there were significant differences in triacylglycerol content between all three temperatures, suggesting that at the higher temperatures snails were building reserves of depot fat. Global climate changes have led to concerns about the spread of infectious disease, including snail born infections such as schistosomiasis. Some of these concerns relate to the ability of vector snails to adapt to climate change, making studies on lipid use of vector snails at temperature extremes crucial to a better understanding of the potential spread of snail-borne disease.","[Fried, Bernard] Lafayette Coll, Dept Biol, Easton, PA 18042 USA; [Bolstridge, Jeff; Sherma, Joseph] Lafayette Coll, Dept Chem, Easton, PA 18042 USA",Lafayette College; Lafayette College,"Fried, B (corresponding author), Lafayette Coll, Dept Biol, Easton, PA 18042 USA.",friedb@lafayette.edu,,,Camille & Henry Dreyfus Foundation; Lafayette College EXCEL Scholars; NIH-NIAID [NO1-AI-55270],Camille & Henry Dreyfus Foundation; Lafayette College EXCEL Scholars; NIH-NIAID(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)),"We are indebted to Dr. Fred A.

Methods: Using cross-sectional data from 210 women collected in 2009 across 28 agro-pastoralist villages in Kaokoveld Namibia, we conducted principal-component (PC) analysis of resource variables and constructed profiles of resource strategies from the major PCs. Next, we explored associations between key resource strategies and demographic measures and fitness proxies. Results: The first two PCs accounted for 43% of women's overall resource variation. PC1 reflects women's ability to access market resources via livestock trading, while PC2 captured women's direct food access. We found that market strategies were more common among married women and less common among women who have experienced child mortality. Women with higher subsistence security were more likely to be from the OvaHimba tribe and had a higher risk of gonorrhea exposure. We also qualitatively explored drought-induced pressure on women's livestock. Finally, we show that sexual networks were attenuated during drought, indicating strain on social support. Conclusions: Our results highlight how agro-pastoralist women manage critical resources in unpredictable environments, and how resource strategies distribute among the women in our study. Goats as a commodity to obtain critical resources suggests that some women have flexibility during drought when gardens fail and cattle die. However, increased aridity and drought may eventually overwhelm husbandry practices in this region.","[Hazel, Ashley; Jones, James Holland] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Meeks, Gillian] Harvard Univ, Dept Human Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Meeks, Gillian] Univ Calif Davis, Program Integrat Genet & Genom, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Bharti, Nita] Penn State Univ, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, Dept Biol, State Coll, PA USA; [Jakurama, John; Matundu, Justy] Kaoko Informat Ctr, Opuwo, Namibia",Stanford University; Harvard University; University of California System; University of California Davis; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Hazel, A (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",mahazel@stanford.edu; jhj1@stanford.edu,,"Hazel, Ashley/0000-0001-7680-5460; Bharti, Nita/0000-0003-1940-7794; Jones, James/0000-0003-1680-6757; Meeks, Gillian/0000-0002-8436-6514",Wenner-Gren Foundation; Robert Wood Johnson Health & Society Foundation; American Philosophical Society; University of Michigan; Branco Weiss Science in Society Program; Huck Institute of Life Sciences at Penn State,Wenner-Gren Foundation; Robert Wood Johnson Health & Society Foundation; American Philosophical Society; University of Michigan(University of Michigan System); Branco Weiss Science in Society Program; Huck Institute of Life Sciences at Penn State,"Foremost, we thank all the people who participated in this research.

Climate change perception and vulnerability were assessed based on the household survey information collected from randomly selected 118 farmers of Kalapara subdistrict in Bangladesh. This paper identified the socio-economic covariates of climate change perception and vulnerability in relation to agricultural adaptation. It was also determined whether their perception was consistent with meteorological information. Findings revealed that the farmers had a moderate level of perception of and vulnerability to climate change. An overwhelming majority (98%) of the respondents perceived a wanner summer and 96% of them observed a colder winter compared to the past. Among the fanners, 91% believed that rainfall had increased and 97% thought that the timing of rainfall had changed. The belief of increase in soil salinity and associated loss was prevailing among 98 and 99% of them, respectively. Observed climate data were mostly aligned with the fanners' perception with respect to temperature, rainfall, floods, droughts and salinity. Positive correlations were found among the perception of climate change, the perception of vulnerability and the number of adopted adaptation practices. Farmers' level of understanding of climate change, vulnerability and adaptation practices could be improved by involving them in different organizations, such as climate field school and farmer associations. It could accelerate the dissemination of agricultural adaptation practices among them to cope with adverse agricultural impacts of climate change.","[Hasan, Md Kamrul; Kumar, Lalit] Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW, Australia; [Hasan, Md Kamrul] Patuakhali Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Rural Dev, Dumki 8602, Patuakhali, Bangladesh; [Kumar, Lalit] Univ New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia",University of New England; University of New England,"Hasan, MK (corresponding author), Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW, Australia.;Hasan, MK (corresponding author), Patuakhali Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Rural Dev, Dumki 8602, Patuakhali, Bangladesh.",kamrulext@pstu.ac.bd; lkumar@une.edu.au,"hasan, kamrul/HGV-0910-2022; Hasan, Prof Dr Md Kamrul/U-8711-2019","Hasan, Prof Dr Md Kamrul/0000-0003-3567-2854",Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; European Union; Ghent University (Belgium),"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); European Union(European Commission); Ghent University (Belgium)(Ghent University)","This study was a part of PhD research concerning the impact of climate change on farming systems and farm management in coastal areas of Bangladesh with financial support from the Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.

In this study, a water resources management model was developed for the upper west slope Sierra Nevada to understand the potential effects of regional climate warming on hydropower at the watershed scale, a scale that has been largely neglected but is important for hydroregional planning. The model is developed with the Water Evaluation and Planning system (WEAP) and includes most water management infrastructure in the study region. Hydropower is simulated assuming historical long-term electricity demand and a spill minimization rule. The method is suitable for simulating generation for most of the main watersheds in the region. To assess the potential effect of climate warming, uniform air temperature increases of 0 degrees C, 2 degrees C, 4 degrees C, and 6 degrees C were considered, with no change in precipitation, to approximate regional warming through 2100. The highly productive northern Sierra Nevada sees large reductions in hydropower generation with decreases in annual runoff. The central watersheds see less reduction in annual runoff and can adapt better to changes in runoff timing. Generation in southern watersheds, which are less productive, decreases. Results from this study can help identify which watersheds might easily adapt to climate change, where hydropower is likely to conflict with other uses, and where more detailed operational studies are needed.","[Rheinheimer, David E.; Viers, Joshua H.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Watershed Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Sieber, Jack] Stockholm Environm Inst, Somerville, MA 02144 USA; [Kiparsky, Michael] Univ Calif Berkeley, Wheeler Inst Water Law & Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Mehta, Vishal K.] Stockholm Environm Inst, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Ligare, Scott T.] State Water Resources Control Board, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Rheinheimer, DE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Watershed Sci, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",drheinheimer@ucdavis.edu; jhviers@ucdavis.edu,"Viers, Joshua/ABC-1851-2020; Rheinheimer, David/K-7437-2015","Viers, Joshua/0000-0001-7957-7942; Rheinheimer, David/0000-0003-1525-9069",California Energy Commission's Public Interest Energy Research (PIER) program,California Energy Commission's Public Interest Energy Research (PIER) program,"This work was funded in part by the California Energy Commission's Public Interest Energy Research (PIER) program.

Likely impacts of and adaptations to climate change are drawing the attention of researchers from many disciplines. In adaptation research focus is often on perceptions of climate change and on vulnerability and adaptation strategies in a particular region or community. But how do we research the ways in which people experience changing climatic conditions, the processes of decision-making, the actual adaptation strategies carried out and the consequences of these for actors living and dealing with climate change? On the basis of a literature review of all articles published in Global Environmental Change between 2000 and 2012 that deal with human dimensions of climate change using qualitative methods this paper provides some answers but also raises some concerns. The period and length of fieldwork and the number and types of interviews conducted are, for example, not always clear. Information on crucial aspects of qualitative research like researcher positionality, social positions of key informants, the use of field assistants, language issues and post-fieldwork treatment of data is also lacking in many articles.

Global gridded cropping system data products offer useful information for these applications. However, not only the main sources of information (satellites, censuses, surveys and models) but also the spatial and temporal resolutions of these data products are quite distant from each other because of different user requirements. This is a barrier to strengthening collaborations among the research communities working to increase the capacity of societies to manage climate risks for global food systems, from extreme weather disasters to climate change. A first step is to improve cropping system data products so they can be used more seamlessly across various applications than they are currently. Toward this goal, this article reviews global gridded data products of crop variables (area, yield, cropping intensity, etc) using systematic literature survey, identifies their current limitations, and suggests directions for future research. We found that cropland or crop type mapping and yield or production estimation/prediction together accounted for half of the research objectives of the reviewed studies. Satellite-based data products are dominant at the finer resolution in space and time (<10 km and daily to annual), while model-based data products are found at the coarser resolutions (>55 km and > decadal). Census-based data products are seen at intermediate resolutions (10-55 km and annual to decadal). The suggested directions for future research include the hybridization of multiple sources of information, improvements to temporal coverage and resolution, the enrichment of management variables, the exploration of new sources of information, and comprehensiveness within a single data product.","[Kim, Kwang-Hyung] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Doi, Yasuhiro; Iizumi, Toshichika] Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan; [Ramankutty, Navin] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, Sch Publ Policy & Global Affairs, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",Seoul National University (SNU); National Agriculture & Food Research Organization - Japan; University of British Columbia,"Iizumi, T (corresponding author), Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan.",iizumit@affrc.go.jp,,"Iizumi, Toshichika/0000-0002-0611-4637; Ramankutty, Navin/0000-0002-3737-5717","FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund [JPMEERF20202005]; Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JPJ000959, 18H02317, 20K06267]; NSERC Discovery Grant [RGPIN-2017-04648]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20K06267, 18H02317] Funding Source: KAKEN","FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund; Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); NSERC Discovery Grant(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","K-H K was supported by the FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific.

Objectives: This study sought to investigate time series of daily admissions from two public hospitals in Limpopo province in South Africa with climate variability and air quality. Methods: We used wavelet transform cross-correlation analysis to monitor coincidences in changes of meteorological (temperature and rainfall) and air quality (concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2) variables with admissions to hospitals for gastrointestinal illnesses including diarrhoea, pneumonia-related diagnosis, malaria and asthma cases. We were interested to disentangle meteorological or environmental variables that might be associated with underlying temporal variations of disease prevalence measured through visits to hospitals. Results: We found preconditioning of prevalence of pneumonia by changes in air quality and showed that malaria in South Africa is a multivariate event, initiated by co-occurrence of heat and rainfall. We provided new statistical estimates of time delays between the change of weather or air pollution and increase of hospital admissions for pneumonia and malaria that are addition to already known seasonal variations. We found that increase of prevalence of pneumonia follows changes in air quality after a time period of 10 to 15 days, while the increase of incidence of malaria follows the co-occurrence of high temperature and rainfall after a 30-day interval. Discussion: Our findings have relevance for early warning system development and climate change adaptation planning to protect human health and well-being. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

We assessed the effects of the processed gypsum seed dressing SOP (R) COCUS MAIZE+ (SCM), combined with a gradient of N fertilization rates (i.e., 0%, 70% equal to 160 kg N ha(-1), and 100% equal to 230 kg N ha(-1)) in maize (Zea mays L.), on: (i) grain yield, (ii) root length density (RLD) and diameter class length (DCL), (iii) biodiversity of soil bacteria and fungi, and (iv) Greenhouse Gases (GHGs, i.e., N2O, CO2, and CH4) emission. Grain yield increased with SCM by 1 Mg ha(-1) (+8%). The same occurred for overall RLD (+12%) and DCL of very fine, fine, and medium root classes. At anthesis, soil microbial biodiversity was not affected by treatments, suggesting earlier plant-rhizosphere interactions. Soil GHGs showed that (i) the main driver of N losses as N2O is the N-fertilization level, and (ii) decreasing N-fertilization in maize from 100% to 70% decreased N2O emissions by 509 mg N-N2O m(-2) y(-1). Since maize grain yield under SCM with 70% N-fertilization was similar to that under Control with 100% N-fertilization, we concluded that under our experimental conditions SCM may be used for reducing N input (-30%) and N2O emissions (-23%), while contemporarily maintaining maize yield. Hence, SCM can be considered an available tool to improve agriculture's alignment to the United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and to comply with Europe's Farm to Fork strategy for reducing N-fertilizer inputs.","[Maris, Stefania Codruta; Capra, Federico; Ardenti, Federico; Boselli, Roberta; Amaducci, Stefano; Tabaglio, Vincenzo; Fiorini, Andrea] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Sustainable Crop Prod, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy; [Chiodini, Marcello E.] Univ Milan, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, Via Celoria 2, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Taskin, Eren; Puglisi, Edoardo] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Sustainable Food Proc, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy; [Bertora, Chiara] Univ Turin, Dept Agr Forest & Food Sci, Largo Braccini 2, I-10095 Grugliasco, Italy; [Poggianella, Lorenzo] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Milan; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Turin; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Tabaglio, V (corresponding author), Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Sustainable Crop Prod, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy.",stefania@macs.udl.cat; federico.capra@unicatt.it; federico.ardenti@unicatt.it; marcello.chiodini@guest.unimi.it; roberta.boselli@unicatt.it; eren.taskin@unicatt.it; edoardo.puglisi@unicatt.it; chiara.bertora@unito.it; lpoggianella@ucdavis.edu; stefano.amaducci@unicatt.it; vincenzo.tabaglio@unicatt.it; andrea.fiorini@unicatt.it,"Puglisi, Edoardo/I-8720-2012; Tabaglio, Vincenzo/C-5989-2008","Puglisi, Edoardo/0000-0001-5051-0971; Tabaglio, Vincenzo/0000-0003-3456-1589; Bertora, Chiara/0000-0001-9583-2384; Chiodini, Marcello Ermido/0000-0002-6870-1001; Fiorini, Andrea/0000-0002-5601-2954","SOP sr-Via Parco Alto Milanese, 1, Busto Arsizio VA, Italy","SOP sr-Via Parco Alto Milanese, 1, Busto Arsizio VA, Italy","This research was funded by SOP sr-Via Parco Alto Milanese, 1, 21052 Busto Arsizio VA, Italy.",,86,4,4,4,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,MAR,2021,11,3,,,,,,,407,10.3390/agronomy11030407,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11030407,,,19,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,RD0AM,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000633152500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In recent years, the evidence shows erosional threats and gradual submergence along the creeks and lowlands of Ratnagiri. To deliberate the vulnerability of these hazards, vulnerability ranking was assigned using a coastal vulnerability index (CVI) using six geophysical parameters. The datasets were obtained from the satellite data of Landsat series from the years 1973, 2015, and 2019 to derive geomorphology of the coast and coastal landforms. Shoreline change along Kelshi, Kachave-Undi-Waravde region, and Mirya bay and beach have been evaluated using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System by demarcating the baseline and shorelines from the series of Landsat data. Data obtained is re-improvised with Google data for updating the recent change in the study area. Elevation data is extracted from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer data of 30 m spatial resolution, the susceptibility of coastal inundation was derived using General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans data, and this has indicated northerly submergence of the coast, prone to become vulnerable. The tidal variations along two major gauging stations were extracted from Windows Unix program for Tides 32 software for Rajapur and Mormugao stations. The CVI results in the categorization of areas with a high-risk vulnerability along the beaches, creeks, and estuaries of Kelshi, Jaigad, Rajapur, and Kajali, while low-risk areas like cliffs and shoals are geologically confronted. The findings from the CVI suggest the need for identifying and mapping such vulnerable areas and is an initial step to emphasize coastal regions for climate change adaptations.","[Thakare, Lalit M.] Sir Parashurambhau Coll, Dept Geog, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Shitole, Tushar A.] Prof Ramkrishna More Arts Commerce & Sci Coll, Dept Geog, Pune, Maharashtra, India",,"Thakare, LM (corresponding author), Sir Parashurambhau Coll, Dept Geog, Pune, Maharashtra, India.",lmthakare@gmail.com,,,,,,,44,1,1,0,4,COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION,COCONUT CREEK,"5130 NW 54TH STREET, COCONUT CREEK, FL 33073 USA",0749-0208,1551-5036,,J COASTAL RES,J.

In this study, drought risk is assessed at a national level across Africa, and the impacts of climate change, population growth, and socioeconomic vulnerabilities on drought risk are investigated. A rigorous framework is implemented to quantify drought vulnerability considering various sectors including economy, energy and infrastructure, health, land use, society, and water resources. Multi-model and multi-scenario analyses are employed to quantify drought hazard using an ensemble of 10 regional climate models and a multi-scalar drought index. Drought risk is then assessed in each country for 2 climate emission pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), 3 population scenarios, and 3 vulnerability scenarios during three future periods between 2010 and 2100. Drought risk ratio is quantified, and the role of each component (i.e. hazard, vulnerability, and exposure) is identified, and the associated uncertainties are also characterized. Results show that drought risk is expected to increase in future across Africa with varied rates for different models and scenarios. Although northern African countries indicate aggravating drought hazard, drought risk ratio is found to be highest in central African countries as a consequent of vulnerability and population rise in that region. Results indicate that if no climate change adaptation is implemented, unprecedented drought hazard and risk will occur decades earlier. In addition, controlling population growth is found to be imperative for mitigating drought risk in Africa (even more effective than climate change mitigation), as it improves socioeconomic vulnerability and reduces potential exposure to drought.

Ecosystem-based adaptation is emerging as an important type of adaptation response. Despite its recognized promise, it remains a challenging task to conceptualize governance regimes for it because of the involvement of numerous actors across the landscape scale. Both multi-level and collaborative forms of governance are required to involve relevant actors in decision-making and related actions. We explore the applicability of the theory of nodal governance, in conjunction with social network theory, to provide a framework for operationalizing the concepts of multi-level and collaborative governance. We use the Bergrivier municipal area of South Africa as a case study, focusing on organizations (nodes) that have the potential to implement ecosystem-based adaptation. We show that a nodal governance focus on institutional structures, mentalities, technologies, and resources can be highly effective for understanding the factors supporting or constraining ecosystem-based adaptation. A focus on the number and strength of network connections that actors share highlights how the numerous connections between organizations constitute an important opportunity for strengthening ecosystem-based adaptation outcomes in the future. The analysis suggests that in the Bergrivier municipal area, both agricultural best practices and restoration activities are side-lined compared to other activities (e.g., land use planning) despite the importance of the agricultural sector in the Bergrivier area. We argue that a nodal governance focus, accompanied by the use of social network analysis, can be highly effective for understanding how to improve governance of adaptation at the local level.","[Ziervogel, Gina; Haiden, Sarah] Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Ziervogel, Gina; Haiden, Sarah] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Pasquini, Lorena] Univ Cape Town, Global Risk Governance Programme, Fac Law, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Ziervogel, G (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.;Ziervogel, G (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",gina@csag.uct.ac.za,"Ziervogel, Gina/AAG-2945-2019","Ziervogel, Gina/0000-0003-4219-6809","African Climate and Development Initiative; National Research Foundation of South Africa under Fulcrum Institutions for Socio-Ecological Resilience project of the Global Change, Society and Sustainability research programme","African Climate and Development Initiative; National Research Foundation of South Africa under Fulcrum Institutions for Socio-Ecological Resilience project of the Global Change, Society and Sustainability research programme","All the respondents who gave up time to be interviewed are gratefully acknowledged.

Gridded station-based observations from the historical period (1951-2020) and simulations from 14 General Circulation Models for the future (2021-2100), participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) are considered. Apart from an overall increasing pattern of precipitation extremes, it is noticed that the contribution of frequency dominates over intensity. Specifically, the frequency of 99th percentile daily rainfall is projected to increase approximately by two- (SSP245) to three- (SSP585) times in future. We also proposed a new zoning of entire Indian mainland, identified as six Homogeneous Precipitation Zones (HPZs). HPZ-wise analysis reveals that the increase in frequency dominates over intensity for all the HPZs with a varying extent. For instance, increase in frequency is more for the climatologically high-precipitation zones (HPZ-3: Western Ghats, and HPZ-6: North-east India), whereas increase in intensity is more for the low-precipitation zones (HPZ-1: North-west India, and HPZ-4: Peninsular India). The degree of increase gets even more pronounced under the worst scenario SSP585, indicating a potential impact of anthropogenic activities on changing precipitation extremes. Findings of this study should be accounted in the climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies for future.","[Sarkar, Subharthi; Maity, Rajib] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur,"Maity, R (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India.",rajib@civil.iitkgp.ac.in,"Maity, Rajib/AAP-9797-2020","Maity, Rajib/0000-0001-5631-9553","Ministry of Earth Science, Government of India; Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India; Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India","Ministry of Earth Science, Government of India; Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India(Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY), Government of India); Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India(Department of Science & Technology (India))","This work is partially supported by the Ministry of Earth Science, Government of India through a sponsored project.

Due to highly variable climate and data scarcity of the upper Blue Nile Basin, previous studies did not detect specific unified trends. This study discusses, the past and future climate projections under CMIP6-SSPs scenarios for the basin. For the models' validation and selection, reanalysis data were used after comparing with area-averaged ground observational data. Quantile mapping systematic bias correction and Mann-Kendall trend test were applied to evaluate the trends of selected CMIP6 models during the 21st century. Results revealed that, ERA5 for temperature and GPCC for precipitation have best agreement with the basin observational data, MRI-ESM2-0 for temperature and BCC-CSM-2MR for precipitation were selected based on their highest performance. The MRI-ESM2-0 mean annual maximum temperature for the near (long)-term period shows an increase of 1.1 (1.5) degrees C, 1.3 (2.2) degrees C, 1.2 (2.8) degrees C, and 1.5 (3.8) degrees C under the four SSPs. On the other hand, the BCC-CSM-2MR precipitation projections show slightly (statistically insignificant) increasing trend for the near (long)-term periods by 5.9 (6.1)%, 12.8 (13.7)%, 9.5 (9.1)%, and 17.1(17.7)% under four SSPs scenarios.","[Alaminie, Addis A.; Tilahun, Seifu A.; Zimale, Fasikaw A.] Bahir Dar Univ, Fac Civil & Water Resources Engn, Bahir Dar Inst Technol, Bahir Dar 6000, Ethiopia; [Legesse, Solomon A.; Tarkegn, Gashaw Bimrew] Bahir Dar Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Dept NRM & Climate Change, Bahir Dar 6000, Ethiopia; [Jury, Mark R.] Univ Puerto Rico Mayaguez, Phys Dept, Mayaguez, PR 00680 USA",Bahir Dar University; Bahir Dar University; University of Puerto Rico; University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez,"Alaminie, AA (corresponding author), Bahir Dar Univ, Fac Civil & Water Resources Engn, Bahir Dar Inst Technol, Bahir Dar 6000, Ethiopia.",metaddi@gmail.com; satadm86@gmail.com; soladd2000@yahoo.com; fasikaw@gmail.com; gashbimrew@gmail.com; mark.jury@upr.edu,"Atanaw, Fasikaw/AGL-4262-2022; Tilahun, Seifu/ABE-2501-2020; Zimale, Fasikaw/GYU-1722-2022","Jury, Mark R/0000-0002-6871-403X; Addisu, Solomon/0000-0002-2555-4478; Tilahun, Seifu/0000-0002-5219-4527; Zimale, Fasikaw/0000-0001-9778-2712","School of Research and Graduate Studies, Bahir Dar Institute of Technology, Bahir Dar University","School of Research and Graduate Studies, Bahir Dar Institute of Technology, Bahir Dar University","The first author would like to thank School of Research and Graduate Studies, Bahir Dar Institute of Technology, Bahir Dar University for providing financial support for PhD research work.",,74,5,5,3,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,AUG,2021,13,15,,,,,,,2110,10.3390/w13152110,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13152110,,,22,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,TW1VG,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000682196300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Novel adaptation strategies, such as managed relocation, frequently entail embracing substantial risk of unintended harm to the focal ecosystems, in an effort to alleviate serious threats to biological diversity (e.g. extinction). Assessing ecological risks associated with different adaptation strategies is consistently called for, but the process for doing so is often undefined. Here, we describe a collaboration amongst university researchers, agency scientists and resource managers to create a set of ecological risk assessment protocols for managed relocation decision support. These protocols are designed to foster a rigorous assessment of ecological risk, while simultaneously being flexible and easy to use. We describe a collaborative process through which we developed a structure for assessing risk that includes a suite of 17 risk categories aggregated into six overarching groups, which is placed within a broader decision context for managed relocation (e.g. evaluating feasibility, social acceptability). Our risk scoring includes both scaled estimates of risk and perceived confidence in those estimates. Because of differences in the importance of risk categories, we do not recommend a quantitative summary across risk areas, but suggest decision makers make decisions based on three criteria: overall confidence that a proposed action can be confidently evaluated; low overall level or risk across categories; and no single risk category that is highly likely to result in severe adverse outcomes.","[Karasov-Olson, Aviv; Schwartz, Mark W.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Skikne, Sarah A.; Hellmann, Jessica J.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Olden, Julian D.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Lawrence, David J.; Schuurman, Gregor W.; Hoffman, Cat Hawkins] Natl Pk Serv, Climate Change Response Program, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Morisette, Jeffrey T.] US Forest Serv, Human Dimens Program, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Allen, Sarah] Natl Pk Serv, Point Reyes Natl Seashore, Point Reyes Stn, CA USA; [Brigham, Christy A.] Natl Pk Serv, Sequoia & Kings Canyon Natl Pk, Three Rivers, CA USA; [Buttke, Danielle] Natl Pk Serv, Biol Resources Div, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Miller-Rushing, Abraham J.] Natl Pk Serv, Acadia Natl Pk, Bar Harbor, ME USA; [Trammell, Melissa] Natl Pk Serv, Reg 6 7 & 8, Grand Junction, CO USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; United States Department of the Interior; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of the Interior; United States Department of the Interior; United States Department of the Interior; United States Department of the Interior; United States Department of the Interior,"Karasov-Olson, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",karasovoison@ucdavis.edu,"Schwartz, Mark/G-1066-2011","Schwartz, Mark/0000-0002-3739-6542; Karasov-Olson, Aviv/0000-0001-5362-2557",U.S. National Park Service (NPS) Climate Change Response Program; University of Minnesota; Nature Conservancy through the Nature Net Fellows program,U.S. National Park Service (NPS) Climate Change Response Program; University of Minnesota(University of Minnesota System); Nature Conservancy through the Nature Net Fellows program,"We thank P.

Urbanization itself is known to increase surface temperatures, but its quantitative effect on extreme precipitation remains very uncertain. Using decadal convection-permitting climate simulations in four midlatitude megacities (Paris, France; New York City, USA; Tokyo, Japan; Shanghai, China), we show that urbanization can strongly increase the frequency and intensity of extreme urban precipitation. Frequency increases far more than intensity, by +16% (11%-22%) (95% confidence interval) for 1 year daily extremes, and +26% (11%-41%) for 1 year hourly extremes, downwind of city centers. Intensities of the same events increase by +5% (3.2%-6.4%) (daily extremes) and +6% (3.2%-9.8%) (hourly extremes), respectively. The intensity and frequency of extremes increases more for the rarest, most extreme events considered, and there is some indication that hourly extremes increase more than daily extremes. Our simulations also show that direct urban anthropogenic emissions of heat could be an important factor driving these changes. Urbanization is expected to continue in the future, and our results indicate that these effects should be considered in urban planning decisions to make cities more resilient to extreme precipitation.","[Marelle, Louis; Myhre, Gunnar; Steensen, Birthe M.; Hodnebrog, Oivind; Alterskjaer, Kari; Sillmann, Jana] CICERO Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo, N-0318 Oslo, Norway; [Marelle, Louis] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, IRD, IGE, Grenoble, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Marelle, L (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, IRD, IGE, Grenoble, France.",louis.marelle@latmos.ipsl.fr,"Myhre, Gunnar/A-3598-2008; Hodnebrog, Øivind/F-5539-2015; Steensen, Birthe/GPG-0510-2022; Sillmann, Jana/P-3482-2017; Marelle, Louis/R-1912-2017","Myhre, Gunnar/0000-0002-4309-476X; Hodnebrog, Øivind/0000-0001-5233-8992; Sillmann, Jana/0000-0002-0219-5345; Alterskjaer, Kari/0000-0003-4650-1102; Marelle, Louis/0000-0003-4925-0046",Research Council of Norway [250573],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"The work has received support from the project SUPER (Grant No. 250573) funded through the Research Council of Norway.

Yet many of the sources of average yield gains are more effective in good weather, leading to heightened drought sensitivity. Here we consider two empirical strategies for detecting changes in drought sensitivity and apply them to maize in the United States, a crop that has experienced myriad management changes including recent adoption of drought-tolerant varieties. We show that a strategy that utilizes weather-driven temporal variations in drought exposure is inconclusive because of the infrequent occurrence of substantial drought. In contrast, a strategy that exploits within-county spatial variability in drought exposure, driven primarily by differences in soil water storage capacity, reveals robust trends over time. Yield sensitivity to soil water storage increased by 55% on average across the US Corn Belt since 1999, with larger increases in drier states. Although yields have been increasing under all conditions, the cost of drought relative to good weather has also risen. These results highlight the difficulty of simultaneously raising average yields and lowering drought sensitivity. A key climate change adaptation goal in agriculture is to reduce drought sensitivity of crop yields. A comparison of two empirical strategies applied to US maize for detecting changes in drought sensitivity reveals the advantages of utilizing within-country spatial variability in drought exposure, driven primarily by differences in soil water-storage capacity.","[Lobell, David B.; Deines, Jillian M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lobell, David B.; Deines, Jillian M.; Di Tommaso, Stefania] Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Lobell, DB (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Lobell, DB (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",dlobell@stanford.edu,,"Deines, Jillian M/0000-0002-4279-8765; Lobell, David/0000-0002-5969-3476","NASA Harvest Consortium (NASA Applied 787 Sciences) [80NSSC17K0652, 54308-Z6059203]; Stanford Data Science Initiative",NASA Harvest Consortium (NASA Applied 787 Sciences); Stanford Data Science Initiative,"This work was supported by the NASA Harvest Consortium (NASA Applied 787 Sciences Grant Number 80NSSC17K0652, sub-award 54308-Z6059203) and the Stanford Data Science Initiative.",,60,40,40,11,58,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",,2662-1355,,NAT FOOD,Nat.

However, unlike other components of the climate system, the impact of climate change on the groundwater system has only recently received attention. This focus is due to the realization that groundwater is a vital freshwater resource crucial to global food and water security, and is essential in sustaining ecosystems and human adaptation to climate variability and change. This paper synthesizes findings on the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on the entire groundwater system and each component. Also, we appraise the use of coupled groundwater-climate and land surface models in groundwater hydrology as a means of improving existing knowledge of climate change-groundwater interaction, finding that most models anticipate decreases in groundwater recharge, storage and levels, particularly in the arid/semi-arid tropics. Reducing uncertainties in future climate projections and improving our understanding of the physical processes underlying models to improve their simulation of real-world conditions remain a priority for climate and Earth scientists. Despite the enormous progress made, there are still few and inadequate local and regional aquifer studies, especially in less developed regions. The paper proposes two key considerations. First, physical basis: the need for a deeper grasp of complex physical processes and feedback mechanism with the use of more sophisticated models. Second, the need to understand the socioeconomic dimensions of climate-groundwater interaction through multidisciplinary synergy, leading to the development of better groundwater-climate change adaptation strategies and modeling.","[Amanambu, Amobichukwu C.; Mossa, Joann] Univ Florida, Dept Geog, Spatial & Temporal Anal Rivers STAR Lab, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Li, Lanhai; Ochege, Friday U.] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, 818 South Beijing Rd, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Li, Lanhai; Ochege, Friday U.] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Obarein, Omon A.] Kent State Univ, Dept Geog, 325 S Lincoln St, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Amanambu, Amobichukwu C.] Loughborough Univ, Sch Civil & Bldg Engn, Water Engn & Dev Ctr, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Ayeni, Shamusideen S.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog, 1009 Spring Garden St, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA; [Balogun, Olalekan] York Univ, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON M3J IP3, Canada; [Oyebamiji, Abiola] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geochem, State Key Lab Ore Deposit Geochem, Guiyang 550081, Peoples R China; [Li, Lanhai] Yili Stn Watershed Ecosyst Studies, 818 South Beijing Rd, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Ochege, Friday U.] Univ Port Harcourt, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Choba, Rivers State, Nigeria; [Oyebamiji, Abiola] Ekiti State Univ, Dept Sci Lab Technol, Ado Ekiti, Nigeria","State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xinjiang Institute of Ecology & Geography, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem; Loughborough University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro; York University - Canada; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Guiyang Institute of Geochemistry, CAS; University of Port Harcourt","Amanambu, AC (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;Li, LH (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Geog, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",a.amanambu@ufl.edu; lilh@ms.xjb.ac.cn; uchenna.ochege@uniport.edu.ng,"OYEBAMIJI, ABIOLA/AAN-3664-2021; Li, Lanhai/AAE-9967-2020; Ochege, Friday Uchenna/AAF-6958-2021","Ochege, Friday Uchenna/0000-0002-6661-0966; Mossa, Joann/0000-0003-4192-6056",commonwealth fellowship program; Chinese Academy of Sciences-The World Academy of Science (CASTWAS),commonwealth fellowship program; Chinese Academy of Sciences-The World Academy of Science (CASTWAS),The authors thank the commonwealth fellowship program for their support from the period of conceptuion and completion of this Manuscript.

Since early 2016, the Sustainable Remediation Forum (SURF) has led research and organized knowledge exchanges to examine (1) the impacts of climate change and extreme weather events on hazardous waste sites, and (2) how we can mitigate these impacts and create value for communities. The SURF team found that climate change and extreme weather events can undermine the effectiveness of the approved site remediation, and can also affect contaminant toxicity. exposure. organism sensitivity, fate and transport, long-term operations, management, and stewardship of remediation sites. Further, failure to consider social vulnerability to climate change could compromise remediation and adaptation strategies. SURF's recommendations for resilient remediation build on resources and drivers from state, national, and international sources, and marry the practices of sustainable remediation and climate change adaptation. They outline both general principles and site-specific protocols and provide global examples of mitigation and adaptation strategies.

This, however, represents a significant challenge as climate change risk assessment is itself a complex, dynamic and geographically diverse process. A wide range of factors including the nature of production processes and value chains, the location of business sites as well as relationships and interdependencies with customers and suppliers play a role in determining if and how companies are impacted by climate risks. This research explores the methodological challenges for a national-scale assessment of climate risks through the lens of the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (UKCCRA) process and compares the approaches adopted in the first and second UKCCRA (2011, 2016), while also reflecting on international experiences elsewhere. A review of these issues is presented, drawing on a wide body of contemporary evidence from a range of sources including the research disciplines, grey literature and government policy. The study reveals the methodological challenges and highlights six broad themes, namely scale, evidence base, adaptation responses, scope, interdependencies and public policy. The paper concludes by identifying suitable lessons for future national climate risk assessments, which should guide the next phase of research in preparation for UKCCRA3 and those of national-level risk assessments elsewhere.

Along California's North Coast streams, private property regimes on land have created commons tragedies in groundwater and salmon fisheries, both classic examples of commons that are often governed collectively and sustainably by their users. Understanding the linkages between salmon and groundwater is one major focus of salmon recovery and climate change adaptation planning in central California and increasingly throughout the Pacific Northwest. In this paper, I use extended field interviews and participant-observation in field ecology campaigns and regulatory forums to explore how, in one water-scarce, salmon-bearing watershed on California's central coast, collaborators are synthesizing agency and landowner data on groundwater and salmon management. I focus on three projects undertaken by citizen scientists in collaboration with me and Gold Ridge Resource Conservation District staff: salmonid censuses, mapping of wet and dry stream reaches and well monitoring. I find that collaborative research initiated by local residents and agency personnel has, in some cases, created a new sense of ecological possibility in the region. I also consider some limitations of this collaborations, namely the lack of engagement with indigenous Pomo and Miwok tribal members, with the Confederated Tribes of Graton Rancheria and with farmworkers and other marginalized residents, and suggest strategies for deepening environmental justice commitments in future collaborative work.","[Woelfle-Erskine, Cleo] Univ Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98105 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Woelfle-Erskine, C (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.",cleowe@uw.edu,"Woelfle-Erskine, Cleo/AAL-8964-2020","Woelfle Hazard, Cleo/0000-0002-4363-237X","National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship; Directorate of Geography and Spatial Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1434309] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate of Geography and Spatial Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","The author acknowledges funding from a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant from the Directorate of Geography and Spatial Sciences.

The economic and social impacts of rising fuel costs for fishers and communities in southwest England are examined. Fuel prices doubled between early 2007 and mid-2008, whereas fish prices remained relatively stable throughout as a result of the price-setting power of seafood buyers. It was the fishers who absorbed the increased costs, resulting in significant loss of income, reduced job security, and problems in recruiting crew. All gear types were affected, but fishers using towed gears were most adversely impacted. Fishing vessels with recent investment have greater fuel efficiency, so appeared to be more able to cope and to adapt to increased fuel costs. Fishing behaviour also altered as skippers attempted to increase fuel efficiency at the cost of reduced catches. Most skippers reported fishing closer to port, reducing their exploratory fishing, and ceasing experimentation with fishing gears with lesser environmental impact. Therefore, a threat to fishing community viability may have linked environmental effects. The impacts of this fuel price volatility foreshadow a likely future impact of rising fuel prices attributable to climate change adaptation and mitigation and forecasts of rising oil prices. Without proactive planning and policy development, rising fuel prices have the potential to cause job losses and economic hardship additional to problems that may arise from poor management and stock decline, in all fishing-related sectors of the industry.","[Abernethy, Kirsten E.; Kebede, Bereket] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Trebilcock, Paul] Cornish Fisheries Producer Org, Newlyn TR18 5JH, Penzance, England; [Allison, Edward H.] WorldFish Ctr, Bayan Lepas 11960, Penang, Malaysia; [Dulvy, Nicholas K.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",University of East Anglia; CGIAR; Worldfish; Simon Fraser University,"Abernethy, KE (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",k.abernethy@uea.ac.uk,"Allison, Edward Hugh/B-8615-2009; Kebede, Bereket/AAJ-9484-2020; Dulvy, Nicholas/I-2895-2012","Dulvy, Nicholas/0000-0002-4295-9725; Kebede, Bereket/0000-0003-4163-6614; Allison, Edward/0000-0003-4663-1396",Fisheries Society of the British Isles (FSBI),Fisheries Society of the British Isles (FSBI),"This work would not have been possible without the help and support of the Cornish Fish Producers Organization, Seafood Cornwall, W.

To support climate action, cities have formed cooperative networks such as the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, the Global Covenant of Mayors and the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives. However, a lack of scientific evidence exists when it comes to the actual impact of network participation, especially in the context of adaptation. This study is the first to test statistically the association between network membership and progress in adaptation planning in 377 cities globally. The results show that network members are more likely to have started the adaptation process than other cities, and that being a member of multiple networks is associated with higher levels of adaptation planning. Moreover, cities in wealthier countries are more likely to be more advanced in adaptation planning than others. We consider the possible explanations for these results based on the previous literature and information gathered from the networks. The main implications of our study are that network organisations should consider how to encourage the adaptation process among their members and the increased involvement of cities from lower-income countries.

We used the WOFOST and AquaCrop crop simulation models to examine the response of crop yield in winter wheat and maize to a set of climate change scenarios up to 2040 in the semi-arid climate of Mashhad in north-east Iran. Modelled climate change from six AOGCMs including GFCM21, HADCM3, INCM3, IPCM4, MPEH5 and NCCCSM under IPCC SRES A2 and B1 emission scenarios was used. The crop models were calibrated and validated against 7 years of observed crop yield data, confirming that the models adequately simulated yields of wheat and maize in the study area. The bootstrap method was used to estimate the uncertainty of crop yield projections. The results showed a mean yield decrease of 10-34% for winter wheat and 8-18% for maize, depending on the crop model and climate change scenario. The period of flowering to maturity of winter wheat and maize would be shortened on average by 9 and 5 days, respectively. Changes in crop management were considered for adaptation to climate change. Simulation results indicated that early sowing of winter wheat and late sowing of maize enhanced yield and water productivity across all climate change scenarios and that late-maturity cultivars of winter wheat and early-maturity hybrids of maize generally have higher productivity than standard cultivars. Increasing heat tolerance of the crops and changing irrigation management of winter wheat were also found to be beneficial adaptation options.

Yet public actors currently cover a small fraction of needed coastal adaptation investments, a finance gap set to widen as coastal adaptation costs continue to increase. Mobilizing private finance for coastal adaptation is thus a salient challenge, as emphasized in the Paris Agreement. Key under-researched dimensions of this challenge are what promotes private investment in coastal adaptation and how can public actors' interest in adaptation be aligned with private investor interests. To address this, we review the literatures on coastal adaptation finance and on financial arrangements involving both public actors and private investors. We describe key actors and interests, and identify coastal financial arrangements that align public actor and private investor interests, finding that private provisioning, public-private Partnerships (PPP), and public debt arrangements are promising. We then survey empirical examples, finding that private provisioning attracts investment when returns are high, for example, in urban real estate, and that PPPs attract dredging and construction companies' investment, particularly for adaptation measures with a large share of operational costs, for example, beach nourishment. We find little evidence of institutional investment through public debt instruments. A number of policy instruments, for example, concessional loans, tax incentives, and standards, may address this gap and enhance private coastal adaptation investment. Our results are also relevant for other sectors that involve long-term infrastructure adaptation measures.

Following T.S. Kuhn, these breaks with the past are seen as paradigm changes. We perceive planned adaptation of forestry and forests under climate change as a new paradigm change, precipitated once more by forest carbon. To be sustainable, forest management and conservation must embrace planned adaptation to and mitigation of mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. The current initiative of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries (REDD) represents, beyond its original mitigation goal, a major facet of planned adaptation of forests and adjoining sectors in developing countries. The initiative is gaining a powerful momentum for enhancing sustainable forest management in developing countries. REDD may also adapt relations between developing and developed countries in another paradigm change. Worldwide observations of climate change impacts on forests and IPCC forecasts project an image of forests and forestry entering a new era. Dealing with this future by relying on autonomous adaptation is unlikely to suffice. Climate change will alter site and ecological conditions, increase risk in many forests, create new gaps in knowledge, increase the value of forest carbon and wood energy, and expand the international and human dimensions of forestry. Ending the proverbial seed dormancy of new developments in forestry, change is underway and appears expedient. We conclude that anticipatory planned adaptation of all facets of forestry to climate change imposes mitigation and adaptation as new boundary conditions for sustainable forest management and conservation, and amounts to a paradigm change.

The proposed multi-hazard risk index was based on indicators from a broader domain and applied on 109 administrative districts of IHR. Exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and coping capacity were defined using comprehensive and sub-regional indicators identified through inductive and deductive approaches. The result showed that the differential risks among the districts of IHR were governed by the multiplicity of the factor such as demography, amenities, natural capital, partnership, technology and spatial specificities of the districts. The result highlighted the need of inclusion of spatial specificities for the risk mitigation in the IHR and therefore a Mountain Specific Risk Management Framework (MSMRMF) was proposed for sustaining the mountainous communities. The proposed MSMRMF contained two broad components as risk assessment and risk addressal. The framework detailed the risk mitigation and coping strategies (based on adjustment of internal and external strengths) for addressing risks. Risk mitigation was proposed to achieved through habitation resilience, natural capital enhancement, external partnerships, climate change adaptation, and technological interventions. The framework would provide an insight of risk and risk management strategies for the multi-hazard prone mountain regions for the sustainable development under the global change.","[Sekhri, Simran] Forest Res Inst, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Sekhri, Simran] Brandenburg Univ Technol Cottbus Senftenberg, Brandenburg, Germany; [Kumar, Praveen] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Environm Sci, New Delhi, India; [Kumar, Praveen; Fuerst, Christine] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Geog & Geosci, Halle, Germany; [Pandey, Rajiv] Indian Council Forestry Res & Educ, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India","Indian Council of Forestry Research & Education (ICFRE); Forest Research Institute (FRI); Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Indian Council of Forestry Research & Education (ICFRE)","Pandey, R (corresponding author), Indian Council Forestry Res & Educ, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India.",rajivfri@yahoo.com,"Kumar, Praveen/AHC-0969-2022; Fürst, Christine/H-8682-2012","Kumar, Praveen/0000-0002-3122-1397; Fürst, Christine/0000-0002-9678-4844; Pandey, Rajiv/0000-0003-4849-775X",,,,,120,31,33,4,38,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

To cope with this issue, we developed (i) spatial hierarchical models of functional diversity of stream invertebrate communities to assess the relative influence of local-vs. regional-scale factors in structuring community assembly, and (ii) analysis of metacommunity elements to determine the ecological processes behind the structuring. The spatial structuring of benthic invertebrate cominunities was investigated over 568 sites in South-eastern France. Community structure was mainly driven by the altitudinal gradient and spring flow variation at broad scales, with functional diversity gradually decreasing with elevation and being maximized at intermediate levels of flow variability. According to the 'elements of metacommunity structure' analysis, the prevailing influence of the altitudinal gradient was also supported by a Clenientsian structuration of invertebrate communities. Conversely, the influence of observed climatic changes in temperature and rainfall was weak and observed only at fine scales. As a result, natural environmental filters were stronger drivers of the functional diversity of communities than human-induced stressors (e.g. water pollution and hydromorphological alterations). More broadly, our results suggest that management needs to embrace the possibilities of gathering high spatial and taxonomical resolution data when analysing and predicting flow variation and climate change effects in order to preserve and restore functionally diverse communities. Moreover, to develop environmental flow schemes or restoration and climate change adaptation strategies for freshwater communities, local and regional processes need to be addressed simultaneously; equally responsible as drivers of community diversity.

In particular, economic evaluation of public health adaptation strategies has been largely absent from both the scientific literature and public policy discussion. OBJECTIVES: We examined how public health organizations should implement adaptation strategies and, second, how to improve the evidence base required to make an economic case for policies that will protect the public's health from heat events and climate change. DISCUSSION: Public health adaptation strategies to cope with heat events and climate change fall into two categories: reducing the heat exposure and managing the health risks. Strategies require a range of actions, including timely public health and medical advice, improvements to housing and urban planning, early warning systems, and assurance that health care and social systems are ready to act. Some of these actions are costly, and given scarce financial resources the implementation should be based on the cost-effectiveness analysis. Therefore, research is required not only on the temperature-related health costs, but also on the costs and benefits of adaptation options. The scientific community must ensure that the health co-benefits of climate change policies are recognized, understood, and quantified. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of climate change adaptation into current public health practice is needed to ensure the adaptation strategies increase future resilience. The economic evaluation of temperature-related health costs and public health adaptation strategies are particularly important for policy decisions.","[Huang, Cunrui; Barnett, Adrian G.; Xu, Zhiwei; Turner, Lyle R.; Tong, Shilu] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Publ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia; [Huang, Cunrui; Barnett, Adrian G.; Xu, Zhiwei; Turner, Lyle R.; Tong, Shilu] Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia; [Huang, Cunrui; Chu, Cordia] Griffith Univ, Ctr Environm & Populat Hlth, Sch Environm, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Huang, Cunrui; Chu, Cordia] Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Wang, Xiaoming] CSIRO Climate Adaptat Flagship, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Wang, Xiaoming] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Queensland; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Griffith University; Griffith University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Huang, CR (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Publ Hlth, Victoria Pk Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia.",huangcunrui@hotmail.com,"Huang, Cunrui/ABI-3312-2020; Wang, Xiaoming/A-3804-2008; Barnett, Adrian/I-9850-2012; Turner, Lyle R/I-9929-2012; Wang, Xiaoming/A-3804-2008","Wang, Xiaoming/0000-0002-6648-0057; Barnett, Adrian/0000-0001-6339-0374; Turner, Lyle R/0000-0002-9696-9232; Wang, Xiaoming/0000-0002-1088-8862; Chu, Cordia/0000-0002-3683-5638; Xu, Zhiwei/0000-0001-7903-2141",,,,,42,73,78,4,73,US DEPT HEALTH HUMAN SCIENCES PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCE,RES TRIANGLE PK,"NATL INST HEALTH, NATL INST ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES, PO BOX 12233, RES TRIANGLE PK, NC 27709-2233 USA",0091-6765,1552-9924,,ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP,Environ.

On the basis of the concept of exposure-sensitivity-adaptive capacity, 21 proxy variables are selected and screened, and their weights are determined for their objectivity by using the Delphi technique. The data from 16 provinces of South Korea and the weighting values of all proxy variables are fuzzified to consider uncertainty. In addition, the National Center for Atmosphere Research Community Climate System Model 3 (CCSM3) in conjunction with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emission Scenario (SRES) A1B, A2, B1, A1T, A1 FI, and B2 are used for future climate data (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s). Therefore, 19 flood risk vulnerabilities of South Korea, including present conditions, are quantitatively evaluated and compared. Three Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques - Weighted Sum Method (WSM), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Situation (TOPSIS), and fuzzy TOPSIS - are used to quantify all spatial vulnerabilities. As a result, some fuzzy TOPSIS rankings are quite different to those of WSM and TOPSIS, and the ranking patterns of the 19 climate change scenarios are also derived in a dissimilar way. In addition, if the variances of the provinces' rankings are considered, some provinces showing low values can plan their climate change adaptation strategies by taking into consideration their relatively certain rankings. In the end, the vulnerability assessment for climate change should consider not only various MCDM techniques but also the uncertainty of weighting values and proxy variable data.

At-risk individuals can take climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction behaviors to mitigate and prepare for disaster risks, reduce costs from damage, and save their lives. However, previous fragmented studies have not provided an integrated model to directly compare the factors and identify factors that are most influential in at-risk community members' behaviors. I present the Integrated Model of Risk Communication by consolidating major theories. This study uses structural equation modeling of quantitative surveys to simultaneously test the impacts of 15 factors on 15 adaptation behaviors for the two most common federally declared disasters (wildfires and hurricanes with floods) in three disaster-prone U.S. states (California, Florida, and Texas) (N = 3,468). Specifically, this study examines 15 behaviors including preparedness, nonstructural mitigation, structural mitigation, insurance purchase, and adaptation policy support. Social norms perceptions, self-efficacy, response efficacy, and resource constraints strongly affect behaviors. Response efficacy strongly affects policy support. Risk perception, knowledge, and climate change perception-commonly argued to be key drivers-are insignificant or weak. The models explain 55%-86% of the variance in adaptation behaviors. Results suggest that the focus of adaptation efforts may need to shift from risk perception and climate change perception to efficacy and social norms.","[Lim, JungKyu Rhys] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Lim, JungKyu Rhys] World Bank, Washington, DC 20006 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; The World Bank,"Lim, JR (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.;Lim, JR (corresponding author), World Bank, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",jk.rhys.lim@gmail.com,"Lim, Jungkyu Rhys/AAI-3972-2020","Lim, Jungkyu Rhys/0000-0002-5006-2491",University of Maryland (UMD) Ann G.

Small-scale local associations have a potential to facilitate collective experimentation and risk management, contributing to the resilience and sustainability of the social-ecological system. Ethnographic focus is on the informal associations of economic cooperation and dispute mediation of Kuria people of northwest Tanzania, and the ways these institutional forms facilitate resource management and the negotiation of difference under income diversification. Organizational features of the groups are examined that facilitate social innovation and alternative patterns of communication, effecting flexible and relational connections between scales.

The entire population was stratified into 27 Pertubuhan Peladang Kawasan out of which 500 targeted respondents were randomly selected from seven strata for data collection. The findings revealed that only 67% of farmers are aware of adaptation practices, while 33% are uninformed. The study also revealed that economic, social, natural, technological, and institutional barriers affect farmers' adaptive capacity levels and ultimately hamper their adaptation practices. This result further affirms the influence of farmers' adaptive capacity level on their adaptation behaviour. Adaptation strategies are essential to mitigate the negative effects of climate change. However, the success of these strategies is contingent upon the farmers' adaptive capacity level, which is strained by several barriers. The findings contribute to the development of a national adaptation plan in a bid to aid the implementation of the 2011-2020 National Agri-Food Policy (NAP) to increase the competitiveness and production capacity of the entire agri-food industry value chain and ensure food security in Malaysia.

This paper examines the ways in which Inuit fishers experience and respond to such change, using a case study from Pangnirtung, Canada. The work is based on over two years of fieldwork, during which semi-structured interviews (n = 62), focus group discussions (n = 6, 31 participants) and key informant interviews (n = 25) were conducted. The changes that most Inuit fishers experience are: changes in sea-ice conditions, Inuit people themselves, the landscape and the seascape, fish-related changes, and changes in weather conditions, markets and fish selling prices. Inuit fishers respond to change individually as well as collectively. Fishers' responses were examined using the characteristics of a resilience-based conceptual framework focusing on place, human agency, collective action and collaboration, institutions, indigenous and local knowledge systems, and learning. Based on results, this paper identified three community-level adaptive strategies, which are diversification, technology use and fisheries governance that employs a co-management approach. Further, this work recognised four place-specific attributes that can shape community adaptations, which are Inuit worldviews, Inuit-owned institutions, a culture of sharing and collaborating, and indigenous and local knowledge systems. An examination of the ways in which Inuit fishers experience and respond to change is essential to better understand adaptations to climate change.

At the highest levels of governance, European Union and Member State adaptation policies and strategies are now well established, but meaningful adaptation interventions illustrating tangible gains in resilience remain scarce. A clear framework for generic adaptation processes, along with barriers to their smooth progress, have now been identified in the literature, and equally generic scenario analysis tools have been put forward to strengthen adaptation delivery by assisting coastal managers to overcome them. Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) is a relatively novel option in this respect, having yet to achieve the kind of widespread uptake and trial that more orthodox futures approaches such as intuitive logic scenarios have. FCM is however growing rapidly in its range of uses and breadth of uptake, and its utility in overcoming the barriers to adaptation among coastal managers is therefore worthy of analysis. This case study, in which FCM was employed in place of intuitive logic scenario analysis within an adaptation strategy development process, found FCM to carry a number of key strengths that intuitive logic scenario analysis has been found to lack. Through enabling a more detailed and granular level of participatory development of the 'engine' of the futures process than possible under an intuitive logic approach, the level of buy-in and commitment to the adaptation strategy development process achieved among coastal managers and stakeholders was significantly greater.","[Gray, S.

Within this framework, we propose a methodology that combines high space-time resolution climate information (reanalysis databases and projections), local data on exposure that accounts for the most relevant sectors, site-specific vulnerability functions, and flood risk consequence valuation, gridded at 5 m. This approach involves efficient multiple-forcing flood modeling, in which the connection between climate change and potential inundation is primarily established through the definition of a total water level index. This research tackles challenging issues, including the importance of incorporating the effects of existing coastal defenses and local wave effects in port areas, dealing with data at different spatial scales and sectors in an integrated way, and the impact of discounting. The results provide insights into the possible consequences of inaction for a range of future scenarios based on changes in climate and socio-economics over the most relevant sectors. With the goal of prioritizing adaptive action and the efficient assignment of funds, we propose a weight-based integration of the sectoral value-at-risk through the application of Bayesian techniques and expert judgment.

Water is already scarce in many regions of the world and could present a critical constraint as society attempts simultaneously to mitigate climate forcing and adapt to climate change, and to provide for a larger and more prosperous human population. Numerous studies have pointed to growing pressures on the world's scarce fresh water resources from population and economic growth, and climate change. This study goes further. We use the Global Change Assessment Model to analyze interactions between population, economic growth, energy, land, and water resources simultaneously in a dynamically evolving system where competing claims on water resources from all claimants-energy, land, and economy-are reconciled with water resource availability-from renewable water, non-renewable groundwater and desalinated water sources-across 14 geopolitical regions, 151 agriculture-ecological zones, and 235 major river basins. We find that previous estimates of global water withdrawal projections are overestimated. Model simulations show that it is more economical in some basins to alter agricultural and energy activities rather than utilize non-renewable groundwater or desalinated water. This study highlights the importance of accounting for water as a binding factor in agriculture, energy and land use decisions in integrated assessment models and implications for global responses to water scarcity, particularly in the trade of agricultural commodities and land-use decisions.","[Kim, Son H.; Hejazi, Mohamad; Liu, Lu; Calvin, Katherine; Clarke, Leon; Edmonds, Jae; Kyle, Page; Patel, Pralit; Wise, Marshall] Joint Global Res Inst, Pacific NW Natl Lab, 5825 Univ Res Court,Suite 3500, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Davies, Evan] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; University of Alberta,"Kim, SH (corresponding author), Joint Global Res Inst, Pacific NW Natl Lab, 5825 Univ Res Court,Suite 3500, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",skim@pnnl.gov,"Davies, Evan/GWU-9310-2022; Kim, Son H./AAA-2728-2020; Kyle, Page/AFP-3602-2022; Davies, Evan/A-3379-2008; Liu, Lu/J-4551-2015","Davies, Evan/0000-0003-0536-333X; Liu, Lu/0000-0002-4939-5432; Kyle, Page/0000-0002-1257-8358",Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy through the Integrated Assessment Research Program; DOE [DE-AC05-76RL01830],Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy through the Integrated Assessment Research Program; DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),This research was supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy through the Integrated Assessment Research Program.

Many authors and policy practitioners consider therefore that decisions over policy, mitigation strategies and capacity for adaptation to climate change require construction and coordination over multiple levels of governance to arrive at acceptable local, regional and global management strategies. However, how such processes of coordination and decision-aiding can occur and be maintained and improved over time is a major challenge in need of investigation. We take on this challenge by proposing research-supported methods of aiding multi-level decision-making processes in this context. Four example regionally focussed multi-level case studies from diverse socio-political contexts are outlined-estuarine management in Australia's Lower Hawkesbury, flood and drought management in Bulgaria's Upper Iskar Basin, climate policy integration in Spain's Comunidad Valenciana and food security in Bangladesh's Faridpur District-from which insights are drawn. Our discussion focuses on exploring these insights including: (1) the possible advantages of informal research-supported processes and specifically those that provide individual arenas of participation for different levels of stakeholders; (2) the complexity of organisation processes required for aiding multi-level decision-making processes; and (3) to what extent progress towards integrated regional policies for climate change aware sustainable development can be achieved through research-supported processes.

This study particularly examines this question and explores how and to what extent livelihood diversification in the face of climate change can support long-term non-migration for people living in the southwest coastal region of Bangladesh. We employed a cluster random sampling method to select the respondents and interviewed a total of 183 households by using a structured questionnaire. Analysis indicates that the tendency of livelihood diversification based on shrimp-farming has been intensified in recent years as the land use pattern also changed due to the frequent occurrence of environmental hazards. The Poisson regression model states that belonging to a religious minority and shrimp farming determines the extent of livelihood diversification, i.e., if the person belongs to a minority religion and possesses a shrimp-farm they will have more diversified sources of income compared to others living in the society. Moreover, therefore, one in every three households in these studied communities' practices seasonal migration as an alternative livelihood strategy so that their family can stay put. The outcome of this study motivates the government and non-government organizations to take policies and programs in a direction that may reduce the dependency on seasonal migration and introduce locally adoptable diversified employment opportunities.","[Biswas, Bangkim] Khulna Univ, Econ Discipline, Khulna 8208, Bangladesh; [Mallick, Bishawjit] Tech Univ Dresden TUD, Chair Environm Dev & Risk Management, Dresden, Germany; [Mallick, Bishawjit] Univ Colorado, CU Populat Ctr Inst Behav Sci, Boulder Campus, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Khulna University; Technische Universitat Dresden; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Mallick, B (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden TUD, Chair Environm Dev & Risk Management, Dresden, Germany.;Mallick, B (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, CU Populat Ctr Inst Behav Sci, Boulder Campus, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",bangkimbiswas@gmail.com; Bishawjit.Mallick@tu-dresden.de,"Mallick, Bishawjit/V-2236-2018","Mallick, Bishawjit/0000-0002-9492-1059; Biswas, Bangkim/0000-0002-0008-2646",,,,,80,8,9,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

The mixed methods research design was used as the strategy of inquiry, and both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods were employed. Results show that the climate is changing, as indicated by significant trends in annual average temperatures (P = 0.000; alpha = 0.05). Rainfall patterns show high inter-annual variability and a declining trend, although this is not statistically significant. Results further indicate that the changing climate has imposed considerable costs on wildlife, the environment and the national budget. Extreme weather events such as droughts, floods and extreme heat in the Kruger National Park have led to the loss of flora and fauna and infrastructure that supports tourism and has disrupted tourists' activities. The study concludes that there is evidence of climate change and given this, appropriate climate change adaptations and mitigation interventions should be made to ensure the sustainable utilisation of the Kruger National Park in line with the dictates of Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goal 13 on climate change action. The study further recommends a revision of land use planning, retrofitting and redesigning of some of the national park facilities and infrastructure to ensure climate resilience and sustainable tourism. Continued investment into research and innovation in national parks is also recommended to foster the protection of natural heritage.","[Dube, K.] Vaal Univ Technol, Dept Ecotourism Management, Andries Potgieter Blvd, ZA-1911 Vanderbijlpark, South Africa; [Nhamo, G.] Univ South Africa, Inst Corp Citizenship, Preller St, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",Vaal University of Technology (VUT); University of South Africa,"Dube, K (corresponding author), Vaal Univ Technol, Dept Ecotourism Management, Andries Potgieter Blvd, ZA-1911 Vanderbijlpark, South Africa.",kaitanod@vut.ac.za; nhamog@unisa.ac.za,"Dube, Kaitano/K-5533-2019; Dube, Kaitano/I-7261-2016; Nhamo, Godwell/N-5165-2015","Dube, Kaitano/0000-0002-7482-3945; Nhamo, Godwell/0000-0001-5465-2168",EXXARO Chair in Business and Climate Change at the University of South Africa,EXXARO Chair in Business and Climate Change at the University of South Africa,"The authors would like to thank the South African Weather Service (SAWS), for the provision of climate data, the EXXARO Chair in Business and Climate Change at the University of South Africa for financing field studies and Dr David Chikodzi for the Kruger National Park map.",,56,33,33,5,35,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2211-4645,2211-4653,,ENVIRON DEV,Environ.

Globally, $2.5tn a year is spent on infrastructure which is typically designed to last decades, over which period projected changes in the climate will modify infrastructure performance. A systems approach has been developed to assess risks across all infrastructure sectors to guide national policy making and adaptation investment. The method analyses diverse evidence of climate risks and adaptation actions, to assess the urgency and extent of adaptation required. Application to the UK shows that despite recent adaptation efforts, risks to infrastructure outweigh opportunities. Flooding is the greatest risk to all infrastructure sectors: even if the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 2 degrees C is achieved, the number of users reliant on electricity infrastructure at risk of flooding would double, while a 4 degrees C rise could triple UK flood damage. Other risks are significant, for example 5% and 20% of river catchments would be unable to meet water demand with 2 degrees C and 4 degrees C global warming respectively. Increased interdependence between infrastructure systems, especially from energy and information and communication technology (ICT), are amplifying risks, but adaptation action is limited by lack of clear responsibilities. A programme to build national capability is urgently required to improve infrastructure risk assessment.

To answer this question, the paper reviews field data on perceptions of environmental and climatic change in a Peruvian mountain community and discusses the possibilities and limitations of using local climate voices to prepare for climate change adaptation. The data comprise two complementary household surveys. The first survey provides information on the community's socio-economic situation, whilst the second survey documents the villagers' climate perception. The data reveal a paradox in the way the community understands global climate change. The villagers who live on the margin of the global world and belong to the poorest economic strata in Peru are deeply concerned about global climate change that is impacting their environment. Yet when locating the cause of climate change they point to their own community rather the industrialized world and suggest mitigation actions rather than adaptation initiatives as answer to the problems it entails. The paper suggests that adaptation initiatives must understand this paradox within the larger socio-economic and discursive context that shapes the villagers' agency and climate perceptions. It proposes an informed participation approach that listens to the local voices but that also informs them about the global dimensions of climate change and engages them in a critical dialogue about the importance of sustainable development and the possibilities of taking advantage of the new opportunities that the changing environment offers.","[Paerregaard, Karsten] Gothenburg Univ, Sch Global Studies, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Paerregaard, K (corresponding author), Gothenburg Univ, Sch Global Studies, Gothenburg, Sweden.",karsten.paerregaard@globalstudies.gu.se,,,,,,,46,14,14,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Results from a survey of 1059 low income persons in agriculture and tourism in Belize, Grenada, Jamaica and St. Lucia point to a need for a new balance to reduce risk, transfer risk, and effectively prepare for climatic stressors. This corroborates the findings from the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaption (SREX). This article seeks to bolster limited evidence to understand the consequences of these measures, and assess whether financial risk management tools could complement current asset-depleting approaches: The results reveal that the dominant responses to managing extreme weather events included: using savings (36 %), borrowing (12 %) and government assistance (9 %). However, one-tenth of the sample is at risk from 'doing nothing', which can contribute to loss of productive capacity and income sources, loss of access to finance, depletion of assets, health problems and social isolation. Study respondents indicated a need for alternative financial risk management approaches. The results also indicate a moderate explicit demand for weather-related microinsurance. Overall the results reveal that where vulnerability and exposure to extreme weather events are high, and capacity is low, a rethinking of risk management measures is needed to reduce loss and damage for low-income people.","[Lashley, Jonathan G.] Univ W Indies, Sir Arthur Lewis Inst Social & Econ Studies, West Indies, Barbados; [Warner, Koko] United Nations Univ, Environm Migrat Social Resilience & Adaptat, Inst Environm & Human Secur, UNU EHS,Munich Climate Insurance Initiat & Sect, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",,"Warner, K (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Environm Migrat Social Resilience & Adaptat, Inst Environm & Human Secur, UNU EHS,Munich Climate Insurance Initiat & Sect, UN Campus,Hermann Ehlerstr 10, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",jlashley@caribsurf.com; warner@ehs.unu.edu,,"Lashley, Jonathan/0000-0002-7993-1793",German Development Corporation (GIZ),German Development Corporation (GIZ),The data presented in this paper was generated by the Microenterprise demand for weather-related insurance and risk management approaches in the Caribbean project undertaken on behalf of the Munich Climate Insurance Initiative (MCII) with funding from the German Development Corporation (GIZ).

This paper investigates the performances of existing state-of-the-art rule induction and tree algorithms, namely, single conjunctive rule learner, decision table, M5P model tree, decision stump, and REPTree. Downscaling models are developed to obtain projections of mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures (Tmax and Tmin) as well as pan evaporation to lake-basin scale in an arid region in India using these algorithms. The predictor variables, such as air temperature, zonal wind, meridional wind, and geo-potential height, are extracted from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data set for the period 1948-2000 and from the simulations using third-generation Canadian coupled global climate models for emission scenarios for the period 2001-2100. A simple multiplicative shift was used for correcting predictand values. The performances of various models have been evaluated on several statistical performance parameters such as correlation coefficient, mean absolute error, and root mean square error. The M5P model tree algorithm was found to yield better performance among all other learning techniques explored in the present study. An increasing trend is observed for Tmax and Tmin for emission scenarios, whereas no trend has been observed for pan evaporation in the future.","[Goyal, Manish Kumar; Ojha, C. S.

These are increasing food security, building the resilience of agricultural systems for adaptation to climate change and mitigation of GHG. As much research focuses on one of these three objectives, our understanding of how agricultural systems address these three challenges simultaneously is limited by the lack of a comprehensive evaluation tool. In order to fill this gap, we have developed a generic evaluation framework that comprises 19 indicators that we measured in a sample of 12 representative farms of the North Basse-Terre region in Guadeloupe. The evaluation revealed clear differences in the performance of these farming systems. For example, nutritional performance varied from 0 to 13 people fed per hectare, the average potential impact of climatic conditions varied from 27% to 33% and the GHG emissions balance varied from +0.8 tCO(2eq)center dot ha(-1) to +3.6 tCO(2eq)center dot ha(-1). The results obtained can guide the design of innovative production systems that better meet the objectives of climate-smart agriculture for the study region. The evaluation framework is intended as a generic tool for a common evaluation basis across regions at a larger scale. Future prospects are its application and validation in different contexts.","[Selbonne, Stan; Guinde, Loic; Causeret, Francois; Sierra, Jorge; Tournebize, Regis; Blazy, Jean-Marc] Inst Natl Rech Agr Alimentat & Environm INRAE, Res Unit ASTRO, F-97170 Petit Bourg, Guadeloupe, France; [Chopin, Pierre] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, POB 7043,Ulls vag 16, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",INRAE; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Selbonne, S (corresponding author), Inst Natl Rech Agr Alimentat & Environm INRAE, Res Unit ASTRO, F-97170 Petit Bourg, Guadeloupe, France.",shimrith.selbonne@inrae.fr,,,,,,,92,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,FEB,2023,13,2,,,,,,,297,10.3390/agriculture13020297,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13020297,,,21,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,9G1CQ,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000937898600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To date, few studies have addressed the issue of heat adaptation, and little is known about the long-term effects of exposure to heat. One indicator that allows the ascertainment of a population's level of adaptation to heat is the minimum mortality temperature (MMT), which links temperature and daily mortality. The aim of this study was to ascertain, firstly, adaptation to heat among persons aged >= 65 years across the period 1983 to 2018 through analysis of the MMT; and secondly, the trend in such adaptation to heat over time with respect to the total population. A retrospective longitudinal ecological time series study was conducted, using data on daily mortality and maximum daily temperature across the study period. Over time, the MMT was highest among elderly people, with a value of 28.6 degrees C (95%CI 28.3-28.9) versus 28.2 degrees C (95%CI 27.83-28.51) for the total population, though this difference was not statistically significant. A total of 62% of Spanish provinces included populations of elderly people that had adapted to heat during the study period. In general, elderly persons' level of adaptation registered an average value of 0.11 (degrees C/decade).","[Navas-Martin, Miguel angel; Lopez-Bueno, Jose Antonio; Ascaso-Sanchez, Maria Soledad; Linares, Cristina; Diaz, Julio] Carlos III Inst Hlth, Natl Sch Publ Hlth, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Navas-Martin, Miguel angel] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Doctorate Program Biomed Sci & Publ Hlth, Madrid 28015, Spain; [Follos, Fernando; Vellon, Jose Manuel] Tdot Soluc Sostenibles SL, Ferrol 15401, A Coruna, Spain; [Miron, Isidro Juan] Reg Hlth Author Castile La Mancha, Torrijos 45500, Spain; [Luna, Maria Yolanda] State Meteorol Agcy, Madrid 28071, Spain; [Sanchez-Martinez, Gerardo] UNEP DTU Partnership, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark",Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED); Agencia Estatal de Meteorologia (AEMET); Technical University of Denmark,"Navas-Martin, MA (corresponding author), Carlos III Inst Hlth, Natl Sch Publ Hlth, Madrid 28029, Spain.;Navas-Martin, MA (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Doctorate Program Biomed Sci & Publ Hlth, Madrid 28015, Spain.",manavas@isciii.es,"; Luna, M.

Relevant meteorological drought-related articles were systematically sourced from credible bibliographic databases covering African subregions in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries (i.e. from 1950 to 2021), using suitable keywords. Past studies show evidence of the occurrence of extreme drought events across the continent. The underlying mechanisms are mostly attributed to complex interactions of dynamical and thermodynamical mechanisms. The resultant impact is evidenced in the decline of agricultural activities and water resources and the environmental degradation across all subregions. Projected changes show recovery from drought events in the west/east African domain, while the south and north regions indicate a tendency for increasing drought characteristics. The apparent intricate link between the continent's development and climate variability, including the reoccurrence of drought events, calls for paradigm shifts in policy direction. Key resources meant for the infrastructural and technological growth of the economy are being diverted to develop coping mechanisms to adapt to climate change effects, which are changing. Efficient service delivery to drought-prone hotspots, strengthening of drought monitoring, forecasting, early warning, and response systems, and improved research on the combined effects of anthropogenic activities and changes in climate systems are valuable to practitioners, researchers, and policymakers regarding drought management in Africa today and in the future.","[Ayugi, Brian] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Atmospher Environm & Equip, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Jiangsu Key Lab Atmospher Environm Monitoring & P, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Ayugi, Brian] Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ KLME,Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Ayugi, Brian; Eresanya, Emmanuel Olaoluwa] Org African Acad Doctors OAAD, Off Kamiti Rd,POB 25305-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Eresanya, Emmanuel Olaoluwa] Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Marine Sci & Technol, PMB 704, Akure, Nigeria; [Eresanya, Emmanuel Olaoluwa] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, Lab Trop Oceanog, 164 Xingangdong Rd, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Onyango, Augustine Omondi; Dike, Victor Nnamdi] Chinese Acad Sci, Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci ICCES, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci,Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ogou, Faustin Katchele] Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Phys, Lab Atmospher Phys, Godomey, Benin; [Okoro, Eucharia Chidinma; Anoruo, Chukwuma Moses] Univ Nigeria, Dept Phys & Astron, Nsukka, Nigeria; [Okoro, Eucharia Chidinma] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Key Lab Solar Act, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Okoye, Charles Obinwanne] Univ Nigeria, Fac Biol Sci, Dept Zool & Environm Biol, Nsukka, Nigeria; [Okoye, Charles Obinwanne] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Environm & Safety Engn, Biofuel Inst, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Dike, Victor Nnamdi] Imo State Polytech Umuagwo, Energy Climate & Environm Sci Grp, Imo, PMB 1472, Owerri, Nigeria; [Ashiru, Olusola Raheemat] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Deep Sea Sci & Engn, Key Lab Geophys & Georesources, Sanya, Peoples R China; [Daramola, Mojolaoluwa Toluwalase] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, 11A Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Mumo, Richard] Botswana Int Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math & Stat Sci, Plot 10071,Private Bag 16, Palapye, Botswana; [Ongoma, Victor] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ, Int Water Res Inst, Lot 660,Hay Moulay Rachid, Ben Guerir 43150, Morocco","Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Abomey Calavi; University of Nigeria; Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Astronomical Observatory, CAS; University of Nigeria; Jiangsu University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Deep-Sea Science & Engineering, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Mohammed VI Polytechnic University","Eresanya, EO (corresponding author), Org African Acad Doctors OAAD, Off Kamiti Rd,POB 25305-00100, Nairobi, Kenya.;Eresanya, EO (corresponding author), Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Marine Sci & Technol, PMB 704, Akure, Nigeria.;Eresanya, EO (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, Lab Trop Oceanog, 164 Xingangdong Rd, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.;Okoro, EC (corresponding author), Univ Nigeria, Dept Phys & Astron, Nsukka, Nigeria.;Okoro, EC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Key Lab Solar Act, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China.",eresanyaemmanuel44@gmail.com; eucharia.okoro@unn.edu.ng,"Okoye, Charles Obinwanne/AAZ-4484-2021; Dike, Victor Nnamdi/J-7734-2018; Ayugi, Brian Odhiambo/C-3372-2017; Eresanya, Emmanuel Olaoluwa/HLQ-5416-2023","Okoye, Charles Obinwanne/0000-0002-6205-4886; Dike, Victor Nnamdi/0000-0003-2268-5859; Ayugi, Brian Odhiambo/0000-0003-3660-7755; Eresanya, Emmanuel Olaoluwa/0000-0002-5942-0849; MUMO, Richard/0000-0003-2309-2609; Augustine Omondi, Onyango/0000-0001-8662-3177; Ashiru, Olusola/0000-0002-7316-6939",Organization of African Academic Doctors (OAAD); Postdoctoral Research Foundation of Jiangsu Province [2191012100301],Organization of African Academic Doctors (OAAD); Postdoctoral Research Foundation of Jiangsu Province,This work was supported by the Organization of African Academic Doctors (OAAD) and a grant from the Postdoctoral Research Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Grant no. 2191012100301).,,180,14,14,14,22,SPRINGER BASEL AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",0033-4553,1420-9136,,PURE APPL GEOPHYS,Pure Appl.

Using selected ecosystems in the Lake region, the paper identifies key EbA approaches and explores trade-offs and synergies at spatial and temporal scales and between different stakeholders. The research methods used for this study include site visits, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, participatory workshops and literature reviews. An analytical framework is applied to advance the understanding of EbA approaches and how they lead to synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services provision at spatial and temporal scales and multiple stakeholders. Our results show that EbA approaches such as ecosystem restoration have the potential to generate multiple adaptation benefits as well as synergies and trade-offs occurring at different temporal and spatial scales and affecting various stakeholder groups.

The study relied on primary survey data drawn from around 115 firms working in rented office spaces in Bengaluru, who were asked to choose between status quo and different levels of green certification. The Tobit model was used for estimation, and the results show that firms value private benefits like reduction in electricity and water bills, water and waste recycling significantly. The willingness to pay of firms is negatively related to rent of the office space and positively related to annual turnover of the firm and prior knowledge on the green building certification.","[Abraham, Pleasa Serin; Gundimeda, Haripriya] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Abraham, PS (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.",pleasaserinlife@gmail.com; haripriya.gundimeda@iitb.ac.in,,"ABRAHAM, PLEASA/0000-0001-5162-8306",,,,,40,3,3,6,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Here we evaluate the relative effect of climate (as indicated by the Ecological Niche Model-ENM) and agricultural technology on actual soybean productivity in Brazilian municipalities and estimate the future geographic distribution of soybeans using a novel statistical approach allowing the evaluation of partial coefficients in a non-stationary (Geographically Weighted Regression; GWR) model. We found that technology was more important than climate in explaining soybean productivity in Brazil. However, some municipalities are more dependent on environmental suitability (mainly in Southern Brazil). The future environmental suitability for soybean cultivation tends to decrease by up 50% in the central region of Brazil. Meanwhile, southern-most Brazil will have more favourable conditions, with an increase of ca. 25% in environmental suitability. Considering that opening new areas for cultivation can degrade environmental quality, we suggest that, in the face of climate change impacts on soybean cultivation, the Brazilian government and producers must invest in breeding programmes and more general ecosystem-based strategies for adaptation to climate change, including the development of varieties tolerant to climate stress, and strategies to increase productivity and reduce costs (social and environmental).","[Caetano, Jordana Moura; Tessarolo, Geiziane; Nabout, Joao Carlos] Univ Estadual Goias, CCET, Anapolis, Go, Brazil; [de Oliveira, Guilherme] Univ Fed Reconcavo Bahia, Setor Biol, Ctr Ciencias Agr Ambientais & Biol, Cruz das Almas, BA, Brazil; [da Silva e Souza, Kelly; Felizola Diniz-Filho, Jose Alexandre] Univ Fed Goias, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Campus Samambaia, Goiania, Go, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Goias; Universidade Federal do Reconcavo da Bahia; Universidade Federal de Goias,"Nabout, JC (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Goias, CCET, Anapolis, Go, Brazil.",joao.nabout@ueg.br,"de Oliveira, Guilherme/S-1531-2019; Nabout, João/I-2828-2014; Diniz-Filho, José Alexandre Felizola/D-9405-2013","Nabout, João/0000-0001-9102-3627; Diniz-Filho, José Alexandre Felizola/0000-0002-0967-9684; Souza, Kelly/0000-0002-5672-4556; Tessarolo, Geiziane/0000-0003-1361-0062; Moura Caetano, Jordana/0000-0001-5777-2974","CAPES [Auxpe 2036/2013]; CNPq; National Institutes for Science and Technology (INCT) in Ecology, Evolution and Biodiversity Conservation; MCTIC/CNPq; FAPEG [465610/2014-5]; PNPD/CAPES-Postdoctoral fellowship; CAPES; GENPAC ('Geographical Genetics and Regional Planning for Natural Resources in the Brazilian Cerrado') from CNPq/MCT/CAPES/FAPEG","CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); National Institutes for Science and Technology (INCT) in Ecology, Evolution and Biodiversity Conservation; MCTIC/CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPEG(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Goias (FAPEG)); PNPD/CAPES-Postdoctoral fellowship; CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); GENPAC ('Geographical Genetics and Regional Planning for Natural Resources in the Brazilian Cerrado') from CNPq/MCT/CAPES/FAPEG","This work was supported by CAPES (grant no.

Disruptions to supply, transportation and storage of energy have global ramifications and potential contamination of the natural environment. On a European scale, there is limited information about energy facilities and their strategic plans for adapting to climate change. Using a Geographical Information System this paper assesses coastal energy infrastructure, comprising (1) oil/gas/LNG/tanker terminals and (2) nuclear power stations. It discusses planning and adaptation for sea-level rise and extreme events. Results indicate 158 major oil/gas/LNG/tanker terminals in the European coastal zone, with 40 % located on the North Sea coast. There are 71 operating nuclear reactors on the coast (37 % of the total of European coastal countries), with further locations planned in the Black, Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. The UK has three times more coastal energy facilities than any other country. Many north-west European countries who have a high reliance on coastal energy infrastructure have a high awareness of sea-level rise and plan for future change. With long design lives of energy facilities, anticipating short, medium and long-term environmental and climatic change is crucial in the design, future monitoring and maintenance of facilities. Adaptation of coastal infrastructure is of international importance, so will be an ongoing important issue throughout the 21(st) century.","[Brown, Sally; Hanson, Susan; Nicholls, Robert J.] Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Brown, Sally; Hanson, Susan; Nicholls, Robert J.] Univ Southampton, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Southampton; University of Southampton,"Brown, S (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Environm, Univ Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",sb20@soton.ac.uk,"Brown, Sally/I-2662-2014; Brown, Sally/AAD-6943-2020; Nicholls, Robert James/G-3898-2010; Nicholls, Robert James/ABD-1481-2020","Brown, Sally/0000-0003-1185-1962; Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109; Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109; Hanson, Susan/0000-0002-2198-1595",European Commission [212774]; EU [GOCE-036961],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); EU(European Commission),"SB and RJN were partly supported from funding provided by the European Commission (DG Research) 7th Framework Programme as part of the ClimateCost Project (Full Costs of Climate Change, grant agreement 212774) www.climatecost.eu.

The approach recognizes two main components in the stand, i.e. a fiber production component, which provides veneer/sawlog quality products from the high-quality trees (HQT), and an ecological component, which contributes to the overall ecosystem functioning through the lower value stems. The objective of the study was to verify if it is possible to sustainably harvest only HQT in northern hardwood (NH) and thereby produce a viable alternative to high-grading the stands. To do so, a simple stand growth simulator, based on empirical growth rates of HQT in Sugar Maple/Yellow Birch stands in southwestern Quebec, was combined with an optimization tool. The optimization parameters aimed to identify possible tree marking regimes (TMRs) under 10-year rotation partial cutting, which would ensure that the basal area of HQT was maintained for 40 years. Results suggest that sustainability is achievable starting from very different initial stand structures and the application of a wide range of alternative TMRs. We argue that this new approach is one way to apply emerging concepts in forest management, such as ecological integrity, attempts to emulate natural disturbance regimes and provides new possibilities managing for resilience and for adaptation to climate change.","[Nolet, Philippe; Doyon, Frederik; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee ISFORT, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada; [Doyon, Frederik; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Dept Nat Sci, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada; [Doyon, Frederik; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, Ctr Etud Foret, Montreal, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada",University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais; University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Nolet, P (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee ISFORT, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada.",philippe.nolet@uqo.ca,,,"Ministere du Developpement economique, de l'Innovation et de l'Exportation du Quebec (MDEIE)","Ministere du Developpement economique, de l'Innovation et de l'Exportation du Quebec (MDEIE)","This work was supported by the Ministere du Developpement economique, de l'Innovation et de l'Exportation du Quebec (MDEIE).",,59,15,16,1,52,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0015-752X,1464-3626,,FORESTRY,Forestry,JAN,2014,87,1,,,SI,,39,48,,10.1093/forestry/cpt044,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/forestry/cpt044,,,10,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,300CR,,Bronze,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000330442500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

World population is projected to reach 9.1 billion by 2050, with most of this growth in developing countries. While the principal cause of climate change is high consumption in the developed countries, its impact will be greatest on people in the developing world. Climate change and population can be linked through adaptation (reducing vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change) and, more controversially, through mitigation (reducing the greenhouse gases that cause climate change). The contribution of low-income, high-fertility countries to global carbon emissions has been negligible to date, but is increasing with the economic development that they need to reduce poverty. Rapid population growth endangers human development, provision of basic services and poverty eradication and weakens the capacity of poor communities to adapt to climate change. Significant mass migration is likely to occur in response to climate change and should be regarded as a legitimate response to the effects of climate change. Linking population dynamics with climate change is a sensitive issue, but family planning programmes that respect and protect human rights can bring a remarkable range of benefits. Population dynamics have not been integrated systematically into climate change science. The contribution of population growth, migration, urbanization, ageing and household composition to mitigation and adaptation programmes needs urgent investigation.","[Stephenson, Judith] UCL, Inst Womens Hlth, Res Dept Reprod Hlth, London W1C1E 6BT, England; [Newman, Karen] Margaret Pyke Trust, Populat & Sustainabil Network, London W1T 4PL, England; [Mayhew, Susannah] Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Ctr Populat Studies, London WC1E 7HT, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Stephenson, J (corresponding author), UCL, Inst Womens Hlth, Res Dept Reprod Hlth, London W1C1E 6BT, England.",judith.stephenson@ucl.ac.uk,", Susannah/HJP-3632-2023","Mayhew, Susannah/0000-0002-2433-3809",Department of Health's National Institute for Health Research Centres; Margaret Pyke Trust; UK Department for International Development,Department of Health's National Institute for Health Research Centres(National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)); Margaret Pyke Trust; UK Department for International Development,This work was undertaken at UCLH/UCL who received a proportion of funding from the Department of Health's National Institute for Health Research Centres funding scheme.

We find that the large uncertainties associated with the climate-change problem can make the policy prescriptions of this traditional approach unreliable. In this study, we construct a large uncertainty space that includes the possibility of large and/or abrupt climate changes and/or of technology breakthroughs that radically reduce projected abatement costs. We use computational experiments on a linked system of climate and economic models to compare the performance of a simple adaptive strategy - one that can make midcourse corrections based on observations of the climate and economic systems - and two commonly advocated 'best-estimate' policies based on different expectations about the longterm consequences of climate change. We find that the 'Do-a-Little' and 'Emissions-Stabilization' best-estimate policies perform well in the respective regions of the uncertainty space where their estimates are valid, but can fail severely in those regions where their estimates are wrong. In contrast, the adaptive strategy can make midcourse corrections and avoid significant errors. While its success is no surprise, the adaptive-strategy approach provides an analytic framework to examine important policy and research issues that will likely arise as society adapts to climate change, which cannot be easily addressed in studies using best-estimate approaches.","UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT ATMOSPHER SCI,URBANA,IL 61801",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Lempert, RJ (corresponding author), RAND CORP,1700 MAIN ST,SANTA MONICA,CA 90407, USA.",,,,,,,,45,88,89,0,9,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Current examples of the application of CR-WSPs show a strong sectoral approach that fails to explore the potential synergies between other climate-sensitive sectors related to water, such as food and energy. This can increase the vulnerability or decrease the overall resilience of urban systems when planning climate change adaptation measures. In this work, the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus approach was applied in the formulation of a CR-WSP in Leh Town, India, a city with rapid development and population growth located in the Himalayas-one of the most sensitive ecosystems to climate change. The WEF Nexus approach was applied in the system description using a critical infrastructure approach and in the formulation of scenarios for risk management which exploited intersectoral synergies through water reclamation with resource recovery using constructed wetlands. The improvements in WEF security and risk reduction were demonstrated through indicators and risk mapping with geographical information systems (GISs). The methods for integrating the WEF Nexus approach in CR-WSPs provided through this work can serve as a base for a trans-sectoral, resilient approach within risk-based approaches for water security.","[Paez-Curtidor, Natalie; Keilmann-Gondhalekar, Daphne; Drewes, Joerg E.] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Chair Urban Water Syst Engn, Coulombwall 3, D-85748 Garching, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Keilmann-Gondhalekar, D (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Chair Urban Water Syst Engn, Coulombwall 3, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",natalie.paez@tum.de; d.gondhalekar@tum.de; jdrewes@tum.de,"Parween, Shama/AFQ-4232-2022","Drewes, Jorg E./0000-0003-2520-7596; Gondhalekar, Daphne/0000-0002-4265-6505",,,,,88,4,4,2,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2021,13,19,,,,,,,10550,10.3390/su131910550,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su131910550,,,29,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WK3IE,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000709621700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, factors affecting adoption of RWHP and their impacts were not studied systematically. Understanding the factors influencing the adoption of RWHP for sustainable agricultural intensification and climate resilience is critical to promoting such technologies. This paper investigates the impacts of using rural roads to harvest rainwater runoff and the factors causing farmers to adopt the practice. Road water harvesting is considered a possible mechanism for transformative climate change adaptation. By systematically capturing rainfall with rural road infrastructure, rain-related road damage is reduced, erosion and landscape degradation due to road development is lessened, and farm incomes increase due to the beneficial use of harvested water, resulting in an increased climate change resilience. This paper uses a binary probit model and propensity score matching methods based on a household survey of 159 households and 603 plots. The results of the probit model show that the education level of the household, family labor, access to markets, and distance of the farming plot from the farmer's dwelling are statistically significant in explaining farmers' adoption of RWHP in the study area. The casual impact estimation from the propensity score matching suggests that RWHP has positive and significant impacts on input uses (farmyard manure and fertilizer), crop yield, and farm income among the sample households.","[Gebru, Kebede Manjur; Beyene, Aregawi; Gebreegziabher, Kidane Tesfay] Mekelle Univ, Dept Rural Dev & Agr Extens, POB 231, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Woldearegay, Kifle] Mekelle Univ, Sch Earth Sci, POB 231, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [van Steenbergen, Frank; Vera, Letty Fajardo; Alemayhu, Taye] MetaMeta Res, Postelstr 2, NL-5211 EA Shertogenbosch, Netherlands",Mekelle University; Mekelle University,"Gebru, KM (corresponding author), Mekelle Univ, Dept Rural Dev & Agr Extens, POB 231, Mekelle, Ethiopia.",solomonmanjur@gmail.com; kiflewold@yahoo.com; fvansteenbergen@metameta.nl; aregawibeyene04@gmail.com; lfajardovera@metameta.nl; kidanetesfay21@gmail.com; taye@metameta.nl,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Alemayehu, Taye/ABB-7685-2021","Woldemariam, Kifle Woldearegay/0000-0003-3208-3544; Manjur, Kebede/0000-0003-4116-9796; Fajardo Vera, Letty/0000-0001-9934-2307; Gebreegziabher, Kidane/0000-0002-3422-258X",Green Future Farming program,Green Future Farming program,The support of the Green Future Farming program and Global Resilience in the preparation of this paper is acknowledged.,,39,3,3,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2020,12,21,,,,,,,8914,10.3390/su12218914,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12218914,,,25,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OR3AN,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000589346400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To cope with this problem, different types of planned adaptation strategies have been implemented guided by laws, policies and programs. However, these guiding documents sometimes fall short of addressing the needs of climate-affected people, especially in natural resource-dependent societies in Asia and Africa. Based on this premise, this paper sought to evaluate the effectiveness of existing policy documents which affect the lives of people living in one large delta (Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna in Bangladesh), two medium-sized deltas (Indian Bengal deltapart of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Mahanadi in India), and a small-sized delta (Volta in Ghana). The study followed a mixed methods research design, which included desktop analyses of policies, laws and programs, a questionnaire survey conducted among individuals who played various roles in the policy and legal development processes at national and local levels and focus group discussions at the community level in the three countries. National laws, policies and programs were assessed in the context of climate change adaptation through three lenses: human rights, natural resource management and disaster response. Findings of this paper reveal that the existing documents have some strengths to promote adaptation, although they have some major limitations that cause concerns among the delta communities.","[Hossen, M.

A new response framework for adaptation is proposed, based on an empirical analysis and consultations with stakeholders, using a modified version of the DPSIR (Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response) framework. The framework is tested in the Narail district of Bangladesh, where temperature has increased by about 1 A degrees C in the summer in combination with an increase in rainfall of 0.70 mm day(-1) yr(-1) in the last decade. Calibrated model (MAGICC/SENGEN) projections forecast, on average, a temperature increase of up to 5 A degrees C and an increase in rainfall of 25 % by the end of this century. Water diversion in the upstream regions of the Ganges River delta contributes to increase water scarcity in the dry season. Enhanced rainfall and the immense pressure of water discharges from upstream water sources are increasing the risk of floods and river erosion in the dry season. An increase in the water holding capacity of rivers, wetlands and canals by dredging is urgently required. The empirical model of this study is intended to support adaptation planning and monitoring in Bangladesh and can be used in other data-poor areas which will suffer from climate change.","[Hossain, Md.

Many studies of climate risk perceptions have either analyzed a general operationalization of climate change risk or employed a case-study approach of specific adaptive processes. This study takes a different approach, examining attitudes toward 17 specific, climate-related coastal risks and cognitive, affective, and risk-specific predictors of risk perception. A survey of 558 undergraduates revealed that risks to the physical environment were a greater concern than economic or biological risks. Perceptions of greater physical environment risks were significantly associated with having more pro-environmental attitudes, being female, and being more Democratic-leaning. Perceptions of greater economic risks were significantly associated with having more negative environmental attitudes, being female, and being more Republican-leaning. Perceptions of greater biological risks were significantly associated with more positive environmental attitudes. The findings suggest that focusing on physical environment risks maybe more salient to this audience than communications about general climate change adaptation. The results demonstrate that climate change beliefs and risk perceptions are multifactorial and complex and are shaped by individuals' attitudes and basic beliefs. Climate risk communications need to apply this knowledge to better target cognitive and affective processes of specific audiences, rather than providing simple characterizations of risks.

In this article, we inquire into how recent localized extreme weather events in Copenhagen, Denmark, have spurred processes of innovation in adaptation pathways. We suggest that risk-framing work by professionals plays an important part in understanding urban innovation processes, since changes in public risk perceptions become part of collaborative learning processes amongst communities of professionals. Such learning processes can result in new technological pathways of innovation, as part of wider urban knowledge systems. We analyze these processes through 32 semi-structured interviews with professionals involved in creating knowledge about climate adaptation in urban Copenhagen. Specifically, we compare two knowledge and innovation pathways, for pluvial and coastal flooding, representing, respectively, an actualized extreme event and a near miss. Overall, we find that the presence (pluvial) or absence (coastal) of damage from localized extreme events matters to the knowledge and innovation pathways. Innovation in dominant technological solution spans, as well as related institutional decision-making routines, is more pervasive in pluvial flooding, whereas coastal flooding is widely considered as temporally distant. Analytically, we suggest that a distinction between regulative and expanded institutional framings of risk matters to how professionals understand their own room for manoeuvre. Recent pluvial flood events have not changed the official technical risk assessments. Yet when professionals consider such events in an expanded institutional frame, they incorporate increased public and political risk perceptions as they construct pathways for further innovation.","[Madsen, Herle Mo; Mikkelsen, Peter Steen] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn DTU Environm, Lyngby, Denmark; [Blok, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Sociol, Copenhagen, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark; University of Copenhagen,"Madsen, HM (corresponding author), Bygning 115,Bygningstorvet, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",hermom@env.dtu.dk,"Mikkelsen, Peter S/D-9691-2011","Mikkelsen, Peter S/0000-0003-3799-0493; Blok, Anders/0000-0002-3403-698X","Technical University of Denmark, under the Integrated Water Technology programme; Department of Sociology, University of Copenhagen","Technical University of Denmark, under the Integrated Water Technology programme; Department of Sociology, University of Copenhagen","Thank you to all the interviewees for taking time to talk to us.

For scientific research to be useful for decision making, it must answer questions relevant for bridging the gap to policy, and so enhance the science-policy interface (SPI). In this study, Q methodology was used to capture perspectives from multi-level stakeholders holding different viewpoints about climate change in order to strengthen the SPI for climate adaptation in Cameroon. The views expressed by stakeholders resolved into three discourses which together explained 59% of the Q-analysis variance. The first discourse explained 21% of the variance and focused on vulnerability and impacts of climate change. Under this discourse, stakeholders recognized the Sudano-Sahel and coastal zones as areas most vulnerable to climate change in Cameroon, with water resources and agriculture as the most vulnerable sectors. The second discourse explained 20% of the study variance and focused on adaptation planning. Political leadership was identified as crucially important for driving adaptation. The third discourse explained 18% of the study variance and centered on policy incentives. Key policy areas that can be put in place to raise the adaptive capacity of the population were identified. Proposed policies included integrated water resources management (IWRM) and the distribution of farm inputs to farmers to boost agricultural production.

A number of recent studies aim to identify policies mapping future observations to actions-in other words, framing climate adaptation as an optimal control problem. This paper uses the control paradigm to review and classify recent dynamic planning studies according to their approaches to uncertainty characterization, policy structure, and solution methods. We propose a set of research gaps and opportunities in this area centered on the challenge of characterizing uncertainty, which prevents the unambiguous application of control methods to this problem. These include exogenous uncertainty in forcing, model structure, and parameters propagated through a chain of climate and hydrologic models; endogenous uncertainty in human-environmental system dynamics across multiple scales; and sampling uncertainty due to the finite length of historical observations and future projections. Recognizing these challenges, several opportunities exist to improve the use of control methods for climate adaptation, namely, how problem context and understanding of climate processes might assist with uncertainty quantification and experimental design, out-of-sample validation and robustness of optimized adaptation policies, and monitoring and data assimilation, including trend detection, Bayesian inference, and indicator variable selection.

The late cowpea sowing on 30 June appeared to be produced the higher seed yield contributions and yields ha(-1), crop and harvest index as well as pure seed. In respect of sowing density, intermediate planting density (95240 plants ha(-1)) exhibited the higher seed yield components and yields ha(-1), crop and harvest index as well as pure seed. Results of interaction indicated that late sowing on 30 June attained the maximum seed yield when intermediate planting density of 95240 plants ha(-1) was used. Late sowing under lighter (57145 and 71430 plants ha(-1)) and intermediate (95240 plants ha(-1)) planting densities exhibited the highest pure seed as well as the fewest shriveled and infected seeds. Path coefficient analysis showed that number of pods plant(-1) had exerted positive and high direct effect on seed yield of cowpea (0.385) and 100-seed weight had positive and moderate direct effect on seed yield of cowpea (0.251).","[El-Sobky, El-Sayed E.

Moist convection provides ascent within the rain belt, but must be parameterized in climate models, limiting predictions. Here, we use a pan-African convection-permitting model (CPM), alongside a parameterized convection model (PCM), to analyze how explicit convection affects the rain belt under climate change. Regarding changes in mean climate, both models project an increase in total column water (TCW), a widespread increase in rainfall, and slowdown of subtropical descent. Regional climate changes are similar for annual mean rainfall but regional changes of ascent typically strengthen less or weaken more in the CPM. Over a land-only meridional transect of the rain belt, the CPM mean rainfall increases less than in the PCM (5% vs 14%) but mean vertical velocity at 500 hPa weakens more (17% vs 10%). These changes mask more fundamental changes in underlying distributions. The decrease in 3-hourly rain frequency and shift from lighter to heavier rainfall are more pronounced in the CPM and accompanied by a shift from weak to strong updrafts with the enhancement of heavy rainfall largely due to these dynamic changes. The CPM has stronger coupling between intense rainfall and higher TCW. This yields a greater increase in rainfall contribution from events with greater TCW, with more rainfall for a given large-scale ascent, and so favors slowing of that ascent. These findings highlight connections between the convective-scale and larger-scale flows and emphasize that limitations of parameterized convection have major implications for planning adaptation to climate change.","[Jackson, Lawrence S.; Finney, Declan L.; Marsham, John H.; Parker, Douglas J.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Kendon, Elizabeth J.; Stratton, Rachel A.; Tomassini, Lorenzo; Tucker, Simon] Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; [Marsham, John H.] Univ Leeds, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; Met Office - UK; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Leeds,"Jackson, LS (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",l.s.jackson@leeds.ac.uk,"Jackson, Lawrence/HHC-1722-2022; Parker, Douglas/O-8051-2015; Finney, Declan/B-1473-2013","Parker, Douglas/0000-0003-2335-8198; Finney, Declan/0000-0002-3334-6935; Marsham, John/0000-0003-3219-8472; Jackson, Lawrence/0000-0001-8143-2777","Natural Environment Research Council/Department for InternationalDevelopment (NERC/DFID) via the Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) [NE/MO17176/1, NE/M017214/1, NE/M02038X/1]; DACCIWA project; European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-13) [603502]; AMMA-2050 project [NE/M020126/1]; Joint U.K. BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme [GA01101]; NCAS via the NERC/GCRF programme ACREW: Atmospheric Hazard in Developing Countries: Risk Assessment and Early Warning; Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award; NERC [NE/M02038X/1, NE/M020126/1, NE/M017214/1, NE/M020428/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Natural Environment Research Council/Department for InternationalDevelopment (NERC/DFID) via the Future Climate for Africa (FCFA); DACCIWA project; European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-13); AMMA-2050 project; Joint U.K. BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme; NCAS via the NERC/GCRF programme ACREW: Atmospheric Hazard in Developing Countries: Risk Assessment and Early Warning; Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award(Royal Society of London); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The authors were supported by Natural Environment Research Council/Department for InternationalDevelopment (NERC/DFID, NE/MO17176/1, NE/M017214/1, and NE/M02038X/1) via the Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) funded projects: Improving Model Processes for African Climate (IMPALA) and Integrating Hydro-Climate Science into Policy Decisions for Climate-Resilient Infrastructure and Livelihoods in East Africa (HyCRISTAL).

Of the 125 reviewed articles, 79 % were published after 2009. There are numerous concepts that point out to stressors other than climate change that were used in reviewed studies. These different concepts were used interchangeably, and they illustrate processes that act on different scales. Most widely used concepts included non-climatic (40 % of the articles), multiple stressors (38 %) and other factors (37 %). About 75 % of the studies either acknowledged or carefully analyzed the social and environmental context in which vulnerability is experienced. One-third of the studies recognized climate change-related stressors as the most important, one-third argued that stressors other than climate are more important, and the rest of the studies did not analyze the relative importance of the different processes. Interactions between different stressors were mentioned in 76 % and analyzed explicitly in 28 % of the articles. Our review shows that there are studies that analyze the social context of vulnerability within climate change-related literature and this literature is rapidly expanding. Reviewed studies point out that there are multiple interacting stressors, whose interlinkages need to be carefully analyzed and targeted by policies, which integrate adaptation to climate change and other stressors. In conclusion, we suggest that future studies should include analytical frameworks that reflect dissimilarities between different types of stressors, methodological triangulation to identify key stressors and analysis of interactions between multiple stressors across different scales.","[Rasanen, Aleksi; Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Nygren, Anja; Kakonen, Mira] Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, Dev Studies, Helsinki, Finland; [Kallio, Maarit; Monge, Adrian Monge; Kanninen, Markku] Univ Helsinki, Viikki Trop Resources Inst, Dept Forest Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Juhola, Sirkku] Aalto Univ, Dept Built Environm, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; Aalto University,"Rasanen, A (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, Helsinki, Finland.",aleksi.rasanen@helsinki.fi,"Juhola, Sirkku/GVS-5485-2022; Nygren, Anja/AGL-3680-2022; Kanninen, Markku/AAW-9606-2021; Kanninen, Markku T/S-7684-2016; Käkönen, Mira/EWC-6958-2022","Nygren, Anja/0000-0001-9054-1801; Kanninen, Markku/0000-0002-5708-9443; Kanninen, Markku T/0000-0002-5708-9443; Käkönen, Mira/0000-0002-2350-4020; Kallio, Maarit/0000-0002-5657-7648; Juhola, Sirkku/0000-0003-0095-2282; Monge Monge, Adrian Antonio/0000-0002-4961-907X; Rasanen, Aleksi/0000-0002-3629-1837",Helsinki University Centre for Environment (HENVI),Helsinki University Centre for Environment (HENVI),"The research was funded by Helsinki University Centre for Environment (HENVI).

This severely affected the functioning of coastal ecosystems, reducing their provision of useful services and increasing coastal vulnerability to climate change. Changes in the hydrology and polluted residual matter make the soil unsuitable for other agricultural purposes without costly restoration. The root of the problem was inappropriate management and a focus on short term economic gains. Despite this previous failure, the national development plan, Mahinda Chinthana, now promotes aquaculture as an avenue for development. This will only be possible if aquaculture is regulated in a sustainable and well-managed manner, and does not increase local vulnerability to climate change effects. The current paper discusses the possible costs and benefits in applying the concept of Climate Compatible Development (CCD) to shrimp aquaculture in Puttalam, Sri Lanka. It suggests how the sector can support mitigation of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions and adaptation to climate change effects, whilst stimulating development that will also benefit rural societies. Mechanisms that could enable this change include subsidies, insurance and bank loans which will also facilitate investment by foreign private enterprises and subsequent export. The development of a specific aquaculture policy and master plan would facilitate the process further. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Harkes, I. H.

Adaptation to climate change will make a major difference to the severity of the impacts experienced. However, individuals (resource users) can erect sometimes seemingly peculiar barriers to potential adaptation options that need to be addressed if adaptation is to be effective. Our aim was to understand the nature of barriers to change for cattle graziers in the northern Australian rangelands. We conceptualised barriers as adverse reactions where resource users are unlikely to contemplate adaptations that threaten core values or perceptions about themselves. We assumed that resource users that were more sensitive to climate change impacts-or more dependent on the resource-were more proximate to thresholds of coping and thus more likely to erect barriers, especially people with little adaptive capacity. Given that climate sensitivity and adaptive capacity are important components of vulnerability, our approach was to conduct a vulnerability assessment to identify potential but important barriers to change. Data from 240 graziers suggest that graziers in northern Australia might be especially vulnerable to climate change because their identity, place attachment, low employability, weak networks and dependents can make them sensitive to change, and their sensitivity can be compounded by a low adaptive capacity. We argue that greater attention needs to be placed on the social context of climate change impacts and on the processes shaping vulnerability and adaptation, especially at the scale of the individual.","[Marshall, Nadine; Stokes, Chris J.] CSIRO, Townsville, Qld, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Marshall, N (corresponding author), CSIRO, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",nadine.marshall@csiro.au,"Marshall, Nadine/D-9339-2011; Stokes, Chris/AAR-2890-2021; Stokes, Chris J/G-5199-2010","Marshall, Nadine/0000-0003-4463-3558; Stokes, Chris/0000-0003-1576-2457; Stokes, Chris J/0000-0003-1576-2457","Federal Department for Agriculture, Forests and Fisheries (DAFF) through the Meat and Livestock Association (MLA) [B.NBP.0617]; Climate Adaptation Flagship, CSIRO","Federal Department for Agriculture, Forests and Fisheries (DAFF) through the Meat and Livestock Association (MLA); Climate Adaptation Flagship, CSIRO","The funding for this study was obtained from the Federal Department for Agriculture, Forests and Fisheries (DAFF) through the Meat and Livestock Association (MLA) project B.NBP.0617 and the Climate Adaptation Flagship, CSIRO.

There were missing values in 52.6% of the data, which were handled by a hybrid random forest approach and bootstrap method (RF-Bs). The present approach addresses large missing values and also reduces the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in the search for the optimum minimal value. Cluster analysis was used to classify stations or grid points into different rainfall regimes. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) of rainfall data reveal the pattern of behavior of the rainfall regime in a specific region by identifying homogeneous clusters. According to the HCA, four distinct and homogenous regions were recognized. Then, the principal component analysis (PCA) technique was used to homogenize the rainfall series and optimally reduce the long-term rainfall records into a few variables. Moreover, PCA was applied to monthly rainfall data in order to validate the results of the HCA analysis. On the basis of the 75% of cumulative variation, 14 factors for the Dry season and the Rainy season, and 12 factors for the Inter-monsoon season, were extracted among the components using varimax rotation. Consideration of different groupings into these approaches opens up new advanced early warning systems in developing recommendations on how to differentiate climate change adaptation- and mitigation-related policies in order to minimize the largest economic damage and taking necessary precautions when multiple hazard events occur.","[Basri, Muhamad Afdal Ahmad; Shaharudin, Shazlyn Milleana; Zainuddin, Nurul Hila] Univ Pendidikan Sultan Idris, Fac Sci & Math, Dept Math, Tanjong Malim 35900, Perak, Malaysia; [Kismiantini] Univ Negeri Yogyakarta, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Dept Stat, Yogyakarta 55281, Indonesia; [Tan, Mou Leong] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Humanities, GeoInformat Unit, Geog Sect, Gelugor 11800, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia; [Najib, Sumayyah Aimi Mohd] Univ Pendidikan Sultan Idris, Fac Human Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Tanjong Malim 35900, Perak, Malaysia; [Andayani, Sri] Univ Negeri Yogyakarta, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Dept Math, Yogyakarta 55281, Indonesia",Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris; Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta; Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris; Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta,"Shaharudin, SM (corresponding author), Univ Pendidikan Sultan Idris, Fac Sci & Math, Dept Math, Tanjong Malim 35900, Perak, Malaysia.",M20201000214@siswa.upsi.edu.my; shazlyn@fsmt.upsi.edu.my; kismi@uny.ac.id; mouleong@usm.my; sumayyah@fsk.upsi.edu.my; nurulhila@fsmt.upsi.edu.my; andayani@uny.ac.id,"Tan, Mou Leong/N-4678-2017; Andayani, Sri/GPK-4005-2022; Kismiantini, Kismiantini/ACB-7845-2022","Tan, Mou Leong/0000-0003-3939-0336; Kismiantini, Kismiantini/0000-0002-6105-7647; Shaharudin, Shazlyn Milleana/0000-0001-8243-5646",FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH GRANT SCHEME [2019-0132-103- 02 (FRGS/1/2019/STG06/UPSI/02/4)]; Geran Penyelidikan Universiti Fundamental (GPUF) 2020 [2020-0172-103-01]; Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris,FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH GRANT SCHEME; Geran Penyelidikan Universiti Fundamental (GPUF) 2020; Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris,"This research was funded by FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH GRANT SCHEME, grant number 2019-0132-103- 02 (FRGS/1/2019/STG06/UPSI/02/4) and The APC was funded by Geran Penyelidikan Universiti Fundamental (GPUF) 2020, grant number 2020-0172-103-01 and Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris.",,46,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2220-9964,,ISPRS INT J GEO-INF,ISPRS Int.

An unusual combination of winds created a storm surge reaching up to 3.5 m above mean sea level, which is more than a meter higher than all other observations over the past 200 years. On the Danish, German, and Swedish coasts, about 300 people lost their lives. The consequences of the storm in Denmark and Germany were more severe than in Sweden, with significantly larger destruction and higher numbers of casualties. In Denmark and Germany, the 1872 storm has been more extensively documented and remembered and still influences local and regional risk awareness. A comparative study indicates that the collective memory of the 1872 storm is related to the background knowledge about floods, the damage extent, and the response to the storm. Flood marks and dikes help to remember the events. In general, coastal flood defence is to the largest degree implemented in the affected areas in Germany, followed by Denmark, and is almost absent in Sweden, corresponding to the extent of the collective memory of the 1872 storm. Within the affected countries, there is local variability of flood risk awareness associated with the collective memory of the storm. Also, the economic dependency on flood-prone areas and conflicting interests with the tourism industry have influence on flood protection decisions. The processes of climate change adaptation and implementation of the EU Floods Directive are slowly removing these differences in flood risk management approaches.","[Hallin, Caroline; Almstrom, Bjorn; Larson, Magnus] Lund Univ, Div Water Resources Engn, John Ericssons Vag 1, S-22363 Lund, Sweden; [Hallin, Caroline] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Hydraul Engn, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands; [Hofstede, Jacobus L.

This scenario poses considerable demand on chemical control. This study was carried out with the specific aim to examine the influence of changes in temperature and exposure time of C quinquefasciatus to toxicities of pyrethroid (Cypermethrin), organophosphate (2, 2- dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate) and their mixtures. Eggs of C quinquefasciatus were collected at the Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria, in an area far from residential and cultivated zones, with a remote chance of the mosquitoes being exposed to insecticides. The eggs were allowed to hatch into larvae/pupae in the field at 27-29 degrees C temperature, 70-85% RH, 14:10 (L: D) photoperiod. F-3 adult generation reared were transferred to the Entomology Laboratory and exposed to different concentrations of Cypermethrin and DDVP applied singly and in mixtures at varying temperatures and exposure time with mortality recorded. The median lethal concentration (LC50) values for the insecticides were higher when the insecticides were applied singly than when applied as mixtures. Therefore, mixtures of cypermethrin and DDVP have enhanced toxicity. Again, temperature changes also affect insecticide toxicity and because climate change has a characteristic temperature variability, it poses a barrier to insecticide toxicity. Hence, it is expedient to have a climate change adaptation policy in synergy with modality of chemical applications. Further study of toxico-kinetic of the insecticides in mosquito control is also recommended. (C) 2021 The Authors.

In this paper, we use techniques from network science and bibliometrics to evaluate the degree to which this transformation has taken place. By creating networks based on over 3,000 agroecology papers and the roughly 160,000 references they cite, we distinguish the sub-fields (research fronts) that made up agroecology in three time intervals: 1982-2004, 2005-2013, and 2014-2018. We also identify the main disciplines from which the research fronts in 2014-2018 drew their supporting knowledge. We suggest that, very broadly, themes in agroecological research include: Ecosystem services; (agro)biodiversity; approaches to agricultural intensification; tropical agroecosystems (particularly coffee); pest and weed management; organic agriculture; cropping systems; system transitions, modeling, and design; climate change adaptation; food sovereignty; education; and the nature and purpose of agroecology itself. Some research fronts mainly cite papers in natural science fields such as ecology, environmental science, agriculture, and entomology. However, others draw upon work in social science areas including development studies, environmental studies, and anthropology. The analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that agroecology has indeed evolved to possess many of the characteristics of an ecology of [the entire] food system. We anticipate that this work will also be of use to those wishing to gain an overview of the field or identify key papers, knowledge gaps, and potential collaborations.","[Mason, Rachel E.; White, Alissa; Bucini, Gabriela; Anderzen, Janica; Mendez, V.

Food security is a key issue in the region, and is related to vulnerability in the natural and human system. This short research paper, which reports on a systematic search of the academic literature and is part of a larger research project on climate change adaptation in Caribbean coastal communities, investigates two central questions: (1) what challenges to food security are Caribbean SIDS facing due to climate change? and (2) what strategies, if any, are being used to adapt to these challenges? We review peer-reviewed articles published after the release of Working Group II's contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2014, which included a chapter on vulnerability and impacts in small islands (Chapter 29). We find that post AR5 articles confirm that climate change will have a significant effect on agriculture and fisheries in the Caribbean, mainly through changing patterns of weather, air and sea surface temperatures, and water availability. These studies highlight the importance of considering the social dimensions of food security in the region when identifying and implementing adaptation strategies, particularly in the context of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. These social dimensions include the Caribbean's historical and social context as well as its demographics, which feature varying population densities and poverty rates. They serve to increase vulnerability but are imperative considerations for understanding and minimizing the threat climate change poses to food security in the region.","[Lincoln Lenderking, Hania; Robinson, Stacy-ann; Carlson, Gail] Colby Coll, Environm Studies Program, Waterville, ME 04901 USA",Colby College,"Robinson, SA (corresponding author), Colby Coll, Environm Studies Program, Waterville, ME 04901 USA.",smrobins@colby.edu,,"Robinson, Stacy-ann/0000-0003-3163-8771",,,,,46,13,13,2,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1350-4509,1745-2627,,INT J SUST DEV WORLD,Int.

Due to climate change, it is advisable to identify the vulnerable area and to investigate if the local reservoir network of hundreds of larger reservoirs and thousands of smaller reservoirs can effectively mitigate the climate-induced hydrologic variation. Therefore, the local high-density reservoir network is integrated into a distributed hydrologic model (HMS) through a fully coupled reservoir module. We then apply the extended HMS in a one-way coupled mode to the bias corrected Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment in East Asia (CORDEX-EA) regional climate simulations under two Representative Concentration Pathways - RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Results indicate that climate change poses new challenges to water resources management for the PLB, with a likely decrease of water availability in the dry season but an increase of water availability, flood magnitude and flood frequency in the flood season till 2049. The local reservoir network can mitigate climate impacts by displacing excessive water resources in the flood season to the dry season and mitigating floods across the basin. Despite that, much of the southern basin is likely to see a higher risk of water shortage in the dry season, while most of the northern basin is expected to see a higher flood risk. The approach and findings are expected to improve the understanding of the role of reservoirs in the context of climate change, and provide implications for water resources management and climate change adaptation strategies on a regional scale.","[Dong, Ningpeng; Yu, Zhongbo; Gu, Huanghe; Yang, Chuanguo] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Dong, Ningpeng; Yu, Zhongbo; Gu, Huanghe; Yang, Chuanguo] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yang, Mingxiang; Wang, Hao] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Dept Water Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wei, Jianhui; Arnault, Joel; Laux, Patrick; Kunstmann, Harald] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK IFU, Campus Alpine, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Laux, Patrick; Kunstmann, Harald] Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Augsburg, Germany",Hohai University; Hohai University; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Augsburg,"Yu, ZB (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Yu, ZB (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Wei, JH (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK IFU, Campus Alpine, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany.",zyu@hhu.edu.cn; jianhui.wei@kit.edu,"Wei, Jianhui/GQB-4060-2022; Dong, Ningpeng/GLU-3558-2022; Laux, Patrick/A-7671-2013; Wei, Jianhui/N-2783-2019; Arnault, Joël/AAV-2282-2021; Kunstmann, Harald/A-7071-2013","Wei, Jianhui/0000-0001-8609-9600; Dong, Ningpeng/0000-0002-5226-6180; Laux, Patrick/0000-0002-8657-6152; Wei, Jianhui/0000-0001-8609-9600; Arnault, Joël/0000-0001-8859-5173; Kunstmann, Harald/0000-0001-9573-1743","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51539003, 41761134090]; Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST [2017QNRC001]; National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China [51709271]; National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC0402710, 2016YFC0402706]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2018B55114]; National Science Funds for Creative Research Groups of China [51421006]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China through National Key Research and Development Program of China; German Research Foundation (DFG) [KU 2090/11-1]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST; National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China; National Key R&D Program of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Science Funds for Creative Research Groups of China(Science Fund for Creative Research Groups); Ministry of Science and Technology of China through National Key Research and Development Program of China; German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51539003; 41761134090); Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST (2017QNRC001); National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China (No. 51709271); National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2016YFC0402710; 2016YFC0402706); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2018B55114) and National Science Funds for Creative Research Groups of China (No. 51421006).

A distinction was made between coping and adaptation, as short-term responses to shocks and long-term responses to stressors, respectively. Binary logistic regression modeling was used based on a survey of 200 farmers. Socio-demographic, economic, biophysical, and institutional and infrastructural characteristics of the study setting and sample households were considered to identify key determinants of farmers' choice of coping and adaptation strategies. This is premised on the fact that understanding significant determinants of farmers' choice of coping and adaptation strategies is useful to design impactful adaptation interventions in the locality. The results showed that the significant factors affecting choice of adaptation strategies include perceived soil fertility status, perception of land tenure security, access to extension service, and ages of household heads. For the choice of coping options, agroecological zone, access to markets, farmer-to-farmer extension, landholding size, access to information on climate change, rainfall amount, and educational level of household heads were the significant determinants. Agroecological zone had negative influence to use selling livestock as coping strategy while the other variables had positive influences on farmers' choice of coping and adaptation strategies. Off-farm income, community participation, ownership of livestock and temperature on the other hand had no significant influence on the choice of coping and adaptation strategies to climate change. Adaptation planning for the study locality should take into account the potential influence of these determinant factors into account.","[Alemayehu, Arragaw; Bewket, Woldeamlak] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Alemayehu, A (corresponding author), Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",aragaw.alemayehu@aau.edu.et; woldeamlak.bewket@aau.edu.et,,,Addis Ababa University; Debre Birhan University,Addis Ababa University; Debre Birhan University,We are very grateful to Addis Ababa University and Debre Birhan University for their financial assistance to the first author.

Simulations by RCMs are used for impacts assessment, often without any evaluation. There is a growing debate on the added value made by the regional models to the projections of GCMs specifically for the regions like, United States and Europe. Evaluation of RCMs for Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) has been overlooked in literature, though there are few disjoint studies on Indian monsoon extremes and biases. Here we present a comprehensive study on the evaluations of RCMs for the ISMR with all its important characteristics such as northward and eastward propagation, onset, seasonal rainfall patterns, intra-seasonal oscillations, spatial variability and patterns of extremes. We evaluate nine regional simulations from Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment and compare them with their host Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-5 GCM projections. We do not find any consistent improvement in the RCM simulations with respect to their host GCMs for any of the characteristics of Indian monsoon except the spatial variation. We also find that the simulations of the ISMR characteristics by a good number of RCMs, are worse than those of their host GCMs. No consistent added value is observed in the RCM simulations of changes in ISMR characteristics over recent periods, compared to past; though there are few exceptions. These results highlight the need for proper evaluation before utilizing regional models for impacts assessment and subsequent policy making for sustainable climate change adaptation.","[Singh, Swati; Ghosh, Subimal; Karmakar, Subhankar] Indian Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Program Climate Studies, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Ghosh, Subimal; Sahana, A.

As climate change impacts become more noticeable and costlier, some current water management strategies will not be useful. According to the findings of CIRCE, the areas with limited water resources will increase in the coming decades with major consequences for the way we produce food and we protect ecosystems. Based on these projections this paper discusses water policy priorities for climate change adaptation in the Mediterranean. We first summarise the main challenges to water resources in Mediterranean countries and outline the risks and opportunities for water under climate change based on previous studies. Recognising the difficulty to go from precipitation to water policy, we then present a framework to evaluate water availability in response to natural and management conditions, with an example of application in the Ebro basin that exemplifies other Mediterranean areas. Then we evaluate adaptive capacity to understand the ability of Mediterranean countries to face, respond and recover from climate change impacts on water resources. Social and economic factors are key drivers of inequality in the adaptive capacity across the region. Based on the assessment of impacts and adaptive capacity we suggest thresholds for water policy to respond to climate change and link water scarcity indicators to relevant potential adaptation strategies. Our results suggest the need to further prioritise socially and economically sensitive policies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose is to fill the policy vacuum and allow stakeholders to manage risks in energy conservation management by EPCs to better adapt to climate change in the building sector. Design/methodology/approach The article chooses a qualitative research approach to depict the whole risk allocation picture of EPC projects and establish a dynamic EPC risk allocation model for commercial buildings in China. It starts with a comprehensive literature review on risks of EPCs. By modifying the theory of Incomplete Contract and adopting the so-called bow-tie model, a theoretical EPC risk allocation model is developed and verified by interview results. By discussing its application in the commercial building sector in China, an operational EPC three-stage risk allocation model is developed. Findings This study points out the contract incompleteness of the risk allocation for EPC projects and offered an operational method to guide practice. The reasonable risk allocation between building owners and Energy Service Companies can realize their bilateral targets on commercial building energy-saving benefits, which makes EPC more attractive for energy conservation. Originality/value Existing research focused mainly on static risk allocation. Less research was directed to the phased and dynamic risk allocation. This study developed a theoretical three-stage EPC risk allocation model, which provided the theoretical support for dynamic EPC risk allocation of EPC projects. By addressing the contract incompleteness of the risk allocation, an operational method is developed. This is a new approach to allocate risks for EPC projects in a dynamic and staged way.","[Wan, Shiyu; Liu, Yisheng] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wan, Shiyu] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Design Architecture & Bldg, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Ding, Grace; Runeson, Goran; Er, Michael] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Design Architecture & Bldg, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Beijing Jiaotong University; University of Technology Sydney; University of Technology Sydney,"Wan, SY; Liu, YS (corresponding author), Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Wan, SY (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Design Architecture & Bldg, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",fishwansy@163.com; yshliu1@bjtu.edu.cn,"liu, yi/GXE-9662-2022",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71871014]; China Scholarship Council [20180709009],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71871014, and the China Scholarship Council under Grant No. 20180709009.

Flood risk disclosure through maps is a policy instrument aimed at addressing this situation. We assess its effectiveness by identifying whether such maps induce a price differential for single family coastal dwellings in three Finnish cities, and by estimating the discount per square meter for various flooding probabilities (return times). The estimations indicate a significant price drop after the information disclosure for properties located in flood-prone areas as indicated by the maps. In the case of sea flooding information in Helsinki, the price effect is sensitive to the communicated probability of flooding. Overall, the discussed policy instrument appears to have functioned as intended, correcting information gaps and asymmetries related to flood risk. The identified effect is spatially selective; it caused a short-term localized shock in market prices in conjunction with some reorientation of demand from risky coastal properties towards ones that represent a similar level of coastal amenity, but are less risky in terms of flooding. This hints at the potential for incorporating the shocks associated with flood events or risk information into broader-scoped urban modelling and simulation. Similarly, the reasonable accuracy with which the housing market processes the additional information shows a potential for wider use of the disclosure of non-obvious risks in real estate markets. In the case of adapting to climate change risks, additional uncertainties may make the disclosure instrument less effective, if used as a single tool.","[Votsis, Athanasios; Perrels, Adriaan] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Socioecon Impact Res, Erik Palmenin Aukio 1,POB 503, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Votsis, Athanasios] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, Helsinki, Finland",Finnish Meteorological Institute; University of Helsinki,"Votsis, A (corresponding author), Finnish Meteorol Inst, Socioecon Impact Res, Erik Palmenin Aukio 1,POB 503, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland.;Votsis, A (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, Helsinki, Finland.",athanasios.votsis@fmi.fi,"Votsis, Athanasios/AAB-1817-2021","Perrels, Adriaan/0000-0003-4655-1310; Votsis, Athanasios/0000-0001-5878-7684",Academy of Finland as part of the RECAST project [140797]; Helsinki University Centre for Environment (HENVI) as part of the ENSURE project; Academy of Finland (AKA) [140797] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Academy of Finland as part of the RECAST project(Academy of Finland); Helsinki University Centre for Environment (HENVI) as part of the ENSURE project; Academy of Finland (AKA)(Academy of FinlandFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES)),This study was funded by the Academy of Finland as part of the RECAST project (decision number 140797) and by Helsinki University Centre for Environment (HENVI) as part of the ENSURE project.,,50,29,29,3,46,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Assessing the spatio-temporal distribution of plantation forest vegetation by analyzing Landsat land use/land cover (LULC) data can provide a logical basis for developing ecological and environmental policies to effectively manage ecosystem carbon storage in the future. The study aimed at assessing and predicting dynamics of plantation forest development and ecosystem carbon storage change in coastal Bangladesh over 1988-2041 under three future land management scenarios: business-as-usual (BAU), economic development (ED), and ecological protection-afforestation (EPA) by linking CA-Markov and InVEST models. Findings from LULC change analysis revealed that during 1988-2018, plantation forest increased by 984.9 km2 (68.34%) leading to an overall increase in regional carbon storage, of 3.30 Tg C. Over 2018-2041, plantation forest land could be increased by 249.90, 361.24, and 472.14 km2 under the BAU, ED, and EPA scenarios, respectively, that may potentially increase future carbon storage by 0.64 Tg C, 0.91 Tg C, and 3.77 Tg C, respectively. However, the three future land management scenarios may lead to shortages of regional food supply, of 5.96%, 13.69%, and 11.06% respectively. The suitability maps of different LULC types created in this study could be useful to find out the potential areas of plantation forest development in the future and would provide a scientific basis for further discussion by policymakers on future land use planning, to minimize the trade-offs between food security and climate change adaptation.","[Hoque, Muhammad Ziaul; Cui, Shenghui; Islam, Imranul; Xu, Lilai; Ding, Shengping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Urban Environm, Key Lab Urban Environm & Hlth, 1799 Jimei Rd, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China; [Hoque, Muhammad Ziaul; Islam, Imranul; Ding, Shengping] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Int Sch, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Hoque, Muhammad Ziaul; Cui, Shenghui; Islam, Imranul; Xu, Lilai; Ding, Shengping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Urban Environm, Xiamen Key Lab Urban Metab, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China; [Hoque, Muhammad Ziaul] Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agr Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Rural Dev, Gazipur 1706, Bangladesh","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Urban Environment, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Urban Environment, CAS; Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University (BSMRAU)","Cui, SH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Urban Environm, Key Lab Urban Environm & Hlth, 1799 Jimei Rd, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China.",mziahoque.aer@bsmrau.edu.bd; shcui@iue.ac.cn; islam@iue.ac.cn; llxu@iue.ac.cn; spding@iue.ac.cn,"Hoque, Muhammad Ziaul/AAX-7776-2021; Ding, Shengping/GZK-2694-2022; CAS, KLUEH/T-5743-2019","Hoque, Muhammad Ziaul/0000-0001-6212-6969; ",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41661144032]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0506600],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China,This study was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41661144032) and The National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFC0506600) .,,85,10,11,13,58,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

Consequently, understanding what research has been conducted and what knowledge gaps remain regarding NTDs and climate change is crucial to informing public health interventions and climate change adaptation. We conducted a systematic scoping review to describe the extent, range, and nature of publications examining relationships between NTDs and climatic factors in East Africa. We collated all relevant English and French publications indexed in PubMed (R), Web of Science T Core Collection, and CAB Direct (c) databases published prior to 2019. Ninety-six publications were included for review. Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia had high rates of publication, whereas countries in the Western Indian Ocean region were underrepresented. Most publications focused on schistosomiasis (n = 28, 29.2%), soil-transmitted helminthiases (n = 16, 16.7%), or human African trypanosomiasis (n = 14, 14.6%). Precipitation (n = 91, 94.8%) and temperature (n = 54, 56.3%) were frequently investigated climatic factors, whereas consideration of droughts (n = 10, 10.4%) and floods (n = 4, 4.2%) was not prominent. Publications reporting on associations between NTDs and changing climate were increasing over time. There was a decrease in the reporting of Indigenous identity and age factors over time. Overall, there were substantial knowledge gaps for several countries and for many NTDs. To better understand NTDs in the context of a changing climate, it would be helpful to increase research on underrepresented diseases and regions, consider demographic and social factors in research, and characterize how these factors modify the effects of climatic variables on NTDs in East Africa.","[Bryson, Julia M.; Bishop-Williams, Katherine E.; Nunez, Emily C.; Harper, Sherilee L.] Univ Guelph, Dept Populat Med, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Bryson, Julia M.] McMaster Univ, Michael G DeGroote Sch Med, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Berrang-Ford, Lea] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Nunez, Emily C.] Western Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, London, ON, Canada; [Lwasa, Shuaib] Makerere Univ, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Climat Sci, Kampala, Uganda; [Namanya, Didacus B.] Ugandan Minist Hlth, Dept Community Hlth, Kampala, Uganda; [Harper, Sherilee L.] Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, 11405 87 Ave, Edmonton, AB T6G 1C9, Canada",University of Guelph; McMaster University; University of Leeds; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Makerere University; University of Alberta,"Bryson, JM; Harper, SL (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, 11405 87 Ave, Edmonton, AB T6G 1C9, Canada.",brysonj@mcmaster.ca; kbishop@uoguelph.ca; l.berrangford@leeds.ac.uk; enunez2@uwo.ca; lwasa_s@caes.mak.ac.ug; didas.namanya@health.go.ug; sherilee.harper@ualberta.ca,"Lwasa, Shuaib/G-3723-2014","Lwasa, Shuaib/0000-0003-4312-2836",Canadian Institutes of Health Research; University of Guelph President's Scholarship; Ontario Veterinary College Graduate Research Assistantship Program,Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); University of Guelph President's Scholarship; Ontario Veterinary College Graduate Research Assistantship Program,"Funding for this project was provided by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (received by S.

The impacts of the already happened 0.5 degrees C warming increment on extreme temperature can serve as essential references for the 1.5/2 degrees C projections. Quantifying the observed changes of climate extremes is hampered by the limitation of observational datasets in both spatial coverage and temporal continuity. The reanalysis datasets are hoped to be useful substitutes for the observations, but their performance over continental China remains unknown. In this study, we compare the extreme temperature changes associated with the past 0.5 degrees C warming derived from three reanalysis datasets including JRA-55, ERA and 20CR with the observation in China. Distinct increases (decreases) in warm (cold) extremes are detected in all three reanalyses in a spatially aggregated perspective as in the observation. On regional scales the reanalyses have evident spreads in regions with insufficient observational coverage such as the western China. JRA-55 shows good agreement with the observation in both spatial patterns and magnitudes of extreme temperature changes. Both ERA and 20CR show weaker consistency with the observation, particularly in western China, mainly due to less observational constraints in data assimilation. The different aerosol data used in reanalysis assimilation systems also influenced the data quality. Our results indicate that while the reanalyses can serve as useful substitutes to fill in the observational gaps, cautious should be taken in regions with sparse observations and large anthropogenic aerosol emissions.","[Zhao, Siyao; Zhou, Tianjun; Chen, Xiaolong] Inst Atmospher Phys, Chinese Acad Sciences, LASG, Beijing, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Siyao; Zhou, Tianjun] Univ Chinese Acad Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Tianjun] Chinese Acad Sciences, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Inst Atmospher Phys, Chinese Acad Sciences, LASG, Beijing, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sciences, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhoutj@lasg.iap.ac.cn,"ZHOU, Tianjun/C-3195-2012; Chen, Xiaolong/AAO-7147-2020","ZHOU, Tianjun/0000-0002-5829-7279; Chen, Xiaolong/0000-0003-4098-9952",,,,,79,13,13,2,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

The intermodel consensus underlies the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment that rainfall declines are likely and implies that significant climate change adaptation is needed. However, model consensus is not necessarily a good indicator of confidence, especially given that there is an order of magnitude difference in the scale of rainfall decline among models in OND (from <10 mm season(-1) to similar to 100 mm season(-1)), and that the CMIP5 ensemble systematically overestimates present-day OND precipitation over subtropical southern Africa (in some models by a factor of 2). In this paper we investigate the uncertainty in the OND drying signal by evaluating the climate mechanisms that underlie the diversity in model rainfall projections. Models projecting the highest-magnitude drying simulate the largest increases in tropospheric stability over subtropical southern Africa associated with anomalous upper-level subsidence, reduced evaporation, and amplified surface temperature change. Intermodel differences in rainfall projections are in turn related to the large-scale adjustment of the tropical atmosphere to emissions forcing: models with the strongest relative warming of the northern tropical sea surface temperatures compared to the tropical mean warming simulate the largest rainfall declines. The models with extreme rainfall declines also tend to simulate large present-day biases in rainfall and in atmospheric stability, leading the authors to suggest that projections of high-magnitude drying require further critical attention.","[Munday, C.; Washington, R.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Munday, C (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England.",callum.munday@ouce.ox.ac.uk,,"Munday, Callum/0000-0002-6436-5813; Washington, Richard/0000-0003-2521-4614","Met Office CASE studentship [ACR00400]; U.K. Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/L002612/1]; NERC; Department for International Development (DfID) [NE/M020207/1, NE/M017206]; NERC [NE/M020207/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Met Office CASE studentship; U.K. Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Department for International Development (DfID); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The first author is funded through a Met Office CASE studentship (ACR00400) and through the doctoral training partnership of the U.K. Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) (NE/L002612/1).

We studied the uncertainties and challenges for LDN application in Russia as a country with high variability of natural and social-economic conditions. Having a great influence on the political decision-making and institutional politics is one of the challenges, and in this regard we found: (i) in national legislation: inadequate conceptualization of land as a natural entity, and of the processes of land degradation for nonagricultural lands, especially occurring in boreal and arctic regions; (ii) the need for a differentiated approach to establishing LDN baseline for different regions within the country with different causes and trends of degradation revealed through the great territory; (iii) the importance of assessing accumulated degradation risks as the basis for articulating priorities in LDN response hierarchy; (iv) the importance of a differentiated approach for selecting time intervals for determining the LDN baseline, taking into account long-term natural and socioeconomic processes. Despite the well-established State Land Monitoring system in Russia, these circumstances identify the following tasks required to achieve LDN objectives: (i) zoning of the country's territory in accordance with the classification of like for like exchanges in various biophysical and socio-economic conditions; (ii) considering the role of natural restoration processes in the planning of LDN activities in natural and managed systems. Principles that appear important for developing national LDN policy are: close interaction with climate change adaptation programs, detailed land degradation assessment for non-agricultural lands, keeping administrative division of territory as the basis for LDN spatial monitoring.","[Kust, German; Andreeva, Olga; Lobkovskiy, Vasiliy; Telnova, Natalya] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geog, Staromonetniy 29, Moscow 119017, Russia; [Andreeva, Olga] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Moscow 119991, Russia","Institute of Geography, Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences; Lomonosov Moscow State University","Kust, G (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geog, Staromonetniy 29, Moscow 119017, Russia.",gkust@yandex.com,"Kust, German/G-3979-2017; Andreeva, Olga/C-8657-2012; Telnova, Natalia/AAB-8179-2020; Lobkovsky, Vasiliy/J-1440-2018","Kust, German/0000-0002-1327-6546; Andreeva, Olga/0000-0002-0764-0903; Telnova, Natalia/0000-0002-7263-6409; Lobkovsky, Vasiliy/0000-0001-9138-0739","Russian Science Foundation [18-17-00178]; Institute of Geography RAS [01201352471, 01201352481]; Ministry of Natural Resources of the Russian Federation [NI -10-23/66]; Moscow Lomonosov State University [116022510015-8]; Russian Science Foundation [18-17-00178] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation",Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); Institute of Geography RAS; Ministry of Natural Resources of the Russian Federation; Moscow Lomonosov State University; Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),"The article was developed within the project of Russian Science Foundation # 18-17-00178 Development of a fundamental concept of Land Degradation Neutrality for assessing the effectiveness of sustainable land management and climate change adaptation, and also has been partly supported by the scientific programs of the Institute of Geography RAS #01201352471 and #01201352481, Task for expert and analytical work NI -10-23/66 by the Ministry of Natural Resources of the Russian Federation, and the scientific program of the Moscow Lomonosov State University # 116022510015-8.",,50,12,17,2,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Based on a qualitative literature review that is complemented by an experimental learning lab, we sketch the patterns and core conceptual trajectories of the mindfulness-sustainability relationship. In addition, we assess this relationship within the field of climate change adaptation and risk reduction. The results highlight that notions such as 'sustainability from within', 'ecological mindfulness', 'organizational mindfulness', and 'contemplative practices' have been neglected in sustainability science and teaching. Whilst little sustainability research addresses mindfulness, there is scientific support for its positive influence on: (1) subjective well-being; (2) the activation of (intrinsic/ non-materialistic) core values; (3) consumption and sustainable behavior; (4) the human-nature connection; (5) equity issues; (6) social activism; and (7) deliberate, flexible, and adaptive responses to climate change. Most research relates to post-disaster risk reduction, although it is limited to the analysis of mindfulness-related interventions on psychological resilience. Broader analyses and foci are missing. In contrast, mindfulness is gaining widespread recognition in practice (e.g., by the United Nations, governmental and non-governmental organizations). It is concluded that mindfulness can contribute to understanding and facilitating sustainability, not only at the individual level, but sustainability at all scales, and should, thus, become a core concept in sustainability science, practice, and teaching. More research that acknowledges positive emotional connections, spirituality, and mindfulness in particular is called for, acknowledging that (1) the micro and macro are mirrored and interrelated, and (2) non-material causation is part of sustainability. This paper provides the first comprehensive framework for contemplative scientific inquiry, practice, and education in sustainability.","[Wamsler, Christine; Brossmann, Johannes; Hendersson, Heidi; Kristjansdottir, Rakel; McDonald, Colin; Scarampi, Phil] Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Wamsler, C (corresponding author), Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden.",christine.wamsler@lucsus.lu.se,,,,,,,154,103,103,7,76,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1862-4065,1862-4057,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

However, the promotion of EbA projects, by development agencies and conservation NGOs, remains blurry as it has not yet been contrasted against evidence on its effectiveness in delivering these benefits. Employing a political ecology perspective, the applied conceptual framework allows for the assessment of the social benefits and costs that EbA projects generate or reinforce and factors that influence the distribution of these social benefits or costs. This research is done in regards to two EbA projects in Colombia: one in the Andes focusing on water provision services from paramos, and the other in a coastal mangrove focusing on regulation services of extreme coastal events. Based on data collected by a qualitative multi-method approach, we find evidence that the assessed EbA projects generate a wide range of perceived social benefits and costs for the local communities living in the vicinity of the project sites. Furthermore, we identify agent-level (i.e., capitals and preferences) as well as structural factors (communication, participation, local and institutional context) that influence the generation and distribution of those social benefits and costs. Finally, this paper illustrates some of the contradictions and tensions in which EbA projects are implemented and how they may end up affecting the adaptive capacity of the communities involved in EbA projects.","[Richerzhagen, Carmen; de Francisco, Jean Carlo Rodriguez; Weinsheimer, Felix; Doehnert, Alessandro; Kleiner, Lukas; Mayer, Marjam; Morawietz, Julia; Philipp, Eric] DIE, German Dev Inst, Tulpenfeld 6, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE),"Richerzhagen, C; de Francisco, JCR (corresponding author), DIE, German Dev Inst, Tulpenfeld 6, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",Carmen.Richerzhagen@die-gdi.de; Jean.Rodriguez@die-gdi.de,,"Rodriguez-de-Francisco, Jean Carlo/0000-0002-7386-8404",,,,,41,4,4,2,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1661-7827,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

In this article, we explore the politics around pursuits of adaptiveness in water management, emphasizing the major transboundary river basins draining the south and eastern Himalayas. We look at two main functions: storing, diverting and sharing water for periods of scarcity; protecting people and places from destructive floods. We find that the pursuit of adaptiveness will take place partly outside the range of human experience in a context of large differences in exposure and vulnerabilities, disparate interests and unequal power. Anticipatory policies and actions to adapt and improve adaptive capacity to the transboundary impacts of changes in water-use, land-use and climate on water resources and services are still in their infancy; but several problem-framing discourses are emerging that have longer-term implications for water governance. It is not yet clear how these competing policy-frames will evolve in Asia. Much will depend on how systems of water governance develop. Public scrutiny of how governments in Asia plan to adapt to climate change in the water sector-on how risks of not enough and too much water are dealt with-will need to continue to help sort out those projects and strategies which are driven primarily by political benefits from those which actually contribute to building adaptive capacities and maintaining social-ecological resilience.","[Lebel, Louis; Bastakoti, Ram C.] Chiang Mai Univ, Unit Social & Environm Res, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Xu, Jianchu] Kunming Inst Bot, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jianchu] World Agroforestry Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Bastakoti, Ram C.] Asian Inst Technol, Bangkok 10501, Pathumthani, Thailand; [Lamba, Amrita] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Ctr Study Law & Governance, New Delhi 110067, India","Chiang Mai University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS; Asian Institute of Technology; Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi","Lebel, L (corresponding author), Chiang Mai Univ, Unit Social & Environm Res, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.",louis@sea-user.org,"Xu, Jianchu/Y-2890-2019; Lebel, Louis/D-4130-2014","Lebel, Louis/0000-0001-6187-6418; Bastakoti, Ram C/0000-0003-2456-5420",,,,,114,21,21,2,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

This paper is based on the GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform and multi-source remote sensing data; the authors quantitatively extracted rice production distribution data in China from 1990 to 2019, analysed the evolution pattern of rice distribution and clusters and explored the driving effects between climatic and environmental conditions on the evolution of rice production distribution using the non-parametric quantile regression model. The results show that: The spatial variation of rice distribution is significant, mainly concentrated in the northeast, south and southwest regions of China; the distribution of rice in the northeast is expanding, while the distribution of rice in the south is extending northward, showing a spatial evolution trend of north rising and south retreating. The positive effect of precipitation on the spatial distribution of rice has a significant threshold. This shows that when precipitation is greater than 800 mm, there is a significant positive effect on the spatial distribution of rice production, and this effect will increase with precipitation increases. Climate change may lead to a continuous northward shift in the extent of rice production, especially extending to the northwest of China. This paper's results will help implement more spatially targeted climate change adaptation measures for rice to cope with the changes in food production distribution caused by climate change.","[Wang, Guogang; Huang, Shengnan; Zhao, Sicheng] Chinses Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Dev, Beijing 100089, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yongxiang] China Agr Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100089, Peoples R China; [Han, Chengji] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100089, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Zhang, YX (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100089, Peoples R China.",noahzhang@cau.edu.cn,,"Han, Chengji/0000-0001-5735-8896","National Social Science Foundation of China [21ZDA056, 41871184]; Science and Technology Innovation Project of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences [10-IAED-01-2022]",National Social Science Foundation of China; Science and Technology Innovation Project of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,"This research was funded by Major Projects of the National Social Science Foundation of China: 21ZDA056, National Natural Science Foundation of China: 41871184, Science and Technology Innovation Project of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences: 10-IAED-01-2022.",,49,0,0,10,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

To address this issue, a single fixed large investment can be divided into two or more sequential investments. This reduces the initial investment cost and adds flexibility about the size and timing of subsequent investment decisions. This flexibility enables future investment decisions to be made when further information about the magnitude of climate change becomes available. This paper presents a real option analysis framework to evaluate adaptations including flexibility to reduce both the risk and uncertainty of climate change, against increasing coastal flooding due to sea-level rise as an example. The paper considers (i) how to design the sequence of adaptation options under growing risk of sea-level rise, and (ii) how to make the efficient use of flexibility included in adaptations for addressing uncertainty. A set of flexibilities (i.e. wait or future growth) are incorporated into single-stage investments (i.e. raising coastal defence from 2.5 mAOD to 3.5mAOD or 4.0 mAOD) in stages so that multiple-stage adaptations with different heights are created. The proposed method compares these sequentially growing adaptations in economic terms, including optimisation, providing additional information on the efficiency of flexible adaptation strategies given the uncertainty of climate change. The results from the evaluation enable decision-makers to identify long-lasting robust adaptation against the uncertainty of climate change.","[Kim, Myung-Jin] Minist Oceans & Fisheries, Div Busan North Port Redev, Se Jong City, South Korea; [Nicholls, Robert J.] Univ East Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Preston, John M.] Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Phys Sci, Transportat Res Grp, Southampton, Hants, England; [De Almeida, Gustavo A.] Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Phys Sci, Water Management Res Grp, Southampton, Hants, England",University of East Anglia; University of Southampton; University of Southampton,"Kim, MJ (corresponding author), Minist Oceans & Fisheries, Div Busan North Port Redev, Se Jong City, South Korea.",mk3g14@soton.ac.uk,"Nicholls, Robert James/G-3898-2010","Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109","School of Engineering, University of Southampton (UK)","School of Engineering, University of Southampton (UK)","This research is supported by the School of Engineering, University of Southampton (UK).",,43,0,0,2,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Distributional changes of monthly rainfall showed downward convergent lines are dominant in peak monsoon months of June, July and August at 28%, 50% and 28% stations, respectively, followed by horizontally divergent lines at 17% of stations during those months. The dominating category of last monsoon month (September) rainfall was found upward divergent lines at 50% stations. The results revealed a decrease in many rainfall quantiles from June to August and increase in September in most of the stations. The increasing trend lines of September rainfall quantiles were found to become more diverse with time, which indicates an increase in rainfall extremes and the possibility of more floods which are already very common in the last month of monsoon in Bangladesh. The decrease in lower quantiles of rainfall in most of the monsoon months may cause an increase in the probability of droughts in the country.

The guidelines are arranged under three headings: foundational, design and construction, and supporting sustainability in the long term. Under foundational, we address the need for co-operation with end users of decision-support resources, the contribution these resources can make to the formation of thriving communities of practice, and the match between the different types of decision support and user needs. Under design and construction, we point to the risk that policy settings will change over the multiple years required to build and publish complex decision-support resources, reducing the relevance of the final product. We discuss the need for innovative approaches to ensure visibility, credibility and hence uptake. Developers should be mindful of the requirements, resources and capabilities of potential users at all points in the design and build. We also suggest that decision-support resources may be transferable between sectors and locations, but the motivation should be around achieving excellence, and not just cost savings. Under supporting sustainability in the long term, we stress the need for evaluation and comparative studies of performance, leading to carefully documented updating and improvement of decision-support resources.

The increase in SOC is of special interest in these systems, as it can help to build resilience for climate change adaptation while contributing to mitigate global warming through the sequestration of atmospheric carbon (C). We compared SOC change and C sequestration under a number of recommended management practices (RMPs) with neighboring conventional plots under Mediterranean climate (174 data sets from 79 references). The highest response in C sequestration was achieved by those practices applying largest amounts of C inputs (land treatment and organic amendments). Conservation tillage practices (no-tillage and reduced tillage) induced lower effect sizes but significantly promoted C sequestration, whereas no effect and negative net sequestration rates were observed for slurry applications and unfertilized treatments, respectively. Practices combining external organic amendments with cover crops or conservation tillage (combined management practices and organic management) showed very good performance in C sequestration. We studied separately the changes in SOC under organic management, with 80 data sets from 30 references. The results also suggest that the degree of intensification in C input rate is the main driver behind the relative C accumulation in organic treatments. Thus, highest net C sequestration rates were observed in most eco-intensive groups, such as irrigated, horticulture and controlled experiments (plot scale). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Some commentators have argued that slowing population growth is necessary to reduce further rises in carbon emissions. Others have objected that this would give rise to dehumanizing population control programmes in developing countries. Yet the perspective of the developing countries that will be worst affected by climate change has been almost completely ignored by the scientific literature. This deficit is addressed by this paper, which analyses the first 40 National Adaptation Programmes of Action reports submitted by governments of least-developed countries to the Global Environment Facility for funding. Of these documents, 93% identified at least one of three ways in which demographic trends interact with the effects of climate change: (i) faster degradation of the sources of natural resources; (ii) increased demand for scarce resources; and (iii) heightened human vulnerability to extreme weather events. These findings suggest that voluntary access to family planning services should be made more available to poor communities in least-developed countries. We stress the distinction between this approach, which prioritizes the welfare of poor communities affected by climate change, and the argument that population growth should be slowed to limit increases in global carbon emissions. The paper concludes by calling for increased support for rights-based family planning services, including those integrated with HIV/AIDS services, as an important complementary measure to climate change adaptation programmes in developing countries.","[Bryant, Leo] Marie Stopes Int, London W1T GLP, England; [Carver, Louise] Populat Sustainabil Network, London, England; [Butler, Colin D.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Anage, Ababu] Populat Hlth & Environm Network, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Australian National University,"Bryant, L (corresponding author), Marie Stopes Int, 1 Conway St, London W1T GLP, England.",leo.bryant@mariestopes.org.uk,"Butler, Colin D./H-2267-2019","Butler, Colin D./0000-0002-2942-5294",,,,,23,40,42,0,16,WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION,GENEVA 27,"MARKETING AND DISSEMINATION, CH-1211 GENEVA 27, SWITZERLAND",0042-9686,,,B WORLD HEALTH ORGAN,Bull.

Decision-makers from local to national scales will be tasked with planning under conditions of high uncertainty, often with minimal data. Participatory scenario planning is a method for devising adaptation strategies under high uncertainty, and we hypothesized that it could also be used for identifying systemic, inclusive, and transformative adaptation options at the community scale, and for highlighting opportunities for cross-scalar collaboration. We conducted scenario exercises with two communities in southeastern Nigeria that have experienced increasing flooding and other challenges linked to climate variability. Both communities identified drivers of change that intersect with climate, as well as community-scale actions that would improve adaptation to a range of future scenarios. We found evidence that scenario exercises can stimulate communities to develop transformative approaches to climate adaptation that seek to reduce climate risk by creating new systems and processes. We also found that community-identified priorities for strategic action highlight how larger-scale interventions could coordinate with communities to adapt more effectively. Participatory scenario planning is therefore a potentially important tool for adaptation planning in regions in which future conditions are highly uncertain.","[Olabisi, Laura Schmitt] Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Onyeneke, Robert Ugochukwu] Alex Ekwueme Fed Univ Ndufu Alike, Dept Agr, Agr Econ & Extens Programme, Ikwo 482131, Ebonyi State, Nigeria; [Choko, Onyinye Prince; Aiyeloja, Adedapo Ayo] Univ Port Harcourt, Dept Forestry & Wildlife Management, Port Harcourt 500272, Nigeria; [Chiemela, Stella Nwawulu; Achike, Anthonia Ifeyinwa] Univ Nigeria, Dept Agr Econ, Nsukka 410001, Nigeria; [Liverpool-Tasie, Lenis Saweda O.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University; University of Port Harcourt; University of Nigeria; Michigan State University,"Olabisi, LS (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",schmi420@msu.edu; robert.onyeneke@funai.edu.ng; chokonyinye@gmail.com; stella.chiemela@unn.edu.ng; lliverp@msu.edu; anthonia.achike@unn.edu.ng; aiyeloja@uniport.edu.ng,"Onyeneke, Robert/AAS-6211-2021; Aiyeloja, Adedapo/HMO-8847-2023","Onyeneke, Robert/0000-0002-9242-901X; Schmitt Olabisi, Laura/0000-0002-6557-9469; Liverpool-Tasie, Lenis/0000-0002-2990-5888",United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Feed the Future initiative; Michigan State University AgBioResearch,United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Feed the Future initiative(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Michigan State University AgBioResearch,This research is made possible by the generous support of the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Feed the Future initiative.

Climate change is projected to have a gradual exacerbating effect on Amman's water stress over the next century, and water resources management strategies and policies put in place now will likely influence water use patterns for generations to come. A multistage decision model allows the identification of both adaptation strategies that should be implemented now and actions likely to be needed later, depending on future climate and demographic conditions. For Amman, the model recommends that household water reuse be expanded immediately, large-scale wastewater reclamation begin within 25 years, and mega-scale water import projects be postponed for several decades. Although these recommendations for the future will almost certainly change as additional information is acquired, by identifying now the actions most likely to be needed in the future, options for their implementation can be reserved, and feasibility studies begun.

Exploring the potentials of an interplay between settlement patterns and water management,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Water management; Low-cost housing; Bogota; Landscape urbanism,,"A paradigm shift in water management is recognized as a necessary and fundamental step for adaptation to climate change and crucial for furthering sustainability. In contexts of rapid urbanization, this paradigm shift is particularly challenged since social and environmental needs often come into conflict. In Bogota, as other Latin-American cities, demands for new housing are increasing daily, while the overall housing deficit remains an unresolved problem. Currently, the city faces the challenges to deal with the pressure to continue to urbanize flood prone areas with low-cost housing projects and simultaneously protect these areas in view of flooding, which promise to increase with the predictions of climate change. In order to contribute to context-responsive solutions to the water and housing issues, this paper investigates the shifting relations between settlement patterns, water infrastructure and landscape in Bogota's El Tintal watershed. This sub-watershed of the Bogota River has a rich history of formal and informal low-cost housing. The critical reading of the landscape transformation of the El Tintal has shown how the water system interventions were and can be instrumental in different stages of development. This reading was the base to elaborate design investigations that could translate to spatial adaptation measures. This paper argues that soft water management tools can be part of a twofold strategy to create spatial quality and provide resilience for more qualitative future urban development.

In this paper, a probabilistic approach is used to estimate the uncertainties and simulate impacts of global warming on wheat production and water use in the main wheat cultivation regions of China, with a global mean temperature (GMT) increase scale relative to 1961-90 values. From output of 20 climate scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Data Distribution Centre, median values of projected changes in monthly mean climate variables for representative stations are adapted. These are used to drive the Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES)-Wheat model to simulate wheat production and water use under baseline and global warming scenarios, with and without consideration of carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization effects. Results show that, because of temperature increase, projected wheat-growing periods for GMT changes of 1 degrees, 2 degrees, and 3 degrees C would shorten, with averaged median values of 3.94%, 6.90%, and 9.67%, respectively. There is a high probability of decreasing (increasing) changes in yield and water-use efficiency under higher temperature scenarios without (with) consideration of CO2 fertilization effects. Elevated CO2 concentration generally compensates for the negative effects of warming temperatures on production. Moreover, positive effects of elevated CO2 concentration on grain yield increase with warming temperatures. The findings could be critical for climate-change-driven agricultural production that ensures global food security.","[Liu, Yujie; Tao, Fulu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Tao, FL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Datun Rd 11A, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",taofl@igsnrr.ac.cn,,"Tao, F/0000-0001-8574-0080",National Science Foundation of China [41071030]; National Key Technology RD Program [2012BAC19B01]; National Key Program for Developing Basic Science of China [2010CB950902]; Hundred Talents'' Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; China Ecosystem Research Network,National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Technology RD Program(National Key Technology R&D Program); National Key Program for Developing Basic Science of China; Hundred Talents'' Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); China Ecosystem Research Network,This study was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (41071030) and was partly supported by the National Key Technology R&D Program (Project 2012BAC19B01) and the National Key Program for Developing Basic Science (Project 2010CB950902) of China.

In particular, systems that aim at evaluating impacts of climatic change on large spatial and temporal scales cannot be based on the assumption that infrastructure, economy, demography and other human factors remain constant while physical boundary conditions change. Therefore, any meaningful simulation of possible future scenarios needs to enable socio-economic systems to react and to adapt to climatic changes. To achieve this it is necessary to simulate decision-making processes of the relevant actors in a way which is adequate for the scale, the catchment specific management problems to be investigated and finally the data availability. This contribution presents the DEEPACTOR approach for representing such human decision processes, which makes use of a multi-actor simulation framework and has similarities to agent-based approaches. This DEEPACTOR approach is embedded in DANUBIA, a coupled simulation system comprising 16 individual models to simulate Global Change impacts on the entire water cycle of the Upper Danube Catchment (Germany, 77,000 km(2)). The applicability of DANUBIA and in particular the DEEPACTOR approach for treating the socio-economic part of the water cycle in a process-based way is demonstrated by means of concrete simulation models of the water supply sector and of the domestic water users. Results from scenario simulations are used to demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of the approach. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Study focus Creating adaptation plans for projected imbalances in the western U.S. agricultural water demand-supply system are difficult given uncertainty in climate projections. It is critical to understand the uncertainties and vulnerabilities of the regional agricultural system and hydrologic impacts of climate change adaptation. We applied a stochastic, integrated hydro-economic model that simulates land and water allocations to analyse Montana farmer adaptations to a range of projected climate conditions and the response of the hydrologic system to those adaptations. Satellite observations of crop types, productivity, water use, and land allocation were used for model calibration. A suite of climate models was employed to quantify end-of-century impacts on streamflows, water and land use, production, and net revenues.New hydrological insights for the region Simulations showed summer streamflows were influenced by a state-wide 18.2% increase in agricultural water use. Decreased summer water availability with increased demand could have far reaching impacts downstream. Land use for irrigated crops increased 1.6%, while rainfed crops decreased 6.5%, implying state-level decrease in planted area. Even with increased land and water use for irrigated crops, production decreased 0.5%, while rainfed production decreased 2.7%. Corresponding losses in net revenues totaled 1.5% and 7.2% for irrigated and rainfed crops, respectively.Results highlight vulnerabilities of semi-arid agricultural regions and can aid water managers in sustaining agriculture in these regions.","[Lauffenburger, Zachary H.; Maneta, Marco P.] Univ Montana, Dept Geosci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Cobourn, Kelly M.] Virginia Tech, Dept Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Maneta, Marco P.; Jencso, Kelsey; Chaffin, Brian; Crockett, Anna; Kimball, John S.] Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Missoula, MT USA; [Maxwell, Bruce] Montana State Univ, Land Resources & Environm Sci, Bozeman, MT USA",University of Montana System; University of Montana; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University of Montana System; University of Montana; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman,"Lauffenburger, ZH (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Dept Geosci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",zachary1.lauffenburger@umontana.edu; marco.maneta@mso.umt.edu; kellyc13@vt.edu; kelsey.jencso@umontana.edu; brian.chaffin@umontana.edu; anna.crockett@umconnect.umt.edu; bmax@montana.edu; john.kimball@umontana.edu,,,"NASA EPSCoR [USDA-NIFA [2016 -67026-25067]]; MITRE Cropland Climate [80NSSC18M0025]; University of Montana BRIDGES program through funding from the National Science Foundation [1160380]; Montana Water Center through funding from the USGS 104b Water Resources Research program [DGE-1633831, OIA-1920938, OIA-1738857]",NASA EPSCoR(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); MITRE Cropland Climate; University of Montana BRIDGES program through funding from the National Science Foundation; Montana Water Center through funding from the USGS 104b Water Resources Research program,"This work was conducted at the University of Montana with support from the following grants: USDA-NIFA [2016 -67026-25067] , NASA EPSCoR [80NSSC18M0025] , and MITRE Cropland Climate [1160380] .

This study assesses the risks associated with climate change vulnerability, adaptation techniques used by young smallholder farmers to ease its adverse effects on agriculture. A dataset of 600 randomly selected respondents was collected using the household survey method from Gulu, Kitgum, Pader, Amuru, Nwoya, and Lamwo districts. Finding reveals droughts, increased temperature, pests and diseases, degradation, and poor socioeconomic conditions as the main determinants of climate change. The main adaptation measures revealed were changing crop types, planting early-maturing crops, crop rotation, mixed cropping, and livelihood diversification. Lack of knowledge and information, poverty, inadequate governmental support, limited agricultural extension, insufficient financial capital, illiteracy, and markets were the main constraints hindering access and adoption of advanced adaptation measures. This research provides useful insights and evidence for policy implementation on household farm-level climate change vulnerability, adaptation measures, and risk perceptions in absorbing, adapting, and transforming from climate shocks and threats. The analysis implies that the government should provide agricultural extension services on climate vulnerability and adaptation measures, access to market, financial credits, knowledge and information, accessible livelihoods assets, and end-to-land grabbing. Overall, our results recommend that government authorities and relevant stakeholders integrate and implement climate change adaptation policies at local government operations to ease the vulnerability of smallholder farmers and augment their climate change absorptive, adaptive, and transformative abilities.","[Twecan, Dalson; Wang, Weiguang; Xu, Junzeng] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Twecan, Dalson; Wang, Weiguang] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Xu, Junzeng] Hohai Univ, Coll Agr Engn, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Mohmmed, Alnail] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Resources, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Twecan, Dalson] Int Inst Trop Agr, POB 7878, Kampala, Uganda",Hohai University; Hohai University; Hohai University; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Twecan, D (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.",D.Twecan@cgiar.org; wangweiguang2016@126.com; jz481@hhu.edu.cn; nail_kajawy@yahoo.com,,"Mohmmed, Alnail/0000-0003-4395-2127",China Scholarship Council (CSC) [2018DFJ001964],China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council),"This study is part of a PhD research for Dalson Twecan at the College of Hydrology and Water Resources, Hohai University, Nanjing, 210098, China, and the State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering, Hohai University, Nanjing, 210098, China.

However, it remains unclear how different governance processes can coordinate competing resource uses despite incoherence of institutional resource regimes. This paper examines how institutional resource regimes and polycentric governance processes are co-evolving and to what extent these processes coordinate competing resource uses in incoherent resource regimes. Empirically, we performed an embedded case study of the institutional resource regime and governance processes of three water reservoir projects with contrasting outcomes in the region of Oberhasli in the canton of Berne, Switzerland, covering a timeframe starting from the early 20th century. Data were collected through 21 semi-structured interviews, document analysis, participatory observation, and transect walks. Analytically, we demonstrate how the combination of the Institutional Resource Regime and polycentric governance frameworks provides an opportunity to analyze co-evolving resource regimes and governance processes. The results show that the institutional resource regime has become increasingly incoherent over the past decades, but the evolution of polycentric processes to govern competing water uses compensated for regime incoherence. Polycentric governance improved the coordination of water uses, if mutual adjustment, trust and activation of overarching rules between actors with similar and opposing interests were present. We conclude that institutional regime incoherence may constitute a critical barrier to climate change adaptation, but polycentric governance processes may alleviate critical challenges arising from regime incoherence.","[Kellner, Elke] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Hochschulstr 4, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Kellner, Elke; Oberlack, Christoph; Gerber, Jean-David] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Hallerstr 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Oberlack, Christoph] Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, Bern, Switzerland; [Gerber, Jean-David] Univ Bern, Ctr Reg Econ Dev, Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern; University of Bern; University of Bern; University of Bern,"Kellner, E (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Hallerstr 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",elke.kellner@giub.unibe.ch,"Londe, Pedro/AAG-2267-2019","Oberlack, Christoph/0000-0003-2813-7327; Gerber, Jean-David/0000-0001-9111-9071; Kellner, Elke/0000-0003-2474-0938",Dr. Alfred Bretscher Fund for Environmental and Air Pollution,Dr. Alfred Bretscher Fund for Environmental and Air Pollution,Financial support by a research grant of the Dr. Alfred Bretscher Fund for Environmental and Air Pollution is gratefully acknowledged.

In this article, we discuss current and potential future energy demand for public buildings air conditioning in the context of climate change. Past and projected future trends of electricity demand for air conditioning in public buildings from 2010 to 2080 have been investigated. Moreover, this paper highlights the fact that the predicted mean temperature using climate change SRES scenario B2 will increase by about 2 degrees C by 2050 which can cause a significant increase in air conditioning energy consumption. This paper then considers the impact of different shading devises and building envelopes characteristics on the demand for air-conditioning in Burkina Faso public buildings. It is estimated that with climate change, in order to maintain a thermally comfortable 25 degrees C inside public buildings, the projected annual energy consumption will have to increase by 56% and 99% respectively for the period between 2030 to 2049 and 2060 to 2079 compared to the base situation (energy consumption between 2010 and 2029). Moreover, the results have shown that shading devices could reduce the cooling load by up to 40%. Therefore shading devices could play a significant role in climate change adaptation in the built environment for Burkina Faso. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

For many reasons, communities are not well connected to formal scientific and policy processes. Knowledge system approaches that analyse how knowledge and information is generated, shared, negotiated and transformed into policy partly explain why the knowledge, preferences and perspectives of the poor are not fully taken into account.

We narrow this knowledge gap by modelling adaptation as a three-stage process where a farmer sequentially decides: (i) whether there is a need for adaptation; (ii) whether there are constraints that prevent adaptation; and (iii) whether such constraints are removed through government support. We develop a triple-hurdle model to describe this decision-making process and empirically estimate the impact of government support using a rural household survey from Guangdong Province, China. It is found that government support is positively associated with raising the odds of adaptation by about one quarter. This magnitude is larger than the estimates in recent literature, suggesting government support is more effective for farmers bound by constraints. Therefore, for cost-effective policy outcomes there is a need to identify the constraints and the farmers facing them.","[Xu, Ying] Univ Adelaide, Ctr Global Food & Resources, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Findlay, Christopher] Univ Adelaide, Fac Profess, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide,"Xu, Y (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Ctr Global Food & Resources, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",ying.xu03@adclaidc.edu.au,,"Xu, Ying/0000-0001-5329-3597",Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research [ADP/2011/039],Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research,"This work was funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research under the project 'Assessing Farmer Responses to Climate Change-Adjustment Policy Options' (ADP/2011/039).

Given the fact that climatic events are projected to become more pervasive, it is necessary to address the resilience of rural households and their complementary choices for adaptation to climate change. Despite raising awareness about the need for enhancing climate resilience among the farm families of developing countries, little is known about the factors that influence their resilience to climate change. Therefore, a survey research was conducted in northeast Iran to serve as a case study in a developing country. A multistage stratified random sampling technique was used to investigate the climate resilience of 224 farm families. While the results revealed low, moderate, and high levels of climate resilience, most farm families were found unable to endure climatic stressors. To enhance climate resilience, most farmers had adopted a combination of absorptive and adaptive measures. Anticipative and transformative measures were less practiced. Age, adaptation strategies, household size, ownership, response efficacy and income were the main drivers of the resilience of farm families to climate extremes. To increase the rural households' resilience against climate change, planning appropriate resilience-building initiatives, designing efficient preventive, absorptive, adaptive and transformative strategies, providing fair technical and financial supports, and increasing rural households' knowledge and information for sustainable management of farms are required.","[Keshavarz, Marzieh] Payame Noor Univ, Dept Agr, POB 19395-3697, Tehran, Iran; [Moqadas, Reihaneh Soltani] Payame Noor Univ, Dept Geog, Tehran, Iran",Payame Noor University; Payame Noor University,"Keshavarz, M (corresponding author), Payame Noor Univ, Dept Agr, POB 19395-3697, Tehran, Iran.",keshavarzmarzieh@pnu.ac.ir; r.soltani@pnu.ac.ir,"Keshavarz, Marzieh/CAF-2592-2022; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Marzieh, Keshavarz/0000-0002-0284-5635",,,,,43,12,12,7,73,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0140-1963,1095-922X,,J ARID ENVIRON,J.

In hot and dry climates, this concern makes it necessary to find a practical solution to adapt to climate change. Rapidly developed cities with large populations, due to ignoring the creation of UHI in planning, mostly have fallen into severe trouble. So, finding the influence of decisions' impacts on urban climate before implementing them would inform planners about the consequences of their decisions. Advanced 3D-4D numerical models like ENVI-met are becoming a frequent way of investigating climatic impacts of decisions and regulations. However, full-scale modeling of a neighborhood or a city cannot be widely possible at present. Therefore, a practical solution is simplification of small-scale models to calculate the consequences of decisions in developments. In this study, we systematically propose some solutions for cooling urban neighborhoods, and then, after analyzing them, possible scenarios for UHI mitigation are presented. The goal is to find the most effective urban form and design strategies across a typical range of Tehran urban development at a high-density urban fabric. Our results provide insight into the impact of urban form and design on microclimate in hotter and drier future cities by considering water shortage and utilizing mitigation strategies.","[Ramyar, Reza; Bryant, Margaret] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Ramyar, Reza; Zarghami, Esmaeil] Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training Univ, Tehran, Iran",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry; Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training University (SRTTU),"Ramyar, R (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",rramyar@esf.edu,"ramyar, reza/AAF-4864-2019","Zarghami, Esmaeil/0000-0002-2398-3041; Ramyar, Reza/0000-0003-1847-5891",,,,,59,27,27,4,47,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

Hence, in rural areas the main challenges are the means of living and food production, whereas, in urban contexts climate change should decrease heath conditions and quality of life. This research seeks to analyse and evaluate trends and perspectives of climate change in Colombia in the last decade using qualitative and quantitative methods that allow to determine whether in this country climate governance has contributed to the mitigation and adaptation to climate change, especially in vulnerable areas that are more likely to poverty. Results indicate that in the up coming 15 years in the most areas of the country the temperature will increase 1 degrees C which should undermine development especially in poor and rural areas. Despite quite a climate governance, it is necessary to strength its application and to raise awareness about importance to promote sustainable development from housing to the productive sector to achieve mitigation and adaptation to decrease and control risks by new weather conditions.

A critical near-term question is how investments in reducing climate damages should be allocated across these elements of a climate policy portfolio, especially in the face of uncertainty in both future climate damages and also the effectiveness of yet-untested adaptation efforts. We build on recent efforts in DICE-based integrated assessment modeling approaches that include two types of adaptation-short-lived flow spending and long-lived depreciable adaptation stock investments-along with mitigation, and we identify and explore the uncertainties that impact the relative proportions of policies within a response portfolio. We demonstrate that the relative ratio of flow adaptation, stock adaptation, and mitigation depend critically on interactions among: 1) the relative effectiveness in the baseline of stock versus flow adaptation, 2) the degree of substitutability between stock and flow adaptation types, and 3) whether there exist physical limits on the amount of damages that can be reduced by flow-type adaptation investments. The results indicate where more empirical research on adaptation could focus to best inform near-term policy decisions, and provide a first step towards considering near-term policies that are flexible in the face of uncertainty.","[Felgenhauer, Tyler] US EPA, Off Res & Dev, Energy & Climate Assessment Team, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA; [Webster, Mort] MIT, Engn Syst Div, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Felgenhauer, T (corresponding author), US EPA, Off Res & Dev, Energy & Climate Assessment Team, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA.",felgenhauer.tyler@epa.gov,"Felgenhauer, Tyler/W-8380-2019","Felgenhauer, Tyler/0000-0001-9122-0444",Joseph L.

Sub-district no.7 of District no.1 of Tehran was selected as the study area. First, to evaluate the energy resilience of 250 blocks of the study area, 28 indicators in four components of urban geometry and morphology, land use, public transportation, and passive design were adopted. Subsequently, using a hybrid factor analysis and analytic network process (F'ANP) model, flexibility, interdependence, coordination capacity, equity, efficiency, self organization, independence, and diversity were determined as the eight underlying energy resilience principles related to the spatial structure of the study area. The composite index results reveal that principles and indicators related to transportation have a more significant role in energy resilience than operational energy related ones. Also, increasing compactness without simultaneous attention to the mass-space ratio and adequate provision of green spaces does not necessarily lead to increased energy resilience and may even detract from resilience. To illustrate the practical implications of the study findings, we recommend action plans that can contribute to enhancing the energy resilience of the study area. The proposed globally applicable framework is expected to give urban planners a better understanding ofurban form and spatial structure implicationsfor energy resilience.

These projects are costly, and differences in property owners' returns from maintaining wide beaches will influence community-level support for investment in shoreline defense. One way to account for these differences is by funding the project through a tax instrument that imposes the heaviest cost on residents who benefit most from beach nourishment. Some communities along the US east coast have adopted this approach. We use an agent-based model to evaluate how the imposition of project costs affects coastline management over the long-term. Charging higher tax rates on oceanfront properties reduces desired beach width among those owners but increases desired width for owners of inland properties. The aggregate impact on beach width depends on coastline shape and development patterns that determine the balance between these two groups, heterogeneity of beach width preferences and climate change beliefs, and levels of participation in local politics. Overall, requiring property owners who benefit most from beach nourishment to bear the highest cost results in wider beaches. Theresult suggests that delineating tax rates to account for unequal benefits of local public goods across taxpayers could facilitate local investment in climate change adaptation.","[Mullin, Megan; Smith, Martin D.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Mullin, Megan] Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Smith, Martin D.] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [McNamara, Dylan E.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Phys & Phys Oceanog, Wilmington, NC USA",Duke University; Duke University; Duke University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Wilmington,"Mullin, M (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA.;Mullin, M (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",megan.mullin@duke.edu,,,National Science Foundation [CNH 1715638],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research was supported by the National Science Foundation grant CNH 1715638.,,36,87,88,1,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Among those emphasised by the SDGs, some are highly relevant for indigenous groups. Education, poverty, access to justice and climate change are only a few of the issues affecting indigenous people's lives. Yet, indigenous groups are not passive actors. Despite being at the mercy of climate hazards and misleading political decisions, the knowledge system they have developed throughout the centuries has helped them to successfully respond to ecological and development challenges. By exploring indigenous cultures and their knowledge systems in greater depth, this article aims to understand how the sustainable development agenda can benefit from these different forms of traditional knowledge. More particularly, it will attempt to explain the main notions in which traditional knowledge is rooted and analyse means of knowledge maintenance and transmission. It will then explore the relationship between indigenous knowledge, sustainable practices and land and resource management, as well as climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. These ideas will be supported by a discussion on the need to guarantee indigenous people full access to land and justice in order for them to fully realise their rights. The conclusion reflects on the importance of fostering an integrated system of knowledge in which indigenous groups are involved in knowledge sharing practices and decision making processes.","[Magni, Giorgia] UNESCO, IBE, Route Morilllons 15, CH-1218 Geneva, Switzerland",,"Magni, G (corresponding author), UNESCO, IBE, Route Morilllons 15, CH-1218 Geneva, Switzerland.",gm2535@tc.columbia.edu,,,,,,,85,65,66,1,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0141-8211,1465-3435,,EUR J EDUC,Eur.

These indicators include mean high water (MHW), high water line (HWL), and, a number of shoreline features, such as the vegetation line. HWM identifies the landward extent of the ocean and is required for cadastral boundary definition, land-use and infrastructure development along the foreshore,and for planning associated with climate change adaptation. In this paper, shoreline indicators are extracted using an object-oriented image analysis (OOIA) approach. Ten-year hourly swash heights (shoreline excursion length) are fitted into a cumulative distribution function. The probability that swash will reach the various HWM indicators over a 10 y period is then estimated. The spatial continuity distances of the swash probability of HWM indicators are calculated using semivariogram models that measure similarity of swash probability. The spatial continuity distance is defined as the distance between the lower bound of sampling position (the most seaward HWM indicator) and the position where autocorrelation, or the similarity of swash probability of the various MAIM indictors, approaches zero. The latter is considered as the HWM position in this study.

A participatory approach has been used in this study to determine climate change vulnerability, impacts and adaptation aspects for the Kangsabati River basin, India. The study approach involved engaging with stakeholders representing state (sub-national), district and community levels, through an interactive brainstorming method, to understand stakeholder perceptions regarding (a) local characteristics which influence vulnerability, (b) climate change impacts and (c) relevant adaptation options. The study reveals that vulnerability varies across upstream, midstream and downstream sections of the river basin. Suggested adaptation options, in this predominantly agricultural basin, are found to be applicable across spatial scales. Stakeholder perceptions, regarding vulnerability and impacts, vary with the level of interaction, academic background and type of experience. Interaction confirms the notion that stakeholders have inherent knowledge regarding adaptation, reveals their preferences and ability to think unconventionally. We discuss limitations of the approach while demonstrating its ability to deliver locally relevant and acceptable adaptation options, which could facilitate implementation. We conclude that engaging stakeholders at multiple levels was highly effective in assessing locally relevant aspects of climate change vulnerability, impacts and applicable adaptation options in the Kangsabati River basin. Based on this assessment, a sub-basin scale is recommended for evaluating these aspects, especially for water resources and agricultural systems, through multi-level stakeholder input.","[Bhave, Ajay Gajanan; Mishra, Ashok] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Agr & Food Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Groot, Annemarie] Wageningen Univ, Alterra, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; Wageningen University & Research,"Bhave, AG (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Agr & Food Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",ajaybhave84@gmail.com; amishra@agfe.iitkgp.ernet.in; Annemarie.Groot@wur.nl,"Mishra, Ashok/D-6478-2014","Bhave, Ajay/0000-0001-5896-8661",European Commission [227087]; project HighNoon; HighNoon project,European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); project HighNoon; HighNoon project,"This work has been supported by the HighNoon project, funded by the European Commission Framework Programme 7 under Grant Nr. 227087.

Meeting energy needs is always a current issue in Hungary, irrespective of climate change because of the country's high dependency on oil and gas imports, limited opportunities to replace them with domestic production, and the pollution associated with using fossil energy sources. Increasing effectiveness and saving energy can provide relatively short-term solutions with bearable costs and a relatively quick return on investment. The aim of the present paper is to give an overview about the climate and energy policy in Hungary with a special focus on the new energy strategy. Energy policy has a pivotal role in the economic recovery plan of the Hungarian government. The National Energy Strategy 2030 taking shape in Hungary takes climate policy into account with respect to adaptation and mitigation and lists renewable energy sources as the second most important tool for achieving strategic goals. As in most countries, it is also possible in Hungary to introduce climate strategy measures with zero social costs. The expedient management of climate change requires the combination of prevention, adaptation and dissemination initiatives. Strategies must meet a dual requirement: they must face the economic risks associated with premature measures, while also considering the adverse effects of delay.","[Csete, Maria] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Inst Econ, Dept Environm Econ, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Szlavik, Janos] Eszterhazy Karoly Coll, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Inst Econ, Dept Reg & Environm Econ, H-3300 Eger, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics; Eszterhazy Karoly Catholic University,"Csete, M (corresponding author), Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Inst Econ, Dept Environm Econ, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",szlavik@ektf.hu; csete@eik.bme.hu,"Csete, Maria/AAP-1198-2021; Csete, Maria/H-8204-2012","Csete, Maria/0000-0001-7170-9402; ",New Szechenyi Plan [TAMOP-4.2.1/B-09/1/KMR-2010-0002],New Szechenyi Plan,This work is connected to the scientific program of the Development of quality-oriented and harmonized R+D+I strategy and functional model at BME project.

It concludes that: adaptation policies are weakly setted on the political agenda; the choice of policy instruments shapes the agenda; the marginalized agricultural sector creates its own adaptive, acclimatized and disjointed policies from other sectors, reinforcing their marginalization; the policy making of these instruments do not follow a sequential multi-level logic, from the international to the Union, the States and the municipalities; the instruments are not articulated between them, but suggest a sort of tinkering of sectoral policies, each with its own logic and processes.","[Caldas, Eduardo de Lima] Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Massardier, Gilles] CIRAD, Paris, France; [Massardier, Gilles] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA USA",Universidade de Sao Paulo; CIRAD; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Caldas, ED (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",eduardocaldas@usp.br; gilles.massardier@cirad.fr,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,1,REVUES ORG,PARIS,"CENTRE SOCIOLOGIE ORGANISATIONS CSO SCIENCES PO-CNRS, 27 RUE SAINT-GUILLAUME, PARIS, 75007, FRANCE",1958-9212,,,CONFINS,Confins,,2020,46,,,,,,,,,10.4000/confins.31691,http://dx.doi.org/10.4000/confins.31691,,,19,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,PH2XO,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000600282500024,View Full Record in Web of Science

While several studies showed that the morphology and type of living and built elements of urban green spaces greatly affect their performance, a persistent gap between theory and practice continues to pervade the design of green spaces. This study conducts a semi-systematic review of research published in the last decade to investigate to what extent recent research has produced evidence-based outputs relevant to practitioners concerning the design of outdoor urban green spaces in the context of climate adaptation. An innovative design-oriented approach is subsequently applied to critically review evidence-based research outputs considering a comprehensive spectrum of climate impacts and adaptation measures. Our specific objectives are to: i) identify evidence-based research outputs of relevance to practitioners according to type of climatic impact; ii) assess the level of relevance and geographical transferability of such outputs to support the design of urban green spaces; and iii) identify key challenges that might hinder the implementation of evidence-based guidelines. Our results support a call to align research to confront the 'wicked' gap between scientific research and implementation in design practice.","[Graca, Marisa; Cruz, Sara; Monteiro, Ana] Res Ctr Terr Transports & Environm CITTA, Rua Dr Roberto Frias S-N, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal; [Graca, Marisa; Cruz, Sara] Univ Porto, Fac Engn, Rua Dr Roberto Frias S-N, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal; [Monteiro, Ana] Univ Porto, Ctr Studies Geog & Spatial Planning CEGOT, Dept Geog, Via Panoram S-N, P-4150564 Porto, Portugal; [Monteiro, Ana] Univ Porto FLUP, Fac Arts & Humanities, Via Panoram S-N, P-4150564 Porto, Portugal; [Neset, Tina-Simone] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; Linkoping University,"Graca, M (corresponding author), Res Ctr Terr Transports & Environm CITTA, Rua Dr Roberto Frias S-N, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal.",graca.marisa@gmail.com; scruz@fe.up.pt; anamt@letras.up.pt; tina.neset@liu.se,,"Monteiro, Ana/0000-0002-3392-2664; Santos Cruz, Sara/0000-0002-1776-4985; Neset, Tina-Simone/0000-0003-1151-9943",FORMAS (Sweden) [2017-01719]; FCT (Portugal) [ERA4CS/0001/2016]; RCN (Norway); European Union [690462]; NWO (The Netherlands); FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia I.P.

They make it possible to follow the evolution of variables over time, to model exogenous events and adaptive policies and to compute sustainability indicators. Various model types based on different worldviews exist, and they give rise to different indicators. Modellers generally choose only one type of model, limiting the variety of indicators. However, decision-makers, who have to be creative to face global change, need a wider diversity of indicators. The objective of this paper is to show the diversity of insights one can get by using alternative system indicators and their decision implications. We test our very diverse indicators approach and illustrate its results for a population at risk of flooding and a water-basin manager who can help the population implement protection measures. We test many variations, including e.g. viability theory and agent-based modelling, and different indicators of viability, resilience, efficiency and equity, based on comparable data sets. We show possible synergies of the obtained diversity of insights: for example, one indicator says that it is urgent to act and another which is the best policy to use. We discuss the difficulties of implementation and the benefits of our approach for the decision-maker.","[Martin, Sophie; Alvarez, Isabelle; Huet, Sylvie] Univ Clermont Auvergne, INRAE, UR LISC, Ctr Clermont Ferrand, 9 Ave Blaise Pascal CS 20085, F-63178 Aubiere, France; [Erdlenbruch, Katrin] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, UMR Cee m, Inst Agro, 2 Pl P Viala, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Smadi, Charline] Univ Grenoble, INRAE, UR LESSEM, 2 Rue Papeterie, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France",INRAE; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut Agro; Universite de Montpellier; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE,"Martin, S (corresponding author), Univ Clermont Auvergne, INRAE, UR LISC, Ctr Clermont Ferrand, 9 Ave Blaise Pascal CS 20085, F-63178 Aubiere, France.",sophie.martin@inrae.fr; katrin.erdlenbruch@inrae.fr; isabelle.alvarez@inrae.fr; sylvie.huet@inrae.fr; charline.smadi@inrae.fr,"Huet, Sylvie/AAV-5505-2020","Huet, Sylvie/0000-0003-2973-7738",Irstea,Irstea,We acknowledge financial support from Irstea via the AAP Risques project RAZ 13.,,58,1,1,5,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

They are increasingly positioned as a transformative means to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Indeed, batteries are not the only form of storage in the spotlight: A variety of stored forms, including seed banks, metals stockpiles, and sequestered carbon dioxide have become central in generating, and ameliorating, anxieties about environmental futures. 'Storage' offers a potent analytic to analogize phenomena across scales and contexts, in part because of the increasingly visible status of its emic instantiations. As a means to store electricity, a uniquely ephemeral commodity, batteries, like other stored forms, both mediate power and capital and can defuse political potency. Though batteries can smooth the integration of renewable energy into the grid by disciplining the unruly schedules of sun and wind, their potentials (and proponents) extend to the fossil fuel industry as well: They are 'fuel-neutral', allowing all kinds of electrons to become more cost-efficient. In these multivalent contexts, I suggest, securing the status and value of a battery's stored electricity, or trading on its ambiguity, can signal and effect political agendas, even as such arbitrations can recast politics in a techno-juridical domain.","[White-Nockleby, Caroline] MIT, Program Hist Anthropol & Sci Technol & Soc HASTS, 77 Massachusetts Ave,Room E51-163, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"White-Nockleby, C (corresponding author), MIT, Program Hist Anthropol & Sci Technol & Soc HASTS, 77 Massachusetts Ave,Room E51-163, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",cwn@mit.edu,,"White-Nockleby, Caroline/0000-0002-1140-0937",,,,,99,0,0,4,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0306-3127,1460-3659,,SOC STUD SCI,Soc.

In the western United States, effects such as warming temperatures, increased drought, reduced snowpack, and widespread wildfires will change the outdoor recreation landscape. In this article, we synthesize the state of science regarding the effects of climate change on outdoor recreation in the western US and summarize adaptation options that can reduce the consequences of climate change, considering the adaptive capacities of recreationists and managers. We draw from a series of climate change assessments in which researchers and managers collaborated to understand recreation vulnerability to climate change and develop effective adaptations. We conclude that building climate resilience requires a shift in planning and resource allocation decisions, including (1) longer-term planning timeframes, (2) interdisciplinary teams, and (3) collaboration among agencies, recreation providers, and communities. Study Implications: Outdoor recreation in the western US is changing due to the effects of climate change. Organized by five recreational categories, this study describes the vulnerability of outdoor recreation to climate change and synthesizes strategies to adapt recreation management to these vulnerabilities. Multiple direct and indirect factors influence individual recreationists' and land managers' capacities to adapt to climate change, as we describe through a diagram.

Owing to the increasing importance of technology development and transfer, a technology subregime became part of the Paris Agreement in the form of Article 10, which obligates parties to strengthen their cooperative action on technology development and transfer. This technology subregime includes the Technology Mechanism as a working mechanism, established in 2010 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The effective implementation of the technology subregime hinges upon the supporting role of the Technology Mechanism, particularly its implementing organization, the Climate Technology Centre & Network (CTCN). Technology subregimes are regarded not only as effective means to tackle environmental problems, but also as an inducement to extend the participation of developing countries in international environmental agreements. However, the means to assess them have not been widely explored. A recent UNFCCC discussion considered whether the CTCN impacted the enhancement of environmental quality in terms of mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. Therefore, this study evaluates the institutional effectiveness of the technology subregime of the Paris Agreement with the CTCN. This study utilizes five evaluation criteria: (1) environmental effectiveness, (2) technological effectiveness, (3) economic effectiveness, (4) compliance and participation incentives, and (5) administrative feasibility. It summarizes analytical results and concludes by proposing policy implications regarding the assessment of institutional effectiveness of the technology subregime.","[Oh, Chaewoon] Green Technol Ctr, Div Policy Res, Seoul, South Korea",,"Oh, C (corresponding author), Green Technol Ctr, Div Policy Res, Seoul, South Korea.",chaewoon.oh@gmail.com,,"Oh, Chaewoon/0000-0003-1357-5519",,,,,54,0,0,1,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The findings show that excess temperature negatively impacts crop yields, and the impact is higher in the plausible future climate scenarios. Under the greenhouse gas representative concentration pathway RCP4.5, the yields of different crops are lower by 1.8 to 6.6% in the medium-term (2041-2060) and 7.2 to 23.6% in the long-term (2061-2080). The heterogeneity in the crops' yield response to temperature, however, does not lead to any notable intra- and inter-regional shifts in the cropping patterns. The area shares of different crops decline by 0.1 to 0.4 percentage points in the medium-term and 0.4 to 1.3 percentage points in the long-term. This evidence suggests limited prospects for adaptation to climate change through adjustments in land use. The future adaptation strategies should, therefore, be built around the innovations in crop breeding for stress tolerance, higher yields and resource-use efficiency, management of land and water resources, and formal risk-mitigating mechanisms such as crop insurance and hedging.","[Birthal, Pratap S.; Hazrana, Jaweriah] ICAR Natl Inst Agr Econ & Policy Res, New Delhi 110012, India; [Negi, Digvijay S.] Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Mumbai 400065, Maharashtra, India; [Bhan, Subhash C.] Govt India, Minist Earth Sci, India Meteorol Dept, New Delhi 110003, India",Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - National Institute of Agricultural Economics & Policy Research; Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; India Meteorological Department (IMD),"Birthal, PS (corresponding author), ICAR Natl Inst Agr Econ & Policy Res, New Delhi 110012, India.",ps.birthal@icar.gov.in,,,Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR),Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)(Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)),Authors are grateful to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) for financial support for this research under the National Professorial Chair to the first author.,,53,2,2,8,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,OCT,2021,109,,,,,,,,105652,10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105652,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105652,,,12,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WC1EN,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000704007200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Though many studies focus on farmer adaptation to climate change, there are few studies of actors in the middle of agricultural value chains such as traders, logistics providers, and processors. The activities of these actors, referred to as the 'hidden middle', are key determinants of the prices received by farmers and the price and quality of food products for consumers. We explore how climate events and risk perceptions affect the adoption of value-adding and damage control strategies among maize traders in Nigeria, Africa's largest economy and most populous country. We find consistent evidence that climate events and climate risk perception discourage the adoption of value-adding practices including storage. This potentially affects the availability and price of maize for consumers (household and industry) in the lean season. However, once traders store maize, climate risk does not affect the adoption of damage control, but training and social networks do. These findings suggest that actors in the midstream of food value chains are responding to climate change and more attention needs to be paid to these actors to maintain the availability of affordable and safe maize products throughout the year. There is also a need for strategies to reduce the risks of trading activities due to climate change.","[Liverpool-Tasie, Lenis Saweda O.; Parkhi, Charuta M.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Liverpool-Tasie, LSO (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",lliverp@msu.edu,,"Liverpool-Tasie, Lenis/0000-0002-2990-5888; Parkhi, Charuta/0000-0002-8662-1056",United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Feed the Future initiative through the Nigeria Agricultural Policy Project [AJD-620-LA-15-00001]; US Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture; Michigan AgBioResearch,United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Feed the Future initiative through the Nigeria Agricultural Policy Project(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); US Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Michigan AgBioResearch,"Lenis Liverpool-Tasie and Charuta Parkhi are both in the Department of Agricultural, Food, and Resource Economics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA.

By using the structural dynamics method, this study quantified the changes in the food supply capacity (FSC) of alpine grassland ecosystem and sensitivity to significant variables. The findings indicated that: i) Natural factors were the dominated forces affecting FSC, and their contribution was 71.3%. Of these natural elements, the net primary productivity (NPP) and precipitation were the largest contributors, accounting for approximately 35%. The sensitivity index of the FSC to NPP and precipitation during grassland growing season were 4.1 and 1.9 respectively. On the contrary, human factors like warm shed area, density of road, capacity for access to information, contributed to 28.7% of the total FSC. ii) More intense snow disaster had a larger negative impact on FSC. Snow disaster can cause dramatic reduction in FSC, with a loss rate of 27.6% and with none intense disaster more negative impacts. iii) The continuing increase of FSC in the past 30 years from 1984 to 2014 was due to the significant increase of precipitation and NPP in the growing season of alpine grassland. Evidently, successful adaptation to climate change was critical to combat the climatic adversely impact on FSC. Typically, strengthening information dissemination, road accessibility and knowledge popularization of local residents' disaster reduction should be place high priority for improving FSC.","[Fang Yi-Ping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Fang Yi-Ping] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resource & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Mountain Hazards & Environment, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Fang, YP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.;Fang, YP (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resource & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",ypfang@imde.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, China [41571523, 41661144038]; National Basic Research Program of China, China [2013CBA01808]; National Key Technology R&D Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, China [2014BAC05B01]","National Natural Science Foundation of China, China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China, China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Key Technology R&D Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, China","This research was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China, China (41571523, 41661144038); National Basic Research Program of China, China (2013CBA01808); and National Key Technology R&D Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, China (2014BAC05B01).",,53,0,0,5,12,KEAI PUBLISHING LTD,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING, DONGCHENG DISTRICT 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1674-9278,,,ADV CLIM CHANG RES,Adv.

This is introducing new risks to the already vulnerable and marginalised societies that lack development and have high poverty rates. This study uses the IPCC Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) approach to analyse the determinants of household livelihood vulnerability defining vulnerability in terms of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. It also determines various adaptation responses that farmers apply and elucidates the reasons why some farmers choose not to adapt to climate change. It focuses on three semi-arid districts in Pakistan (Faisalabad, D.G. Khan and Mardan) and uses a sample of 150 rural agricultural households. As per the LVI scores, D.G. Khan is the most vulnerable district to climate change impacts, followed by Mardan and Faisalabad, respectively. Results show that (a lack of) adaptive capacity plays quite an important role in shaping households' livelihood vulnerability for any given degree of exposure and sensitivity. Besides lower exposure and sensitivity to climate change, extremely low levels of adaptive capacity make Mardan more vulnerable to climate change compared to Faisalabad. The paper argues on people-centric development for rural areas through strengthening of agriculture sector as well as providing rural household opportunities for off-farm livelihoods.","[Qaisrani, Ayesha; Umar, Muhammad Awais; Siyal, Ghamz E.

Fifty percent of the respondents were female. Males sourced more climate-related livestock information than females; recording 29.6% difference in feed formulation information; which is the most differed. Females were more affected by climate change than males, with the difference more on disruption of animal heat period due to high temperature (male (X) over bar = 2.80; female (X) over bar = 3.50; difference in mean{dm} = -0.70). Male entrepreneurs differed from females in the adaptation strategies used in combating climate change and also on their view on effectiveness of adaptation strategies. Females were more constrained than male in adapting to climate change; with the variance more on lack of information facilities (male (X) over bar = 2.28; female (X) over bar = 2.60; dm = -0.32). Males and females differed in their effects and adaptation strategies to climate change.

Any global climate treaty must, however, at least not make global inequality worse, and ideally should embody desirable principles of justice. The Greenhouse Development Rights framework (GDRs), described briefly here, is a proposal for such a fair division of the burdens or emissions reductions and adaptation to climate change that won't be avoided, based on an assessment of capacity (ability to pay) and responsibility (contribution to the problem). The GDRs considers both inequality within countries and inequality between countries: national obligations are based on the exemption of poor individuals (tinder a 'development threshold') from global burdens. GDRs accepts the link between 'development' and the growth in consumption of the world's poor majority, an obvious requirement if it is to be taken seriously by Southern governments intent oil 'development as usual'. It also does not directly challenge the institutions of capitalism or the sovereignty of nation states. Nonetheless, in its focus on poor and rich people it is consistent with a class-based rather than nation-based approach to economic justice. We conclude by raising a variety of questions both about the limits of approaches like GDRs, and the need for policies that address climate change even during or after a transition beyond the current global capitalist regime.","[Baer, Paul] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Kartha, Sivan] Stockholm Environm Inst, US Ctr, Somerville, MA 02144 USA; [Kartha, Sivan] Stockholm Environm Inst, SEIs Climate Program, Somerville, MA 02144 USA; [Athanasiou, Tom] Earth Isl Inst, EcoEqu, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Baer, P (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, 685 Cherry St, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",paul.baer@pubpolicy.gatech.edu,"Baer, Paul/I-3855-2012","Kemp-Benedict, Eric/0000-0001-5794-7172; Kartha, Sivan/0000-0002-6014-2161",,,,,7,30,33,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-155X,1467-7660,,DEV CHANGE,Dev.

Quantitative data on food security issues were collected by reviewing newspapers namely The Herald, Newsday, The Standard and The Sunday Mail in 123 days. The main objective was to analyse quantitative coverage of climate-smart agricultural news. The study analysed newspaper coverage of crop production, animal production, fisheries, postharvest management, food safety, value addition, marketing and administration as they relate to climate change. Results of 469 food security articles revealed that 22.6% coverage was related to climate change whilst 77.4% covered food security issues not related to climate change. The study concluded that there was a significant variance in the coverage of various food security issues related to climate change with climate change issues related to postharvest management, food safety and fishery management not being covered during the period of study.

To address this failing, we consider how a rights-based approach broadens understanding of adaptive capacity while directing attention towards causes of exclusion and marginalisation. Drawing on human rights principles and lessons from rights-based practice, we develop a novel analytical tool for use with communities that considers adaptive capacity through examination of equality, transparency, accountability and empowerment. We apply this to the illustrative case of aquatic agricultural systems in Timor-Leste. This approach yields a qualitative analysis that unpacks the formal and informal institutions and actors that structure opportunities and barriers to adaptive actions. The rights framing exposes the processes of marginalisation and exclusion that lead to differentiation in adaptive capacity, but at the same time helps identify concrete actions that can be taken as part of a rights-based approach to development support for adaptive capacity. The tool and empirical illustration support an emerging body of thought that adaptive capacity requires development actors to engage not only with the technical challenges of responding to climate change, but also with the social and political context that determines the distribution of costs and benefits.

The CVI relates the Exposure and Adaptive Capacity for a specific Hazard, offering feasible supports for decision-makers in identifying country-specific needs to adapt to climate change. However, even with this scenario, the LDCs are still unable to cope with the impact of extreme events. Therefore, the main question is, which part of Adaptive Capacity needs more effort to deal with extreme weather events? To address this issue, this paper discusses the governance role in the CVI definition, suggesting an alternative approach to assess climate vulnerability. Overall, we propose a tool, taking into account four main components: Exposure, Sensitivity, Adaptive Capacity, and Governance. In this case, the Governance component represents organizations, policies, and qualified human resources that could improve the planning and management of a specific system. More specifically, we explicitly considered the Governance component in the climate vulnerability function by adding specific indicators. As a study case, we consider Mozambique, a highly vulnerable country to the adverse impact of climate change. The results have shown that by adding the Governance component to assess climate vulnerability, the function becomes more sensitive. In conclusion, Governance is accepted as a powerful component in the CVI definition.","[Samussone Tomas Buchir, Luis Miguel] Natl Directorate Climate Change, Minist Land & Environm, Maputo, Mozambique; [Marco Detzel, Daniel Henrique] Univ Fed Parana, Polytech Ctr, Dept Hydraul & Sanitat, Block V, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Parana,"Buchir, LMST (corresponding author), Natl Directorate Climate Change, Minist Land & Environm, Maputo, Mozambique.",buchirmz@yahoo.com.br,,,,,,,37,1,1,1,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0343-2521,1572-9893,,GEOJOURNAL,GeoJournal,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10708-022-10711-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-022-10711-7,,JUL 2022,16,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,2Y8CJ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000826117500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Electricity in particular underpins the operation of hospitals, schools, financial systems, transportation assets, telecommunications, and water treatment, and affects many other aspects of daily life. There is an emerging recognition of power systems as complex adaptive systems and a proliferation of work on how to make them more resilient in the face of natural hazards and climate change. However, the term resilience is often used to encompass important, but distinct, aspects of infrastructure analysis including vulnerability, asset hardening, resistance to failure and risk management. As work in this domain has evolved through disciplines from risk management, economics, engineering and policy, the term resilience has often remained vague or referred to broad aspects of infrastructure performance under hazard events. Here we argue it is important to distinguish asset hardening and risk management from aspects of a system that allow it to deliver services even when some of its components fail. Understanding infrastructure vulnerability and risk are key components of resilient power system assessments. However, differentiating vulnerability from functional resilience (service delivery even when components fail) can help identify gaps in data, modeling and decision making. We propose that continued progress in this area can be made by unifying these areas of work through (1) understanding vulnerability and risk management in the context of hazards and climate change and (2) an orientation of resilient service delivery as a unifying concept for resilience analysis.

This makes a farmer the key actor. This study aimed to understand farmers' climate change views and reveal how farmers see their role, responsibilities and possibilities to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Furthermore, this study aimed to assess how various background variables and values associate with farmers' views in order to have novel and comprehensive on farmers' perspectives on climate change. Short-term changes in views were studied with a longitudinal framework. In total, 4401 farmers in Finland answered a standardized e-mail survey in spring 2018. A total of 2000 of them responded again in spring 2020. The respondents differed in gender, age, education, farming system, farm type, farm organization, farm size, revenue and region. The farmers were not a uniform group of citizens, and their views on climate change varied widely. For a Nordic, boreal zone country like Finland, climate change will bring not only challenges but also opportunities that may even strengthen the agricultural production. Such a two-sided coin causes confusion for farmers as indicated by this study. Climate change-induced risks often dominate the public dialogue with farmers. This study emphasizes the need for better balance between risks and opportunities not only in the dialogue with farmers but also with policy makers and all public discussion. Acknowledging farmers' views in planning the future climate policies for agricultural sector is elemental to ensure success in farm-scale implementation.","[Sorvali, Jaana; Peltonen-Sainio, Pirjo] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Latokartanonkaari 9, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland; [Kaseva, Janne] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Tietotie 4, Jokioinen 31600, Finland",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Sorvali, J (corresponding author), Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Latokartanonkaari 9, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland.",jaana.sorvali@luke.fi,"Kaseva, Janne/GLT-5462-2022","Kaseva, Janne/0000-0002-8167-5434; Sorvali, Jaana/0000-0003-0371-7149",Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE); European Commission Life-Programme and Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke) as a part of a consortium project Optimising Agricultural Land Use to Mitigate Climate Change (OPAL-Life) [LIFE14 CCM/FI/000254]; Academy of Finland through DivCSA [316215]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [316215] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE); European Commission Life-Programme and Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke) as a part of a consortium project Optimising Agricultural Land Use to Mitigate Climate Change (OPAL-Life); Academy of Finland through DivCSA(Academy of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Academy of FinlandFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES)),"Open access funding provided by Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE).

Potential distribution models and landscape connectivity studies have increased with regard to their utility to prioritizing areas for conservation. The objective of this study was to model the potential distribution of Mountain cloud forests in the Transversal Volcanic System, Michoacan and to analyze the role of these areas in maintaining landscape connectivity. Potential distribution was modeled for the Mountain cloud forests based on the maximum entropy approach using 95 occurrence points and 17 ecological variables at 30 m spatial resolution. Potential connectivity was then evaluated by using a probability of connectivity index based on graph theory. The percentage of variation (dPCk) was used to identify the individual contribution of each potential area of Mountain cloud forests in overall connectivity. The different ways in which the potential areas of Mountain cloud forests can contribute to connectivity were evaluated by using the three fractions derived from dPCk (dPCintrak, dPCfluxk, and dPCconnectork). We determined that 37,567 ha of the TVSMich are optimal for the presence of Mountain cloud forests. The contribution of said area in the maintenance of connectivity was low. The conservation of Mountain cloud forests is indispensable, however, in providing or receiving dispersal flows through TVSMich because of its role as a connector element between another habitat types. The knowledge of the potential capacity of Mountain cloud forests to promote structural and functional landscape connectivity is key in the prioritization of conservation areas.","[Correa Ayram, Camilo A.; Mendoza, Manuel E.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Invest Geog Ambiental, Antigua Carretera Patzcuaro 8701, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico; [Etter, Andres] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Dept Ecol & Territorio, Fac Estudios Ambient & Rur, Transversal 4 42-00 Piso 8, Bogota, Colombia; [Perez Salicrup, Diego R.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Ecosistemas & Sustentabilidad, Antigua Carretera Patzcuaro 8701, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico; [Correa Ayram, Camilo A.] Inst Invest Recursos Biol Alexander von Humboldt, Bogota, Colombia",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Pontificia Universidad Javeriana; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT,"Mendoza, ME (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Invest Geog Ambiental, Antigua Carretera Patzcuaro 8701, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico.",mmendoza@ciga.unam.mx,"Ayram, Camilo Andrés Correa/AAS-4624-2020; Etter, Andrés/E-1860-2011; Cantú, Manuel E.

The potential sensitivity of carbon sources and sinks in lakes may be of global importance, yet the direction and magnitude of possible changes are poorly understood across entire lake-rich regions. We used a spatially explicit simulation model of water and carbon cycling to explore the potential behavior of 6739 lakes and watersheds to changes in climate. Our study site was the Northern Highland Lake District of northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We developed two perturbation scenarios built from observed extreme high and low precipitation and evaporation values. Despite a spatially uniform change in precipitation across the region, individual lakes responded differently. Hydrologic responses were mostly predictable at both individual and regional scales, but the routing of carbon in lakes was both more sensitive and varied. We estimate that in today's climate, 7.3E+10 g of carbon are vented annually from lake surfaces in the District to the atmosphere. Compared to today's climate, total regional flux of carbon from lake surfaces was 31% higher in the wet scenario and 45% lower in the dry scenario. Some measures of carbon fluxes (such as net ecosystem production) appear to change uniformly and gradually at the regional scale, though aggregate change was driven primarily by considerable changes in relatively few large lakes. The simulations demonstrate that simple, spatially homogeneous perturbations in these complex connected watersheds can have both predictable and surprising effects.","[Cardille, Jeffrey A.; Turner, Monica G.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53726 USA; [Carpenter, Stephen R.; Hanson, Paul C.] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Limnol, Madison, WI 53726 USA; [Foley, Jonathan A.; Vano, Julie A.] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Sustainabil & Global Environm, Madison, WI 53726 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Cardille, JA (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Dept Geog, 520 Chemin Cote Ste Catherine, Montreal, PQ H2V 2B8, Canada.",jeffrey.cardille@umontreal.ca,"Turner, Monica G/B-2099-2010; Foley, Jonathan A/GRS-5522-2022; Carpenter, Stephen/AAQ-6404-2020","Turner, Monica G/0000-0003-1903-2822; Cardille, Jeffrey/0000-0002-4667-9085",Andrew W.

P.",,,HESS Opinions Urgent water challenges are not sufficiently researched,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BIOFUEL,"In this opinion paper we submit that water experts conduct comparatively little research on the more urgent challenges facing the global community. Five specific biases are identified. First, research in the field of water and sanitation is heavily biased against sanitation. Second, research on food security is biased in favour of conventional irrigation and fails to address the problems and opportunities of rainfed agriculture. Third, insufficient water research is dedicated to developmental compared to environmental issues. Fourth, too little research is conducted on adaptation to climate change by developing countries. And finally, research on water governance has a fascination for conflict but too little eye for cooperation and meeting basic needs. This paper illustrates these biases with bibliometric indicators extracted from the ISI Web of Science. There is a stark mismatch between the global demand for knowledge and the supply of it. This mismatch is identified here as a problem that we water scientists must confront and resolve. We still lack a full understanding why this divergence between demand and supply occurs and persists; an understanding that is required to guide us towards aligning our research priorities to societal demands. The paper, however, makes some inferences. On the one hand, we should promote the global South to create its own research biases and allow it to develop alternative solutions. Simultaneously we would benefit from critical examination of our own research practice. Although this paper addresses a critical challenge it does not aim to be exhaustive or definitive. We merely identify the persistence of intransigent water problems as a valid research object in itself.","[van der Zaag, P.; Gupta, J.; Darvis, L.

In this paper, we explore the information needs of California coastal managers as they begin confronting the growing risks from climate change. Through this case study we examine the challenges managers face presently, what information they use to perform their responsibilities, what additional information and other knowledge resources they may need to begin planning for climate change. We place our study into the broader context of the study of how science can best support policy-makers and resource managers as they begin to plan and prepare for adaptation to climate change. Based on extensive interview and survey research in the state, we find that managers prefer certain types of information and information sources and would benefit from various learning opportunities (in addition to that information) to make better use of available global change information. Coastal managers are concerned about climate change and willing to address it in their work, but require financial and technical assistance from other agencies at the state and federal level to do so. The study illustrates the strong need for boundary organizations to serve various intermediary functions between science and practice, especially in the context of adaptation to global climate change impacts.

Assessing socio-demographics of solar irrigation in Nepal,ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate finance; Equitable distribution; Nepal; Policy gaps; Solar irrigation,WATER; GROUNDWATER; IMPACT,"Solar-powered irrigation pumps are a vital tool for both climate change adaptation and mitigation. Since most developing countries cannot fully utilize large-scale global funds for climate finance due to limited institutional capacities, small-scale solar irrigation pumps (SIPs) can provide a climate-resilient technological solution. We study the case of a subsidized SIP program in Nepal to understand who likely benefits from a small-scale climate finance program in a developing country setting. We analyze government data on profiles of farmers applying for SIPs and in-depth interviews with different actors along the SIP service chain. We find that vulnerable farmers (women, ethnic minorities, and poor farmers) were less likely than wealthier and non-minority farmers to have access to climate finance subsidies. Even though the government agency gave preference to women and ethnic minority farmers during beneficiary selection, an unrepresentative pool of applicants resulting from social and institutional barriers that prevented them from applying to the program led to an inequitable distribution of subsidized SIPs. The lack of a clear policy framework for allocating climate finance subsidies was a significant constraint. Lack of periodic updating of SIP prices and poor provision of after-sale services were also responsible for the inequitable distribution of subsidized SIPs. We recommend the involvement of local governments in soliciting applications from a wider pool of farmers, periodic revision of SIP prices to reflect market price, replacement of the current fixed subsidy scheme with a variable subsidy scheme, and mandatory provisions of after-sales services.","[Kafle, Kashi] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Uprety, Labisha; Shrestha, Gitta] Int Water Management Inst IWMI, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Pandey, Vishnu] Tribhuvan Univ, Inst Engn IOE, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Mukherji, Aditi] Int Water Management Inst IWMI, New Delhi, India",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI); Tribhuvan University; CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI),"Kafle, K (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",krkafle@tamu.edu; l.uprety@cgiar.org; g.shrestha@cgiar.org; Vishnu.pandey@pcampus.edu.np; a.mukherji@cgiar.org,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-6296,2214-6326,,ENERGY RES SOC SCI,Energy Res.

The Rossby Center Atmospheric Regional Model (RCA4) datasets obtained from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment over West Africa were used for the study for projected period between 2011 and 2100. The ability of the RCA4 to reproduce the past climate was evaluated using Climate Research Unit (CRU) dataset. Drought classification and trends in seasonal and annual variability using Mann-Kendall trend test at 95% confidence level were also examined. The results show that RCA4 replicates observed climate of West Africa, evident by strong correlation between the output of the model and CRU dataset. Strong correlation exists between SPI and SPEI at 95% confidence level. The RCA4 model projects a distinct humid period between 2011 and 2060 and drier period from the early 2060s till the year 2100 under RCP4.5 and 8.5 pathways. Projected drought events by the two indices show that areas north of 12 degrees N of West Africa will be hot spot area for mildly and moderately dry events, while the southern part of West Africa will witness pronounced severe and extreme dry events under the two RCPs. Under RCP4.5, SPI trend shows an insignificant increase in almost all the seasons, while the increase is significant in SPEI. At RCP8.5 scenario, SPEI projects a significant decreasing trend in drought events over the three climatic zones and in almost all seasons. The result may be applied to a sustainable climate change adaptation plan.","[Ajayi, Vincent O.; Ilori, Oluwaseun W.] Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Meteorol & Climate Sci, PMB 704, Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria",,"Ajayi, VO (corresponding author), Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Meteorol & Climate Sci, PMB 704, Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria.",voajayi@futa.edu.ng,,"Ilori, Oluwaseun/0000-0001-9584-6401",,,,,87,24,24,1,3,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2509-9426,2509-9434,,EARTH SYST ENVIRON,Earth Syst.

Projecting the spatial distribution and impacts of these risks requires consideration of biophysical and socioeconomic factors. Models like the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) can project spatial distributions of hydrologic risk due to shifting biophysical factors like climate and land use, but cannot account for socioeconomic factors influencing a community's capacity to adapt to future streamflow changes. To address this limitation, we used a risk matrix to classify subbasins in a large river basin in the southeastern USA based on (1) percent increase in SWAT simulated 10-year and extreme high flows due to climate and land use change between baseline (1982-2002) and projected (2050-2070) periods and (2) degree of community vulnerability according to a Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). We compared spatial distributions of high-risk subbasins based on SWAT results, SVI results, and the integration of SWAT and SVI results using a risk matrix. Large increases in simulated 10-year and extreme high flows occurred in middle and lower parts of the river basin, and socially vulnerable communities were distributed throughout. We identified 16, 7, and 14 unique high-risk subbasins using SWAT results, SVI results, and SWAT and SVI results, respectively. By using a risk matrix, we identified subbasins with vulnerable communities that are projected to experience future increases in streamflow due to climate and land use change. These results serve as a starting point for subsequent climate change adaptation planning.","[Saia, Sheila M.] Oak Ridge Inst Sci & Educ, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA; [Saia, Sheila M.; Wear, David N.; Vose, James M.] US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, 3041 East Cornwallis Rd, Durham, NC 27709 USA; [Saia, Sheila M.; Emanuel, Ryan E.; Martin, Katherine L.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Suttles, Kelly M.] Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Ctr Housing & Community Studies, Greensboro, NC USA; [Cutts, Bethany B.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Tourism Pk & Management, Raleigh, NC USA; [Cutts, Bethany B.; Emanuel, Ryan E.; Martin, Katherine L.] North Carolina State Univ, Ctr Geospatial Analyt, Raleigh, NC USA; [Coulston, John W.] US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, Blacksburg, VA USA",Oak Ridge Associated Universities; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge Institute for Science & Education; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; North Carolina State University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro; North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Saia, SM (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Inst Sci & Educ, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA.;Saia, SM (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, 3041 East Cornwallis Rd, Durham, NC 27709 USA.;Saia, SM (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",ssaia@ncsu.edu,"Saia, Sheila M./AAO-7158-2020; Emanuel, Ryan E/C-3796-2012","Saia, Sheila M./0000-0002-4943-0306; Emanuel, Ryan E/0000-0002-2166-1698; Martin, Katherine/0000-0001-6020-9250",DOE [DE-SC0014664]; United States Department of Energy (DOE); USFS,DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); United States Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); USFS,"SMS and KMS were supported by an appointment to the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service (USFS) Research Participation Program administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) through an inter-agency agreement between the United States Department of Energy (DOE) and the USFS.

Adaptation and mitigation strategies constitute the front line of attack for rural households in developing countries that rely on agricultural production and natural resource use as their main source of income and growth, and whose livelihoods are threatened by climate change. This study models the determinants of adoption of sustainable production practices by coffee producers in the department of Matagalpa, in northern Nicaragua. Using primary survey data, we analyze the extent to which cooperative membership impacts adoption of ten different practices. We find that coffee farmers who belong to cooperatives have adopted sustainable practices at higher rates than non-members, and that the odds of adoption are higher for members than for non-members. A factor analysis was conducted to determine the underlying structural differences between the ten practices, and from this analysis three factors emerged and were modeled. We find that cooperative membership is a significant determinant of practices that promote water conservation, yet not significant for practices that promote soil and plant health, nor for practices related to field management. These findings are valuable for policy makers, donors, and development and extension practitioners in the coffee sector, as they can better inform and guide policies toward more efficient and effective paths of long-term climate change adaptation.","[Bro, Aniseh S.; Clay, Daniel C.; Lopez, Maria C.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Ortega, David L.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Bro, AS (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",broanise@msu.edu; clay@anr.msu.edu; dlortega@anr.msu.edu; mlopez@anr.msu.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,United States Agency for International Development; Purdue University through their Borlaug Fellowship in Global Food Security,United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Purdue University through their Borlaug Fellowship in Global Food Security,The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support of the United States Agency for International Development and Purdue University through their Borlaug Fellowship in Global Food Security.,,66,13,13,4,47,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

The varietal diversity based on the response to temperature and photoperiod during vegetative growth was determined in a core collection of 40 Sri Lankan traditional rice accessions (SLTRA) and 2 improved and 2 wild rice types in terms of days to fully expansion of fifth leaf (DFL) and plant height (PH). Short day (SD), day neutral (DN) and long day (LD) conditions were imposed during 2 trials of high temperature (HT) and low temperature (LT) at 36.9 +/- 0.43 degrees C and 34.0 +/- 0.98 degrees C under natural temperature fluctuation. Average DFL of the collection at HT was significantly lower than that of the LT irrespective of photoperiods. Temperature affected the DFL of 22 accessions, while photoperiod alone affected 1 accession. Average PHs under HT were similar irrespective of the photoperiod, which were lower than those of LT. PH of 15 accessions was not affected by photoperiod or temperature. Temperature alone affected 12 accessions and photoperiod alone affected 2 accessions. Both photoperiod and temperature affected 4 accessions. In the cluster analysis on response to photoperiod and temperature, SLTRA and improved rice were differentiated into 2 clusters at a rescaled distance of 25. Further, sub-clusters grouped several accessions of the same variety together. The differential varietal response to photoperiod and temperature in SLTRA would be useful in breeding for climate change adaptations after further experiments on flowering time and yield.","[Rathnathunga, Elpitiya Udari Uvindhya] Univ Ruhuna, Fac Grad Studies, Board Study Agr, Matara, Sri Lanka; [Senanayake, Gamini; Geekiyanage, Sudarshanee] Univ Ruhuna, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Biol, Mapalana, Kamburupitiya, Sri Lanka; [Seneweera, Saman] Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Crop Hlth, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia",University Ruhuna; University Ruhuna; University of Southern Queensland,"Geekiyanage, S (corresponding author), Univ Ruhuna, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Biol, Mapalana, Kamburupitiya, Sri Lanka.",sudarshanee@agbio.ruh.ac.lk,"Rathnathunga, Udari/ABB-9976-2021; Seneweera, Saman/H-3770-2012; Seneweera, Saman/AAX-9011-2021","Seneweera, Saman/0000-0001-5147-9988; Rathnathunga, Udari/0000-0002-1704-4363","National Research Council, Sri Lanka","National Research Council, Sri Lanka","Authors acknowledge the National Research Council, Sri Lanka for funding the research and the Plant Genetic Resources Centre, Gannoruwa, Sri Lanka for providing traditional rice seeds.",,52,1,1,1,6,NATL SCIENCE FOUNDATION SRI LANKA,COLOMBO,"47/5  MAITLAND PLACE, COLOMBO, 00000, SRI LANKA",1391-4588,2362-0161,,J NATL SCI FOUND SRI,J.

In Ghana, both these factors come into play as women living in slums bear the brunt of the impacts. In spite of this, the majority of research in gender and climate change adaptation has focused on rural communities to the detriment of their poor urban counterparts. Using a critical feminist intersectional approach, this study investigates how the interplay between gender, socio-economic, institutional and place-based factors shapes vulnerability to climate change in three slums in urban Accra, Ghana. The results demonstrate that while climate change poses serious environmental hazards to all residents of slums, their perceptions and knowledge regarding the causes and impacts of these hazards are differentiated by gender, age, educational status and place-based variables, with women generally showing a lower level of awareness about climate change than their male counterparts. The results indicate further that irrespective of age, educational attainment and where people live, women were found to be overall more vulnerable, despite experiencing similar levels of exposure as the men, by virtue of their limited access to productive resources, poor conditions of housing, low participation in adaptation decision-making, as well as the heavy domestic responsibilities placed on them. We conclude that it is imperative for adaptation policy makers to formulate and implement appropriate adaptive measures in a gender-sensitive and context-specific manner to respond to the different vulnerabilities faced by different categories of social groups and communities in cities of the Global South.","[Owusu, Mensah; Nursey-Bray, Melissa; Rudd, Diane] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Owusu, M (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",Mensah.Owusu@adelaide.edu.au; Melissa.nursey-bray@adelaide.edu.au; Dianne.rudd@adelaide.edu.au,"Nursey-Bray, Melissa/J-8183-2019",,University of Adelaide,University of Adelaide,The authors would like to thank the University of Adelaide for provision of funds to support this research.,,75,31,31,0,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

This threatens farmers' livelihood and the cocoa sector. Climate change adaptation requires an improved understanding of existing cocoa production systems and farmers' coping strategies. This study characterized current cocoa production, income diversification and shade tree management along a climate gradient within the cocoa belt of Ghana. The objectives were to 1) compare existing production and income diversification between dry, mid and wet climatic regions, and 2) identify shade trees in cocoa agroforestry systems and their distribution along the climatic gradient. Our results showed that current mean cocoa yield level of 288 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in the dry region was significantly lower than in the mid and wet regions with mean yields of 712 and 849 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. In the dry region, farmers diversified their income sources with non-cocoa crops and off-farm activities while farmers at the mid and wet regions mainly depended on cocoa (over 80% of annual income). Two shade systems classified as medium and low shade cocoa agroforestry systems were identified across the studied regions. The medium shade system was more abundant in the dry region and associated to adaptation to marginal climatic conditions. The low shade system showed significantly higher yield in the wet region but no difference was observed between the mid and dry regions. This study highlights the need for optimum shade level recommendation to be climatic region specific.","[Abdulai, Issaka] Univ Gottingen, Trop Plant Prod & Agr Syst Modelling TROPAGS, Gottingen, Germany; [Jassogne, Laurence; Van Asten, Piet] IITA, Kampala, Uganda; [Graefe, Sophie] Univ Goettingen, Trop Silviculture & Forest Ecol, Busgenweg 1, Gottingen, Germany; [Asare, Richard] IITA, Accra, Ghana; [Laderach, Peter] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Vaast, Philippe] Univ Montpellier, Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, UMR Eco&Sols, Montpellier, France; [Vaast, Philippe] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Hanoi, Vietnam",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier,"Abdulai, I (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Trop Plant Prod & Agr Syst Modelling TROPAGS, Gottingen, Germany.",iabdula@gwdg.de,,"Laderach, Peter/0000-0001-8708-6318",German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) [12.1433.7-001.00]; German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),"This study was funded by the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), project number: 12.1433.7-001.00.; This research is part of the CGIAR programs on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) and Forest, Trees and Agriculture (FTA).

This information has the potential to provide key evidence for decisions on climate change adaptation, especially at regional scales. Its importance implies that following the creation of an initial generation of decadal prediction systems, a process of continual development is needed to produce successive versions with better predictive skill. Here, a new version of the Met Office Hadley Centre Decadal Prediction System (DePreSys 2) is introduced, which builds upon the success of the original DePreSys. DePreSys 2 benefits from inclusion of a newer and more realistic climate model, the Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model version 3 (HadGEM3), but shares a very similar approach to initialization with its predecessor. By performing a large suite of reforecasts, it is shown that DePreSys 2 offers improved skill in predicting climate several years ahead. Differences in skill between the two systems are likely due to a multitude of differences between the underlying climate models, but it is demonstrated herein that improved simulation of tropical Pacific variability is a key source of the improved skill in DePreSys 2. While DePreSys 2 is clearly more skilful than DePreSys in a global sense, it is shown that decreases in skill in some high-latitude regions are related to errors in representing long-term trends. Detrending the results focuses on the prediction of decadal time-scale variability, and shows that the improvement in skill in DePreSys 2 is even more marked.","[Knight, Jeff R.; Andrews, Martin B.; Smith, Doug M.; Arribas, Alberto; Colman, Andrew W.; Dunstone, Nick J.; Eade, Rosie; Hermanson, Leon; MacLachlan, Craig; Peterson, K.

However, in many developing countries, resettlement is a deeply political process that often results in an unequal distribution of costs and benefits among relocated persons. This paper examines these tensions in Mozambique, drawing on a case study of flood-affected communities in the Lower Zambezi River valley. It takes a political ecology approach - focusing on discourses of human-environment interaction, as well as the power relationships that are supported by such discourses - to show how a dominant narrative of climate change-induced hazards for small-scale farmers is contributing to their involuntary resettlement to higher-altitude, less fertile areas of land. These forced relocations are buttressed by a series of wider economic and political interests in the Lower Zambezi River region, such as dam construction for hydroelectric power generation and the extension of control over rural populations, from which resettled people derive little direct benefit. Rather than engaging with these challenging issues, most international donors present in the country accept the 'inevitability' of extreme weather impacts and view resettlement as an unfortunate and, in some cases, necessary step to increase people's 'resilience', thus rationalising the top-down imposition of unpopular social policies. The findings add weight to the argument that a depoliticised interpretation of climate change can deflect attention away from underlying drivers of vulnerability and poverty, as well as obscure the interests of governments that are intent on reordering poor and vulnerable populations.","Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Arnall, A (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Agr Bldg,POB 237, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England.",a.h.arnall@reading.ac.uk,,"Arnall, Alex/0000-0001-6218-5926",,,,,66,44,44,3,85,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0016-7398,1475-4959,,GEOGR J,Geogr.

The city of Curitiba in Brazil is no exception. In December 2020, the city published PlanClima (Plano Municipal de Mitigacao e Adaptacao as Mudancas Climaticas), a climate plan developed with local and international organizations. PlanClima aims to guide policies and actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change. This study focuses on selecting and qualitatively evaluating transport policies that contribute to the city's 2030 climate and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With PlanClima's analysis for the transport sector in mind, nine targets for 2030 are identified and connected to different transport policies. To evaluate the possible interactions between the policies and the different dimensions of the SDGs, four types of linkages were designed: essential, uncertain, limited, and opposite. These categories were developed to evaluate the several dimensions in which a policy can have a positive or negative impact. The results show that the implementation of zero emission zones/low emission zones, green public procurement, subsidy schemes for the uptake of clean vehicle technology, and the digitalization of the transport system through smarter public transport and digital platforms that couple bike sharing, taxis, and public transport are some of the measures that can contribute to the achievement of Curitiba's targets and ensure a positive impact on the sustainable development of the city. The study highlights how different policy instruments can contribute to achieve the city's targets, thus providing guidance to policymakers.","[de Almeida, Constanca Martins Leite] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sch Ind Engn & Management, S-11428 Stockholm, Sweden; [Silveira, Semida] Sustainable Vis Global Ventures AB, S-18131 Lidingo, Sweden; [Jeneulis, Erik] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Transport Planning, Brinellvagen 23, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Fuso-Nerini, Francesco] KTH Royal Inst Technol, KTH Climate Act Ctr, S-11428 Stockholm 8, Sweden; [Fuso-Nerini, Francesco] KTH Royal Inst Technol, KTH Div Energy Syst, Sch Ind Engn & Management, S-11428 Stockholm 8, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology; Royal Institute of Technology; Royal Institute of Technology; Royal Institute of Technology,"de Almeida, CML (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sch Ind Engn & Management, S-11428 Stockholm, Sweden.",cmlda@kth.se; semida.silveira@svision.se; erik.jenelius@abe.kth.se; francesco.fusonerini@energy.kth.se,"Jenelius, Erik/I-8061-2017; Jenelius, Erik/GQZ-3686-2022; Jenelius, Erik/P-2940-2019","Jenelius, Erik/0000-0002-4106-3126; Jenelius, Erik/0000-0002-4106-3126; Jenelius, Erik/0000-0002-4106-3126; Fuso Nerini, Francesco/0000-0002-4770-4051",VINNOVA (Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems) in Sweden,VINNOVA (Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems) in Sweden,This paper was written in the scope of a collaboration between Swedish and Brazilian partners in the project Smart City Concepts in Curitibalow-carbon transport and mobility in a digital society funded by VINNOVA (Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems) in Sweden.,,57,0,0,5,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2021,13,21,,,,,,,12222,10.3390/su132112222,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132112222,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WX4HN,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000718558900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In practice, this emphasises the need for community engagement, planning and inclusive decision-making. Community engagement may be potentially facilitated by the use of spatially explicit quantitative scenarios of land-use change in combination with interactive visualisation. This requires a coherent framework to integrate spatial data modelling, analytical capabilities and visualisation tools in a format that will also engage diverse public audiences. These challenges were explored with a case study of virtual landscapes from N-E Scotland that was used to test preferences for scenarios of future land use. Visualisations employed texture-based rendering rather than full photo-realistic rendering to facilitate interactivity and this provided additional scope for audiences to explore multiple future scenarios compared to the present landscape. Interactive voting in a virtual landscape theatre suggested preferences for visual diversity, good stewardship and perceived naturalness that should be considered in developing planned responses to change. Further investigation of preferences was conducted using interactive 3D features located within the landscape. Study findings are reviewed against objectives for inclusive engagement in the Digital Earth agenda and used to make further recommendations on the use of scenarios and visualisation tools.

However, variability of climate resources and disaster risks under varying climate conditions makes selection of the proper variety for a certain region more difficult. Based on climate data from 1951 to 2010 and crop data from 1981 to 2007, the impact of climate change on maturity-type shifts of maize variety, the variability of available climate resources including heat, precipitation, and sunshine duration, and agro-meteorological disaster risks in Northeast China (NEC) were analysed. Larger middle-and late-maturity-type cropping areas were found during the second period (1981-2010) than during the first period (1951-1980). The area planted with early-maturity maize tended to decrease in the north-western portion of NEC. In sensitive cropping areas where the maturity types of spring maize shifted, growing degree days increased by 2.8-11.5 %, and the northern portion showed higher increasing amplitude than the southern portion. In addition, both accumulated precipitation and sunshine duration during the maize-growing season showed a significant increasing trend in the northern portion, although a significant decreasing trend was found in the southern portion of NEC. In conclusion, the maturity-type shift in spring maize caused more exposure to chilling damage and water deficiency in the sensitive cropping areas of NEC. The importance of taking full account of disaster risks was demonstrated when changing maturity types of spring maize to achieve higher production.","[Zhao, Jin; Yang, Xiaoguang; Lv, Shuo; Liu, Zhijuan; Wang, Jing] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jing] Ningxia Inst Meteorol Sci, Yinchuan 750002, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Yang, XG (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",zhaojin@cau.edu.cn; yangxg@cau.edu.cn; cau20060625@163.com; liuzhijuan1215@163.com; wj19870122@163.com,"lv, shuo/AAC-7018-2019; yang, xiao/HJI-7815-2023; Liu, Zhijuan/AEA-8412-2022","Liu, Zhijuan/0000-0001-7082-6439",Ministry of Science and Technology of China ('973' project) [2010CB951502]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China ('National Science & Technology Pillar Program' project) [2012BAD20B04],"Ministry of Science and Technology of China ('973' project)(Ministry of Science and Technology, ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China); Ministry of Science and Technology of China ('National Science & Technology Pillar Program' project)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China ('973' project: Grant No. 2010CB951502; 'National Science & Technology Pillar Program' project: Grant No. 2012BAD20B04).,,40,19,23,2,52,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

These two rivers have been chosen because they differ markedly in the type and intensity of prevailing threats. The Mekong is relatively pristine, whereas the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze is the world's largest dam representing the apotheosis of environmental alteration of Asian rivers thus far. Moreover, it is situated at the foot of a planned cascade of at least 12 new dams on the upper Yangtze. Anthropogenic effects of dams and pollution of Yangtze fishes will be exacerbated by plans to divert water northwards along three transfer routes, in part to supplement the flow of the Yellow River. Adaptation to climate change will undoubtedly stimulate more dam construction and flow regulation, potentially causing perfect storm conditions for fishes in the Yangtze. China has already built dams along the upper course of the Mekong, and there are plans for as many as 11 mainstream dams in People's Democratic Republic (Laos) and Cambodia in the lower Mekong Basin. If built, they could have profound consequences for biodiversity, fisheries and human livelihoods, and such concerns have stalled dam construction. Potential effects of dams proposed for other rivers (such as NujiangSalween) are also cause for concern. Conservation or restoration measures to sustain some semblance of the rich fish biodiversity of Asian rivers can be identified, but their implementation may prove problematic in a context of increasing Anthropocene alteration of these ecosystems.","Univ Hong Kong, Sch Biol Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong,"Dudgeon, D (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Sch Biol Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",ddudgeon@hku.hk,,,,,,,155,99,106,4,127,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1112,1095-8649,,J FISH BIOL,J.

Electricity consumption is of interest both from the perspectives of adaptation to climate change and emission reductions. We study the relationship between European electricity consumption and outdoor temperature and other variables, using a panel data set of 31 countries. Apart from providing a rare quantitative window into adaptation, the study contributes demand system parameters with respect to price and income. The results suggest that weather has a statistically significant effect on electricity demand, with effects that are of plausible magnitude. In a simulation of climate change for the next 100 years-other factors held constant-we find that the demand for heating will decrease in Northern Europe while the demand for cooling will increase in Southern Europe. In countries like Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Malta, Spain, and Turkey the net effect of increased cooling outweighs decreased heating consumption whereas in most of Europe the opposite holds. The largest estimated partial impact is 20%, which predicted increase in adaptive consumption for Turkey and decrease in adaptive consumption for Latvia. Estimated elasticities with respect to income and price are 0.8 and minus 0.2 respectively: plausible in the light of the literature. As a discussion item, we add that electricity consumption changes due to temperature change likely will be small compared to those due to other factors, such as changes in income, demography and technology.

Current environmental flow assessments tend to assume climate stationarity, so there is an urgent need for robust environmental flow programs that allow adaptation to changing flow regimes due to climate change. Designing and implementing robust environmental flow programs means ensuring environmental objectives are achieved under a range of uncertain, but plausible climate futures. We apply stress testing concepts previously adopted in water supply management to environmental flows at a catchment scale. We do this by exploring vulnerabilities in different river management metrics for current environmental flow arrangements in the Goulburn River, Australia, under non-stationary climatic conditions. Given the limitations of current environmental flows in supporting ecological outcomes under climate change, we tested three different adaptation options individually and in combination. Stress testing adaptation results showed that increasing environmental entitlements yielded the largest benefits in drier climate futures, whereas relaxing river capacity constraints (allowing more targeted delivery of environmental water) offered more benefits for current and wetter climates. Combining both these options led to greater than additive improvements in allocation reliability and reductions in environmental water shortfalls, and these improvements were achieved across a wider range of climatic conditions than possible with either of the individual options. However, adaptation may present additional risks to some ecological outcomes for wetter climates. Ultimately, there was a degree of plausible climate change beyond which none of the adaptation options considered were effective at improving ecological outcomes. This study demonstrates an important step for environmental flow assessments: evaluating the feasibility of environmental outcomes under climate change, and the intervention options that prove most robust under an uncertain future.","[John, Andrew; Horne, Avril; Nathan, Rory; Fowler, Keirnan; Webb, J.

This study explores the future variability of wave conditions in the Persian Gulf under three different shared socio-economic pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5). Near-surface wind speed simulations of the CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6) models are evaluated against the ERA5 reanalysis outputs to find the general circulation models (GCMs) with relatively better performance. The outputs related to the selected GCMs are regionalized through a Weibull-based bias-correction technique, applied to the interpolated grid points. A third-generation numerical wave model is employed to simulate wave characteristics over the computational domain using the modified wind field of each CMIP6 GCM. An ensemble model is obtained by applying the arithmetic mean on the wave model's output of the selected GCMs. The ensemble model projects a mild decrease in the future significant wave height, 95th wave height, and peak wave period to the corresponding values in the historical period. The mean wave direction shows partial variations intensifying for the higher emission scenarios in the southern part of the gulf. Projections of extreme waves for the return periods of 2, 5, 10, 50, and 100 years demonstrate insignificant variation in the future extreme conditions. Moreover, the frequency of extreme events under different SSPs is expected to decrease slightly. Finally, wave steepness and wave age calculations for a location in the middle of the gulf show a mixed condition of swells and sea waves with insignificant variability under climate change scenarios.","[Baghanian, Saeideh] KN Toosi Univ Technol, Civil Engn Dept, Tehran, Iran; [Alizadeh, Mohamad Javad] Water Res Inst, Caspian Sea Natl Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran",K.

Here, we use water quality monitoring data collected from the nearshore of Lake Ontario between 2000 and 2018 to ask: i) which sites in the nearshore of Lake Ontario have statistically extreme water quality conditions?; ii) do water quality conditions differ in extreme versus non-extreme climate years?; and iii) what are the significant antecedent extreme weather drivers of water quality in the nearshore of Lake Ontario? Three sites with the highest chlorophyll a concentrations and eutrophic conditions, two of which are in Areas of Concern, exhibited the strongest responses to climate extremes. Antecedent weather conditions explained 87.2% of the variation in extreme chlorophyll a concentrations. In particular, warmer temperatures and heatwaves corresponded with statistical extremes in chlorophyll a concentrations. Precipitation accounted for 35.5% of the variation in extreme conditions of turbidity, including storm events the day prior to sampling. When considering site-specific extreme conditions, antecedent weather conditions explained 66.8% of the variation in turbidity.

Unfortunately, the effects of climate change on the planet are no more distant reality. The melting of glaciers, rising sea levels, extreme rainfall, and prolonged drought are already being experienced. These have affected water resources, land, and food security across the world. The limits of conventional climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies call for the integration of indigenous knowledge and technologies for tackling climate change issues. This is because of the importance that indigenous knowledge and technologies have for identifying the impacts and as well providing effective adaption and mitigation strategies to climate change. Thus, this chapter explores the potential of indigenous knowledge and technologies for the sustainable management of water, land, and food security amidst climate change. The applications of indigenous technologies and knowledge such as agroforestry, the use of sacred groves to conserve water, land, and biodiversity resources, and the practising of conservation-agriculture are discussed as solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, water shortages, land degradation, and pollution. However, these indigenous technologies will be less useful in today's world if not harnessed.

This study sought to assess climate vulnerability in upper Ewaso Nyiro basin area using the IPCC approach which defines vulnerability in three components: exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Twelve indicators were selected based on its proximity to the component being measured and normalization of the indicators was done to ensure consistency of scale ranging from 0 to 100, illustrating a linear relationship to vulnerability 100 being most vulnerable. The study relied on averaging approach of indicators to derive component and vulnerability scores through the process of spatial integration. Results observed high vulnerability in areas exhibiting similar trend in high exposure and lack of adaptive capacity as well as high sensitivity. The highest vulnerability was observed in Korr/Ngurunit ward in Marsabit County where approximately 45.45% of the population was noted to be highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, while 54.55% of the population was noted to be moderately vulnerable. This study recommends county government and national government to build targeted resilience efforts within the highly vulnerable communities since this would improve community livelihoods.","[Koech, Grace; Makokha, Godfrey Ouma; Mundia, Charles Ndegwa] Dedan Kimathi Univ Technol, Inst Geomat GIS & Remote Sensing, Nyeri, Kenya",,"Koech, G (corresponding author), Dedan Kimathi Univ Technol, Inst Geomat GIS & Remote Sensing, Nyeri, Kenya.",gracechero.gc@gmail.com,"Makokha, Godfrey/AAG-3998-2020",,,,,,13,11,11,2,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2363-6203,2363-6211,,MODEL EARTH SYST ENV,Model.

PAR tools and processes led to participatory diagnosis, conceptualizing of change, participatory identification, prioritization and implementation of specific strategies for climate change adaptation in the study sites. However, further studies are needed to investigate the effectiveness of these strategies. Practical implications - The PAR experiences show that stakeholders' involvement throughout the project needs to be considered by researchers who wish to enhance the adaptive capacity of the communities they work with. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the description of the process for enhancing adaptive capacity of forest living communities. Findings in this research may provide a crucial foundation for community-based adaptation measures and complement broader-scale scientific research with local precision.","[Bele, Mekou Youssoufa; Sonwa, Denis Jean] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Forests & Environm Programme, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Tiani, Anne Marie] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Livelihoods Programme, Yaounde, Cameroon",CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),"Bele, MY (corresponding author), Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Forests & Environm Programme, Yaounde, Cameroon.",b.youssoufa@cgiar.org,,,,,,,56,12,12,0,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

This study analyzes these framing processes in Brazil and Colombia by examining the translation of global prescriptions into tangible policy instruments. It combines a policy translation analytical framework with the processes of layering, drift, conversion, and replacement. It draws on semi-structured interviews with institutional actors and it examines (i) agenda-setting and elaboration of the NAPs, (ii) the different roles and interactions of sector-based actors in agriculture and land-use, and (iii) the distinct concepts of adaptation put forward and their subsequent policy outputs in relation to national institutional trajectories. In Brazil and Colombia, the initial ambition of mainstreaming climate adaptation into sector-based policies resulted in a divergent patchwork of policies, which is characterized by limited means, capacity and other resources dedicated to coordination and implementation. Key policy insights The study examines the processes through which international prescriptions influence concrete policy outcomes. The ambition of establishing new climate policies resulted in a patchwork of policies, characterized by low levels of coordination and limited means of implementation. In Brazil, adaptation goals were layered in with existing sector-based policies with some operational capacity, while in Colombia the national adoption of several adaptation goals has not translated into implementation. The article addresses the politics of policy transfer, knowledge interpretation, and policy change. It considers the possibility of actors interacting to reframe concepts according to their ideas and interests, while also aiming to assure stability. Climate policy requires efforts to alter policy priorities at the sector level, to create cross-sectoral balances, and strengthen the means of implementation, actions which intimately relate to power relations and institutional settings.","[Milhorance, Carolina; Sabourin, Eric; Le Coq, Jean-Francois] Agr Res Ctr Int Dev CIRAD, Dept Environm & Soc, Art Dev Res Unit, Montpellier, France; [Milhorance, Carolina; Sabourin, Eric] Univ Brasilia, Ctr Sustainable Dev CDS UnB, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Howland, Fanny; Le Coq, Jean-Francois] Int Ctr Trop Agr Alliance Biodivers CIAT, Cali, Colombia; [Sabourin, Eric; Le Coq, Jean-Francois] Montpellier Univ Excellence MUSE, Montpellier, France",CIRAD; Universidade de Brasilia; Universite de Montpellier,"Milhorance, C (corresponding author), Ctr Int Dev & Agr Res CIRAD, UMR Art Dev Dept Environm & Societies, Bur 309,TA C 113,73 Rue Jean Francois Breton, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",carolina.milhorance@cirad.fr,,"SABOURIN, Eric/0000-0002-1171-2535; Le Coq, Jean-Francois/0000-0003-1084-1973; Howland, Fanny/0000-0002-0778-2741",CNPq/Capes/FAPDF under the project INCT [16-2014 ODISSEIA]; French Association Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-17-CE03-0005],CNPq/Capes/FAPDF under the project INCT; French Association Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"This work was supported by CNPq/Capes/FAPDF under the project INCT [16-2014 ODISSEIA], by the French Association Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) under projects ARTIMIX [ANR-17-CE03-0005].",,78,3,3,5,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

J,,,,,,,APA Task Force Climate Change,Addressing the Climate Crisis: An Action Plan for Psychologists (Summary),AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST,,,English,Article,,,,,,climate change; climate justice; sustainability; mitigation; adaptation,ENERGY-CONSERVATION; CHANGE ADAPTATION; PLANETARY HEALTH; MENTAL-HEALTH; BEHAVIOR; JUSTICE,"Psychologists have conducted valuable work on the climate crisis and can make even greater contributions to understanding the crisis, mitigating and adapting to climate change, and achieving climate justice. This summary of the report from the American Psychological Association's (APA's) Task Force on Climate Change examines the multiple roles psychologists play in research, practice, education, advocacy, and communications related to the climate crisis and how APA can facilitate expansion of psychologists' work in these domains. The task force recommends that APA pursue a set of activities that will both (a) strengthen the field by encouraging a larger number of psychologists, across all specializations, to work on climate change and (b) broaden the impact of psychologists' work on climate change by supporting their engagement and collaborations with other fields and sectors. Further, the task force offers recommendations for how APA can help mitigate climate change by improving its own energy use and sustainability practices and encouraging improvements by other organizations and the public. Public Significance Statement Although the severity and urgency of the climate crisis should not be understated, it remains within the capacity of society to reduce its most adverse effects and to promote health, well-being, and justice for all people. Psychologists have the knowledge and skills to design and implement strategies that will help realize these aims. As a leading scientific and professional association, APA can prepare, support, and organize psychologists to address the climate crisis and amplify their work for greatest impact and visibility.","[APA Task Force Climate Change] Amer Psychol Assoc, Washington, DC 20036 USA",,,,,,,,,,131,0,0,7,8,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0003-066X,1935-990X,,AM PSYCHOL,Am.

However, green roof research and maintenance awareness in Malaysia are comparatively scarce, largely due to the absence of local tropical green roof guidelines. Therefore, this paper aims to explore current green roof maintenance practices and challenges for non-residential buildings in Malaysia through case studies and in-depth interviews. These results were then compared with three international green roof guidelines, namely those of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyor, Singapore's National Parks Board, and the US Environmental Protection Agency. The findings show that current green roof maintenance elements implemented in the case studies are insufficient and inadequate for Malaysia's tropical climate conditions. The paper recommends nine (9) green roof maintenance elements specific for non-residential buildings in Malaysia and the tropical climate: plant selection, rainwater harvesting system, pest control, monitoring performance, accessibility, irrigation cleaning, waterproofing membrane maintenance, plants and growing medium, and maintenance of outdoor furniture. As this paper has only included data from Kuala Lumpur, this limits the generalizability of the findings to other buildings in Malaysia and a tropical climate. The implications of this study may provide further direction for researchers to consider a larger sample size and other cities in a tropical climate. This study will allow policymakers and building stakeholders to develop suitable green roof maintenance guidelines.","[Zaid, Suzaini; Zaid, Laila Medina; Abu Hasan, Zahiruddin Fitri] Univ Malaya, Ctr Bldg Construct & Trop Architecture BuCTA, Fac Built Environm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Esfandiari, Masoud] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Architecture & Urban Planning, Tehran, Iran",Universiti Malaya; Shahid Beheshti University,"Zaid, S (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Ctr Bldg Construct & Trop Architecture BuCTA, Fac Built Environm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",suzaini_zaid@um.edu.my,"ABU HASSAN, ZAHIRUDDIN FITRI/AAI-2568-2019; MOHAMED ZAID, NOOR SUZAINI/B-9282-2010","ABU HASSAN, ZAHIRUDDIN FITRI/0000-0002-2002-4507; MOHAMED ZAID, NOOR SUZAINI/0000-0002-4979-0555","Fundamental Research Grant Scheme, Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia [FP002-2019A]","Fundamental Research Grant Scheme, Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia","This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme, Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia [FP002-2019A].",,67,3,3,2,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

The present study conducted in Vembanad lake in India attempted to identify and assess vulnerabilities of wetland fishers to climate variability at spatial scale. One hundred and eighty fishers distributed across three villages (Vaikkom, Muhamma and Thycattussery) who were representative of marine, freshwater and brackish water fishers, respectively, were surveyed based on a structured schedule prepared by National Innovations for Climate Resilient Agriculture and ICAR-Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute. Potential indicators of vulnerability as perceived from survey were segregated under seven drivers such as health, livelihood, social, food, ecological, resource and resource user. These indicators which were represented by attributes were scored, based on fishers' perception, and were used for identifying the highly contributing drivers of vulnerabilities. Kruskal-Wallis parametric test was used for analyzing the vulnerabilities statistically. The overall wetland vulnerability indices derived from various villages indicated that Thycattussery was highly vulnerable compared to Muhamma and Vaikkom. A transactional analysis across each sampling station indicated that in Vaikkom, fishers were less vulnerable to resource, food security and resource user vulnerabilities in a climate changing context. Poor status of livelihood, social and food related insecurities and resource user-based uncertainties were the factors attributing to fishers' vulnerability in Thycattussery. The fishers of Muhamma experienced greater ecological and resource-based vulnerabilities. The study suggested that a bottom-up approach involving the primary stakeholders (fishers) along with the community will adequately position them to climate change adaptation and mitigation.","[Paul, Thankam Theresa; Manoharan, S.; Ganeshan, Kuberan] ICAR CIFRI, Kochi, India; [Sarkar, U.

This qualitative case study was conducted on both strawberry growers and agricultural experts to explore the perceived causes, evidence and impacts of climate change, adaptation strategies used by farmers, and constraints and drivers of climate-smart agriculture development on the strawberry farms in Kurdistan province, Western Iran. Findings indicated that the causes of climate change could be divided into anthropogenic and natural forces. Decreased precipitation, increased temperature, dust storms, greenhouse gases, forest fires, spring frosts, severe hail, floods and droughts comprised the most notable climate change evidence in the region. Both groups confirmed the impacts of climate change on the reduction in strawberry yield, increasing the perishability of the fruits, poverty, migration and other social problems. Adaptation strategies used by farmers are classified into technical-agricultural, water conservation, farm smartening, and institutional adaptation practices. However, poverty, the shortage of strawberry-processing industries, insufficient financial support, the presence of intermediaries and brokers, traditional cultivation, difficulties in shipping strawberry crops to the market, the lack of storage facilities and equipment and the export terminal along with the mistrust of strawberry growers in the agricultural organization hinder climate-smart agriculture development in the study area. Finally, several drivers were proposed, which were considered the basis for providing practical suggestions for planning and policy making for climate-smart agriculture development in strawberry farms.","[Memarbashi, Payam; Mojarradi, Gholamreza] Univ Zanjan, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Extens Commun & Rural Dev, Zanjan 4537138791, Iran; [Keshavarz, Marzieh] Payame Noor Univ, Agr Extens & Educ, Tehran 193954697, Iran",University Zanjan; Payame Noor University,"Memarbashi, P (corresponding author), Univ Zanjan, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Extens Commun & Rural Dev, Zanjan 4537138791, Iran.",payammbs@gmail.com,,,"University of Zanjan, Iran","University of Zanjan, Iran","This research was funded by the vice chancellor for research of University of Zanjan, Iran.",,83,1,1,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2022,14,23,,,,,,,15573,10.3390/su142315573,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142315573,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6Y7UD,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000897294800001,View Full Record in Web of Science
