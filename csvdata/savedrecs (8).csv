J,"Manatsa, D; Unganai, L; Gadzirai, C; Behera, SK",,,,"Manatsa, Desmond; Unganai, Leonard; Gadzirai, Christopher; Behera, Swadhin K.",,,An innovative tailored seasonal rainfall forecasting production in Zimbabwe,NATURAL HAZARDS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Tailored seasonal rainfall forecast; Zimbabwe farmers; Maize yield; Indian Ocean Dipole; El Nino Southern Oscillation,SOUTH-AFRICA; DROUGHT; FARMERS; IMPACTS,"Farmers' adaptation to climate change over southern Africa may become an elusive concept if adequate attention is not rendered to the most important adaptive tool, the regional seasonal forecasting system. Uptake of the convectional seasonal rainfall forecasts issued through the southern African regional climate outlook forum process in Zimbabwe is very low, most probably due to an inherent poor forecast skill and inadequate lead time. Zimbabwe's recurrent droughts are never in forecast, and the bias towards near normal conditions is almost perpetual. Consequently, the forecasts are poorly valued by the farmers as benefits accrued from these forecasts are minimal. The dissemination process is also very complicated, resulting in the late and distorted reception. The probabilistic nature of the forecast renders it difficult to interpret by the farmers, hence the need to review the whole system. An innovative approach to a regional seasonal forecasting system developed through a participatory process so as to offer a practically possible remedial option is described in this paper. The main added advantage over the convectional forecast is that the new forecast system carries with it, predominantly binary forecast information desperately needed by local farmers-whether a drought will occur in a given season. Hence, the tailored forecast is easier for farmers to understand and act on compared to the conventional method of using tercile probabilities. It does not only provide a better forecasting skill, but gives additional indications of the intra-seasonal distribution of the rainfall including onsets, cessations, wet spell and dry spell locations for specific terciles. The lead time is more than 3 months, which is adequate for the farmers to prepare their land well before the onset of the rains. Its simplicity renders it relatively easy to use, with model inputs only requiring the states of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) climate modes. The developed forecast system could be one way to enhance management of risks and opportunities in rain-fed agriculture among small-holder farmers not only in Zimbabwe but also throughout the SADC region where the impact of ENSO and/or IOD on a desired station rainfall is significant.","[Manatsa, Desmond] Bindura Univ Sci, Dept Geog, Bindura, Zimbabwe; [Manatsa, Desmond] Abdus Salaam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, I-34151 Trieste, Italy; [Manatsa, Desmond; Behera, Swadhin K.] Univ Tokyo, Dept Ocean Technol Policy & Environm, Tokyo, Japan; [Manatsa, Desmond; Behera, Swadhin K.] Res Inst Global Change JAMSTEC, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Unganai, Leonard] Minist Environm, Environm Management Agcy, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Gadzirai, Christopher] Bindura Univ Sci, Dept Agr, Bindura, Zimbabwe",Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP); University of Tokyo; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC),"Manatsa, D (corresponding author), Bindura Univ Sci, Dept Geog, Bindura, Zimbabwe.",dmanatsa@gmail.com,"Behera, Swadhin/B-7839-2009","Behera, Swadhin/0000-0001-8692-2388",UNDP; Bindura University,UNDP; Bindura University,"Funding for this research has been provided through UNDP sponsored 'Coping with Drought and Climate Change Project' in Zimbabwe.

It affects food and nutrition security and undermines current efforts to reduce hunger and promote nutrition. Undernutrition in turn undermines climate resilience and the coping strategies of vulnerable populations. Objectives: The objectives of this paper are to identify and undertake a cross-sectoral analysis of the impacts of climate change on nutrition security and the existing mechanisms, strategies, and policies to address them. Methods: A cross-sectoral analysis of the impacts of climate change on nutrition security and the mechanisms and policies to address them was guided by an analytical framework focused on the three 'underlying causes' of undernutrition: 1) household food access, 2) maternal and child care and feeding practices, 3) environmental health and health access. The analytical framework includes the interactions of the three underlying causes of undernutrition with climate change,vulnerability, adaptation and mitigation. Results: Within broad efforts on climate change mitigation and adaptation and climate-resilient development, a combination of nutrition-sensitive adaptation and mitigation measures, climate-resilient and nutrition-sensitive agricultural development, social protection, improved maternal and child care and health, nutrition-sensitive risk reduction and management, community development measures, nutrition-smart investments, increased policy coherence, and institutional and cross-sectoral collaboration are proposed as a means to address the impacts of climate change to food and nutrition security. This paper proposes policy directions to address nutrition in the climate change agenda and recommendations for consideration by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Conclusions: Nutrition and health stakeholders need to be engaged in key climate change adaptation and mitigation initiatives, including science-based assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and policies and actions formulated by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Improved multi-sectoral coordination and political will is required to integrate nutrition-sensitive actions into climate-resilient sustainable development efforts in the UNFCCC work and in the post 2015 development agenda. Placing human rights at the center of strategies to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change and international solidarity is essential to advance sustainable development and to create a climate for nutrition security.","[Tirado, M.

Here we explore the extent to which local place-based knowledge is used and is relevant to understanding and appropriately responding to place-based climate variability and change (specifically rainfall) in an area of considerable rainfall variability in south-western Tanzania. Primary data were collected using focus group discussions and household questionnaire surveys, and secondary data obtained from government institutions. Various changes associated with the frequency, intensity and consistency of rainfall during the period 1960 to 2014 are explored. Findings indicate that knowledge and perceptions associated with climate operate at a local level, and that these are not necessarily applicable to neighbouring regions. Smallholder farmers in the Great Ruaha River Sub-Basin rely on incremental adaptations of agricultural practices, in response to climatic stresses which have long-term implications. We argue that incremental adaptations ought to be supplemented by more transformative changes of existing agricultural practices, such as using more climate-adapted crops and livestock. Moreover, caution is required when examining human perceptions and responses to climate variability and change at the site-specific scale, as such findings may not necessarily be applicable to broader regions in all cases.","[Pauline, Noah Makula] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Inst Resource Assessment, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Pauline, Noah Makula; Grab, Stefan] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Dar es Salaam; University of Witwatersrand,"Pauline, NM (corresponding author), Univ Dar Es Salaam, Inst Resource Assessment, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.;Pauline, NM (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa.",makulanoah@yahoo.com,"Pauline, Noah Makula/ABD-3692-2020","Pauline, Noah Makula/0000-0001-6560-2932",Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA),Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA),"We appreciate funding from the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), under the project titled 'Impacts of Climate Change on Water Resources and Agriculture - and adaptation strategies in Tanzania (CLIVET)'.

The assessment serves two purposes. First, it shows how information can support decisions. Second, decision criteria put leads on what information is required. This is helpful to identify unavailable information. We show by an example from a land-slide prone area in Norway how a relatively reliable estimate of the probability of slides ends up in a rather uncertain estimate of the risk. Uncertainty about the risk represented by natural hazards imply great challenges to the development of adaptation policies to meet climate change, but they are required. We develop a simplified criterion for optimal adaptation, and estimate the added social value required to defend development in hazard prone areas instead of developing a risk-free alternative. The value is estimated between 0 and 0.40 Euros per Euro invested in the case area, depending on type of slide, category of asset and other costs that occur in the wake of slides.","[Aaheim, Asbjorn; Romstad, Bard; Saelen, Hakon] Univ Oslo, CICERO, N-0318 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Aaheim, A (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, CICERO, POB 1129, N-0318 Oslo, Norway.",asbjorn.aaheim@cicco.uio.no,"Romstad, Bård/A-5484-2009",,,,,,12,3,3,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

In this study, different climate adaptation measures and their ecosystem services were categorized into green, blue, and grey categories and weight was given to each category based on their impact on the microclimate. This study took place in the Hillesluis district in the city of Rotterdam and the Paddepoel district in the city of Groningen. In Rotterdam, 21 streets, composed of 42 street segments, were assessed. In Groningen, 17 streets, composed of 45 street segments, were assessed. The available ecosystem services of each street segment were scored from 0-100. The scorecard method that was developed and tested during this study provided insight in the variation of available ecosystem services of streets and street segments. Individual street scores were very low in the city of Rotterdam and ranged between 3 and 50, with the average score for the street segments of 29. In Groningen, the scores were considerably higher with a range between 23 and 70, with an average score of 47 per street segment. The presence of larger green trees, front yards, and facade gardens in the green category are the most distinctive variable, while adaptation measures in the blue category were absent in both cities. The scorecard proved to be very useful in the adaptation labeling of street segments and entire streets. After assessing a neighborhood, the least adaptive streets can be identified relatively easy. Based on the score a label can be given between A+++ and G. The scorecard informs residents and decision makers about which streets are most adaptive and which streets have an adaptation potential. The method can easily be duplicated and used by local governments and community groups to have better insight in the level of climate adaptation of their street. Labels for entire streets can be used to create awareness and encourage residents to take action and expand the number of climate adaptation measures in their street.","[Heikoop, Rick; Idahmanen, Aniss; de Ruiter, Pascal] Rotterdam Univ Appl Sci, Fac Water Management, GJ de Jonghweg 46, NL-3015 GG Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Heikoop, Rick; Oosthoek, Elma; van der Heijden, Angela] Rotterdam Univ Appl Sci, Ctr Expertise Social Innovat EMI Rotterdam, Hillevliet 90, NL-3074 KD Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Heikoop, Rick] Rotterdam Univ Appl Sci, RDM Ctr Expertise, Heijplaatstr 23, NL-3089 JB Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Boogaard, Floris] Hanze Univ Appl Sci, Ctr Appl Res & Innovat Area Dev, NoorderRuimte, Zernikepl 7, NL-9701 DA Groningen, Netherlands; [Boogaard, Floris] Energy Acad Europe, Global Ctr Adaptat, Nijenborgh 6, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands",,"Heikoop, R (corresponding author), Rotterdam Univ Appl Sci, Fac Water Management, GJ de Jonghweg 46, NL-3015 GG Rotterdam, Netherlands.;Heikoop, R (corresponding author), Rotterdam Univ Appl Sci, Ctr Expertise Social Innovat EMI Rotterdam, Hillevliet 90, NL-3074 KD Rotterdam, Netherlands.;Heikoop, R (corresponding author), Rotterdam Univ Appl Sci, RDM Ctr Expertise, Heijplaatstr 23, NL-3089 JB Rotterdam, Netherlands.",heith@hr.nl,"Boogaard, Floris/V-6308-2019","Boogaard, Floris/0000-0002-1434-4838; Heikoop, Teunis Hendrik/0000-0001-9055-4602","Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union; IMPETUS project, Innovative Measurement Tool towards Urban Environmental Awareness; SIA-RAAK grant from the Taskforce for Applied Research SIA within the project Citizen Participation in Climate Adaptation; Centre of Expertise Social Innovation (EMI) in Rotterdam; Research atelier Urban Cool Island; Municipality Rotterdam; Municipality Groningen; European Commission","Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union; IMPETUS project, Innovative Measurement Tool towards Urban Environmental Awareness; SIA-RAAK grant from the Taskforce for Applied Research SIA within the project Citizen Participation in Climate Adaptation; Centre of Expertise Social Innovation (EMI) in Rotterdam; Research atelier Urban Cool Island; Municipality Rotterdam; Municipality Groningen; European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre)","This study would not have been possible without funding from the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union and collaboration within the IMPETUS project, Innovative Measurement Tool towards Urban Environmental Awareness, the SIA-RAAK grant from the Taskforce for Applied Research SIA within the project Citizen Participation in Climate Adaptation and without the support of the Centre of Expertise Social Innovation (EMI) in Rotterdam and the research atelier Urban Cool Island.

Climate information services (CIS) are crucial enablers in adapting to climate change and managing climate-related risks by smallholder farmers. Even though various gender groups have distinct preferences, understandings, and uses of CIS, which affect adaptation decisions differently, there is little research on gender perspectives of CIS. This study employs a novel intra-household survey of 156 married couples to evaluate the gender-differentiated effects of CIS access on the adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) technologies in Kenya. The findings reveal gender differences in access to CIS, with husbands having significantly more access to early warning systems and advisory services on adaptation. In contrast, wives had better access to weather forecasts. About 38% of wives perceived that CIS meets their needs, compared to 30% of husbands. As for CIS dissemination pathways, husbands preferred extension officers, print media, television, and local leaders, whereas wives preferred radio and social groups. Recursive bivariate probit analysis shows that trust in CIS, a bundle of CIS dissemination pathways, access to credit, and membership in a mixed-gender social group, affected access to CIS for both genders. Access to early warning systems and advisory services positively affected decisions to adopt CSA by both genders. Still, access to seasonal forecasts influenced husbands' decisions to adopt CSA but not wives. Besides, there were gender differences in how CIS affected each CSA technology based on gendered access to resources and roles and responsibilities in a household. It is necessary to disseminate CIS through gender-sensitive channels that can satisfy the needs and preferences of different gender groups to encourage the adoption of climate-smart technologies.","[Ngigi, Marther W.; Muange, Elijah N.] Machakos Univ, Dept Agr Sci, POB 136-90100, Machakos, Kenya",,"Ngigi, MW (corresponding author), Machakos Univ, Dept Agr Sci, POB 136-90100, Machakos, Kenya.",m_ngigi@mksu.ac.ke,"Ngigi, Marther/CAF-7391-2022","Ngigi, Marther/0000-0003-3479-7938",Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development through the Center for Development Research (ZEF),Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development through the Center for Development Research (ZEF),This work was supported by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development through the Center for Development Research (ZEF).,,50,0,0,6,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

With the UK parliament tasked with passing legislation to mitigate against and adapt to climate change, it is well placed to take a lead in implementing policies that reduce the impact of climate change on mental health and even provide mental health benefits (e.g., by increasing access to green space). The extent to which the UK parliament considers the relationship between climate change and mental health in its decision-making was previously unknown. We report, through quantitative thematic analysis of the UK Hansard database, that the UK parliament has only infrequently made links between climate change and mental health. Where links have been made, the primary focus of the speeches were around flooding and anxiety. Key mental health impacts of climate change reported in the academic literature, such as high temperature and suicides, or experiences of eco-anxiety, were found to be missing entirely. Further, policies suggested in UK parliament to minimise the impact of climate change on mental health were focused on pushing adaptation measures such as flood defences rather than climate mitigation, indicating potential missed opportunities for effective policies with co-benefits for tackling climate change and mental health simultaneously. Therefore, this research suggests a need to raise awareness for UK policymakers of the costs of climate inaction on mental health, and potential co-benefits of climate action on mental health. Our results provide insight into where links have and have not been made to date, to inform targeted awareness raising and ultimately equip policymakers to protect the UK from the increasingly large impacts of climate change on mental health.","[Pirkle, Lucy T.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Brain Sci, London, England; [Jennings, Neil; Lawrance, Emma L.] Imperial Coll London, Grantham Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Vercammen, Ans] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London, England; [Vercammen, Ans] Univ Queensland, Sch Commun & Arts, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Lawrance, Emma L.] Imperial Coll London, Inst Global Hlth Innovat, London, England; [Lawrance, Emma L.] Mental Hlth Innovat, London, England",Imperial College London; Imperial College London; Imperial College London; University of Queensland; Imperial College London,"Pirkle, LT (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Brain Sci, London, England.",l.pirkle20@imperial.ac.uk,,"Jennings, Neil/0000-0002-8039-6839",,,,,37,0,0,14,14,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-2565,,FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH,Front.

Greening policies and projects are being applied at both the citywide and the neigh-bourhood level for various reasons, such as adaptation to climate change and the improvement of housing and living conditions as well as wellbeing and health. Urban policies, plans, and programmes have increasingly employed greening strategies to make urban neighbourhoods more attractive, to improve quality of life, and to provide residents with recreational space. At the same time, greening is increasingly exploited by market -oriented regeneration and construction strategies. The new critical debates on eco-gentrification-or distribu-tional, procedural, and interactional injustices-are discussing emerging conflicts or trade-offs between green regeneration and the social or housing market impacts, as well as analysing the role of greening and green regeneration with respect to the (re)production of socio-spatial inequalities and injustices.Set against this background, our paper provides a comparative analysis of two cases-L acute accent odz acute accent Stare Polesie (Poland) and Leipzig's inner east (Germany)-and has a threefold purpose: first, it seeks to analyse in-terconnections between greening policies and justice concerns. To operationalise the aforementioned in-terconnections, we will, second, develop an operational model that looks at interconnections as a process and applies a justice perspective that focuses on a multidimensional, intersectional, relational, and context-and policy-sensitive understanding of justice. Third, the paper seeks to detect how a contrasting comparison can help us to come to a better and more comprehensive understanding of the interconnections between green regen-eration and justice.

The volume to be granted as permanent and eventual WURs is calculated from streamflow records, if stream gauge data are available, or from hydrologic parameter transfer from gauged to ungauged catchments, usually with less than 50 years of record. To test the performance of this allocation system, while analyzing the long-term natural variability in water resources, we investigated a 400 year-long (1590-2015) tree-ring reconstruction of runoff and historical water rights for Perquilauquen at Quella catchment, a tributary to the Maule River in Central Chile (35 degrees S-36 degrees 305). Furthermore, we assess how the current legislation would perform under a projected climate scenario, based on historical climate simulations of runoff calibrated against observed data, and future projections. Our analyses indicate that the allocation methodology currently applied by the Water Authority in Chile is very sensitive to the time window of data used, which leads to an underestimation of variability and long-term trends. According to the WURs database provided by the Chilean Water Directorate, WURs at Perquilauquen at Quella are already over-allocated. Considering regional climate projections, this condition will be exacerbated in the future. Furthermore, serious problems regarding the access and quality of information on already-granted WURs and actual water usage have been diagnosed, which further encumber environmental strategies to deal with and adapt to climate change. We emphasize the urgent need for a review and revision of current water allocation methodologies and water law in Chile, which are not concordant with the dynamics and non-stationarity of hydrological processes. Water scarcity and water governance are two of the key issues to be faced by Chile in the Anthropocene.","[Barria, Pilar] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Forestales & Conservac Nat, Santiago, Chile; [Rojas, Maisa; Bozkurt, Deniz] Univ Chile, Dept Geofis, Santiago, Chile; [Barria, Pilar; Rojas, Maisa; Moraga, Pilar; Murnoz, Ariel; Bozkurt, Deniz; Alvarez-Garreton, Camila] FONDAP15110009, Ctr Climate & Resilience Res, CR2, Valdivia, Chile; [Moraga, Pilar] Univ Chile, Ctr Derecho Arnbiental, Santiago, Chile; [Murnoz, Ariel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Geog, Valparaiso, Chile; [Alvarez-Garreton, Camila] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Conservac Biodiversidad & Terr, Valdivia, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Universidad de Chile; Universidad de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso; Universidad Austral de Chile,"Barria, P (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Forestales & Conservac Nat, Santiago, Chile.;Barria, P (corresponding author), FONDAP15110009, Ctr Climate & Resilience Res, CR2, Valdivia, Chile.",pbarria@uchile.cl,"Barria, Pilar A/L-2535-2018; Rojas, Maisa/A-7229-2013; Bozkurt, Deniz/AAC-4563-2021; Moraga, Pilar/AAD-8718-2020","Barria, Pilar A/0000-0001-6496-1204; Rojas, Maisa/0000-0002-5985-1905; Bozkurt, Deniz/0000-0003-1021-8241; Munoz Navarro, Ariel/0000-0002-1719-4900",Center for Climate and Resilience Research (CR2) [CONICYT/FONDAP/15110009]; FONDECYT [3170428],Center for Climate and Resilience Research (CR2); FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),"This research emerged from the collaboration with many colleagues at the Center for Climate and Resilience Research (CR2, CONICYT/FONDAP/15110009).

In this study we compared four different model concepts: artificial neural networks (ANN), fuzzy logic (FL), an index model (IM, using light use efficiency and water use efficiency) and the process based model FORGRO. The models were tested on a 2-year data set of carbon and water fluxes of a Douglas-fir forest, 1 year before and 1 year after a thinning. The potentials of the model concepts for application for four research goals were assessed in relation to the obtained results and in a more general context: measurement fitting, insight into the importance of processes and mechanisms, simulation of climate change effects and up-scaling of forest responses to regional scale. For measurement fitting ANN and FL showed the highest potentials, mainly because of their high number of fitting parameters. IM and FORGRO showed a satisfactory model performance, although systematic errors were detectable. Insight into forest ecosystem functioning was difficult with ANN, but FL, IM and FORGRO showed clear interpretability of the effects of the thinning in terms of ecosystem functioning. FORGRO has the highest potentials for reliable estimation of effects of climate change on forests like Speuld, although the incorporation of adaptation to climate change in the model formulation is a major problem unsolved. For up-scaling FL and ANN can be used effectively if they are parameterised on a range of forests rather than one forest as in this study. IM showed potentials for linking the model parameters to variables characterising forest ecosystems like leaf area index, and thereby for large-scale applications. The discussion showed that the application of a set of totally different models can increase our knowledge of forest functioning. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Therefore, rural residents experience large income and consumption fluctuations when dealing with climate change risks. However, little is known about whether digital financial inclusion can help rural residents improve their ability to resist climate change. This study uses the Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index of China and China Household Finance Survey data, together with historical temperature data from major cities, to study the impact of digital financial inclusion on Chinese rural residents' consumption in response to climate change. The results suggest that digital financial inclusion significantly promotes rural households' total consumption and consumption upgrades. Heterogeneity analyses also show that digital financial inclusion predominantly affects low-income households, low-asset households, and households living in China's central and western regions. The instrumental variable and control function methods were used for robustness, and our main conclusions are robust and reliable. Although climate change reduces rural residents' consumption and increases their risks, digital finance inclusion significantly mitigates this negative effect. The government can increase the usage depth of digital financial inclusion in rural areas by promoting the construction of digital financial inclusion facilities. The government should strive to deepen the impact of digital financial inclusion on rural household income and consumption to further improve their ability to resist climate risks.","[He, Chunyan] Xihua Univ, Sch Econ, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Weisong] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Tailong Finance Sch, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Yu, Junlin] Yonsei Univ, Sch Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea",Xihua University; Zhejiang Gongshang University; Yonsei University,"Qiu, WS (corresponding author), Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Tailong Finance Sch, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.",qiuweisong1992@163.com,,,Research Center of Scientific Finance and Entrepreneurial Finance of the Ministry of Education of Sichuan Province [KJJR 2021-004],Research Center of Scientific Finance and Entrepreneurial Finance of the Ministry of Education of Sichuan Province,The Research Center of Scientific Finance and Entrepreneurial Finance of the Ministry of Education of Sichuan Province (No. KJJR 2021-004).,,50,1,1,36,49,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

Current long-term change projections are often based on changes to mangrove extent; however, this may overlook fragmentation and the associated habitat resilience decline and therefore fail to adequately reveal the risks to mangrove habitats. A mangrove sustainability index (MSI) was proposed in this study to assess the impact of SLR and land use on mangrove habitats. The index consists of four components: habitat area change, habitat quality, landscape pattern, and protection ratio. Ecological models and landscape models were combined to calculate the MSI. Considering the SLR under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 and land use strategies, four scenarios were set with prediction periods of base year (2020) to 2050 and 2100. The Leizhou Peninsula, China was used as the case study. The results showed that dual stressors would reduce the extent of mangroves by 16.6%-56.2%. Habitat quality was sensitive to land use change but was not affected by SLR. Landscape pattern and protection ratio were influenced by SLR but less effected by land use. In all scenarios, mangroves tended to migrate out of the protected areas, with protection ratio decreasing from 37% to 16.9%-29.9%. Newly expanding habitats may suffer from patch fragmentation and low connectivity. Unsustainable mangrove distribution sites on Leizhou Peninsula were identified as hotspots for management. Projections under different scenarios showed that some unsustainable sites could be reversed to sustainable sites through improvements in land use policies. The proposed approach could provide essential tools for the formulation of mangrove conservation and resto-ration strategies adapted to climate change.","[Liang, Shanshan; Hu, Wenjia; Su, Shangke; Chen, Guangcheng; Chen, Shunyang; Xie, Bin; Du, Jianguo; Chen, Bin] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 3, Key Lab Marine Ecol Conservat & Restorat, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Liang, Shanshan; Liu, Wenhua] Shantou Univ, Inst Marine Sci, Shantou 515063, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jie] Natl Marine Data & Informat Serv, Tianjin 300171, Peoples R China; [Chen, Guangcheng; Chen, Shunyang; Du, Jianguo; Chen, Bin] Minist Nat Resources, Observat & Res Stn Coastal Wetland Ecosyst Beibu G, Beihai 536015, Peoples R China",Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Shantou University; National Marine Data & Information Service; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China,"Hu, WJ; Chen, B (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 3, Key Lab Marine Ecol Conservat & Restorat, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",huwenjia@tio.org.cn; chenbin@tio.org.cn,"su, shangke/GZG-3518-2022","Xie, Bin/0000-0003-4166-7541",National Natural Science Foundation of China; Provincial Natural Science Foundation of Fujian;  [41906127];  [42076163];  [2020J05078],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Provincial Natural Science Foundation of Fujian(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); ; ; ,This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41906127 and 42076163) and the Provincial Natural Science Foundation of Fujian (2020J05078) .,,106,0,0,33,33,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

CLARREO measurements establish new climate change benchmarks with high absolute radiometric accuracy and high statistical confidence across a wide range of essential climate variables. CLARREO's inherently high absolute accuracy will be verified and traceable on orbit to Systeme Internationale (SI) units. The benchmarks established by CLARREO will be critical for assessing changes in the Earth system and climate model predictive capabilities for decades into the future as society works to meet the challenge of optimizing strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change. The CLARREO benchmarks are derived from measurements of the Earth's thermal infrared spectrum (5-50 m), the spectrum of solar radiation reflected by the Earth and its atmosphere (320-2300 nm), and radio occultation refractivity from which accurate temperature profiles are derived. The mission has the ability to provide new spectral fingerprints of climate change, as well as to provide the first orbiting radiometer with accuracy sufficient to serve as the reference transfer standard for other space sensors, in essence serving as a NIST [National Institute of Standards and Technology] in orbit. CLARREO will greatly improve the accuracy and relevance of a wide range of space-borne instruments for decadal climate change. Finally, CLARREO has developed new metrics and methods for determining the accuracy requirements of climate observations for a wide range of climate variables and uncertainty sources. These methods should be useful for improving our understanding of observing requirements for most climate change observations.","[Wielicki, Bruce A.; Young, D. F.; Mlynczak, M.

Based on its ability to separate algal particles, dissolved air flotation (DAF) is considered as a climate change adaptation technology for water treatment. The feasibility of DAF treatment is often assessed using DAF jar tests; however, they are not particularly good at predicting a full-scale DAF system's turbidity removals. Therefore, our group has developed a more reliable larger-diameter/larger-volume batch apparatus (LB-DAF), which was optimized by comparison with a full-scale DAF plant treating a low turbidity, highly coloured river water (SUVA similar to 4.3). The objective of this study was to verify that the LB-DAF was capable of simulating full-scale DAF systems treating two significantly different waters. One was water from a large eutrophic bay in Lake Ontario (SUVA similar to 2.6) and the second was a river water (SUVA similar to 3.5). The turbidity removals achieved by the full-scale DAF systems treating these waters were compared with those for the LB-DAF tests conducted using different flocculation velocity gradients, saturated water pressures, recycle ratios and water depth to diameter ratios. The LB-DAF tests are good predictors of the full-scale DAF turbidity removals, the average difference for the two waters tested were 2% and 6%. The LB-DAF natural organic matter (NOM) removals for both waters differed by less than 1% from that measured at the corresponding treatment plants.

The purpose of this study is to predict the impact of climate change on groundwater recharge in an arid environment in Ilam Province, west of Iran. Design/methodology/approach A three-dimensional transient groundwater flow model (modular finite difference groundwater FLOW model: MODFLOW) was used to simulate the impacts of three climate scenarios (i.e. an average of a long-term rainfall, predicted rainfall in 2015-2030 and three years moving average rainfall) on groundwater recharge and groundwater levels. Various climate scenarios in Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator were applied to predict weather data. Findings HadCM3 climatic model and A2 emission scenario were selected as the best methods for weather data generation. Based on the results of these models, annual precipitation will decrease by 3 per cent during 2015-2030. For three emission scenarios, i.e. an average of a long-term rainfall, predicted rainfall in 2015-2030 and three years moving average rainfall, precipitation in 2030 is estimated to be 265, 257 and 247 mm, respectively. For the studied aquifer, predicted recharge will decrease compared to recharge calculated based on the average of long-term rainfall. Originality/value The decline of groundwater level in the study area was 11.45 m during the past 24 years or 0.48 m/year. Annual groundwater depletion should increase to 0.75 m in the coming 16 years via climate change. Climate change adaptation policies in the basin should include changing the crop type, as well as water productivity and irrigation efficiency enhancement at the farm and regional scales.","[Ghazavi, Reza; Ebrahimi, Haidar] Univ Kashan, Fac Nat Resources & Earth Sci, Dept Watershed Management, Kashan, Iran",University Kashan,"Ghazavi, R (corresponding author), Univ Kashan, Fac Nat Resources & Earth Sci, Dept Watershed Management, Kashan, Iran.",ghazavi@kashanu.ac.ir,,,University of Kashan,University of Kashan,This work was supported by the University of Kashan.

The research involved a four-year study with 425 smallholder households, selected purposively based on high levels of food insecurity and/or positive HIV status. The households carried out agroecological experiments of their own choosing over a four-year period. Baseline (n = 306) and follow-up (n = 352) surveys were conducted in 2011 and 2013 respectively to assess changes in farming practices, food security, crop diversity and dietary diversity. Longitudinal mixed effects models were used with 203 matched households to estimate determinants of change in food security and dietary diversity at the population level. Qualitative interviews and focus groups were also conducted to provide depth to the survey findings. The findings show that participatory agroecology experimentation increased intercropping, legume diversification and the addition of compost, manure and crop residue amendments to the soil. Intercropping was associated with food security and the use of organic soil amendments was associated with gains in dietary diversity in bivariate analysis. Household food security and dietary diversity increased significantly over a 2-year period. Importantly, multivariate models showed that spousal discussion about farming was strongly associated with increased household food security and dietary diversity. Households who discussed farming with their spouse were 2.4 times more likely to be food secure and have diverse diets. Addition of compost or manure to the soil significantly influenced dietary diversity. These findings indicate that poor, vulnerable farmers can use agroecological methods to effectively improve food and nutritional security in sub-Saharan Africa. The study also highlights how linking agroecology to participatory research approaches that promote farmer experimentation and gender equity also lead to greater health and well-being. The study sheds light on how agroecological approaches can rapidly improve food security and dietary diversity, even under conditions of acute social, health or ecological stress. It draws attention to issues of equity and farmer-led approaches in addressing food security and nutrition.","[Kerr, Rachel Bezner] Cornell Univ, Dept Dev Sociol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Kangmennaang, Joseph] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Dakishoni, Laifolo; Lupafya, Esther; Shumba, Lizzie; Msachi, Rodgers; Chitaya, Annita; Maona, Esther; Gondwe, Tinkani; Nkhonjera, Paul] Soils Food & Hlth Commun Org SFHC, Ekwendeni, Malawi; [Nyantakyi-Frimpong, Hanson] Univ Denver, Denver, CO USA; [Boateng, Godfred Odei] Harvard Univ, Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Snapp, Sieglinde S.] Michigan State Univ, Plant Soil & Microbial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Luginaah, Isaac] Western Univ, Dept Geog, London, ON, Canada",Cornell University; University of Waterloo; University of Denver; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

These changes will be a function of the projected changes not only in weather-related hazard activity due to climate change but also in the vulnerability of the built environment and the aggregate value of assets exposed due to the growth of communities and associated increased concentrations of wealth. Tools developed for the insurance industry over the past three decades to assist decision-makers in estimating and managing catastrophe insurance risk can be adapted to assess the impact of these changes. This paper presents a probabilistic method for undertaking cost-benefit analyses of proposed building adaptation measures using these insurance-based models. The approach accounts for the direct and indirect cost of disasters on a community, including the transfer of risk through insurance and the associated aleatory and epistemic risks. A simplified hypothetical case study focussed on the impact of potential changes to structural design standards for tropical cyclone winds is presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed approach.","[Walker, George R.; Musulin, Rade T.] Aon Benfield, Asia Pacific, Level 29,201 Kent St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; [Walker, George R.; Mason, Matthew S.] Queensland Univ Technol, Civil Engn & Built Environm, Gardens Point Campus,2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Crompton, Ryan P.] Macquarie Univ, Risk Frontiers, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Macquarie University,"Walker, GR (corresponding author), Aon Benfield, Asia Pacific, Level 29,201 Kent St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia.;Walker, GR (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Civil Engn & Built Environm, Gardens Point Campus,2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",george.walker@aonbenfield.com; matthew.mason@uq.edu.au; ryan.crompton@mq.edu.au; rmusulin@sprynet.com,"Mason, Matthew S/HPF-5216-2023","Mason, Matthew S/0000-0003-4622-693X",,,,,48,8,8,0,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1573-2479,1744-8980,,STRUCT INFRASTRUCT E,Struct.

To address emerging issues like climate change, it is vital to find a way to understand and approach multiple, intersecting axes of identity that shape how impacts will be distributed and experienced.

Mapping the climate and land use change impact for urban heat events should set the agenda for adaptation planning at the local scale. Literature on urban heat mapping does not reveal a clear indicator to visualise the urban heat impacts that includes consequences of land use and climate changes for planning purposes. This paper introduces a stepwise approach to develop a single complex indicator to map the urban heat impact for local climate adaptation planning processes. Information on climatic drivers and land use characteristics are combined and projected for future land use and climate change impacts. Next, several visualisation techniques are developed to investigate which techniques are most effective to visualise complex information with multiple variables in one visualisation. A usability test is performed to investigate how indicator and map meet the information and communication needs of policy makers. Our findings reveal that it is important to add information on future impacts to set the agenda for adaptation planning at the local scale. Applying cartographic techniques in a map series presentation has proven to be effective to map complex information in a single image and fulfil most of the identified information needs. Based on our finding, we introduce the information enrichment chain as a promising approach to support local adaptation planning.","[de Groot-Reichwein, M. A. M.; van Lammeren, R. J.

Climate change may alter this environment, especially in the longer term, causing an acceleration of reinforcement corrosion that will affect the safety and serviceability of concrete infrastructure in Australia, US, Europe, China and elsewhere. This paper reviews advanced simulation procedures to predict increases in damage (corrosion) risks under a changing climate in Australia in terms of changes in probability of reinforcement corrosion initiation and corrosion induced damage due to (i) increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, and changes to (ii) temperature and (iii) humidity. These time and spatial variables will affect the penetration of aggressive agents CO2 and chlorides into concrete, and the corrosion rate once corrosion initiation occurs. The effectiveness of adaptation measures for new and existing buildings, bridges, and other concrete infrastructure is then assessed. Carbonation-induced damage risks may increase by more than 16% which means that one in six structures will experience additional and costly corrosion damage by 2100. We show that the impact of climate change on infrastructure deterioration cannot be ignored, but can be addressed by changes to design procedures including increases in cover thickness, improved quality of concrete, and coatings and barriers. For example, an increase in design cover of 10 mm and 5 mm for structures where carbonation or chlorides govern durability, respectively, will ameliorate the effects of a changing climate.

However, regarding the goal of enhancing the acceptance of and commitment to the NAS, we find that this has been achieved among those who participated but not among high-level policymakers who are responsible for implementing the NAS.

The implementation of legal acts and diverse environmentally oriented sectoral policies plays an important role in that process. The objective of this paper is to determine the antecedences and effects of the transformation of cities in accordance with the eco-city concept in Poland in the context of implemented policies, legislation and initiatives. The study reviews the normative acts and programme-strategic documents that provide the framework for the shift towards eco-city at the international and EU level, as well as identifying changes in legislation and policy initiatives resulting from their implementation at national and local level. A set of 24 original indices referring to six aspects of the eco-city (waste management, water and wastewater management, transport and urban mobility, application of RES in energy engineering, air quality, and urban green areas) were applied in multi-criterion analyses in selected case studies. This permitted us to identify the key factors that power the transition towards eco-city. The legal and policy measures are implemented in a top-down approach. Actions are usually initiated at national level and implemented by local authorities, who operate according to their assigned tasks and using dedicated tools (e.g. LEPs, SUMPs). Significant effect of the implementation of eco-city solutions were identified in waste management, sustainable transport, urban mobility, and air quality improvement. Recommendations for future measures include implementing plans and demonstrative projects of eco-cities or eco-districts, conducting complex pro-ecological measures, and increasing the role of bottom-up actions.","[Kociuba, Dagmara; Wais, Klaudi] Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Fac Earth Sci & Spatial Management, Dept Spatial Management, Krasnicka 2d, PL-20718 Lublin, Poland",Maria Curie-Sklodowska University,"Kociuba, D (corresponding author), Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Fac Earth Sci & Spatial Management, Dept Spatial Management, Krasnicka 2d, PL-20718 Lublin, Poland.",dagmara.kociuba@poczta.umsc.lublin.pl; klaudiawajs11@gmail.com,,"Kociuba, Dagmara/0000-0001-9217-323X",,,,,47,0,0,0,0,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1732-4254,2083-8298,,BULL GEOGR SOCIO-ECO,Bull.

Decision-makers and other interested citizens need to be able to access reliable science-based information to help them respond to the risks of climate change impacts and assess opportunities for adaptation. Participatory integrated assessment (IA) tools combine knowledge from diverse scientific disciplines, take account of the value and importance of stakeholder 'lay insight' and facilitate a two-way iterative process of exploration of 'what if's' to enable decision-makers to test ideas and improve their understanding of the complex issues surrounding adaptation to climate change. This paper describes the conceptual design of a participatory IA tool, the CLIMSAVE IA Platform, based on a professionally facilitated stakeholder engagement process. The CLIMSAVE (climate change integrated methodology for cross-sectoral adaptation and vulnerability in Europe) Platform is a user-friendly, interactive web-based tool that allows stakeholders to assess climate change impacts and vulnerabilities for a range of sectors, including agriculture, forests, biodiversity, coasts, water resources and urban development. The linking of models for the different sectors enables stakeholders to see how their interactions could affect European landscape change. The relationship between choice, uncertainty and constraints is a key cross-cutting theme in the conduct of past participatory IA. Integrating scenario development processes with an interactive modelling platform is shown to allow the exploration of future uncertainty as a structural feature of such complex problems, encouraging stakeholders to explore adaptation choices within real-world constraints of future resource availability and environmental and institutional capacities, rather than seeking the 'right' answers.","[Harrison, Paula A.] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Holman, Ian P.] Cranfield Univ, Cranfield Water Sci Inst, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England; [Cojocaru, George] TIAMASG Fdn, Bucharest 010963, Romania; [Kok, Kasper] Wageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kontogianni, Areti] Univ Aegean, Lab Appl Environm Econ, Mitilini 81100, Greece; [Metzger, Marc J.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Metzger, Marc J.] ClimateXChange, Edinburgh EH8 9AA, Midlothian, Scotland; [Gramberger, Marc] Prospex Bvba, B-3140 Keerbergen, Belgium",University of Oxford; Cranfield University; Wageningen University & Research; University of Aegean; University of Edinburgh,"Harrison, PA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",paharriso@aol.com,"Holman, Ian/A-7108-2010; Metzger, Marc/S-3976-2019; Metzger, Marc J./B-2510-2010; Harrison, Paula Ann/K-1519-2016; Cojocaru, George/R-8216-2019","Holman, Ian/0000-0002-5263-7746; Metzger, Marc/0000-0002-5119-5894; Metzger, Marc J./0000-0002-5119-5894; Harrison, Paula Ann/0000-0002-9873-3338; Kok, Kasper/0000-0002-6319-9227; Cojocaru, George/0000-0002-1432-364X; Kontogianni, Areti/0000-0002-9183-6211",CLIMSAVE Project; European Commission [244031],CLIMSAVE Project; European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),This work was supported by the CLIMSAVE Project (Climate change integrated assessment methodology for cross-sectoral adaptation and vulnerability in Europe; www.climsave.eu) funded under the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Commission (Contract No. 244031).

This study focuses on a Mediterranean agricultural zone to evaluate the economic impact of rainfall regime changes that modify the accumulation of irrigation water in a dam. The objective is to identify farm typologies that suffer more from rainfall changes, in order to target policy measures that increase farm sector capability to adapt to climate change. First, an analysis of historical series is conducted for precipitation. The decreasing trend in annual precipitation, as well as an increase in monthly rainfall variability, is shown to have a statistically significant influence on the regime of water accumulation in the dam. Density functions representing this regime are estimated for several periods, including the 1960s-1970s, the current time and a time interval that extends to 2015. A comparison of these functions reveals an increase in variability of water accumulation in the dam through time. Parameters of these functions are used in three models of Discrete Stochastic Programming to represent different expectations of irrigation water availability and to simulate the possible reaction of the farm sector in the study area to the different scenarios. The simulation results show that both income and employment are noticeably reduced in some farm typologies when scenarios with higher variability levels for water accumulation in the dam are considered. In addition, changes in the use of soil are seen, the use of inputs declines and the quantity of extracted groundwater increases. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Compared to Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), the model climatologies and interannual variability are investigated individually and as multimodel ensemble means (MME-mean) at monthly and seasonal time scales for the historical simulation over the period 1988-2014. Overall, results show that both LR and MR CMIP6 model skills in simulating mean and extreme precipitation indices vary across specific Indonesian regions and seasons. The individual and MME-mean tend to overestimate the observed climatology, being largest over drier regions, yet MR models perform better compared to the LR regarding the mean bias presumably due to increased resolution. CMIP6 models tend to simulate extreme precipitation better in the dry seasons compared to the wet season. The MME-means of the LR and MR groups mostly outperform the individual models of each group in simulating wet extremes (R95p and Rx5d) but not for the dry extremes (CDD). Among the 42 CMIP6 models, three models consistently perform poorly in simulating Rx5d and R95p, namely FGOALS-g3, IPSL-CM6A-LR, and IPSL-CM6A-LR-INCA, and one model in consecutive dry day (CDD) simulation, MPI-ESM-1-2-HAM, and caution is warranted. Given the knowledge of such biases, the LR and MR CMIP6 climate models can be suitably applied to assist policy makers in their decision on climate change adaptation and mitigation action.","[Kurniadi, Ari; Weller, Evan] Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Auckland, New Zealand; [Kurniadi, Ari] Indonesia Agcy Meteorol Climatol & Geophys BMKG, Ctr Climate Change Informat, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Kim, Yeon-Hee; Min, Seung-Ki] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Div Environm Sci & Engn, Pohang, South Korea","University of Auckland; Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology & Geophysics; Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH)","Kurniadi, A (corresponding author), Sci Ctr, Bldg 302,Level 4,Room 451,23 Symonds St, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.",akur687@aucklanduni.ac.nz,,"Kim, Yeon-Hee/0000-0003-0233-1690; Kurniadi, Ari/0000-0002-7503-7989","Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, New Zealand: New Zealand Scholarship (NZS)","Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, New Zealand: New Zealand Scholarship (NZS)","Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, New Zealand: New Zealand Scholarship (NZS)",,92,0,0,8,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

This study was an attempt to understand the trends in extreme climatic events in coastal and inland areas over the period 1968-2018. The missing data in daily maximum and minimum temperature, and daily rainfall datasets were imputed using the multiple imputation by chained equations technique and implementing a predictive mean matching algorithm. The imputed datasets were then tested for inhomogeneity using the penalized maximal t and modified penalized maximal F tests. A quantile matching algorithm was then applied to homogenize the datasets, which were then used for generating 13 extreme temperature and 9 extreme rainfall indices. The trends were assessed using the Trend Free Pre-whitened Mann-Kendall test and the magnitudes of the changes were determined using the Thiel-Sen slope estimator. Additionally, standardized anomalies were calculated to understand the seasonal variability of temperature and rainfall over the past five decades. Results suggested that both coastal and inland areas were warming significantly but coastal areas exhibited a higher rate of warming. Although most of the extreme rainfall indices showed statistically non-significant changes for coastal and inland stations, there is evidence of localized dryness and increased rainfall at individual stations. In particular, the drought-prone northwestern region of the country experienced decreased rainfall, which is discordant to the results of previous studies. Findings from this study highlighted important local and regional-scale changes in extreme climate events that were previously overlooked. The findings of this study can help undertake targeted climate change adaptation strategies to save population and resources.","[Abdullah, Abu Yousuf Md] Univ Waterloo, Sch Planning, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Bhuian, Md Hanif] Jagannath Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Kiselev, Grigory; Dewan, Ashraf] Curtin Univ, Sch Earth & Planetary Sci, Bentley, WA, Australia; [Hasan, Quazi K.] Univ Calgary, Dept Geomat Engn, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Rafiuddin, M.] Bangladesh Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Phys, Dhaka, Bangladesh",University of Waterloo; Curtin University; University of Calgary; Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET),"Abdullah, AM (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Sch Planning, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",aymabdullah@uwaterloo.ca,"Dewan, Ashraf/O-2191-2015; Abdullah, Abu Yousuf Md/AAX-7051-2021","Dewan, Ashraf/0000-0001-5594-5464; Hassan, Quazi K./0000-0002-7034-359X; Abdullah, Abu Yousuf Md/0000-0001-8641-990X",,,,,92,13,13,3,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Billions of dollars have been pledged for adaptation finance, with many donor agencies requiring that adaptation is distinct from baseline development. However, practitioners and academics continue to question what adaptation looks like on the ground, especially in a developing country. This study examines the current framing of planned adaptation amidst low socioeconomic development and considers the practical implications of this framing for adaptation planning. Three overarching approaches to planned adaptation in a developing country context emerged in a systematic review of 30 peer-reviewed articles published between 2010 and 2015, including: (1) technocratic risk management, which treats adaptation as additional to development, (2) pro-poor vulnerability reduction, which acknowledges the ability of conventional development to foster and act as adaptation, and (3) sustainable adaptation, which suggests that adaptation should only be integrated into a type of development that is socially and environmentally sustainable. Over half of sustainable adaptation' articles in this review took a critical adaptation approach, drawing primarily from political ecology and postdevelopment studies, and emphasizing the malleability of adaptation. The reviewed articles highlight how the different framings of the relationship between adaptation and development result in diverse and sometimes contradictory messages regarding adaptation design, implementation, funding, monitoring, and evaluation. This review illustrates the need to continually interrogate the multiple framings of adaptation and development and to foster a pragmatic and pluralistic dialogue regarding planned adaptation and transformative change in developing countries.

We bring together results from different research areas to describe the physical interactions and to shortly discuss governance issues in the sectors of water and energy. We highlight the fact that water demand management options combined with a sustainable energy model is a priority action to answer the challenge of climate change adaptation in North African countries. We use the IPAT formula approach to compute scenarios for quantifying the magnitudes of advantages to expect from water demand side management actions coupled with energy efficiency options. According to our results, water demand management is a very appropriate adaptation option with significant benefits in terms of water saving, energy use and energy bill. Overall, in 2050, the water saved thanks to demand management actions could be around 68 billion of cubic meters, which is the magnitude of the total water demand of Egypt in 2005. Depending on the scenario and assumptions, the expected cumulated benefit in terms of energy bill over the period 2005-2025 could range between 30 and 48 billion US Dollar, which is comparable to the GDP of Tunisia in 2011 (46 billion US Dollar). Nevertheless, up to 2050, regardless the scenario, additional options will be needed to cover the water deficit of the region. This leads us to consider virtual water as an additional option to reduce the local water demand. Finally, we discuss the political implications and the reforms to be implemented for integrating water and energy demand side policies in North Africa.","[Quefelec, Stephane] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Aix En Provence, France; [Quefelec, Stephane] ENERGIES 2050, Biot, France; [Allal, Samir] Inst Univ Technol Mantes, Mantes La Jolie, France; [Allal, Samir] Univ Versailles St Quentin En Yvelines, Versailles, France; [Allal, Samir] UVSQ Univ Versailles, Lab REEDS, Versailles, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Quefelec, S (corresponding author), Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Aix En Provence, France.",stephane.quefelec@univ-amu.fr; samir.allal@uvsq.fr,,,,,,,105,2,2,1,19,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Climate change poses new and dynamic challenges for infrastructural adequacy, compounding challenges of existing long-term underinvestment. In the United States, historical infrastructural choices such as redlining have substantially contributed to the structural marginalization and intergenerational wealth disparities experienced today by Black, Latinx, and other groups. This marginalization manifests in part as social vulnerability to disproportionate infrastructural and other hazards, which, without active intervention, is likely to continue to increase as climate change progresses. Adaptation to climate change will require a massive mobilization of resources for new and enhanced infrastructures. Future infrastructural investments must not repeat or mirror the unjust patterns of the past, nor facilitate their continuation through patterns such as reactive investments made based on financial value. In this commentary, we argue that the effects of climate change on future equity and resilience are particularly salient in the context of existing disparities in residential energy burden, specifically related to the way that future energy and housing system choices could worsen these disparities without explicit effort. We describe the intersection of two major anticipated climate-driven changes: (1) climate migration, which is expected to disrupt communities and change patterns of housing and energy needs; and (2) energy burden, which is expected to be exacerbated both by climate change itself (e.g., through higher temperatures) and by interactions among mitigation strategies (e.g., electrification in colder climates receiving low wealth climate migrants). Anticipating climate migration and shifting residential energy needs could facilitate a more just energy transition, focused on avoiding locking in extreme energy burdens and protecting people from extreme temperature events. Preemptive planning and targeted infrastructural investments can enable just transitions and community resilience.","[Maxim, Alexandra; Grubert, Emily] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 790 Atlantic Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Grubert, E (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 790 Atlantic Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",gruberte@gatech.edu,,"Maxim, Alexandra/0000-0003-3323-4201",,,,,89,1,1,6,13,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1939-4071,1937-5174,,ENVIRON JUSTICE,Environ.

The first difference method was used to disentangle the contributions of climate change from the changes in potato yield in two consecutive years. The moving average method was used to decouple the climate-induced yield of potato. The results showed that the yield and planting area of potato from the period 1982 to 2015 increased markedly, with inter-annual fluctuations. The temperature increased significantly during the potato growing period in northwest China, while other climatic factors did not change significantly. Specifically, the changing trends in climatic factors varied among different provinces. The key meteorological factors limiting potato yield were temperature, precipitation and diurnal temperature range, varying in the different provinces. Potato yields in Gansu, Shaanxi, Ningxia and Xinjiang decreased by 127, 289, 199 and 339 kg ha(-1), respectively, for every 1 degrees C increase in daily maximum temperature. The potato yield in Xinjiang decreased by 583 kg ha(-1) for every 1 degrees C increase in daily minimum temperature. For every 100 mm increase in precipitation, the potato yields in Gansu, Qinghai and Ningxia increased by 250, 375 and 182 kg ha(-1), respectively. Combining the first difference method and the moving average method, precipitation was the dominant climatic factor affecting potato yield in rain-fed areas (Gansu, Qinghai and Ningxia). For areas with irrigation (Xinjiang) or relatively high rainfall (Shaanxi), maximum temperature was the deciding climatic factor affecting potato yield. Appropriate adaptation to climate change in the different regions will help to ensure potato production in northwest China.","[Li, Qiang; Zhang, Suiqi] Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, 26 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Qiang] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Zhengzhou 450002, Henan, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; Henan Agricultural University,"Zhang, SQ (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, 26 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",liqiang@henau.edu.cn; sqzhang@ms.iswc.ac.cn,,,National Science and Technology Supporting Programs [2015BAD22B01]; 111 project of the Chinese Education Ministry [B12007]; Special Funds for Scientific Research Programs of the State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming on the Loess Plateau [A314021403-C5],National Science and Technology Supporting Programs; 111 project of the Chinese Education Ministry; Special Funds for Scientific Research Programs of the State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming on the Loess Plateau,"This work was supported by the National Science and Technology Supporting Programs (2015BAD22B01), the 111 project of the Chinese Education Ministry (B12007), and the Special Funds for Scientific Research Programs of the State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming on the Loess Plateau (A314021403-C5).",,51,7,6,3,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,MAR,2020,10,3,,,,,,,426,10.3390/agronomy10030426,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10030426,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,LI3ID,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000529377300112,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results showed that the cultivated area increase by 52.7 % in reaching 15,712 ha in 2019. The West and South West regions cultivate 81 % of Romania's cropped area with Sorghum. Production increased 3.2 times reaching 60 thousand tons in 2019, 80% being achieved by West region (63.4 %) and South West Oltenia (10.5%). Sorghum yield was doubled in 2018 achieving 3,819 kg/ha, the highest records being in North East and West. Romania is ranked the 4th in the EU-28 after France, Italy and Hungary for Sorghum cultivated surface, production and yield. Between production and yield is a positive and strong relationship, r = 0.842 and R-2 = 0.710, reflecting that 71 % of the variation ofproduction is caused by yield change. The regression model Y = 0.0112 x + 13.424, shows that if Sorghum yield increases by one unit, production will grow by 13.43 units. Therefore, a higher productivity per surface unit will contribute to production growth. For this reason, farmers have to use modern technologies involving high potential varieties and hybrids, optimized tillage, fertilization, sowing depth, plant density, distance between rows, correct and timing application of the agricultural works, the use of modern equipments for tillage, sowing, crop maintenance and harvesting. The technologies have to be adapted to climate change, meaning the use of earlier cultivars, looking for a new depth of sowing where soil moisture content favours seeds germination and chose the best harvesting moment.","[Popescu, Agatha] Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med Bucharest, 59 Marasti Blvd,Dist 1, Bucharest 011464, Romania; [Popescu, Agatha] Acad Agr & Forestry Sci Gheorghe Ionescu Sisesti, 61 Marasti Blvd,Dist 1, Bucharest 011464, Romania; [Popescu, Agatha] Acad Romanian Scientists, 1 Ilfov St, Bucharest 030167, Romania",University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest; Academy of Romanian Scientists (AOSR),"Popescu, A (corresponding author), Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med Bucharest, 59 Marasti Blvd,Dist 1, Bucharest 011464, Romania.;Popescu, A (corresponding author), Acad Agr & Forestry Sci Gheorghe Ionescu Sisesti, 61 Marasti Blvd,Dist 1, Bucharest 011464, Romania.;Popescu, A (corresponding author), Acad Romanian Scientists, 1 Ilfov St, Bucharest 030167, Romania.",agatha_popescu@yahoo.com,,,,,,,31,2,2,1,2,UNIV AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES & VETERINARY MEDICINE BUCHAREST,BUCHAREST,"59 MARASTI BOULEVARD, DISTRICT 1, BUCHAREST, 011464, ROMANIA",2284-7995,2285-3952,,SCI PAP-SER MANAG EC,Sci.

However, the impacts of these changes on GHG emissions have not been comprehensively assessed. While most earlier studies focused on the GHG emissions per unit area, recent research indicated that the yield-scaled impact may better reflect the reality. Through integrating the results from a meta-analysis, two multi-site field experiments and an expert survey, we quantify the integrated impacts of different practices on both area- and yield-scaled GHG emissions in China. Results from the expert survey showed that rice planting area has shifted northwards, and alternate water-saving (WS) irrigation has been applied in nearly 78% of Chinese rice paddy areas in both the rice nursery stage and post-transplanting period over the past five decades. The changes of these practices and replacement of new rice varieties have increased China?s rice yield by 131%. During the same period, cropping system adjustment, variety replacement, and implementation of WS irrigation have reduced total GHG emissions by 7%, 31%, and 42%, respectively. Also, the major decrease in GWP occurred prior to the 2000s, and the decreasing trend continued in the post-2000s period but at a slower rate. Our results have some limitations as these estimates ignore a number of important variations and interactions among management factors as well as climatic and edaphic conditions. Still, our findings illustrate that it is possible to enhance rice productivity at reduced environmental costs through screening for low emission varieties and agronomic practices. Future innovations should ensure that rice farming progressively adapts to climate change, while continuing to reduce GHG emissions.","[Zhang, Yi] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yu] Nanjing Agr Univ, Jiangsu Collaborat Innovat Ctr Modern Crop Prod, Natl Engn & Technol Ctr Informat Agr, Key Lab Crop Physiol & Ecol Southern China, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Tai, Amos P.

Based on a dataset of daily maximum temperatures from meteorological stations on the North China Plain, including ordinary and national basic/reference surface stations, the intensity-area-duration method was used to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of heatwave events on the North China Plain (1961-2017). Moreover, based on demographic data from the Statistical Yearbook and Greenhouse Gas Initiative (GGI) Population Scenario Database of the Austrian Institute for International Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), population exposure to heatwave events was also studied. The results showed that the frequency, intensity, and area of impact of heatwave events on the North China Plain initially decreased (becoming weaker and less extensive) and then increased (becoming stronger and more extensive). Similarly, the trend of population exposure to heatwave events initially decreased and then increased, and the central position of exposure initially moved southward and then returned northward. Population exposure in the eastern Taihang Mountains was found significantly higher than in the western Taihang Mountains. In relation to the change of population exposure to heatwave events on the North China Plain, the influence of climatic factors was found dominant with an absolute contribution rate of >75%. Except for 2011-2017, increase in population also increased the exposure to heatwaves, particularly in the first half of the study period. Interaction between climatic and population factors generally had less impact on population exposure than either climatic factors or population factors alone. This study demonstrated a method for assessing the impact of heatwave events on population exposure, which could form a scientific basis for the development of government policy regarding adaption to climate change.","[Zhan, Long-Fei; Zhan, Mingjin] Jiangxi Prov Climate Ctr, Nanchang 330046, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yanjun; Zhai, Jianqing; Zhan, Mingjin] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog Sci, IDRM, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Sun, Hemin; Zhai, Jianqing] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; China Meteorological Administration,"Zhan, MJ (corresponding author), Jiangxi Prov Climate Ctr, Nanchang 330046, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.;Zhan, MJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog Sci, IDRM, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",hellorm@126.com,"sun, hemin/GRX-6761-2022","Zhan, Mingjin/0000-0002-3757-2307","CDM Fund Jiangxi Climate Change Adaptation Program [2014102]; Natural Science Foundation of China [41661144027]; Pakistan Science Foundation [41661144027]; CMA Climate Change Science Fund (CCSF) [201722, 201810]; High-level Talent Recruitment Program of the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST)",CDM Fund Jiangxi Climate Change Adaptation Program; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Pakistan Science Foundation; CMA Climate Change Science Fund (CCSF); High-level Talent Recruitment Program of the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST),"This study was supported by the CDM Fund Jiangxi Climate Change Adaptation Program (2014102) and bilateral cooperation project between the Natural Science Foundation of China and the Pakistan Science Foundation (41661144027).

The methods were applied in Madagascar as a case study. The initiative centered on an exploratory research exercise in two communities in the south-west of Madagascar, a workshop held in Antananarivo in June 2016, combined with a component on communicating ocean science and climate change to stakeholders. It utilized innovative and rapid approaches to combine global and local skills and information on adaptation and resilience building, taking cognizance of national policies, and was based on the principles of a holistic, integrated and participatory approach. This paper summarizes the activities undertaken and assesses how effective they were in achieving the project goals, as well as presenting examples of the outputs obtained. The activities demonstrated the value of using existing high resolution global climate models for provision of information on future trends, and of including a traits-based ecological risk assessment as a standard component of vulnerability assessments. User-friendly qualitative modeling activities helped to consolidate holistic, integrated understanding of selected fisheries. The value of assessing the importance and resilience of supply chains and taking the local management measures and institutions into account were validated. The outcomes of the initiative reinforced the principle that the cumulative ecological and social impacts of individual stressors and drivers on marine-dependent communities must be addressed, including climate-change related stressors. Assessments of vulnerability and adaptation planning should be forward-looking and consider likely changes in the future. They must also be done with participation by local experts and stakeholders to ensure knowledge exchange, local capacity-building and ownership and that outputs are rooted in the local realities, are accepted as being legitimate, and reinforce and complement relevant legal frameworks and laws.","[Cochrane, K.

It is largely documented that farmers who depend on rainfall to cultivate crops understand climate change as a change in climatic elements, especially rainfall which negatively affects crop production. However, studies on how people whose livelihoods do not directly depend on climate change understand it, whether and how the changes affect their livelihoods and whether and how they are coping to the change are limited in the literature. This paper aims to therefore determine perspective of traders of climate change and how they cope. Design/methodology/approach - The data collection took place in Accra, which is the capital city of Ghana. Thousand traders who sold unprocessed and processed food as well as manufactured goods took part in the study. Questionnaires which were largely open-ended were administered. SPSS version 16 was used to analyse the data. In addition, some of the interview responses were included verbatim to support study participants view on some issues. Findings - The majority of the respondents engaged in trading of manufactured goods. The respondents understood climate change as prolonged dry season and changes in rainfall pattern. About 97 per cent of the respondents said climate change had negatively impacted their trading activities, and almost all respondents (91 per cent) who were affected by climate change livelihoods were also affected such that they were unable to meet their basic needs. About 23 per cent have adopted coping strategies by depending on friends, relatives and engaging in menial jobs, and 63 per cent adopted no coping strategy. Originality/value - It seems that rural farmers may have more options than urban traders during climate change. This can mean that research and policy efforts towards adaption to climate change should not focus only on farmers but traders as well.","[Arku, Frank S.; Angmor, Emmanuel N.] Presbyterian Univ Coll, Fac Dev Studies, Akropong, Ghana; [Adjei, Godlove T.] Presbyterian Univ Coll, Cent Adm, Okwahu, Ghana",,"Arku, FS (corresponding author), Presbyterian Univ Coll, Fac Dev Studies, Akropong, Ghana.",fsarku@gmail.com,,,,,,,27,5,5,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

To address the continuing and accelerating alterations that climate change is bringing to SESs, adaptive governance generally will require more flexibility than prior governance institutions have often allowed. However, to function as good governance, adaptive governance must pay real attention to the problem of how to balance this increased need for flexibility with continuing governance stability so that it can foster adaptation to change without being perceived or experienced as perpetually destabilizing, disruptive, and unfair. Flexibility and stability serve different purposes in governance, and a variety of tools exist to strike different balances between them while still preserving the governance institution's legitimacy among the people governed. After reviewing those purposes and the implications of climate change for environmental governance, we examine psychological insights into the structuring of adaptive governance and the variety of legal tools available to incorporate those insights into adaptive governance regimes. Because the substantive goals of governance systems will differ among specific systems, we do not purport to comment on what the normative or substantive goals of law should be. Instead, we conclude that attention to process and procedure (including participation), as well as increased use of substantive standards (instead of rules), may allow an increased level of substantive flexibility to operate with legitimacy and fairness, providing the requisite levels of psychological, social, and economic stability needed for communities to adapt successfully to the Anthropocene.","[Craig, Robin Kundis] Univ Utah, SJ Quinney Coll Law, Wallace Stegner Ctr Land Resources, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Craig, Robin Kundis] Univ Utah, Global Change & Sustainabil Ctr, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Garmestani, Ahjond S.] US EPA, Cincinnati, OH 45268 USA; [Allen, Craig R.] US Geol Survey, 959 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA 22092 USA; [Allen, Craig R.] Nebraska Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Lincoln, NE USA; [Allen, Craig R.; Birge, Hannah] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE USA; [Arnold, Craig Anthony (Tony)] Univ Louisville, Brandeis Sch Law, Dept Urban & Publ Affairs, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Arnold, Craig Anthony (Tony)] Univ Louisville, Ctr Land Use & Environm Responsibil, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Arnold, Craig Anthony (Tony)] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Law, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [DeCaro, Daniel A.] Univ Louisville, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Dept Urban & Publ Affairs, Social Decis Making & Sustainabil Lab, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Fremier, Alexander K.] Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Gosnell, Hannah] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Schlager, Edella] Univ Arizona, Sch Govt & Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; United States Environmental Protection Agency; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Louisville; University of Louisville; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Louisville; Washington State University; Oregon State University; University of Arizona,"Craig, RK (corresponding author), Univ Utah, SJ Quinney Coll Law, Wallace Stegner Ctr Land Resources, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.;Craig, RK (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Global Change & Sustainabil Ctr, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",,"Craig, Robin Kundis/GPX-3135-2022; Craig, Robin Kundis/U-7318-2018; Gosnell, Hannah/X-6341-2019; Fremier, Alexander/AAC-7706-2019; Garmestani, Ahjond/AAJ-3695-2020","Craig, Robin Kundis/0000-0003-2120-9543; Craig, Robin Kundis/0000-0003-2120-9543; Gosnell, Hannah/0000-0002-2108-945X; Garmestani, Ahjond/0000-0001-5678-7293; Birge, Hannah/0000-0001-6489-0098; Fremier, Alexander/0000-0002-4104-6633",National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) under National Science Foundation [DBI-1052875]; Nebraska Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit; Direct For Biological Sciences; Div Of Biological Infrastructure [1052875] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) under National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Nebraska Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit; Direct For Biological Sciences; Div Of Biological Infrastructure(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"This work was supported by the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) under funding from the National Science Foundation DBI-1052875.

Determined largely by precipitation gradients, specific agroecological systems in the inland Pacific Northwestern U.S. (iPNW) feature different practices across the region. Historically, these farming systems have been economically productive, but at the cost of high soil erosion rates and organic matter depletion, making them win-lose situations. Agronomic, sociological, political and economic drivers all influence cropping system innovations. Integrated, holistic conservation systems also need to be identified to address climate change by integrating cfBMPs that provide win-win benefits for farmer and environment. We conclude that systems featuring short-term improvements in farm economics, market diversification, resource efficiency and soil health will be most readily adopted by farmers, thereby simultaneously addressing longer term challenges including climate change. Specific win-win scenarios are designed for different iPNW production zones delineated by water availability. The cfBMPs include reduced tillage and residue management, organic carbon (C) recycling, precision nitrogen (N) management and crop rotation diversification and intensification. Current plant breeding technologies have provided new cultivars of canola and pea that can diversify system agronomics and markets. These agronomic improvements require associated shifts in prescriptive, precision N and weed management. The integrated cfBMP systems we describe have the potential for reducing system-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by increasing soil C storage, N use efficiency (NUE) and by production of biofuels. Novel systems, even if they are economically competitive, can come with increased financial risk to producers, necessitating government support (e.g., subsidized crop insurance) to promote adoption. Other conservation-and climate change-targeted farm policies can also improve adoption. Ultimately, farmers must meet their economic and legacy goals to assure longer-term adoption of mature cfBMP for iPNW production systems.","[Pan, William L.; Young, Frank L.; Maaz, Tai M.; Madsen, Isaac J.; Port, Lauren E.] Washington State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Schillinger, William F.] Washington State Univ, Dryland Res Stn, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Lind, WA USA; [Kirby, Elizabeth M.; Yorgey, Georgine G.] Washington State Uninvers, Ctr Sustaining Agr & Nat Resources, Mt Vernon, WA USA; [Borrelli, Kristy A.] Penn State Univ, NE SARE, State Coll, PA USA; [Brooks, Erin S.; Johnson-Maynard, Jodi L.] Univ Idaho, Dept Soil & Water Syst, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [McCracken, Vicki A.] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Machado, Stephen] Oregon State Univ, Columbia Basin Agr Res Ctr, Pendleton, OR USA; [Painter, Kate] Univ Idaho, Boundary Cty Idaho Extens, Bonners Ferrry, ID USA; [Huggins, David R.] Washington State Univ, Agr Res Serv USDA, Northwest Sustainable Agroecosyst Res Unit, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Esser, Aaron D.] Washington State Univ, Adams Cty Extens, Ritzville, WA USA; [Collins, Harold P.] Agr Res Serv USDA, Grassland Soil & Water Res Lab, Temple, TX USA; [Stockle, Claudio O.] Washington State Univ, Biol Syst Engn, Washington, DC USA; [Eigenbrode, Sanford D.] Univ Idaho, Dept Entomol Plant Pathol & Nematol, Moscow, ID 83843 USA",Washington State University; Washington State University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Idaho; University of Idaho; Washington State University; Oregon State University; Idaho; University of Idaho; Washington State University; Washington State University; Washington State University; Idaho; University of Idaho,"Pan, WL (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",wlpan@wsu.edu,"Johnson-Maynard, Jodi L/E-9518-2013; McCracken, Vicki/AAA-1854-2020; Schillinger, William/P-4112-2019","Johnson-Maynard, Jodi L/0000-0002-4450-4636; Brooks, Erin/0000-0002-6921-4870; Madsen, Isaac/0000-0003-2216-1529","USDA-NIFA from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2011-68002-30191]; National Science Foundation [0903714]; Washington Oilseed Cropping Systems; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project [1014527]; NIFA [687206, 2011-68002-30191] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","USDA-NIFA from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Washington Oilseed Cropping Systems; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","The authors thank the following sources of support: USDA-NIFA Award #2011-68002-30191 from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

Assessment of such changes is particularly important for Southeast Asia (SEA) - home to global largest ecological diversity. Twenty-three global climate models (GCMs) of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) were used in this study to evaluate changes in 11 thermal bioclimatic indicators over SEA for two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), 2-4.5 and 5-8.5. Spatial changes in the ensemble mean, 5th, and 95th percentile of each indicator for near (2020-2059) and far (2060-2099) periods were examined in order to understand temporal changes and associated uncertainty. The results indicated large spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in projected changes of bioclimatic indicators. A higher change was projected for mainland SEA in the far future and less in maritime region during the near future. At the same time, uncertainty in the projected bioclimatic indices was higher for mainland than maritime SEA. Analysis of mean multi-model ensemble revealed a change in mean temperature ranged from - 0.71 to 3.23 degrees C in near and from 0.00 to 4.07 degrees C in far futures. The diurnal temperature range was projected to reduce over most of SEA (ranging from - 1.1 to - 2.0 degrees C), while isothermality is likely to decrease from - 1.1 to - 4.6%. A decrease in isothermality along with narrowing of seasonality indicated a possible shift in climate, particularly in the north of mainland SEA. Maximum temperature in the warmest month/quarter was projected to increase a little more than the coldest month/quarter and the mean temperature in the driest month to increase more than the wettest month. This would cause an increase in the annual temperature range in the future.","[Hamed, Mohammed Magdy] Arab Acad Sci Technol & Maritime Transport AASTMT, Coll Engn & Technol, Construct & Bldg Engn Dept, B 2401 Smart Village, Giza 12577, Egypt; [Hamed, Mohammed Magdy; Shahid, Shamsuddin; bin Ismail, Tarmizi] Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Fac Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Water & Environm Engn, Skudia 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Nashwan, Mohamed Salem] Arab Acad Sci Technol & Maritime Transport AASTMT, Construct & Bldg Engn Dept, Coll Engn & Technol, Cairo 2033, Egypt; [Dewan, Ashraf] Curtin Univ, Sch Earth & Planetary Sci, Spatial Sci Discipline, Kent St, Perth, WA 6102, Australia; [Asaduzzaman, Md] Staffordshire Univ, Sch Digital Technol & Arts, Dept Engn, Stoke On Trent, Staffs, England","Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport; Curtin University; Staffordshire University","Hamed, MM (corresponding author), Arab Acad Sci Technol & Maritime Transport AASTMT, Coll Engn & Technol, Construct & Bldg Engn Dept, B 2401 Smart Village, Giza 12577, Egypt.;Hamed, MM (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Fac Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Water & Environm Engn, Skudia 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",eng.mohammedhamed@aast.edu; m.salem@aast.edu; sshahid@utm.my; tarmiziismail@utm.my; A.Dewan@curtin.edu.au; Md.Asaduzzaman@staffs.ac.uk,"Hamed, Mohammed Magdy/AAW-7463-2021; SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/B-5185-2010; Ismail, Tarmizi/AAO-3422-2020; Nashwan, Mohamed Salem/J-6843-2018; Dewan, Ashraf/O-2191-2015; Asaduzzaman, Md/Q-9571-2017","Hamed, Mohammed Magdy/0000-0002-2939-5443; SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/0000-0001-9621-6452; Ismail, Tarmizi/0000-0002-6748-4703; Nashwan, Mohamed Salem/0000-0003-4007-5878; Dewan, Ashraf/0000-0001-5594-5464; Asaduzzaman, Md/0000-0002-8885-6721","Staffordshire University, UK [WR GCRF 2020-2021]","Staffordshire University, UK","The authors are grateful to Staffordshire University, UK, for providing financial support for this research through grant no.

The IPPU's emission has been following an increasing trend. This study investigated time-series and cross-sectional analyses of the IPPU sector. Petrochemical, iron and steel, and cement production are the leading source categories in the Kingdom. In recent years, aluminum, zinc, and titanium dioxide production industries were established. During the last ten years, a significant growth was observed in steel, ethylene, direct reduce iron (DRI), and cement production. The growth of this sector depends on many factors, including domestic and international demand, socioeconomic conditions, and the availability of feedstock. The emissions from IPPU without considering energy use was 78 million tons of CO2 equivalent (CO(2)eq) in 2020, and the cement industry was the highest emitter (35.5%), followed by petrochemical (32.3%) and iron and steel industries (16.8%). A scenario-based projection analysis was performed to estimate the range of emissions for the years up to 2050. The results show that the total emissions could reach between 199 and 426 million tons of CO(2)eq in 2050. The Kingdom has started initiatives that mainly focus on climate change adaptation and economic divergence with mitigation co-benefits. In general, the focus of such initiatives is the energy sector. However, the timely accomplishment of the Saudi Vision 2030 and Saudi Green Initiative will affect mitigation scenarios significantly, including in the IPPU sector. The mitigation opportunities for this sector include (i) energy efficiency, (ii) emissions efficiency, (iii) material efficiency, (iv) the re-use of materials and recycling of products, (v) intensive and longer use of products, and (vi) demand management. The results of this study will support the Kingdom in developing an appropriate climate change mitigation roadmap.","[Rahman, Muhammad Muhitur; Abu Shoaib, Syed; Islam, Md Kamrul] King Faisal Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Al Hasa 31982, Saudi Arabia; [Rahman, Mohammad Shahedur] Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ, Coll Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Riyadh 13318, Saudi Arabia; [Chowdhury, Saidur R.] Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, POB 1664, Al Khobar 31952, Saudi Arabia; [Elhaj, Alaeldeen; Rahman, Syed Masiur] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals KFUPM, Appl Res Ctr Environm & Marine Studies, Dhahran 31260, Saudi Arabia; [Razzak, Shaikh Abdur] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals KFUPM, Dept Chem Engn, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia; [Razzak, Shaikh Abdur] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals KFUPM, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr Membranes & Water Secur, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia; [Islam, Mohammed Monirul] King Faisal Univ, Coll Clin Pharm, Dept Biomed Sci, Al Hasa 31982, Saudi Arabia; [Rushd, Sayeed] King Faisal Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Chem Engn, Al Hasa 31982, Saudi Arabia",King Faisal University; Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU); Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd University; King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals; King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals; King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals; King Faisal University; King Faisal University,"Rahman, MM (corresponding author), King Faisal Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Al Hasa 31982, Saudi Arabia.",mrahman@kfu.edu.sa; msrahman@imamu.edu.sa; schowdhuryl@pmmedu.sa; aladin.elhaj@kfupm.edu.sa; srazzak@kfupm.edu.sa; sabushoaib@kfu.edu.sa; maislam@kfmedu.sa; mislam@kfu.edu.sa; mrushd@kfu.edu.sa; smrahman@kfupm.edu.sa,"Rahman, Mohammad/HKW-0675-2023; Rahman, Syed/D-4611-2011; ISLAM, MD.

Changing relationships and distribution patterns of sealed and vegetated surfaces as well as building geometry across different scales in urban environments influence surface temperatures. Cities comprise different urban forms, which, depending on their surface characteristics, enhance the heating process, increasing the emergence of urban heat islands (UHIs). Detecting priority areas to introduce multi-beneficial climate change adaptation measures is set to be a key task for the cities long-term strategies to improve climatic conditions across different urban structures and scales. We introduce a simple and fast spatial modelling approach to carry out fine-scale simulations for land surface temperature (LST), mean radiant temperature (MRT) and Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) in a 2D environment. Capabilities of our modelling approach are demonstrated in evaluating urban thermal comfort in the alpine city of Innsbruck, the capital of Tyrol in western Austria. Results show a major contrast between sealed and vegetated surfaces reflected in the distributional patterns and values of LST, MRT and UM, correlating with the appearance and frequency of specific surface classes. We found the Sky View Factor to have a substantial impact on calculations for bioclimatic conditions and see high-albedo surfaces decrease LST but increase the apparent temperature (MRT and UTCI values) effecting human thermal comfort. Furthermore, MRT and UTCI are more sensitive to changes in emissivity values, whereas LST is more sensitive to changes in Bowen Ratio values. Application of our modelling approach can be used to identify priority areas and maximise multi-functionality of dimate change adaptation measures, to support urban planning processes for heat mitigation and the implementation of policy suggestions to achieve sustainable development goals and other political objectives.

This is mainly due to the scarcity of in situ data, which are essential to building robust impact models. To address this, we developed a fine-resolution (500 m) GW model using MODFLOW-NWT, focusing on the Gilgel-Abay Catchment located in the Upper Blue Nile basin, fed with daily distributed input forcings of recharge and streamflow simulated by the Coupled Routing and Excess Storage (CREST) hydrological model. The model was calibrated against instantaneous observation records of GW table for 38 historical wells, and validated at selected sites using time series data collected from the Citizen Science Initiative (PIRE CSI), and the Innovation Lab for Small Scale Irrigation (ILSSI) project. An RMSE of 14.4 m (1.8% of range) was achieved for calibration and same for validation was 18.21 m and 15.76 mat the PIRE CSI and ILSSI sites, respectively. The findings of this research indicate substantial physical GW resource availability in the Gilgel-Abay region. Moreover, we expect the model to have multiscale future applications. These include obtaining dynamically downscaled boundary conditions for a local-scale GW model, to be developed in the next phase of our research. Further, an upscaled version of this model to encompass the entire Tana Basin would be developed to simulate lake-aquifer interactions. Finally, the approach of this research combining different types of datasets (e.g., reanalysis products, satellite data, citizen science data, etc.) is adaptable to other global data-scarce regions. Moreover, the method overcomes specific challenges associated to in situ data scarcity, limited knowledge on GW resources availability in the area, interaction with complex boundary conditions, and sensitivity under meteorological boundary forcings.","[Khadim, Fahad Khan; Lazin, Rehenuma; Moges, Semu; Bagtzoglou, Amvrossios C.; Anagnostou, Emmanouil] Univ Connecticut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Dokou, Zoi] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Civil Engn, 6000 J St, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA",University of Connecticut; California State University System; California State University Sacramento,"Dokou, Z (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Civil Engn, 6000 J St, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA.",zoi.dokou@csus.edu,"Lazin, Rehenuma/GPK-6157-2022","Lazin, Rehenuma/0000-0002-9838-2160; Khadim, Fahad Khan/0000-0002-0899-3540; Dokou, Zoi/0000-0003-0879-3423","National Science Foundation [1545874]; Abay Basin Authority (ABA) -Ethiopia; Bahir Dar University (BU) -Ethiopia; Ministry of Water, Irrigation, and Energy-Ethiopia","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Abay Basin Authority (ABA) -Ethiopia; Bahir Dar University (BU) -Ethiopia; Ministry of Water, Irrigation, and Energy-Ethiopia","This research is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1545874.

Central to the entire discipline of climate projections is the use of models. However, model performance varies from one region to another. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine the performance of 18 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) historical simulations of precipitation over Malawi against rain gauge data. The period of study runs from 1982 to 2005. Statistical analyses were extensively carried out at both spatial and temporal scales using the following metrics: correlation coefficient (R), bias, percentage bias (PBias), standard deviation (STDEV), root mean square error (RMSE), and trend. At spatial scales, Hovmoller diagrams (HD) were used to analyse model simulations. Results indicate that the models adequately reproduce the expected annual cycle of rainfall although similar to 77% of them overestimate rain gauge data. Further, only nine of the models analysed correlate positively with rain gauge data. The correlation ranges from - 0.2 to 0.43. Seasonal root mean square errors (RMSEs) are largest during the core of the rainy season (December-February), the beginning (September-October), and the end (March-May), respectively. Rainy gauge data showed that the highest standard deviation was in the north-eastern parts of the country and around the Lake Malawi region. In general, most models poorly simulated the spatial standard deviation. Although there are large variations in model performance, models that generally perform better than others are: CNRM-CM5, EC-EARTH, GISS-E2-H, and MPI-ESM-LR. While these models are identified as well performing, their deficiencies have also been extensively discussed in this work, and therefore, caution needs to be exercised by end users when using these models to make decisions pertaining to climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.","[Libanda, Brigadier] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3FF, Midlothian, Scotland; [Nkolola, Namwiinga Babra] Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Energy Geosci Infrastruct & Soc, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh; Heriot Watt University,"Libanda, B (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3FF, Midlothian, Scotland.",brigadier.libanda@ed.ac.uk,", Libanda/N-9781-2019",", Libanda/0000-0001-8215-5572",University of Edinburgh; Commonwealth Scholarship Commission; Heriot-Watt University,University of Edinburgh; Commonwealth Scholarship Commission; Heriot-Watt University,The first author carried out this work while on a PhD scholarship sponsored by the University of Edinburgh; the university is hereby acknowledged for the financial support and for creating an environment that nurtures research activities.

In Madagascar, different sustainable agricultural practices were implemented in the last 20 years by many non-governmental organizations in order to increase crop yields, maintain soil fertility and increase household income. These practices are conservation agriculture, agroforestry systems and the use of organic fertilizers as compost and manure. This study aimed to compare the soil organic carbon storage of some climate smart practices in the Malagasy context. The soil organic carbon stock of each practice, distributed in several sites among the island, was measured and compared with the traditional practices of each study site. For conservation agriculture, the differences in the soil organic carbon content varied from 0 to 1.82 MgC ha(-1) year(-1) when compared with traditional practices (tillage and crop residues exported). For agroforestry, a difference in the soil organic carbon content of 0.68 Mg Cha(-1) year(-1) was found when comparing with the slash and burn practices in the East Coast of Madagascar but no significant soil organic carbon content was found in the Malagasy Highlands. The use of organic fertilizers such as manure, compost and urban organic waste led to an increase of soil organic carbon of 0.16, 0.81 et 0.42 Mg Cha(-1) year(-1) respectively, but these increases were not significant due to the great variability of soil organic carbon values. Results confirm the capacity of some climate smart practices to store more carbon in the soil and hence to compensate for greenhouse gases emissions. However, the storage potentiality is quite different according to the practice and its spatial extent.","[Razafimbelo, Tantely Maminiaina; Andriamananjara, Andry; Rafolisy, Tovonarivo; Razakamanarivo, Herintsitohaina; Falinirina, Marie-Virginie; Ravonjiarison, Nasandratra] Univ Antananarivo, Lab Radioisotopes, Antananarivo, Madagascar; [Masse, Dominique; Blanchart, Eric; Bernard, Laetitia; Albrecht, Alain] Univ Montpellier, Inst Rech Dev, UMR Eco & Sols, Montpellier, France",University Antananarivo; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier,"Razafimbelo, TM (corresponding author), Univ Antananarivo, Lab Radioisotopes, Antananarivo, Madagascar.",tantely.razafimbelo@gmail.com,"Masse, Dominique/A-7603-2011; Blanchart, Eric/AAI-6792-2020","Masse, Dominique/0000-0002-3165-1469; Blanchart, Eric/0000-0002-5258-5069; Razafimbelo, Tantely M./0000-0003-2101-9715",,,,,25,5,6,3,38,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",1777-5949,,,CAH AGRIC,Cah.

In the context of the scientific and policy debate surrounding potential climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, the importance of the impact of relatively recent state fire-exclusion policies on fire regimes has been debated. To provide empirical evidence to this ongoing debate we examine the impacts of state fire-exclusion policies in the chestnut forest ecosystems of two geographically neighbouring municipalities in central Spain, Casillas and Rozas de Puerto Real. Extending the concept of 'Traditional Ecological Knowledge' to include the use of fire as a management tool as 'Traditional Fire Knowledge' (TFK), we take a mixed-methods and interdisciplinary approach to argue that currently observed differences between the municipalities are useful for considering the characteristics of pre-industrial anthropogenic fire regimes and their impact on chestnut forest ecosystems. We do this by examining how responses from interviews and questionnaire surveys of local inhabitants about TFK in the past and present correspond to the current biophysical landscape state and recent fire activity (based on data from dendrochronological analysis, aerial photography and official fire statistics). We then discuss the broader implications of TFK decline for future fire management policies across Europe particularly in light of the published results of the EU sponsored Fire Paradox research project. In locations where TFK-based pre-industrial anthropogenic fire regimes still exist, ecosystem management strategies for adaptation and mitigation to climate change could be conceivably implemented at a minimal economic and political cost to the state by local communities that have both the TFK and the adequate social, economic and cultural incentives to use it.

Adaptation is typically viewed as actions in response to climate change that seek to limit its impacts and/or bring some benefit to human society. In this paper we consider adaptation actions in response to the twin risks of coastal flooding and recession both of which are likely to increase in frequency/rate and magnitude as a result of global climate change. Adaptation actions are classified on a spectrum based on the degree of planned modification of (i) human activities or (ii) the physical coastal environment. At one end of the spectrum is a set of activities that involve changing human activities to suit the changing environment (e.g. innovative building design, relocation of infrastructure and/or people, changing landuse or livelihoods). At the other extreme are activities (e.g. building or raising flood defences, building or strengthening seawalls, nourishing beaches) that involve resisting environmental change in order to preserve existing infrastructure and human activities. Between these two extremes are a few initiatives that involve components of both approaches. A qualitative review of current practice suggests that most adaptation activity is in the category of seeking to preserve human activities and infrastructure. This form of response is better termed 'resistance' than 'adaptation'. These conservative and short-term goals of protecting fixed assets and existing activities, are damaging to the environment, involve significant cost and increase future risk of catastrophic failure. Those measures that involve adaptation of human activities in response to the changing coastal environment are likely to be more sustainable in the longer term, but are politically more difficult to implement.

However, previous characterizations of these ecosystem services have typically been based on a small number of historical studies, and the consistency and extent to which marshes provide these services has not been investigated. Here, we review the current evidence for the specific processes of wave attenuation, shoreline stabilization and floodwater attenuation to determine if and under what conditions salt marshes offer these coastal protection services. Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a thorough search and synthesis of the literature with reference to these processes. Seventy-five publications met our selection criteria, and we conducted meta-analyses for publications with sufficient data available for quantitative analysis. We found that combined across all studies (n = 7), salt marsh vegetation had a significant positive effect on wave attenuation as measured by reductions in wave height per unit distance across marsh vegetation. Salt marsh vegetation also had a significant positive effect on shoreline stabilization as measured by accretion, lateral erosion reduction, and marsh surface elevation change (n = 30). Salt marsh characteristics that were positively correlated to both wave attenuation and shoreline stabilization were vegetation density, biomass production, and marsh size. Although we could not find studies quantitatively evaluating floodwater attenuation within salt marshes, there are several studies noting the negative effects of wetland alteration on water quantity regulation within coastal areas. Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that salt marshes have value for coastal hazard mitigation and climate change adaptation. Because we do not yet fully understand the magnitude of this value, we propose that decision makers employ natural systems to maximize the benefits and ecosystem services provided by salt marshes and exercise caution when making decisions that erode these services.","[Shepard, Christine C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Crain, Caitlin M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Beck, Michael W.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Shepard, CC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",cshepard@ucsc.edu,"Beck, Michael W./AAB-2844-2019","Beck, Michael W./0000-0002-5107-9973",David and Lucile Packard Foundation; Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN),David and Lucile Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation); Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN)(US Department of Education),"This work was supported by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.

A common scientific approach is the development of urban ecosystem services (UES) based on remote sensing methods at the city or district level. Urban planning, however, requires fine-grained data that match local management practices. Hence, this study linked local biotope and tree mapping methods to the concept of ecosystem services. The methodology was tested in an inner-city district in SW Germany, comparing publicly accessible areas and non-accessible courtyards. The results provide area-specific [m(2)] information on the green inventory at the microscale, whereas derived stock and UES indicators form the basis for comparative analyses regarding climate adaptation and biodiversity. In the case study, there are ten times more micro-scale green spaces in private courtyards than in the public space, as well as twice as many trees. The approach transfers a scientific concept into municipal planning practice, enables the quantitative assessment of urban green at the microscale and illustrates the importance for green stock data in private areas to enhance decision support in urban development. Different aspects concerning data collection and data availability are critically discussed.","[Boehnke, Denise] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Div Nat & Built Environm 4, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Krehl, Alice; Norra, Stefan] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Moermann, Kai; Luetzkendorf, Thomas] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Sustainable Management Housing & Real Estate, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Volk, Rebekka; Naber, Elias] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Ind Prod, D-76187 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Becker, Ronja] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Geog & Geoecol, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Potsdam; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Boehnke, D (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Div Nat & Built Environm 4, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany.",denise.boehnke@kit.edu; alice.krehl@uni-potsdam.de; kai.moermann@kit.edu; rebekka.volk@kit.edu; thomas.luetzkendorf@kit.edu; elias.naber@kit.edu; ronjabecker1@gmail.com; stefan.norra@uni-potsdam.de,"; Volk, Rebekka/R-6755-2017","Naber, Elias/0000-0001-6945-2644; Volk, Rebekka/0000-0001-9930-5354",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung-BMBF) [033W111A],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung-BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung-BMBF) grant number 033W111A and research project 'Namares' in the funding program 'RES:Z-Ressourceneffiziente Stadtquartiere'.

Drawing on primary research conducted in August 2010 through interviews with key stakeholders, this article investigates the project for the likely benefits and challenges it will face in promoting institutional, infrastructural, and community resilience to climate change impacts. We find that the country's ongoing decentralization reforms offer an effective opportunity to mainstream climate change planning into sub-national government operations, but that competing priorities for immediate investment in education, roads, and healthcare may prevent government officers from sustaining a focus on preventative adaptation measures. We conclude that through careful planning, water resources infrastructure and agricultural practices can be designed to withstand climate variability and avoid the need to replace or rehabilitate systems whose specifications were prematurely determined by international donors.","[D'Agostino, Anthony L.; Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore 259772, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"D'Agostino, AL (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, 469C Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 259772, Singapore.",sppald@nus.edu.sg,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403; D'Agostino, Anthony/0000-0002-1895-9995",,,,,69,17,17,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

The ilding simulation model is validated by comparing the simulation results with monthly electricity consumption bills. device requirements are determined by using the building model without shading devices and simulation results are studied together with the sun path diagram analysis results. Hourly and seasonal solar movements are considered as the main parameters affecting the 'transparency' and 'elevation angles' of the shading devices. As a result of the shading device requirement analysis, climate adaptive shading device (CASD) scenarios are presented for the case building. Consequently, existing shading devices and proposed CASD scenarios are compared and discussed in terms of electricity consumptions and window solar radiation energy parameters. As a result of the comparisons, shading devices that are adaptable to both hourly and seasonal solar movements gave the highest improvement results in terms of decreasing cooling energy consumptions. Also, suggestions are given for developing the best performing facade for further studies.","[Kaya, Hande Odaman] Kayapim Mimarlik, Mansuroglu Mah 286-7 Sok 10-11 Bayrakli, Izmir, Turkey; Dokuz Eylul Univ, Mimarlik Bolumu, Mimarlik Fak, Izmir, Turkey",Dokuz Eylul University,"Kaya, HO (corresponding author), Kayapim Mimarlik, Mansuroglu Mah 286-7 Sok 10-11 Bayrakli, Izmir, Turkey.",hodamankaya@gmail.com,,,,,,,28,0,0,1,4,GAZI UNIV,ANKARA,"CENTER CAMPUS TECHNOLOGY FAC B BLOCK EK BINA, 2ND FL, ANKARA, 06500, TURKEY",1302-0900,2147-9429,,J POLYTECH,J.

Against this background, this paper provides a critical review and assessment of existing economic decision support tools (cost-benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis) an uncertainty framework (iterative risk management) and alternative tools that more fully incorporate uncertainty (real options analysis, robust decision making and portfolio analysis).

How do they distribute this aid? While donors agreed to prioritise particularly vulnerable countries, we know from the general aid allocation literature that donors (also) use aid as a foreign policy tool to promote their own economic and political goals. In this paper, we analyse data on bilateral adaptation aid from 2010 through 2015 to assess to what extent adaptation aid is provided in response to recipient need (that is, vulnerability to climate change impacts) as opposed to recipient merit (that is, good governance) and donors' interests. In contrast to previous research, we find that donors partly take into account vulnerability to climate change. Countries that are physically more exposed to climate change tend to be more likely to receive some adaptation aid and also receive more adaptation aid per capita, as do poorer countries, small island developing states and to a lesser extent least developed countries. Countries with lower adaptive capacity, however, do not receive more adaptation aid; instead, donors reward well-governed countries with adaptation aid as well as use adaptation aid to promote their own economic interests. Furthermore, adaptation aid flows very closely follow general development aid flows. The extent to which adaptation aid is new and additional thus remains unclear. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The agenda is based on insights from a dialogue session held at the 2016 Adaptation Futures conference as well as drawing on the collective experience of the authors. We propose five key areas that need to be changed in order to meet the needs of future adaptation research, namely: increasing transparency and consultation in research design; encouraging innovation in the design and delivery of adaptation research programmes; demonstrating impact on the ground; addressing incentive structures; and promoting more effective brokering, knowledge management and learning.

As a result, there is a burgeoning body of studies recommending adaptation options, pathways and strategies generated by the research and increasingly private consulting sector. However, recent reviews of global adaptation performance repeatedly highlight a lack of implementation of many adaptation studies and plans. It is suggested here that one of the reasons why many coastal adaptation plans have not been applied is due to inadequate consideration of the political risk, underpinned by lack of consideration of potential allocation and distributional impacts of adaptation strategies. The work presented here identifies the political risk of the most common coastal adaptation pathways and approaches ('retreat', 'protect' and 'manage'). This work especially highlights the major political risk of pre-emptive planned retreat adaptation strategies, which may seem the most obvious adaptation approach from the perspective of minimising future risks to settlements and infrastructure. However, it carries the largest political risk and potential distributional impacts, which is likely to hinder the adoption of this adaptation strategy in the short term. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

SOC stocks in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are threatened by changes in land practice and climatic factors, which destabilises the soil system and resilience to continued climate change. Here, we provide a review of the role of SOC in overall soil health and the challenges and opportunities associated with maintaining and building SOC stocks in SSA. As an exemplar national case, we focus on Tanzania where we provide context under research for the Jali Ardhi  (Care for the Land) Project. The review details (i) the role of SOC in soil systems; (ii) sustainable land management (SLM) techniques for maintaining and building SOC; (iii) barriers (environmental, economic and social) to SLM implementation; and (iv) opportunities for overcoming barriers to SLM adoption. We provide evidence for the importance of site-specific characterisation of the biophysicochemical and socio-economic context for effective climate adaptation. In particular, we highlight the importance of SOC pools for soil function and the need for practitioners to consider the type of biomass returns to the soil to achieve healthy, balanced systems. In line with the need for local-scale site characterisation we discuss the use of established survey protocols alongside opportunities to complement these with recent technologies, such as rapid in situ scanning tools and aerial surveys. We discuss how these tools can be used to improve soil health assessments and develop critical understanding of landscape connectivity and the management of shared resources under co-design strategies.","[Taylor, Alex; Wynants, Maarten; Kelly, Claire; Kalnins, Alice; Gilvear, David; Blake, William] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Munishi, Linus; Mkilema, Francis; Ndakidemi, Patrick; Patrick, Aloyce] Nelson Mandela African Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Life Sci & Bioengn, POB 447, Arusha 23311, Tanzania; [Mtei, Kelvin] Nelson Mandela African Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Mat Energy Water & Environm Sci, POB 447, Arusha 23311, Tanzania; [Nasseri, Mona] Schumacher Coll, Ecol Design Thinking, Totnes TQ9 6EA, England",University of Plymouth; Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science & Technology; Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science & Technology,"Taylor, A (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",alex.taylor-34@plymouth.ac.uk; maarten.wynants@plymouth.ac.uk; linus.munishi@nm-aist.ac.tz; claire.kelly@plymouth.ac.uk; kelvin.mtei@nm-aist.ac.tz; francis.mkilema@nm-aist.ac.tz; patrick.ndakidemi@nm-aist.ac.tz; Mona.Nasseri@schumachercollege.org.uk; alice.kalnins@plymouth.ac.uk; david.gilvear@plymouth.ac.uk; william.blake@plymouth.ac.uk,"Wynants, Maarten/AFN-4958-2022","Wynants, Maarten/0000-0002-5367-7619; mkilema, francis/0000-0002-6782-8350; Kelly, Claire/0000-0002-3809-225X; Mtei, Kelvin/0000-0002-6792-3083; Nasseri, Mona/0000-0002-7927-210X; Taylor, Alex/0000-0001-7977-7522; Patrick, Aloyce/0000-0001-9434-9681","Research England QR Global Challenges Research Funds [NE/R009309/1]; Research Council UK Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) [NE/P015603/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/T012560/1]; UN FAO/IAEA Coordinated Research Projects (CRP) [D15017, D1.50.18]; BBSRC [BB/T012560/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Research England QR Global Challenges Research Funds; Research Council UK Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); UN FAO/IAEA Coordinated Research Projects (CRP); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),This research was funded by: Research England QR Global Challenges Research Funds allocated by the University of Plymouth [Ardhi na Kujifunza (Land and Learning)] building on UK Natural Environment Research Council grant NE/R009309/1 and Research Council UK Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) grant NE/P015603/1; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council grant BB/T012560/1.

These solutions are envisioned to contribute to operationalizing sustainable development strategies, especially in the context of adaptation to climate change (e.g. flood risk reduction). In order to quantify NBS performance, ease their uptake and advocate for them as alternatives to business-as-usual infrastructures, a comprehensive, holistic valuation of their multiple benefits (multiple advantages and disadvantages) is needed. This entails quantifying non-market benefits for people and nature in addition to determining the (direct) cost-benefit of the risk-reduction measure. Despite the importance given to the assessment of non-tangible benefits for people and nature in the literature, systematic data collection on these dimensions seems to be missing. This study reviews publications that used stated preference methods to assess non-market human benefits of NBS and NBS-like strategies. Its aim is to highlight any biases or knowledge gaps in this kind of evaluation. Our results show that the valuation of non-tangible benefits of NBS (e.g. increased recreation and well-being, enhanced biodiversity) still suffers from a lack of common framing. Despite some steps being taken on enabling interconnected benefit assessments, unexploited opportunities concerning the integrated assessment of non-market human and nature benefits predominate. Moreover, the research to-date appears based on a case-to-case approach, and thus a shared holistic method does not emerge from the present literature, potentially delaying the uptake of NBS. We argue that future research could minimize missed opportunities by focusing on and systematically applying holistic benefits assessments. Methods based on stated preference surveys may help to ensure holistic approaches are taken, as well as contributing to their replicability and application when upscaling NBS.","[Viti, Martina; Lowe, Roland; Sorup, Hjalte J.

The atmosphere is also moistening, though, representing an accumulation of latent heat, which is partly concealed by dry-bulb temperature trends. We highlight that, consistent with basic theory, latent heat gains are outpacing sensible heat gains over about half of the Earth's surface. The difference is largest in the tropics, where global hotspots of total heat accumulation are located, and where regional disparities in heating rates are very poorly represented by dry-bulb temperatures. Including latent heat in climate-change metrics captures this heat accumulation and therefore improves adaptation-relevant understanding of the extreme humid heat and precipitation hazards that threaten these latitudes so acutely. For example, irrigation can lower peak dry-bulb temperatures, but amplify latent heat content by a larger margin, intensifying dangerous heat stress. Based on a review of the research literature, our Perspective therefore calls for routine use of equivalent temperature, a measure that expresses the combined sensible and latent heat content of the atmosphere in the familiar units of degrees C or K. We recognize that dry-bulb air temperature must remain a key indicator of the atmospheric state, not least for the many sectors that are sensitive to sensible heat transfer. However, we assert here that more widespread use of equivalent temperature could improve process understanding, public messaging, and adaptation to climate change.

However, the dynamic response of the UHI effect to LULC change over space and time has not been deeply studied. In this study, a transfer matrix method was carried out to monitor the class-to-class transitions between different LULC types, as well as those between different NLST (normalized land surface temperature) levels over space and time. The spatiotemporal correlation and dynamic coupling between UHI variation and LULC change from 1987 to 2016 were simulated based on multi-temporal remote sensing data in Wuhan, China. The results showed that high temperature (level V) and sub-high temperature (level IV) were mainly concentrated in construction land, while the majority of low temperature (level I) was distributed in water bodies. During the study period, the most notable changes were the rapid increase in construction land, as well as the continuous shrinkage of farmland and water bodies. The inward transfer of construction land was mainly from farmland and water bodies, with the transferred area of 218.3 km(2) (69.2%) and 78.9 km(2) (25.0%). These transitions were mainly responsible for the thermal deterioration in the study area. The transition of farmland to construction land contributed the most (66.3% and 81.6%) to thermal deterioration in the original medium temperature area (level III). The transition of water bodies to construction land was the main driving force in rapidly upgrading NLST level I into level IV (55.8%) and level V (58.6%). These findings provided detailed information for decision support in optimizing land use structure to fight against the thermal deterioration caused by urbanization.","[Xie, Qijiao; Sun, Qi; Ouyang, Zhonglu] Hubei Univ, Fac Resources & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430062, Peoples R China; [Xie, Qijiao] Key Lab Reg Dev & Environm Response, Wuhan 430062, Peoples R China",Hubei University,"Xie, QJ (corresponding author), Hubei Univ, Fac Resources & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430062, Peoples R China.;Xie, QJ (corresponding author), Key Lab Reg Dev & Environm Response, Wuhan 430062, Peoples R China.",xieqijiao@126.com; sq1631@126.com; oyzl_email@163.com,,,Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province of China [2019CFB538]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41401186],Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province of China (2019CFB538) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41401186).,,51,4,4,3,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Population growth and extended urban footprints in the region's cities have decreased rainfall infiltration and significantly increased runoff, carrying sediments and other pollutants into binational watersheds thus contributing to the pollution of aquatic habitats and potable water sources. As a strategy to mitigate these impacts, the Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC) developed a four year initiative with the long-term goal to support communities in building resiliency through the use of GI in public spaces such as parks, sidewalks, medians, and parking lots as a way to adapt to climate change, improve urban image, and strengthen native ecosystems. The Border Green Infrastructure Initiative was organized around training, strengthening municipal codes, developing pilot projects, restoring native vegetation, and the participation of residents, local government, and the private sector. The investment over the entire period was approximately USD$800,000. Outcomes were noteworthy. Approximately 900 professionals received various types of capacity building. Five cities and four Mexican border states were active participants in the program. Six pilot projects were implemented, three of which could capture a total volume of 4691 m(3) of water in one year. In two sites the annual sediment collected was 656 m(3). Finally, six technical tools were developed to assist communities in analysis and implementation. This approach represents a paradigm shift from the conventional management of stormwater through gray infrastructure and is intended to influence public policy at the local level, in a replicable and scalable way, resulting in more livable cities, improved water quality, and stronger binational environmental health.","[Giner, Maria-Elena] Univ Texas Austin, Lyndon B Johnson Sch Publ Policy, 2315 Red River, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Cordova, Ana] Colegio Frontera Norte, Dept Estudios Urbanos & Medio Ambiente, Ave Insurgentes 3708, Ciudad Juarez 32350, Chihuahua, Mexico; [Vazquez-Galvez, Felipe A.] Univ Autonoma Ciudad Juarez, Inst Ingn & Tecnol, Ave Hermanos Escobar S-N, Ciudad Juarez 32584, Chihuahua, Mexico",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Colegio Frontera Norte; Universidad Autonoma de Ciudad Juarez,"Giner, ME (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Lyndon B Johnson Sch Publ Policy, 2315 Red River, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",mariaelenaginer@utexas.edu; acordova@colef.mx; fvazquez@uacj.mx; jmarruffor@gmail.com,,"Vazquez-Galvez, Felipe Adrian/0000-0003-0282-8023",,,,,34,8,8,2,61,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Manhattan, Berlin and New Delhi all need to take action to adapt to climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While case studies on these cities provide valuable insights, comparability and scalability remain sidelined. It is therefore timely to review the state-of-the-art in data infrastructures, including earth observations, social media data, and how they could be better integrated to advance climate change science in cities and urban areas. We present three routes for expanding knowledge on global urban areas: main-streaming data collections, amplifying the use of big data and taking further advantage of computational methods to analyse qualitative data to gain new insights. These data-based approaches have the potential to upscale urban climate solutions and effect change at the global scale. Technical summary. Cities have an increasingly integral role in addressing climate change. To gain a common understanding of solutions, we require adequate and representative data of urban areas, including data on related greenhouse gas emissions, climate threats and of socio-economic contexts. Here, we review the current state of urban data science in the context of climate change, investigating the contribution of urban metabolism studies, remote sensing, big data approaches, urban economics, urban climate and weather studies. We outline three routes for upscaling urban data science for global climate solutions: 1) Mainstreaming and harmonizing data collection in cities worldwide; 2) Exploiting big data and machine learning to scale solutions while maintaining privacy; 3) Applying computational techniques and data science methods to analyse published qualitative information for the systematization and understanding of first-order climate effects and solutions. Collaborative efforts towards a joint data platform and integrated urban services would provide the quantitative foundations of the emerging global urban sustainability science.","[Creutzig, Felix; Lamb, William F.; Minx, Jan] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany; [Creutzig, Felix; Lohrey, Steffen] Tech Univ Berlin, Sustainabil Econ Human Settlements, Berlin, Germany; [Bai, Xuemei] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Baklanov, Alexander] World Meteorol Org WMO, Geneva, Switzerland; [Dawson, Richard] Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Dhakal, Shobhakar] Asian Inst Technol, Bangkok, Thailand; [McPhearson, Timon] New Sch, Urban Syst Lab, New York, NY USA; [McPhearson, Timon] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Milbrook, NY USA; [McPhearson, Timon] Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Munoz, Esteban] UN Environm, Paris, France; [Walsh, Brenna] Future Earth, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Technical University of Berlin; Australian National University; Newcastle University - UK; Asian Institute of Technology; The New School; Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies; Stockholm University,"Creutzig, F (corresponding author), Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany.;Creutzig, F (corresponding author), Tech Univ Berlin, Sustainabil Econ Human Settlements, Berlin, Germany.",creutzig@mcc-berlin.net,"; Bai, Xuemei/A-5443-2012; Creutzig, Felix/B-8691-2016","Lamb, William F./0000-0003-3273-7878; Minx, Jan Christoph/0000-0002-2862-0178; Lohrey, Steffen/0000-0001-7881-9102; Bai, Xuemei/0000-0001-6556-8041; Baklanov, Alexander/0000-0002-5396-8440; Creutzig, Felix/0000-0002-5710-3348",Urban Resilience to Extreme Weather-Related Events Sustainability Research Network (URExSRN; NSF) [SES 1444755],Urban Resilience to Extreme Weather-Related Events Sustainability Research Network (URExSRN; NSF),"Material for this paper was prepared for, and presented at a special session of, the IPCC Cities and Climate Change Conference, 5-7th March 2018.

Flood risk increases when landscapes degrade, counteracted or aggravated by engineering solutions. Efforts to maintain and restore buffering as an ecosystem function may help adaptation to climate change, but this require quantification of effectiveness in their specific social-ecological context. However, the specific role of forests, trees, soil and drainage pathways in flow buffering, given geology, land form and climate, remains controversial. When complementing the scarce heavily instrumented catchments with reliable long-term data, especially in the tropics, there is a need for metrics for data-sparse conditions. We present and discuss a flow persistence metric that relates transmission to river flow of peak rainfall events to the base-flow component of the water balance. The dimensionless flow persistence parameter F-p is defined in a recursive flow model and can be estimated from limited time series of observed daily flow, without requiring knowledge of spatially distributed rainfall upstream. The F-p metric (or its change over time from what appears to be the local norm) matches local knowledge concepts. Inter-annual variation in the F-p metric in sample watersheds correlates with variation in the flashiness index used in existing watershed health monitoring programmes, but the relationship between these metrics varies with context. Inter-annual variation in F-p also correlates with common base-flow indicators, but again in a way that varies between watersheds. Further exploration of the responsiveness of F-p in watersheds with different characteristics to the interaction of land cover and the specific realisation of space-time patterns of rainfall in a limited obser-vation period is needed to evaluate interpretation of F-p as an indicator of anthropogenic changes in watershed conditions.","[van Noordwijk, Meine; Tanika, Lisa; Lusiana, Betha] World Agroforestry Ctr, Bogor, Indonesia; [van Noordwijk, Meine] Wageningen Univ, Plant Prod Syst, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"van Noordwijk, M (corresponding author), World Agroforestry Ctr, Bogor, Indonesia.;van Noordwijk, M (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Plant Prod Syst, Wageningen, Netherlands.",m.vannoordwijk@cgiar.org,"van Noordwijk, Meine/C-3338-2008","van Noordwijk, Meine/0000-0002-7791-4703",,,,,87,21,21,1,37,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

Climate change threatens to further exacerbate this trend by increasing both the severity and duration of many natural hazards, ultimately leading to even greater costs in both human life and monetary resources. To prepare for these changes, a handful of local communities have integrated climate change into their Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved hazard mitigation plans. This paper analyzes 30 U.S. local hazard mitigation plans against a conceptual framework for how climate change could be integrated into the requirements specified in the FEMA Plan Review Crosswalk, a checklist used by FEMA to evaluate and approve local hazard mitigation plans. Results show that the majority (23/35) of communities are openly discussing how climate change could affect or already is affecting the occurrence of natural hazards. Additionally, over half also include hazard mitigation actions that are designed to be viable in a climate-altered future. These actions, however, represent only a small portion of the total actions proposed in the plans and are generally focused on researching, planning, and capacity building. In addition, few communities include a formal commitment to adapting to climate change or include clear mechanisms for integrating new climate information as it become available into plan revisions. In general, results from this analysis show that there is little consistency in how communities are integrating climate change into hazard planning. These findings point to both the nascence of this practice and the opportunity to develop more formalized guidance that can steer communities towards holistic integration of climate change into hazards planning.

Identifying and protecting areas of the ocean where conditions are most stable may provide another tool for adaptation to climate change. To date, research on potential marine climate refugia has focused on tropical systems, particularly coral reefs. We examined a northeast Pacific temperate region - Canada's Pacific - to identify areas where physical conditions are stable or changing slowly. We analyzed the rate and consistency of change for climatic variables where recent historical data were available for the whole region, which included sea surface temperature, sea surface height, and chlorophyll a. We found that some regions have been relatively stable with respect to these variables. In discussions with experts in the oceanography of this region, we identified general characteristics that may limit exposure to climate change. We used climate models for sea surface temperature and sea surface height to assess projected future changes. Climate projections indicate that large or moderate changes will occur throughout virtually the entire area and that small changes will occur in only limited portions of the coast. Combining past and future areas of stability in all three examined variables to identify potential climate refugia indicates that only 0.27% of the study region may be insulated from current and projected future change. A greater proportion of the study region (11%) was stable in two of the three variables. Some of these areas overlap with oceanographic features that are thought to limit climate change exposure. This approach allowed for an assessment of potential climate refugia that could also have applications in other regions and systems, but revealed that there are unlikely to be many areas unaffected by climate change.

Although many comparisons have been made between organic and conventional agriculture in terms of crop yields, economic returns and other factors, only a few studies have compared their effects on mitigating climate change. The present review compares the effectiveness of organic and conventional agriculture in mitigating climate change. The review reveals that organic agriculture has a greater potential for mitigating climate change, largely due to its greater ability in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) including carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). It also increases carbon sequestration in soils compared with that of conventional agriculture. In addition, many farming practices commonly adopted in organic agriculture such as rotation with leguminous crops, minimum or no tillage, and the return of crop residues favour the reduction of GHGs and the enhancement of soil carbon sequestration. The certification of farming practices as required in organic agriculture provides a transparent guarantee of organic principles and standards. This also allows the enforced adoption of new and effective practices aimed at improving the mitigation of climate change. Furthermore, organic agriculture is highly adaptable to climate change compared with conventional agriculture. However, greater recognition of the potential of organic agriculture for mitigating climate change is needed. At present, this recognition depends on the ability of organic yields to out-perform conventional yields, which has been shown to occur in developing countries. More research is needed to improve organic yields in developed countries and to improve the potential of mitigating climate change by organic agriculture. Future strategies for improving the effectiveness of organic agriculture in mitigating climate change are presented and discussed.","Lincoln Univ, Dept Soil & Phys Sci, Fac Agr & Life Sci, Canterbury, New Zealand",Lincoln University - New Zealand,"Goh, KM (corresponding author), Lincoln Univ, Dept Soil & Phys Sci, Fac Agr & Life Sci, POB 84, Canterbury, New Zealand.",Kuan.Goh@lincoln.ac.nz,,,,,,,137,22,24,6,159,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-8765,2165-0616,,BIOL AGRIC HORTIC,Biol.

For a rich economy such as Australia's, the majority of human systems have considerable adaptive capacity. However, the impacts on human systems at the intra-nation level are not homogenous due to their differing levels of exposure, sensitivity and capacity to adapt to climate change. Despite past resilience to changing climates, many Indigenous communities located in remote areas are currently identified as highly vulnerable to climate impacts due to their high level of exposure and sensitivity, but low capacity to adapt. In particular, communities located on low-lying islands have particular vulnerability to sea level rise and increasingly intense storm surges caused by more extreme weather. Several Torres Strait Island community leaders have been increasingly concerned about these issues, and the ongoing risks to these communities' health and well-being posed by direct and indirect climate impacts. A government agency is beginning to develop short-term and long-term adaptation plans for the region. This work, however, is being developed without adequate scientific assessment of likely 'climate changed futures.' This is because the role that anthropogenic climate change has played, or will play, on extreme weather events for this region is not currently clear. This paper draws together regional climate data to enable a more accurate assessment of the islands' exposure to climate impacts. Understanding the level of exposure and uncertainty around specific impacts is vital to gauge the nature of these islands' vulnerability, in so doing, to inform decisions about how best to develop anticipatory adaptation strategies over various time horizons, and to address islanders' concerns about the likely resilience and viability of their communities in the longer term.","[Green, Donna] Univ New S Wales, Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Alexander, Lisa; Nicholls, Neville] Monash Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Mclnnes, Kathy; Church, John; Nicholls, Neville] Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; Monash University; Antarctic Climate & Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre (ACE CRC),"Green, D (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",donna.green@unsw.edu.au,"McInnes, Kathleen L/A-7787-2012; Alexander, Lisa V/A-8477-2011; Nicholls, Neville/A-1240-2008; Church, John A/A-1541-2012; White, Neil/B-2077-2013","McInnes, Kathleen L/0000-0002-1810-7215; Alexander, Lisa V/0000-0002-5635-2457; Church, John A/0000-0002-7037-8194; Nicholls, Neville/0000-0002-1298-4356; green, donna/0000-0003-4521-8735",Australian Government's Marine and Tropical Sciences Research Facility; Australian Government's Cooperative Research Centres through Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre; Australian Climate Change Science Program; Australian Research Council [DP0877417],"Australian Government's Marine and Tropical Sciences Research Facility(Australian Government); Australian Government's Cooperative Research Centres through Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); Australian Climate Change Science Program; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","The authors would also like to thank David Hanslow, Ian Macadam, Kevin Parnell, Benjamin Preston, Sam Reuben, Peter Todd and Penny Whetton for valuable comments.

Accordingly, there is a growing need for proactive adaptation to climate change risks. In order to achieve this, the requisite competence needs to be developed on the use and interpretation of climate information to support informed decisions. The present paper assesses the extent to which climate change scenarios are currently used in developing adaptation strategies within the agricultural development sector, with a focus on Africa. The data, based on interviews with practitioners and donors working in the climate change field in Africa, suggest that although annual climate information (such as seasonal climate forecasts) is used to a certain extent to inform and support some decisions, climate change scenarios are rarely used at present in agricultural development. However, respondents suggest a number of ways to improve the application of climate change science in these endeavors; these include strengthening technical skills for downscaling climate models, as well as using scenario outputs to develop and prioritize robust locally relevant adaptation strategies to provide examples of 'good' adaptation practice. Improved understanding, packaging, and communication of climate scenarios are required between scientists, practitioners, policymakers and civil society, both within areas in the global south as well as between the global south and north. In addition, we argue that a paradigmatic shift is required from supply-driven activities to a user-focused approach that addresses decision makers' needs for climate change data. Such a shift would focus on generating the information required to provide actionable suggestions to formulate viable adaptation policies and reduce the negative consequences of climate change, particularly for Africa's most vulnerable groups.","[Ziervogel, Gina; Zermoglio, Fernanda] Oxford Off, Stockholm Environm Inst, Oxford OX2 7DL, England",,"Ziervogel, G (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Private Bag X3, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.",gina@csag.uct.ac.za,"Ziervogel, Gina/AAG-2945-2019","Ziervogel, Gina/0000-0003-4219-6809",,,,,51,46,46,0,43,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0936-577X,1616-1572,,CLIM RES,Clim.

Resilience research and practice have conceptual and empirical challenges of how to understand, characterize and measure resilience, particularly at community level. Using a multidimensional framework, this paper takes a systems approach to understanding, characterizing, and measuring community flood resilience. Through cluster analysis, bivariate methods and multivariable-adjusted binary logistic regression modeling, we developed a context and hazard specific construct of community flood resilience and investigated its predictor variables. The factors defining the community flood resilience construct captured the community needs to withstand disasters through purpose-built infrastructure, early warning systems for preparedness and utilization of local human capacity for adaptation. These results strengthen the previous arguments for utilizing a comprehensive multidimensional framework for resilience analysis. Access to services for improved health and psychosocial well-being was significantly associated with the three-item measure of being more flood resilient. Additionally, a strong sense of place and resistance to relocation were presented as key elements of resilience, maintaining community system function, and preserving livelihoods. The study further found that these key factors would not be adequate to guarantee community flood resilience outside the transformative capacity of a well-resourced village civil protection committee that can prepare and mobilize stakeholders in response to flood emergencies. Our results suggest that, in the context where policymakers seek to strengthen resilience of communities without relocating them, a focus on public health and on strengthening and utilizing local capacities as adaptation, are key in disaster risk management policymaking and implementation. For the international research community, this study demonstrated the importance of utilizing context and hazard specific measures for defining, characterizing, and measuring resilience to inform policy.","[Dewa, Ozius; Ayo-Yusuf, Olalekan A.] Sch Hlth Syst & Publ Hlth, Fac Hlth Sci, Pretoria, South Africa; [Dewa, Ozius; Ayo-Yusuf, Olalekan A.] Univ Pretoria, Southern Afr Resilience Innovat Lab, Pretoria, South Africa; [Makoka, Donald] Lilongwe Univ Agr & Nat Resources, Ctr Agr Res & Dev, Lilongwe, Malawi; [Dewa, Ozius] Sch Hlth Syst & Publ Hlth, Fac Hlth Sci, Private Bag X323, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria; Lilongwe University of Agriculture & Natural Resources,"Dewa, O (corresponding author), Sch Hlth Syst & Publ Hlth, Fac Hlth Sci, Private Bag X323, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",oziusd@gmail.com,"Ayo-Yusuf, Olalekan/HKF-6027-2023","Dewa, Ozius/0000-0002-4477-0408",United States Agency for International Development [AID-OAA-A-13-00018],United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"United States Agency for International Development, Grant/Award Number: AID-OAA-A-13-00018",,107,1,1,13,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1753-318X,,,J FLOOD RISK MANAG,J.

Construction of engineering infrastructures (e.g., piers, bridges) in these areas alters estuary-wide hydromorphological conditions and thus sedimentation patterns at the estuarine scale, which are key drivers of habitats distribution and ecosystem structure, processes and functions. Most of the research on the impact of civil engineering structures on coastal habitats has focused on the biological communities that colonize them or the bottoms where they are placed, whereas their indirect impacts on adjacent habitats has been largely unexplored. Understanding the influence of man-made infrastructures on the distribution of estuarine habitats and functions is critical, particularly considering that shoreline armoring is expected to increase as a way to protect coastal areas from hazards derived from climate change. Shifts in habitat distribution and functions occur in several years or decades and relating them with the occurrence of past historical events is challenging when no monitoring data is available. By examining historical aerial photographs and different biogeochemical properties along a saltmarsh soil record, this study demonstrates that the construction of an infrastructure (i.e. bridge) caused a rapid transformation (similar to 30 years) of a bare sandflat into a high marsh community and to significant changes in sediment biogeochemical properties, including the decrease in sediment accretion rate and C-org burial rates since then. This study contributes to increase the knowledge on the impact that the construction in coastal areas of civil engineering infrastructures can cause in intertidal habitats distribution and the ecological functions they provide for climate change adaption and mitigation.","[Mazarrasa, Ines; Puente, Araceli; Juanes, Jose A.] Univ Cantabria, IHCantabria Inst Hidraul Ambiental, Parque Cient & Tecnol Cantabria PCTCAN, Santander, Spain; [Mazarrasa, Ines] CSIC, Ctr Estudios Avanzados Blanes, Blanes, Girona, Spain; [Garcia-Orellana, Jordi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Fis, Barcelona, Spain; [Garcia-Orellana, Jordi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Barcelona, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria; IHCantabria - Instituto de Hidraulica Ambiental de la Universidad de Cantabria; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centre d'Estudis Avancats de Blanes (CEAB); Autonomous University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Mazarrasa, I (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, IHCantabria Inst Hidraul Ambiental, Parque Cient & Tecnol Cantabria PCTCAN, Santander, Spain.;Mazarrasa, I (corresponding author), CSIC, Ctr Estudios Avanzados Blanes, Blanes, Girona, Spain.",mazarrasai@unican.es,"Mazarrasa, Ines/A-8420-2017; Garcia-Orellana, Jordi/L-7758-2014; JUANES, JOSE A/O-2578-2013","Mazarrasa, Ines/0000-0002-5476-9953; Garcia-Orellana, Jordi/0000-0002-0543-2641; JUANES, JOSE A/0000-0003-1825-2858",LIFE Programme of the European Union [LIFE18 CCA/ES/001160]; Government of Cantabria through the Fenix Programme; Generalitat de Catalunya [2017 SGR-1588]; Spanish Government [CEX2019-000940-M],LIFE Programme of the European Union; Government of Cantabria through the Fenix Programme; Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Spanish Government(Spanish Government),"This research was carried out with the contribution of the LIFE Programme of the European Union to the Project ADAPTA BLUES (ref.

Here, 19 durum wheat, 24 barley, and 24 lentil elites incorporating CWR in their pedigrees were yield tested against commercial checks across 19 environments located in Morocco, Ethiopia, Lebanon, and Senegal. For each crop, the combined analysis of variance showed that genotype (G), environment (E), and genotype x environment (GxE) effects were significant for most of the traits. A selection index combining yield potential (G) and yield stability (GxE) was used to identify six CWR-derived elites for each crop matching or superior to the best check. A regression analysis using a climate matrix revealed that grain yield was mostly influenced by the maximum daily temperature and soil moisture level during the growing stages. These climatic factors were used to define five clusters (i.e., E1 to E5) of mega-environments. The CWR-derived elites significantly outperformed the checks in E1, E2, and E4 for durum wheat, and in E2 for both barley and lentil. The germplasm was also assessed for several food transformation characteristics. For durum wheat, one accession (Zeina) originating from T. araraticum was significantly superior in mixograph score to the best check, and three accessions originating from T. araraticum and T. urartu were superior for Zn concentration. For barley, 21 accessions originating from H. spontaneum were superior to the checks for protein content, six for Zn content, and eight for beta-glucan. For lentil, ten accessions originating from Lens orientalis were superior to the check for protein content, five for Zn, and ten for Fe concentration. Hence, the results presented here strongly support the use of CWR in breeding programs of these three dryland crops, both for adaptation to climatic stresses and for value addition for food transformation.","[El Haddad, Noureddine; Sanchez-Garcia, Miguel; Visioni, Andrea; Kumar, Shiv; Bassi, Filippo M.] Int Ctr Agr Res Dry Areas ICARDA, Rabat 10112, Morocco; [El Haddad, Noureddine] Univ Mohammed V Rabat, Fac Sci, Rabat 10112, Morocco; [Jilal, Abderrazek] Natl Inst Agr Res INRA, Rabat 10112, Morocco; [El Amil, Rola] Lebanese Agr Res Inst LARI, Zahle 287, Lebanon; [Sall, Amadou Tidiane] Inst Senegalais Rech Agr ISRA, St Louis 46024, Senegal; [Lagesse, Wasihun] Ethiopian Inst Agr Res EIAR, Addis Ababa 1000, Ethiopia",CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA); Mohammed V University in Rabat; Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR),"Bassi, FM (corresponding author), Int Ctr Agr Res Dry Areas ICARDA, Rabat 10112, Morocco.",n.el-haddad@cgiar.org; m.sanchez-garcia@cgiar.org; a.visioni@cgiar.org; abderrazek.jilal@inra.ma; ramil@lari.gov.lb; tidianesa1111@yahoo.com; wasihunl@yahoo.com; sk.agrawal@cgiar.org; f.bassi@cgiar.org,"; Sanchez-Garcia, Miguel/B-1465-2019","Bassi, Filippo Maria/0000-0002-1164-5598; Kumar, Shiv/0000-0001-8407-3562; Jilal, Abderrazek/0000-0002-9147-9074; Sanchez-Garcia, Miguel/0000-0002-9257-4583; El Haddad, Noureddine/0000-0001-8848-4799","Adapting Agriculture to Climate Change: Collecting, Protecting and Preparing CropWild Relatives - Government of Norway; Millennium Seed Bank of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew project [GS18009]","Adapting Agriculture to Climate Change: Collecting, Protecting and Preparing CropWild Relatives - Government of Norway; Millennium Seed Bank of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew project","This research was fully funded by Adapting Agriculture to Climate Change: Collecting, Protecting and Preparing CropWild Relatives, supported by the Government of Norway, managed by the Global Crop Diversity Trust with the Millennium Seed Bank of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew project GS18009: DIIVA-PR: dissemination of interspecific ICARDA cultivars and elites through participatory research.",,106,3,3,2,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,NOV,2021,11,11,,,,,,,2283,10.3390/agronomy11112283,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11112283,,,23,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,XG6IH,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000724853900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The focus of smart city studies and policy initiatives has historically been on technology, particularly how information and communi-cation technology can be leveraged to improve city functions. This focus has begun to shift towards sustain-ability, with many researchers calling for the development of smart, sustainable cities, which can aid efforts of climate change mitigation and adaptation. The connection between smart cities and climate change, however, is not clear. In this review article, we aim to synthesize the recent literature surrounding smart cities and climate change, and to discuss the benefits (or costs) of smart cities with regard to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. In particular, we focus on five key aspects of urban resilience to climate change: infrastruc-ture, public health and well-being, accessibility and equity, sustainable systems, and governance. The literature reveals a higher level of emphasis on infrastructure resilience to climate change than the other categories. Moreover, the research areas differ in the level of connection between smart city initiatives and climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. For example, within the critical infrastructure research area, studies on smart energy systems focus on climate change mitigation, particularly reducing emissions, while studies on smart water systems emphasize adaptation to future floods and droughts. Going beyond the aforementioned research areas, we discuss the role of big data in smart cities, including the benefits and challenges associated with collecting large amounts of data from smart technology, as well as the techniques needed to analyze such data. Finally, we highlight future directions that we believe the research on smart cities needs to focus on, based on the results from our literature review. These include infrastructure and disaster resilience, public health and social equity, and sustainability.","[Obringer, Renee] Univ Maryland, Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr, 1 Pk Pl, Annapolis, DC 21401 USA; [Obringer, Renee] Purdue Univ, Environm & Ecol Engn, 500 Cent Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Nateghi, Roshanak] Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, 315 N Grant St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Nateghi, Roshanak] Purdue Univ, Ctr Environm, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Nateghi, Roshanak] Purdue Univ, Purdue Climate Change Res Ctr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Obringer, R (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr, 1 Pk Pl, Annapolis, DC 21401 USA.",obringer@umd.edu,,"Obringer, Renee/0000-0002-4471-4131","NSF [1826161, 1832688]; National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) from the NSF [DBI-1639145]; Graduate School at Purdue University; Bilsland Dissertation Fellowship; Purdue University Center for the Environment; Purdue Climate Change Research Center",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) from the NSF; Graduate School at Purdue University; Bilsland Dissertation Fellowship; Purdue University Center for the Environment; Purdue Climate Change Research Center,"The authors would like to acknowledge support from NSF grants #1826161 & #1832688, as well as the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) under funding received from the NSF grant #DBI-1639145.

As one of the high risk countries, fifty percent of the country's informal settlements are located in danger and disaster-prone areas. However, informal settlement upgrading has not reached its significance in disaster mitigation and community resilience building. At the national level, on-site upgrading is not established in disaster risk management or climate change adaptation strategies, which explains the lack of strategic approaches for local implementation. Metro Manila serves as a suitable backdrop in this sense to study informal settlement upgrading under the condition of high risk and rapid urbanization with a high civil society engagement. This study investigates the underlined reasons why upgrading strategically falls short in addressing disaster mitigation and community resilience building. Theoretically, it questions what on-site upgrading is about. Empirically, two hazard-prone informal settlement communities within Metro Manila are examined with their different risk profiles, community development needs and resilience priorities. The core issues of upgrading are, therefore, differentiated at the settlement level with communities' innate socio-economic and eco-spatial features over time. Meanwhile, the paper heightens the necessity of tackling on-site upgrading at the settlement level and articulating settlements' spatial correlations with the city development, so as to sustain upgrading outcomes. In addition, this study attempts at setting up a range of scenarios conditioned with COVID pandemic fallout. It endeavors to provide another facet of how to deal with adaptation and resilience. This includes the urgent strategy shift in the housing sector and its financial sustainability, innovative mechanisms to manage uncertainty and risks, lessons for post-COVID planning, etc.","[Du, Juan; Greiving, Stefan] TU Dortmund Univ, Sch Spatial Planning, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany",Dortmund University of Technology,"Du, J; Greiving, S (corresponding author), TU Dortmund Univ, Sch Spatial Planning, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany.",juan.du@tu-dortmund.de; stefan.greiving@tu-dortmund.de,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,"German Federal Ministry of Education, and Research (BMBF) [01LE1906A]","German Federal Ministry of Education, and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education, and Research (BMBF) under the project Linking Disaster Risk Governance and Land-use Planning: The Case of Informal Settlements in Hazard-prone Areas in the Philippines (LIRLAP) with grant number 01LE1906A.

One approach that can be used to adapt to changing climatic pattern is in-field water harvesting. This study evaluated the soil profile water content and maize yields of 3 infield water harvesting technologies namely infiltration pits (IF), fanya juus (FJ) and contour ridges with cross ties (CRCT) in comparison to standard contour ridges (SC). The three systems are currently the focus of extension recommendations for water conservation in semi-arid regions of the country. Soil water content was measured on a regular basis using gravimetric methods at locations upslope and down slope of each structure. The average volumetric water content was signifcantly different between treatments, and it varied with increasing distance from the water harvesting structures. The average profile soil moisture content, over the three seasons were 8.3, 8.2, 8.1 and 7.8% for CRCT, FJ, IF and SC repectively. CRCT, FJ and IF retained more water for a greater distance from the harvesting structures compared to the SC. Maize yields were significantly higher in the water harvesting technologies compared to SC. Maize yields were 1196, 1164, 1250 and 749 kg ha(-1) for CRCT, FJ, IF and SC respectively. There as a good correlation between water content and maize yields (R-2 = 0.80). It was concluded that improved water harvesting structures when compared to SC have the potential to increase maize yields in areas with water shortages, hence they can be a useful strategy for climate change adaptation.","[Nyagumbo, Isaiah] CIMMYT, Southern Africa Reg Off, POB MP163, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Nyamadzawo, George; Madembo, Connie] Bindura Univ Sci Educ, Dept Environm Sci, Box 1020, Bindura, Zimbabwe",,"Nyamadzawo, G (corresponding author), Bindura Univ Sci Educ, Dept Environm Sci, Box 1020, Bindura, Zimbabwe.",gnyama@yahoo.com,,"Nyamadzawo, George/0000-0001-8048-935X",International Foundation of Science (IFS),International Foundation of Science (IFS)(International Foundation for Science),"We are grateful for the funding from the International Foundation of Science (IFS).

Wildfires are anticipated to be more frequent and intense under climate change. As a result, wildfires may emit more air pollutants that can harm health in communities in the future. The health impacts of wildfire smoke under climate change are largely unknown. Methods. Welinked projections of future levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) specifically from wildfire smoke under the A1B climate change scenario using the GEOS-Chem model for 2046-2051, present-day estimates of hospital admission impacts from wildfire smoke, and future population projections to estimate the change in respiratory hospital admissions for persons >= 65 years by county (n. = 561) from wildfire PM2.5 under climate change in the Western US. Results. The increase in intense wildfire smoke days from climate change would result in an estimated 178 (95% confidence interval: 6.2, 361) additional respiratory hospital admissions in the Western US, accounting for estimated future increase in the elderly population. Climate change is estimated to impose an additional 4990 high-pollution smoke days. Central Colorado, Washington and southern California are estimated to experience the highest percentage increase in respiratory admissions from wildfire smoke under climate change. Conclusion. Although the increase in number of respiratory admissions from wildfire smoke seems modest, these results provide important scientific evidence of an often-ignored aspect of wildfire impact, and information on their anticipated spatial distribution. Wildfires can cause serious social burdens such as property damage and suppression cost, but can also raise health problems. The results provide information that can be incorporated into development of environmental and health policies in response to climate change. Climate change adaptation policies could incorporate scientific evidence on health risks from natural disasters such as wildfires.","[Liu, Jia Coco; Bell, Michelle L.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Liu, Jia Coco; Peng, Roger D.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD USA; [Mickley, Loretta J.; Sulprizio, Melissa P.; Yue, Xu] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Yue, Xu] Chinese Acad Sci, Climate Change Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Dominici, Francesca] Harvard Univ, Dept Biostat, TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Yale University; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Harvard University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

However, data on floods are scarce in many of the countries where people are most exposed and vulnerable to their impacts. Here, our separate analyses of village interview surveys (364 villages) and news archives (16 sources) show that floods have major impacts on lives and livelihoods in Indonesian Borneo, and flooding risks are associated with features of the local climate and landscape, particularly land uses that have seen rapid expansions over the past 30 years. In contrast with government assessments, we find that flooding is far more widespread, and that frequent, local, events can have large cumulative impacts. Over three years, local news agencies reported floods that affected 868 settlements, 966 times (including 89 in urban areas), inundated at least 197 000 houses, and displaced more than 776 000 people, possibly as many as 1.5 million (i.e. 5%-10% of the total population). Spatial analyses based on surveys in 364 villages show that flood frequency is associated with land use in catchment areas, including forest cover and condition, and the area of wetlands, mines (open-cut coal or gold mines), and oil palm. The probability that floods have become more frequent over the past 30 years was higher for villages closer to mines, and in watersheds with more extensive oil palm, but lower in watersheds with greater cover of selectively-logged or intact forests. We demonstrate that in data-poor regions, multiple sources of information can be integrated to gain insights into the hydrological services provided by forest and wetland ecosystems, and motivate more comprehensive assessment of flooding risks and options for ecosystem-based adaptation.","[Wells, Jessie A.; Abram, Nicola K.; Nunn, Malcolm; Runting, Rebecca K.; Meijaard, Erik] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Wells, Jessie A.; Abram, Nicola K.; Tarniati, Nina; Meijaard, Erik] Borneo Futures, People & Nat Consulting Int, Country Woods 306,Jl WR Supratman, Jakarta 15412, Indonesia; [Wilson, Kerrie A.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Abram, Nicola K.] Living Landscape Alliance, 5 Jupiter House,Calleva Pk, Reading RG7 8NN, Berks, England; [Abram, Nicola K.] HUTAN Kinabatangan Orang Utan Conservat Programme, POB 17793, Kota Kinabalu 88874, Sabah, Malaysia; [Gaveau, David L.

Climate change will likely increase the temperatures humans are exposed to through exacerbated heat wave intensity and frequency, possibly increasing health risks from heat. To prevent adverse effects on human health, heat prevention plans and climate change adaptation strategies are being implemented. But are these measures effectively reducing heat-related mortality and morbidity? This study assesses the evidence base in 2014. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed published literature. We applied a combined search strategy of automated search and journal content search using the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Biological Abstracts, CAB Abstracts and ProQuest Dissertation & Theses A&I. Quality appraisal was conducted using CASP checklists, and we identified recurrent themes in studies with content analysis methodology. We conducted sub-group analyses for two types of studies: survey and interview research on behavioral change and perception, and observational studies with regression. Results: 30 articles were included in the review. The majority of studies (n = 17) assessed mortality or morbidity reductions with regression analysis. Overall, the assessments report a reduction of adverse effects during extreme heat in places where preventive measures have been implemented. Population perception and behavior change were assessed in five studies, none of which had carried out a pre-test. Two themes emerged from the review: methodological challenges are a major hindrance to rigorous evaluation, and what counts as proof of an effective reduction in adverse health outcomes is disputed. Conclusions: Attributing health outcomes to heat adaptation remains a challenge. Recent study designs are less rigorous due to difficulties assigning the counterfactual. While sensitivity to heat is decreasing, the examined studies provide inconclusive evidence on individual planned adaptation measures.","[Boeckmann, Melanie] BIPS, Leibniz Inst Prevent Res & Epidemiol, Dept Prevent & Evaluat, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Boeckmann, Melanie] Univ Bremen, Ctr Social Policy Res, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Rohn, Ines] Hannover Med Sch, D-30625 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research & Epidemiology (BIPS); University of Bremen; Hannover Medical School,"Boeckmann, M (corresponding author), BIPS, Leibniz Inst Prevent Res & Epidemiol, Dept Prevent & Evaluat, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",melanie.boeckmann@bips.uni-bremen.de,,"Boeckmann, Melanie/0000-0001-5909-5508",Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS; University of Bremen,Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS; University of Bremen,"MB was supported by a Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS and University of Bremen joint dissertation scholarship.

The objectives of this study were to determine the combined effects of nutrient fertilization management and climatic variability on yield of pearl millet in the Republic of Niger. Considered fertilization treatments refer to (i) no fertilization and the use of (ii) crop residues, (iii) mineral fertilizer and (iv) a combination of both. A crop simulation model (DSSAT 4.5) was evaluated by using data from field experiments reported in the literature and applied to estimate pearl millet yields for two historical periods and under projected climate change. Combination of crop residues and mineral fertilizer resulted in higher pearl millet yields compared to sole application of crop residues or fertilizer. Pearl millet yields showed a strong response to mean temperature under all fertilization practices except the combined treatment in which yields showed higher correlation to precipitation. The crop model reproduced reported yields well including the detected sensitivity of crop yields to mean temperature, but underestimated the response of yields to precipitation for the treatments in which crop residues were applied. The crop model simulated yield declines due to projected climate change by -11 to -62% depending on the scenario and time period. Future crop yields in the combined crop residues + fertilizer treatment were still larger than crop yields in the control treatment with baseline climate, underlining the importance of crop management for climate change adaptation. We conclude that nutrient fertilization and other crop yield limiting factors need to be considered when analyzing and assessing the impact of climate variability and change on crop yields.

A combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses shows: high levels of livelihood flexibility and perceived agency to address climate risks; social networks as most vital community asset; significant utility of traditional knowledge combined with scientific information; and, the need for governments and leadership to develop effective sustainable fisheries governance that prevents further fisheries resource degradation and helps develop alternative sustainable livelihoods for fishers.","[Wongbusarakum, Supin] Management & Livelihoods Sect, Pacific Community, Coastal Fisheries Sci, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Wongbusarakum, Supin] Div Fisheries Aquaculture & Marine Ecosyst, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Wongbusarakum, Supin] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, 1910 East West Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Wongbusarakum, Supin] Univ Hawaii Sea Grant Coll Program, 2525 Correa Rd,HIG 238, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Gorstein, Matt] South Carolina Sea Grant Consortium, 287 Meeting St, Charleston, SC 29401 USA; [Pomeroy, Robert] Univ Connecticut Sea Grant, 380 Marine Sci Bldg, Groton, CT 06355 USA; [Anderson, Cheryl L.] LeA Int Consultants Ltd, 32 Tirangi Rd, Wellington 6022, New Zealand; [Mawyer, Alexander] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Ctr Pacific Isl Studies, 1890 East West Rd,Moore 210, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Pomeroy, R (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut Sea Grant, 380 Marine Sci Bldg, Groton, CT 06355 USA.",supin@hawaii.edu; matthew.gorstein@scseagrant.org; robert.pomeroy@uconn.edu; andersonlefale@gmail.com; mawyer@hawaii.edu,,,Saltonstall-Kennedy grant program of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries grant [NA16NMF4270265],Saltonstall-Kennedy grant program of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries grant,"The authors acknowledge the project funding from the SaltonstallKennedy grant program of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries grant #NA16NMF4270265.

Among the meteorological variables with the greatest effect are temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind direction and speed. This research focused on analyzing and forecasting the wind patterns occurring in Enoshima Bay (Japan). In particular, the objective of this study was to provide support and guidance to sailors in the preparation of the race strategy, thanks to an in-depth knowledge of these meteorological variables. To do this, an innovative method was used. First, through the combined use of Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and CALMET models, a simulation was performed, in order to reconstruct an offshore database of a recent 10-year period (2009-2018) over the race area, inside the bay. Subsequently, the verification of hind-cast was performed: the wind data measured at sea were compared with the data extracted from the CALMET database to verify the validity of the model. The verification was performed through three statistical indexes: BIAS, MAE, and PCC. The analysis showed mixed results, depending on the examined pattern, but made it possible to identify the days that best simulated the reality. Then, the wind data from the selected days were summarized and collected in plots, tables, and maps to design a decision support service (DSS), in order to provide athletes with the necessary information in a simple and effective way. In conclusion, we state that the application of this method extends beyond the sports field. Indeed, the study of wind patterns may be necessary in the design of actions to contrast and adapt to climate change, particularly in coastal areas.","[Masino, Pietro; Besana, Angelo; Pezzoli, Alessandro] Politecn Torino, Interuniv Dept Reg & Urban Studies & Planning DIS, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Masino, Pietro; Besana, Angelo; Pezzoli, Alessandro] Univ Turin, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Bellasio, Roberto; Bianconi, Roberto] Enviroware Srl, Via Dante 142, I-20863 Concorezzo, MB, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin; University of Turin,"Masino, P (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Interuniv Dept Reg & Urban Studies & Planning DIS, I-10125 Turin, Italy.;Masino, P (corresponding author), Univ Turin, I-10125 Turin, Italy.",pietro.masino@edu.unito.it; rbellasio@enviroware.com; rbianconi@enviroware.com; angelo.besana@unito.it; alessandro.pezzoli@polito.it,"Bellasio, Roberto/O-5707-2018","Bellasio, Roberto/0000-0002-0638-0089",Swedish Sailing Federation,Swedish Sailing Federation,The authors acknowledge the Swedish Sailing Federation for the support to the presented research.,,43,0,0,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,MAY,2021,9,5,,,,,,,80,10.3390/cli9050080,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli9050080,,,29,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,SG9HH,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000653750500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to prepare the country more adequately to altered climate conditions, as well as the successful implementation of adaptive measures, it is necessary to determine the vulnerability, as well as the assessment of the risks to certain sectors to climate change. Estimates show that since 2000 the Republic of Serbia has faced several significant extreme climate and weather events that have caused the loss of human life, considerable material consequences and degradation of the natural environment. The consequences have been various depending on the part of the country and the paper uses as an example the Raska Administrative District which covers an area of 3.918 km(2) and has 309.258 residents. The aim of the paper is to assess the vulnerability and assessment of the risks of natural resources (agricultural and forest land) of the Raska Administrative District to climate change based on methodology 'FUTURE CITIES Adaptation Compass' [1], developed as part of the EU Project FUTURE CITIES. Using the results of 9 different models for the RCP 8.5 scenario, the paper concluded that agriculture and forests would be at a very high risk of heat waves, droughts and extreme precipitation, as well as under the medium-level risk of extreme cold. The research has a applicative character as it represents the starting point in the process of adapting to climate change. Also, the result of the paper has significant impact on planning spatial development because the defining of planned solutions must be in correlation with possibilities for adapting the sector to different climate conditions, and thus the realistic concept of spatial development.","[Duskov, Ljubica; Filipovic, Dejan] Univ Belgrade, Fac Geog, Dept Spatial Planning, Belgrade, Serbia; [Djurdjevic, Vladimir] Univ Belgrade, Fac Phys, Inst Meteorol, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade; University of Belgrade,"Duskov, L (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Fac Geog, Dept Spatial Planning, Belgrade, Serbia.",ljubica.p88@gmail.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,2,4,PARLAR SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS (P S P),FREISING,"ANGERSTR. 12, 85354 FREISING, GERMANY",1018-4619,1610-2304,,FRESEN ENVIRON BULL,Fresenius Environ.

In Central America maize and beans are usually cultivated by farmers who have small landholdings and live in vulnerable situations. Climate change is an important threat to these smallholder basic grain farmers, putting at risk their production systems and their livelihoods. The use of Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) can help them to adapt to climate change, however there is limited information on the use of EbA. The objective of the present work was to characterize the EbA strategies that smallholder basic grain farmers of four landscapes in Guatemala and Honduras use to increase their resilience to climate change. Using interviews and field measurements in 160 farms, between July 2014 and June 2015, we 1) explored how common the use of different EbA practices is, 2) documented the biophysical characteristics of these practices, and 3) explored if the implementation and characteristics of EbA practices differed among landscapes. Our results indicate that even though they own small land areas (mean maize plot area of similar to 0.68 ha), have low education levels and low access to technical training and advice, many smallholder basic grain farmers are using EbA practices in their farms. The most common EbA practices were the use of dispersed trees, home gardens and live fences. An ANOVA anlysis indicated significant differences in the use of different EbA practices among farmers, which suggests that farmers adapt practices in response to the social and biophysical conditions where they live. Our study suggests that smallholder basic grain farmers have the experience and the knowledge to use EbA practices and recognize the benefits derived from the implementation of such practices. However, in order to increase use of EbA practices, more technical, financial and political support is needed.","[Martinez-Rodriguez, M. R.; Harvey, C.

However, so far most studies have focused on potential impacts of climate change on water bodies and the adaptation to climate change-related risks, whereas the relationship between RBMP's and mitigation of climate change - through the reduction in emissions of greenhouse gasses (GHG) - has only been touched upon. This paper investigates the potential for synergies between reduction of nutrient losses from agriculture and climate change mitigation in a case study of the Isefjord and Roskilde Fjord River Basin in Denmark. For this purpose, a map-based approach is applied to analyze the effects and cost-effectiveness of selected PoMs to reduce both nitrogen loads and GHG emissions from agriculture at the river basin scale. The results indicate a substantial potential for cost-effective integration of climate change mitigation into WFD action programmes with special emphasis on four agri-environmental N-GHG measures applied in combination: (1) manure treatment for biogas production and improved N utilization, (2) cultivation of perennial energy crops, (3) extensification of intensively farmed lowland areas and (4) wetland restoration. The particular PoMs investigated can ensure fulfilment of the WFD GES objectives for Isefjord and Roskilde Fjord in a cost-effective way and at the same time reduce GHG emissions significantly, corresponding to a 35-65% reduction of total agricultural GHG emissions within the river basin. This study suggests that a targeted and differentiated approach to the development of PoMs is necessary in order to attain the full potential of these kinds of win-win solutions in the context of the WFD.

However, the availability of climate data, particularly throughout rural Africa, is very limited. Available weather stations are unevenly distributed and mainly located along main roads in cities and towns. This imposes severe limitations to the availability of climate information and services for the rural community where, arguably, these services are needed most. Weather station data also suffer from gaps in the time series. Satellite proxies, particularly satellite rainfall estimate, have been used as alternatives because of their availability even over remote parts of the world. However, satellite rainfall estimates also suffer from a number of critical shortcomings that include heterogeneous time series, short time period of observation, and poor accuracy particularly at higher temporal and spatial resolutions. An attempt is made here to alleviate these problems by combining station measurements with the complete spatial coverage of satellite rainfall estimates. Rain gauge observations are merged with a locally calibrated version of the TAMSAT satellite rainfall estimates to produce over 30-years (1983-todate) of rainfall estimates over Ethiopia at a spatial resolution of 10km and a ten-daily time scale. This involves quality control of rain gauge data, generating locally calibrated version of the TAMSAT rainfall estimates, and combining these with rain gauge observations from national station network. The infrared-only satellite rainfall estimates produced using a relatively simple TAMSAT algorithm performed as good as or even better than other satellite rainfall products that use passive microwave inputs and more sophisticated algorithms. There is no substantial difference between the gridded-gauge and combined gauge-satellite products over the test area in Ethiopia having a dense station network; however, the combined product exhibits better quality over parts of the country where stations are sparsely distributed.","[Dinku, Tufa] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Earth Inst, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Hailemariam, Kinfe] Natl Meteorol Agcy, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Maidment, Ross; Tarnavsky, Elena] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England; [Connor, Stephen] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England",Columbia University; University of Reading; University of Liverpool,"Dinku, T (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Earth Inst, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",tufa@iri.columbia.edu,"Dinku, Tufa/V-8609-2019; Tarnavsky, Elena/K-4902-2014","Tarnavsky, Elena/0000-0003-3403-0411; Maidment, Ross/0000-0003-2054-3259",Google.org; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA050AR4311004],Google.org; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"We would like to acknowledge the contribution of the late Dr David Grimes from the University of Reading.

Climate models predict that the Pacific Islands and other regions with mixed-subsistence communities will experience increased climate variability, including more frequent cyclones and prolonged droughts. Authors suggest that development agencies should help to increase levels of household market participation, or the proportion of household output that is marketable, in rural communities because those households with more financial assets are better equipped to respond to climatic disturbances [Pettengell, C., & Oxfram, P. G. (2010). Climate change adaptation: Enabling people living in poverty to adapt. Oxfram International Research Report.]. Other authors suggest that, because all socio-ecological systems are inherently vulnerable, increasing financial assets may not reduce the vulnerabilities of rural communities to natural hazards [Lauer, M., Albert, S., Aswani, S., Halpern, B. S., Campanella, L., & Rose, D. L. (2013). Globalization, Pacific Islands, and the paradox of resilience. Global Environmental Change, 23, 40-0]. Likewise, authors claim that food-sharing and other forms of social capital are more important to the resilience of mixed-subsistence communities to climate change than are financial assets [Smit, B., & Wandel, J. (2006). Adaptation, adaptive capacity and vulnerability. Global Environmental Change, 16, 282-292]. This article demonstrates that higher levels of household market participation are not associated with smaller social networks in Samoa, which shows that households in mixed- subsistence communities that are more engaged in the market do not necessarily have less social capital than others. The article also demonstrates that social institutions shape the relationships among variables of community-perceived adaptive capacity. Future policy changes and other adaptations that satisfy an increased demand for cash may ultimately reduce local-level resilience.","[Vickers, J.

In the early days, after the formation of Pakistan, its survival and future was under a great deal of skepticism. Therefore, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) took initiatives for agricultural growth and development in the mid-1960's, which later on became a revolution, commonly known as the Green Revolution. The present study aims to explore the environmental consequences of the Green Revolution by testing a hypothesis. Our H0 states that there is no trade-off between agricultural growth (proxy variable for economic growth) and carbon dioxide emissions in case of Pakistan, based on the annual data on variables (such as GHG emissions and Index of agriculture, GDP, etc.) from 1960 to 1990. Johansen's method of cointegration has been employed in this study to test H0. This method has an advantage over Phillips-Ouliaris' and Engle-Granger's methods of cointegration, in that it has the ability to estimate more than one cointegrating relationship between variables. Results of the present study do not support the existence of EKC hypothesis in relation to the Green Revolution, neither in the short run nor in the long run. None of the factors that led to the Green Revolution significantly contributed to the CO2 emissions; however, the Green Revolution resulted in an increase in the GDP of Pakistan. This shows that the agricultural sector of Pakistan can provide better earning opportunities besides having the potential for climate change mitigation. The present scenario in Pakistan necessitates the need for the government to focus on climate change mitigation and adaptation policies through the agricultural sector. Moreover, effective implementation of such policies using economic instruments, such as charges and subsidies, especially against the polluting industries, should be encouraged.","[Ali, Ghaffar; Cui, Shenghui] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Urban Environm & Hlth, Inst Urban Environm, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China; [Ali, Ghaffar; Ashraf, Aqdas; Bashir, Muhammad Khalid] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Social Sci, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Urban Environment, CAS; University of Agriculture Faisalabad","Ashraf, A (corresponding author), Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Social Sci, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan.",aqdas.ashraf2014@gmail.com,"Bashir, Muhammad Khalid Khalid/H-9729-2014; Ali, Ghaffar/H-8088-2019; CAS, KLUEH/T-5743-2019","Bashir, Muhammad Khalid Khalid/0000-0001-5572-2666; Ali, Ghaffar/0000-0002-6055-2371; ",National Key R & D Program of China [2017YFC0506606]; PIFI project of CAS [2017PC0074],National Key R & D Program of China; PIFI project of CAS,This paper is extracted from an M.Phil. thesis of Aqdas Ashraf supported by the National Key R & D Program of China (No. 2017YFC0506606) and the PIFI project of CAS (No. 2017PC0074).,,41,51,53,2,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

However, none of these water management plans, which have large socio-economic impacts, have been assessed under future changes in climate and water availability. By adapting a method of environmental flow requirements (EFRs) for hypersaline lakes, we estimated annually 3.7.10(9) m(3) water is needed to preserve Urmia Lake. Then, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model was forced with bias-corrected climate model outputs for both the lowest (RCP2.6) and highest (RCP8.5) greenhouse-gas concentration scenarios to estimate future water availability and impacts of water management strategies. Results showed a 10% decline in future water availability in the basin under RCP2.6 and 27% under RCP8.5. Our results showed that if future climate change is highly limited (RCP2.6) inflow can be just enough to meet the EFRs by implementing the reduction irrigation plan. However, under more rapid climate change scenario (RCP8.5) reducing irrigation water use will not be enough to save the lake and more drastic measures are needed. Our results showed that future water management plans are not robust under climate change in this region. Therefore, an integrated approach of future land-water use planning and climate change adaptation is therefore needed to improve future water security and to reduce the desiccating of this hypersaline lake.

In this study, we demonstrate an approach to assess future risks and quantify the benefits of adaptation options at a city-scale, with application to flood risk in Mumbai. In 2005, Mumbai experienced unprecedented flooding, causing direct economic damages estimated at almost two billion USD and 500 fatalities. Our findings suggest that by the 2080s, in a SRES A2 scenario, an 'upper bound' climate scenario could see the likelihood of a 2005-like event more than double. We estimate that total losses (direct plus indirect) associated with a 1-in-100 year event could triple compared with current situation (to $690-$1,890 million USD), due to climate change alone. Continued rapid urbanisation could further increase the risk level. The analysis also demonstrates that adaptation could significantly reduce future losses; for example, estimates suggest that by improving the drainage system in Mumbai, losses associated with a 1-in-100 year flood event today could be reduced by as much as 70%.,We show that assessing the indirect costs of extreme events is an important component of an adaptation assessment, both in ensuring the analysis captures the full economic benefits of adaptation and also identifying options that can help to manage indirect risks of disasters. For example, we show that by extending insurance to 100% penetration, the indirect effects of flooding could be almost halved. We conclude that, while this study explores only the upper-bound climate scenario, the risk-assessment core demonstrated in this study could form an important quantitative tool in developing city-scale adaptation strategies. We provide a discussion of sources of uncertainty and risk-based tools could be linked with decision-making approaches to inform adaptation plans that are robust to climate change.","[Ranger, Nicola] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Ranger, Nicola] Risk Management Solut Ltd, London, England; [Hallegatte, Stephane; Naville, Nicolas; Henriet, Fanny] Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev, Paris, France; [Hallegatte, Stephane] Ecole Natl Meteorol, Toulouse, France; [Bhattacharya, Sumana] MoEF, NATCOM PMC, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; [Bachu, Murthy; Priya, Satya; Dhore, K.; Rafique, Farhat; Mathur, P.] RMS India, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Herweijer, Celine] PriceWaterhouseCoopers, London, England; [Pohit, Sanjib] Natl Council Appl Econ Res, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Corfee-Morlot, Jan] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Paris, France",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; AgroParisTech; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Ranger, N (corresponding author), Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",n.ranger@lse.ac.uk,"Pohit, Sanjib/E-6185-2015","Pohit, Sanjib/0000-0002-7376-7574; Corfee-Morlot, Jan/0000-0003-2590-6995",ESRC [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,39,163,164,1,82,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

We use fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to determine how seven potentially relevant conditions influence learning outcomes. From the systematic comparison of 30 cases (i.e. organizations who participated in seven selected projects) we conclude that, on the short-term, there is no relation between high levels of project-internal learning and wider learning outcomes. For wider learning outcomes to occur, a project needs to be aligned with formal policy processes. When policy agenda alignment is present, motivation, external actor involvement and project knowledge and communication are sufficient for the use of project knowledge by external actors.","[Vinke-de Kruijf, Joanne] Univ Twente, Dept Civil Engn, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Pahl-Wostl, Claudia; Knieper, Christian] Osnabruck Univ, Inst Environm Syst Res, Barbarastr 12, D-49076 Osnabruck, Germany",University of Twente; University Osnabruck,"Vinke-de Kruijf, J (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Dept Civil Engn, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",joanne.vinke@utwente.nl,,,European Community [PIEF-GA-2012-326268],European Community(European Commission),"We thank Wassim Sako, the MSc student who collected data for two projects, and the respondents for their valuable contributions to the presented research.

This paper used remote sensing images from 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 to investigate the changes in wetland in the Dongting Lake Basin (DLB) and their possible causes. The land-use conversion matrix and contribution rate were calculated in 1990-2000, 2000-2010, and 2010-2020, and results showed that the total wetland area displayed an increasing trend, especially the reservoir ponds and channels across DLB from 1990 to 2020. Forest and agricultural land conversion into wetland accounted for the main proportion, with the greatest contribution rate (234.13%) of forest land and the smallest rate (-117.46%) of agricultural land between 1990 and 2000. On the contrary, agricultural land had the highest contribution rate (47.96%) for wetlands compared to other land-cover types from 2000 to 2010, followed by forest land (39.03%). The contribution rates of forest and agricultural lands to wetlands were 60.17% and 39.02% from 2010 to 2020, respectively. Wetlands showed a more significant net gain (a total of 259 km(2)) in Central and Southern Hunan Province. More specifically, the wetlands area in North Hunan Province decreased by 45 km(2) from 1990 to 2000. It increased over the next two decades (155 km(2) and 22 km(2), respectively). Southern Hunan Province continued increasing from 1990 to 2010 (a total of 149 km(2)) while decreasing from 2010 to 2020 (a total of -297 km(2)). Forestation was the principal driving force promoting the continuous increase in wetlands. In addition, agricultural land was mainly related to wetland change in this region, characterized by reclaiming land from lakes in the earlier period and returning agricultural land to wetland in the later period. Built-up land occupied a small area of wetlands over the study period. The study is beneficial to understanding the wetlands' dynamic changes in the past and present, as well as being useful for wetland management, consistent with sustainable development.","[Yang, Zhi-Min; Han, Long-Fei; Xu, Ke] Hunan Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Changsha 410081, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zhi-Min; Li, Chun-Hui] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qing-Ping] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Water Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Pan, Zhao-Yi] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Shenzhen 518172, Peoples R China","Hunan Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen","Han, LF (corresponding author), Hunan Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Changsha 410081, Peoples R China.",yangzm@mail.bnu.edu.cn; hanlf@hunnu.edu.cn; 202121470018@mail.bnu.edu.cn; chunhuili@bnu.edu.cn; zhaoyipan@link.cuhk.edu.cn; 201830163036@hunnu.edu.cn,,"Han, Longfei/0000-0001-7802-2988; Chunhui, Li/0000-0003-0067-4112","Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2020JJ5361]; Project of Education Department of Hunan Province [19A311]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [52070023, 41807163]; College students' innovation and entrepreneurship projects [2020109]",Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); Project of Education Department of Hunan Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); College students' innovation and entrepreneurship projects,"This research was financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (2020JJ5361), Project of Education Department of Hunan Province (19A311), National Natural Science Foundation of China (52070023; 41807163), and the College students' innovation and entrepreneurship projects (2020109).",,44,3,3,15,30,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR,2022,14,6,,,,,,,3620,10.3390/su14063620,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14063620,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0B5QX,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000774690200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In wine-growing systems, commercial pressure and varietal regulations have narrowed agrobiodiversity in vineyards despite higher diversity being an important buffer against the effects of climate change. If drivers of grape diversity change are well-understood at national to global scales, little is known about the local, past or anticipated trajectories that drive agrobiodiversity dynamics depending on growers' cultural values, practices and choices. We combined quantitative agricultural census data and qualitative ethnographic approaches to characterise changes in the diversity of grape varieties from 1960 to 2020 at the communal and vineyard levels in a French wine-growing region, and to decipher the drivers of change. We highlight that vineyards have drastically changed in 60 years, with a decline in planted area and in farm number. We outline that despite a loss of varietal richness across both vineyard and communal scales, varietal richness remains high and evenness have increased across geographic scales in 2020. Ethnographic field observations emphasize that growers account for external drivers (e.g., market changes, regulation and policy, technology, environmental), but also cultural values when they choose which grape varieties to plant. Grape diversity was maintained despite market integration as an insurance to spread production risk, mitigate market volatility and address environmental uncertainties. Securing livelihoods in the midst of market changes has been a major concern for growers over the last six decades and remains so. Despite a pessimistic future vision of the vineyard shared by most growers, the Gaillac region has a cultural heritage that values diversity and that thereby supports adaptation to climate change. We expect that environmental factors may play a more important role in grape selection and planting sites in the future under the influence of climate change and pesticide reduction policies. In order to expand individual initiatives resulting in diversified grape selection, growers need to be better connected with stakeholders at a variety of institutional levels.","[Doncieux, Antoine; Prudham, Scott; Caillon, Sophie; Renard, Delphine] Univ Montpellier, EPHE, CEFE, CNRS,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Yobregat, Olivier] Inst Francais Vigne & Vin, BP 22, F-81310 Lisle Sur Tarn, France; [Prudham, Scott] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Prudham, Scott] Univ Toronto, Sch Environm, Toronto, ON, Canada",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; University of Toronto; University of Toronto,"Doncieux, A (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, EPHE, CEFE, CNRS,IRD, Montpellier, France.",antoine.doncieux@cefe.cnrs.fr,,"YOBREGAT, OLIVIER/0000-0002-7516-8727; Renard, Delphine/0000-0002-3228-4269",French National Research Agency (ANR) [17-MPGA-0004],French National Research Agency (ANR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"The research for this article was supported by the French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the Programme d'Investissements d'Avenir (reference 17-MPGA-0004).

The investigation of C:N:P ratios in major cropping soils is important for managing nutrient balance and maximizing their use efficiency in future farming systems. This study aimed to examine the effect of eCO(2) on the C: N:P ratios in different plant parts among soybean cultivars. Twenty-four soybean cultivars were planted in open top chambers at two CO2 concentrations (390 and 550 ppm) and sampled at the initial pod filling stage (R5) and the full maturity stage (R8). The C, N and P concentrations in root, stem, leaf and seed were determined. Elevated CO2 decreased the N concentrations in stem (-5.1%) and leaf (-3.2%) at R5, and in root (-24%), stem (-25%) and seed (-6.2%) at R8, resulting in a significant decrease of C:N ratio in the corresponding parts. The P concentration was significantly increased in root (6.0%), stem (7.9%) and leaf (16%) at R5, and in root (2.6%), stem (29%) and seed (16%) at R8 across 24 cultivars, leading to a decrease in the C:P ratio. Elevated CO2 significantly decreased the N:P ratio in root (-4.5%), stem (-12%) and leaf (-17%) at R5, and in root (-26%), stem (-57%) and seed (-22%) at R8. Furthermore, the response of C:N:P ratios to eCO(2) varied greatly among soybean cultivars leading to significant CO2 x cultivar interactions. Nitrogen, but not P was the limiting factor for the soybean plants grown in Mollisols under eCO(2). The considerable variation in the C:N:P ratios among cultivars in response to eCO(2) indicates a potential improvement in soybean adaptability to climate change via selection new cultivars. Cultivars SN22 and ZH4 that did not considerably altered the C:N and C:P ratios in response to eCO(2) are likely the optimal genomes in soybean breeding programs for eCO(2) adaption.

In this study, climate change impacts on irrigated corn and sorghum, dryland (rainfed) sorghum, and continuous fallow in the Northern High Plains of Texas were evaluated using an improved Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model equipped with management allowed depletion (MAD) irrigation scheduling. Projected climate data (2020-2099) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 5) of 19 General Circulation Models (GCMs) were used. Climate data were divided into four 20-year periods of near future (2020-2039), middle (2040-2059), late (2060-2079), and end (2080-2099) of the 21st century under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). For irrigated corn, median annual crop evapotranspiration (ET) and irrigation decreased by 8%-25% and 15%-42%, respectively, under the climate change scenarios compared to the historical period (2001-2010). The median yield was reduced by 3%-22% with exponentially decreases in the latter half of the 21st century. For sorghum, the reduction of median annual crop ET ranged from 6%-27%. However, the decline in the median annual irrigation was within 15%, except for the 2060-2079 and 2080-2099 periods under RCP 8.5 scenarios with 30% and 49% reductions in median annual irrigation. The median irrigated sorghum yield declined by 6%-42%. The median annual crop ET of dryland sorghum decreased by 10%-16%. The reduction in median yield was within 10% of the historical dryland sorghum yield. The decrease in median annual evaporation varied from 15%-23% under future continuous fallow conditions. The elevated CO2 level of future climate scenarios was the primary factor for the decrease in the ET and irrigation. The reduction in future crop yield was mainly attributed to the shortening of the maturity period caused by increased future temperature.","[Chen, Yong; Srinivasan, Raghavan] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, 2138 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Marek, Gary W.; Moorhead, Jerry E.; Brauer, David K.] USDA ARS, Conservat & Prod Res Lab, 300 Simmons Rd,Unit 10, Bushland, TX 79012 USA; [Marek, Thomas H.; Heflin, Kevin R.] Texas A&M AgriLife Res & Extens Ctr, Texas A&M AgriLife Res, 6500 Amarillo Blvd W, Amarillo, TX 79106 USA; [Gowda, Prasanna H.] USDA ARS, Grazinglands Res Lab, 7207 West Cheyenne St, El Reno, OK 73036 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M AgriLife Research; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Chen, Y (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, 2138 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",yongchen@neo.tamu.edu,"Srinivasan, R/D-3937-2009; Gowda, Prasanna/L-4916-2015","Srinivasan, R/0000-0001-8375-6038; Gowda, Prasanna/0000-0001-8782-6953","USDA-Agricultural Research Service; Kansas State University; Texas A&M AgriLife Research; Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service; Texas Tech University; West Texas AM University; Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy","USDA-Agricultural Research Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service); Kansas State University; Texas A&M AgriLife Research; Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service; Texas Tech University; West Texas AM University; Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This research was supported in part by the Ogallala Aquifer Program, a consortium between USDA-Agricultural Research Service, Kansas State University, Texas A&M AgriLife Research, Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service, Texas Tech University, and West Texas A&M University.

Furthermore, it is accentuated with puddling of soil, which disrupts soil aggregates. Conservation agriculture (CA) practices involving zero tillage, crop residue management and suitable crop rotation can serve as better alternative to conventional agriculture for maintaining soil quality. Soil organic carbon is an important determinant of soil quality, playing critical role in food production, mitigation and adaptation to climate change as well as performs many ecosystem functions. To understand the turnover of soil carbon in different forms (Total organic carbon-TOC; aggregate associated carbon-AAC; particulate organic carbon-POC), soil aggregation and crop productivity with different management practices, one conventional agriculture based scenario and three CA based crop management scenarios namely conventional rice-wheat system (Sc1), partial CA based rice-wheat-mungbean system (Sc2), full CA-based rice-wheat-mungbean system (Sc3) and maize-wheat-mungbean system (Sc4) were evaluated. TOC was increased by 71%, 68% and 25% after 4 years of the experiment and 75%, 80% and 38% after 6 years of the experiment in Sc4, Sc3 and Sc2, respectively, over Sc1 at 0-15 cm soil depth. After 4 years of the experiment, 38.5% and 5.0% and after 6 years 50.8% and 24.4% improvement in total water stable aggregates at 0-15 and 15-30 cm soil depth, respectively was observed in CA-based scenarios over Sc1. Higher aggregate indices were associated with Sc3 at 0-15 cm soil depth than others. Among the size classes of aggregates, highest aggregate associated C (8.94 g kg(-1)) was retained in the 1-0.5 mm size class under CA-based scenarios. After 6 years, higher POC was associated with Sc4 (116%). CA-based rice/maize system (Sc3 and Sc4) showed higher productivity than Sc1. Therefore, CA could be a potential management practice in rice-wheat cropping system of Northwest India to improve the soil carbon pools through maintaining soil aggregation and productivity.","[Jat, H.

The wavelet transform self-organizing map (WTSOM) framework combines the wavelet transform (WT) and a self-organizing map (SOM) neural network. WT is used to extract dynamic and multiscale features of the non-stationary precipitation time-series, and SOM is applied to objectively identify spatially homogeneous clusters on the high-dimensional wavelet-transformed feature space. Haar and Morlet wavelets are applied in the data preprocessing stage to preserve the desired characteristics of the precipitation data. A two-level SOM neural network is applied to identify clusters in the wavelet space in the clustering stage. The performance of clustering is evaluated using silhouette coefficients. The results indicate that singularities or sharp transitions are more significant than changes in the periodicity or data structure in the spatial-temporal precipitation data. The WTSOM results show that six clusters are optimal for both Haar and Morlet wavelet functions, but their corresponding geographic locations are different. The geographic locations of clusters based on the Haar wavelet, which captures the occurrence of extreme hydrological events, appear in blocks while those classified by the Morlet wavelet, which indicates periodicity changes and describes fine structures, appear in strips that cross the island of Taiwan. Principal component analysis is applied to the precipitation data of each cluster. The first principal components explain 62-90% of the total variation of data. Characteristics of precipitation data for each cluster are explored using scalogram analysis. The results show that both extreme hydrological events and periodicity changes appear in the spatial and temporal precipitation data but with different characteristics for each cluster. Recognizing homogeneous hydrologic regions and identifying the associated precipitation characteristics improves the efficiency of water resources management in adapting to climate change, preventing the degradation of the water environment, and reducing the impact of climate-induced disasters. Measures for countering the stress of precipitation variation for water resources management are provided. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, the impact of climate change on the magnitude and frequency of high flows is analysed for Great Britain (GB) to provide the first spatially consistent GB projections to include both climate ensembles and hydrological model parameter uncertainties. We use the latest high-resolution (12 km) regional climate model ensemble from the UK Climate Projections (UKCP18). These projections are based on a perturbed-physics ensemble of 12 regional climate model simulations and allow exploration of climate model uncertainty beyond the variability caused by the use of different models. We model 346 larger (>144 km(2)) catchments across GB using the DECIPHeR hydrological modelling framework. Generally, results indicated an increase in the magnitude and frequency of high flows (Q10, Q1, and annual maximum) along the western coast of GB in the future (2050-2075), with increases in annual maximum flows of up to 65 % for western Scotland. In contrast, median flows (Q50) were projected to decrease across GB. Even when using an ensemble based on a single regional climate model (RCM) structure, all flow projections contained large uncertainties. While the RCM parameters were the largest source of uncertainty overall, hydrological modelling uncertainties were considerable in eastern and south-eastern England. Regional variations in flow projections were found to relate to (i) differences in climatic change and (ii) catchment conditions during the baseline period as characterised by the runoff coefficient (mean discharge divided by mean precipitation). Importantly, increased heavy-precipitation events (defined by an increase in 99th percentile precipitation) did not always result in increased flood flows for catchments with low runoff coefficients, highlighting the varying factors leading to changes in high flows. These results provide a national overview of climate change impacts on high flows across GB, which will inform climate change adaptation, and highlight the impact of hydrological model parameter uncertainties when modelling climate change impact on high flows.","[Lane, Rosanna A.; Coxon, Gemma; Freer, Jim] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England; [Coxon, Gemma; Freer, Jim; Wagener, Thorsten] Univ Bristol, Cabot Inst, Bristol BS8 1UJ, Avon, England; [Freer, Jim] Univ Saskatchewan, Ctr Hydrol, Canmore, AB T1W 3G1, Canada; [Seibert, Jan] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland; [Wagener, Thorsten] Univ Bristol, Dept Civil Engn, Bristol BS8 1TR, Avon, England; [Wagener, Thorsten] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Lane, Rosanna A.] UK Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England",University of Bristol; University of Bristol; University of Saskatchewan; University of Zurich; University of Bristol; University of Potsdam; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH),"Lane, RA (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England.;Lane, RA (corresponding author), UK Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England.",roslan@ceh.ac.uk,"Lane, Rosanna/ABH-5708-2020","Lane, Rosanna/0000-0003-4176-9214; Coxon, Gemma/0000-0002-8837-460X",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council as part of the Water Informatics Science and Engineering Centre for Doctoral Training [EP/L016214/1],Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council as part of the Water Informatics Science and Engineering Centre for Doctoral Training(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This work has been supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (grant no.

It is worth mentioning that the present study is the first of its kind to use such a large number of CMIP5 models to project future changes in T-min, T-max, and T-mean over SA using three different warming thresholds. The results show that CSIRO-MK3-6-0, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, CNRM-CM5, CCSM4, and MRI-CGCM3 models relatively performed better with a consistent and accurate spatiotemporal simulation of T-min,T- T-max, and T-mean over SA. In terms of projected changes, T-min, T-max, and T-mean show a dominating and consistent warming pattern over SA with stronger intensity in higher latitude than mid-low latitudes under 1.5 degrees C, 2 degrees C, and 3 degrees C warming thresholds. The northwestern (eastern) regions of SA will witness greater (least) warming in T-min, T-max, and T-mean under all warming thresholds in RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Furthermore, the central and southern parts of SA will experience a moderate increase in T-min, T-max, and T-mean under all warming targets. The uneven and intensified patterns of T-min, T-max,T- and T-mean may result in temperature extremes, which would pose potential risks to the local population. Therefore, more attention should be paid on the regional and local perspectives to estimate the adverse impacts of these extremes under different global warming targets. We further suggest to project future changes in climate extremes over SA under different warming levels, which will be helpful in climate change adaptation and mitigation over the study region.","[Ullah, Safi; You, Qinglong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol NUIST, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ KLME,Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [You, Qinglong; Zhang, Yuqing] Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China; [Bhatti, Asher Samuel; Ullah, Waheed; Hagan, Daniel Fiifi Tawia] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol NUIST, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Ali, Amjad; Jan, Mushtaq Ahmad; Khan, Shah Nawaz] Univ Peshawar, Ctr Disaster Preparedness & Management, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan; [Ali, Gohar] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol NUIST, Sch Atmospher Phys, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Ali, Gohar] Pakistan Meteorol Dept, Sect H-8-2, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Ali, Asif] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Dept Disaster Management, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Fudan University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of Peshawar; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan,"You, QL (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol NUIST, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ KLME,Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",yqingl@126.com,"Ullah, Safi/X-6228-2019; Ullah, Waheed/I-7102-2018","Ullah, Safi/0000-0002-2328-8321; Ali, Asif/0000-0002-3299-2230; Bhatti, Asher Samuel/0000-0003-4666-5860; Ullah, Waheed/0000-0002-0626-0650",National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0603804]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771069],National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFA0603804) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (41771069).

Comprehensive records of land cover land use dynamics in urban regions are essential for strategic climate change adaption and mitigation and sustainable urban development. This study aims to develop a Google Earth Engine (GEE) application for high-resolution (15-m) urban LCLUC mapping with a novel classification scheme using pan-sharpened Landsat images. With this approach, we quantified the annual LCLUC in Changchun, China, from 2000 to 2019, and detected the abrupt changes (turning points of LCLUC). Ancillary data on social-economic status were used to provide insights on potential drivers of LCLUC by examining their correlation with change rate. We also examined the impacts of LCLUC on environment, specifically air pollution. Using this approach, we can classify annual LCLUC in Changchun with high accuracy (all above 0.91). The change detection based on the high-resolution wall-to-wall maps show intensive urban expansion with the compromise of cropland from 2000 to 2019. We also found the growth of green space in urban regions as the result of green space development and management in recent years. The changing rate of different land types were the largest in the early years of the observation period. Turning points of land types were primarily observed in 2009 and 2010. Further analysis showed that economic and industry development and population migration collectively drove the urban expansion in Changchun. Increasing built-up areas could slow wind velocity and air exchange, and ultimately led to the accumulation of PM2.5. Our implement of pan-sharpened Landsat images facilitates the wall-to-wall mapping of temporal land dynamics at high spatial resolution. The primary use of GEE for mapping urban land makes it replicable and transferable by other users. This approach is a first crucial step towards understanding the drivers of change and supporting better decision-making for sustainable urban development and climate change mitigation.","[Dong, Yulin; Ren, Zhibin; Fu, Yao; He, Xingyuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Environm, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China; [Dong, Yulin; Fu, Yao; He, Xingyuan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Miao, Zhenghong] Water & Hydraul Survey & Planning Inst, Changchun 130021, Peoples R China; [Yang, Ran] Jilin Univ, Coll Earth Sci, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yuanhe] Jilin Guoyao Geog Informat Technol Co Ltd, Changchun 130061, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography & Agroecology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Jilin University","He, XY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Environm, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China.;He, XY (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",dongyulin@iga.ac.cn; renzhibin@iga.ac.cn; fuyao@iga.ac.cn; miaozhengh@163.com; ranyang19@mails.jlu.edu.cn; sunyuanhe@ev-image.com; hexingyuan@iga.ac.cn,,"Yu-lin, DONG/0000-0002-1781-7848",Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences [2020237]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41701210]; Science Development Project of Jilin province [20190303067SF]; Project of Jilin Province Water Resources Department [12600220190012],Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science Development Project of Jilin province; Project of Jilin Province Water Resources Department,"This work was funded in part by the Youth Science Fund Project approved by the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences under Grant 2020237, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 41701210, in part by the Science Development Project of Jilin province under Grant 20190303067SF, and in part by the Project of Jilin Province Water Resources Department under Grant 12600220190012.",,48,20,20,6,42,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,AUG,2020,12,15,,,,,,,2451,10.3390/rs12152451,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12152451,,,19,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,MZ4BM,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000559066700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we investigated how stakeholders from important Blue Economy sectors along the German North Sea coast perceive the impacts of climate change on their daily work life and the growth of the Blue Economy. In a two-stage approach we first conducted two stakeholder workshops with representatives from the regional sea food sector, science, NGOs and local authorities, in order to identify important issues linked to climate change affecting environment, society, economy and policy. In the second stage, we conducted semi-structured interviews with key knowledge holders from the Blue Economy, to evaluate and validate the most important issues identified during the first stage, and the impacts on the respective sectors. The workshop participants identified perceptible effects of climate change on their marine environment. Early career scientists showed that they possess a clear focus on measures for climate change adaptation, transdisciplinary approaches and knowledge transfer. The interviews revealed that the climate change effects could be perceived as both negative and positive, depending on the sector. Other issues, especially political decisions and developments are perceived to have a greater immediate impact on the Blue Economy than the slow progress of climate change effects. Additionally, increased human activities, in the form of new or intensified uses like marine renewable energy generation, have a greater influence and lead to conflicts between the Blue Economy sectors. Our study showed that economic and societal stakeholders in Germanys North Sea region are aware of climate change and already perceive its effects on their businesses. Synergies and conflicts between the sectors and political decisions might influence sustainable growth of the Blue Economy in highly contested regions, such as the North Sea basin, much stronger than the effects of climate change. This calls for a more flexible and adaptive approach to policymaking, taking into account the changing environmental, social and economic realities.","[Hoerterer, Christina; Schupp, Maximilian F.; Benkens, Andreas; Nickiewicz, Dustin; Krause, Gesche; Buck, Bela H.] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Schupp, Maximilian F.] Univ Dundee, Sch Social Sci, Dundee, Scotland; [Buck, Bela H.] Univ Appl Sci Bremerhaven, Appl Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Fac 1, Bremerhaven, Germany","Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; University of Dundee","Hoerterer, C (corresponding author), Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany.",Christina.Hoerterer@awi.de,"Benkens, Andreas/HKO-9661-2023; Krause, Gesche/L-7394-2017; Hoerterer, Christina/GXF-7124-2022; Buck, Bela H./B-8772-2012","Benkens, Andreas/0000-0001-7943-7843; Krause, Gesche/0000-0001-7917-7121; Hoerterer, Christina/0000-0001-5627-456X; Buck, Bela H./0000-0001-7491-3273; Schupp, Maximilian Felix/0000-0001-7546-1694","umbrella of the Earth System Knowledge Platform (ESKP) Call for Tender at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research [PAGESKP077, IP80770003]","umbrella of the Earth System Knowledge Platform (ESKP) Call for Tender at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research","The projects Biodiversity and Climate Change: Impacts on Local Stakeholder on the North Sea Coast (BioDiv; grant no.

It is also claimed to mitigate climate change through soil carbon sequestration: we conducted a meta-analysis of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock changes under CA practices in two tropical regions, the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), to quantify this. In IGP annual increases in SOC stock compared to conventional practice were between 0.16 and 0.49 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). In SSA increases were between 0.28 and 0.96 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), but with much greater variation and a significant number of cases with no measurable increase. Most reported SOC stock increases under CA are overestimates because of errors introduced by inappropriate soil sampling methodology. SOC increases require careful interpretation to assess whether or not they represent genuine climate change mitigation as opposed to redistribution of organic C within the landscape or soil profile. In smallholder farming in tropical regions social and economic barriers can greatly limit adoption of CA, further decreasing realistic mitigation potential. Comparison with the decreases in greenhouse gas emissions possible through improved management of nitrogen (N) fertilizer in regions such as IGP where N use is already high, suggests that this is a more effective and sustainable means of mitigating climate change. However the mitigation potential, and other benefits, from crop diversification are frequently overlooked when considering CA and warrant greater attention. Increases in SOC concentration (as opposed to stock) in near-surface soil from CA cause improvements in soil physical conditions; these are expected to contribute to increased sustainability and climate change adaptation, though not necessarily leading to consistently increased crop yields. CA should be promoted on the basis of these factors and any climate change mitigation regarded as an additional benefit, not a major policy driver for its adoption. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To evaluate whether this development is sustainable, impacts of these multiple drivers need to be assessed for multiple indicators. In a case study area in the Netherlands, a bio-economic farm model, an agent-based land-use change model, and a regional emission model have been used to simulate rural development under two plausible global change scenarios at both farm and landscape level. Results show that in this area, climate change will have mainly negative economic impacts (dairy gross margin, arable gross margin, economic efficiency, milk production) in the warmer and drier W+ scenario, while impacts are slightly positive in the G scenario with moderate climate change. Dairy farmers are worse off than arable farmers in both scenarios. Conversely, when the W+ scenario is embedded in the socio-economic Global Economy (GE) scenario, changes in technology, prices, and policy are projected to have a positive economic impact, more than offsetting the negative climate impacts. Important is, however, that environmental impacts (global warming, terrestrial and aquatic eutrophication) are largely negative and social impacts (farm size, number of farms, nature area, odour) are mixed. In the G scenario combined with the socio-economic Regional Communities (RC) scenario the average dairy gross margin in particular is negatively affected. Social impacts are similarly mixed as in the GE scenario, while environmental impacts are less severe. Our results suggest that integrated assessments at farm and landscape level can be used to guide decision-makers in spatial planning policies and climate change adaptation. As there will always be trade-offs between economic, social, and environmental impacts stakeholders need to interact and decide upon most important directions for policies. This implies a choice between production and income on the one hand and social and environmental services on the other hand. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, as Ireland's population and industrial centres are concentrated in coastal locations, Ireland's coastal communities will be particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Therefore, making the best use of existing knowledge to inform the establishment of governance structures capable of facilitating the measures and actions which may soon be required is a national imperative. Coastal communities worldwide have turned to integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) as a process to deliver sustainable development. This paper explores how experience gained from ICZM implementation can be harnessed to inform the development and implementation of climate adaptation policies, with a particular focus on the coastal zone. Using the principles and conceptual basis of Earth System Governance - an emerging approach to analyse complexity of governance under global environmental change - the paper maps the architecture of ICZM and climate governance in Ireland. The research identifies the main barriers to, and opportunities for, integrated application of the two policy domains. Barriers include the fragmentation of governance structures and responsibilities of key stakeholders, a lack of coordinated support for ICZM implementation at the national level, and a relatively weak awareness of the specifics of adaptation at the local level. Opportunities include the availability of expertise gathered from phases of ICZM implementation in Ireland, which encompasses mechanisms for science-policy integration, and invaluable experience of stakeholder participation and interaction. Current political and scientific support at national and EU levels give an additional impetus to climate research and actions which may bring additional opportunities and resources to coastal governance in Ireland.

GIS-based climate risk vulnerability assessment maps were generated to pinpoint the areas with the major climate hazards in Agusan del Norte. The vulnerability of the farmlands, and the adaptive capacity of the farms were assessed with index scoring. Also, adaptation to climate change based on the most problematic hazard (flooding) was observed on the two groups of farmers (with and without climate resilient agriculture (CRA)/cropping system adjustments) for cost and benefit comparison. The results show flooding and drought as the significant hazards in Agusan del Norte (Caraga Region) and high vulnerability to these hazards due to low coping mechanisms for most farms. Low adaptive capacity was also observed among these farms. Case-based observations on adaptation in Jabonga, Agusan del Norte revealed that well-timed adjustments to the usual cropping system can increase farm income despite of the flood and inundation for 2-3 months. This study recommends for harmonized measures toward advocating strengthened adaptive capacity for agriculture across Agusan del Norte. Further climate R&D and increasing policy support on climate financing and CRA options are highly encouraged for the agricultural stakeholders to take action. For hard-pressed farmers with constrained access to improved varieties and technologies, timing is potentially essential to circumvent damages from climate change to gain economic and psychosocial benefits with well-timed adaptation measures.","[Varela, Rowena P.

Green and efficient production methods are urgently needed in order to further enhance the yield of winter wheat and reduce the negative impact on the environment. Here, we analyzed the potential yield and yield gap of winter wheat in Shandong Province of China from 1981 to 2009. Meanwhile, we specified the effects of sowing time, irrigation and fertilization scheme, and variety characteristics on winter wheat. RESULTS In the past 29 years, the yield gap in most areas of Shandong has become smaller, because the actual yield has increased and the potential yield has changed little under the background of climate change. In addition, it is found that delaying sowing date is beneficial to increase yield by helping winter wheat avoid adverse climate conditions. Also, an irrigation amount of 240 mm and nitrogen application amount of 180-210 kg ha(-1) are best to maintain high yield, high resource utilization rate and low environmental pollution in this area. These suggested levels are lower than those currently used by many local farmers. Wheat varieties with longer grain-filling period and photoperiod response, higher grain-filling rate and grain weight were more adaptable to climate change. CONCLUSION Improving agronomic management measures can significantly increase the yield of winter wheat and narrow the yield gap. This study can provide valuable information for improving the production potential of winter wheat, and for reducing the damage of agricultural activities to the environment.

The situation is worsened by the fact that we are currently running out of cheap energy resources at the global scale while adaptation to climate change requires extra energy costs. It is often argued that technology and alternative energy will be a solution. However, alternative energy infrastructure also requires additional energy investments, which can further increase the gap between energy demand and supply. This paper presents an explorative model that demonstrates that a smooth transition from an oil-based economy to alternative energy sources is possible only if it is started well in advance while fossil resources are still abundant. Later the transition looks much more dramatic and it becomes risky to rely entirely on technological solutions. It becomes increasingly likely that in addition to technological solutions that can increase supply we will need to find ways to decrease demand and consumption. We further argue that market mechanisms can be just as powerful tools to curb demand as they have traditionally been for stimulating consumption. We observe that individuals who consume more energy resources benefit at the expense of those who consume less, effectively imposing price externalities on the latters. We suggest two transparent and flexible methods of pricing that attempt to eliminate price externalities on energy resources. Such pricing schemes stimulate less consumption and can smooth the transition to renewable energy.","[Voinov, Alexey] Univ Twente, Int Inst Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, NL-7522 EA Enschede, Netherlands; [Filatova, Tatiana] Univ Twente, Ctr Studies Technol & Sustainable Dev, NL-7522 EA Enschede, Netherlands",University of Twente; University of Twente,"Voinov, A (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Int Inst Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, NL-7522 EA Enschede, Netherlands.",aavoinov@gmail.com,"Voinov, Alexey/F-7397-2010; Filatova, Tatiana/K-8233-2016","Voinov, Alexey/0000-0002-2985-4574; Filatova, Tatiana/0000-0002-3546-6930",COMPLEX project [EU-FP7-308601],COMPLEX project,"In part this work has been supported by the EU-FP7-308601 COMPLEX project.

The drivers of and barriers to cultivating various energy crops are described in terms of a variety of motivational factors. The approach used peer-reviewed and gray literature using three Internet sources. Questions addressed include the energy crops available to Swedish farmers and how well established they are in terms of areal extent. What drivers of and barriers to growing energy crops do farmers perceive? How do various motivational factors for these drivers and barriers correspond to the adoption of certain energy crops? The results indicate that 13 energy-related crops are available, of which straw (a residue), oil crops, and wheat are the most extensively produced in terms of cultivated area. Results confirm earlier research findings that converting from annual to perennial crops and from traditional crops or production systems to new ones are important barriers. Economic motivations for changing production systems are strong, but factors such as values (e.g., esthetic), knowledge (e.g., habits and knowledge of production methods), and legal conditions (e.g., cultivation licenses) are crucial for the change to energy crops. Finally, there are knowledge gaps in the literature as to why farmers decide to keep or change a production system. Since the Swedish government and the EU intend to encourage farmers to expand their energy crop production, this knowledge of such motivational factors should be enhanced. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, wet bulb, temperature (Tw) was used to quantify the moist heat stress. Subsequently, The Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) is applied to simulate the modulation of climate change related to afforestation during 2001-2015. Based on the analysis of energy fluxes, we identified the biogeophysical mechanism of afforestation impact on moist heat stress. New hydrological insights for the region: Since the operation of the Grain-to-Green program, LP has experienced widespread afforestation which perturbs energy and water fluxes, affecting regional climate regimes. The forest expansion increases relative humidity but cools the regional temperature. As a significant combined climate factor, the average moist heat stress decreases with the magnitude of - 0.1 similar to- 0.3 degrees C in central LP. While the decrease rate of Tw is slower than near-surface temperature. It is worth noting that, an increased signal occurs in the maximum Tw (almost 0.2 degrees C in eastern and northeastern LP), which might expose humans to the risk of moist heat stress. By the mechanistic analysis, the research shows that the near-surface temperature and sensible heat flux are dominant driving factors for the change of Tw. Furthermore, the subsidence of the planetary boundary layer enhances moist heat stress. Overall, afforestation's effects on land surface-atmosphere interaction are non-negligible and the moist heat stress should be accounted for in climate change adaptation strategies.","[Zhang, Shulin; Wang, Weiguang; Liu, Guoshuai; Fu, Jianyu; Dong, Qing] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul Eng, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shulin; Wang, Weiguang; Liu, Guoshuai; Fu, Jianyu; Dong, Qing] Hohai Univ, Key Lab Water Big Data Technol Minist Water Resour, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shulin; Wang, Weiguang; Liu, Guoshuai; Fu, Jianyu; Dong, Qing] Hohai Univ, Coll Water Resources & Hydrol, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shulin; Teuling, Adriaan J.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Hydrol & Quantitat Water Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Ayantobo, Olusola O.] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China",Hohai University; Hohai University; Hohai University; Wageningen University & Research; Tsinghua University,"Teuling, AJ (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Hydrol & Quantitat Water Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",wangweiguang006@126.com; ryan.teuling@wur.nl,"Teuling, Ryan/D-2318-2014; Fu, Jianyu/GZA-7593-2022","Teuling, Ryan/0000-0003-4302-2835; Fu, Jianyu/0000-0002-7331-2457","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51979071, 51779073]; Distin- guished Young Fund Project of Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation [BK20180021]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFA0605402]; National Ten Thousand Program Youth Talent and the Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [B200204016]; China Scholar Council [202106710118]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Distin- guished Young Fund Project of Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation; National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Ten Thousand Program Youth Talent and the Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); China Scholar Council,"This work was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51979071, 51779073) , the Distinguished Young Fund Project of Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation (No. BK20180021) , the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2018YFA0605402) , the National Ten Thousand Program Youth Talent and the Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province, the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD) , the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. B200204016) , and China Scholar Council (No. 202106710118) .

In Sri Lanka, the agricultural sector is comprised largely of smallholder farmers where rain-fed rice is often a staple. Yet climate change projections indicate rice yields could drop by 40%, affecting the majority of farmers, and poverty levels could increase from 17% to 33%. At the same time, fertilisers are highly subsidized, without which farmers in this import-dependent island state would be exposed to future price fluctuations like the 800% phosphate price spike in 2008. Collaborative research between Sri Lankan and Australian researchers investigated the capacity of smallholder farmers, policy-makers and other food system stakeholders in Sri Lanka to adapt to these twin challenges via a participatory rapid integrated vulnerability assessment framework. We find that while Sri Lanka is vulnerable, there are many adaptive strategies already in place or planned. Although these strategies are not driven by climate change adaptation or phosphorus scarcity, they could be strengthened to support phosphorus and climate smart agriculture (PACSA). Sri Lanka's food production is in the midst of a major transformation, largely driven by the President's push for organic agriculture and organic fertilisers, waste-to-energy systems implemented through public-private partnerships, and the National Adaptation Plan for Climate Change. There are many 'win-win' PACSA opportunities both on- and off-farm, such as developing crop varieties that are drought-tolerant and need less phosphorus fertiliser and improved cold storage in the food value chain to reduce food losses.","[Cordell, Dana; Dominish, Elsa; Jacobs, Brent] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Esham, Mohamed] Sabaragamuwa Univ Sri Lanka, Belihuloya 70140, Sri Lanka; [Nanda, Madhuri] TERI Sch Adv Studies, Delhi, India; [Nanda, Madhuri] Rainforest Alliance, New Delhi, India",University of Technology Sydney; Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka; TERI University,"Cordell, D (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",dana.cordell@uts.edu.au,"Esham, Mohamed/M-7169-2019","Esham, Mohamed/0000-0002-4498-9274; Cordell, Dana/0000-0001-5138-1569",UTS Early Career Grant,UTS Early Career Grant,This study was funded by a UTS Early Career Grant.,,51,2,2,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1876-4517,1876-4525,,FOOD SECUR,Food Secur.,APR,2021,13,2,,,,,477,492,,10.1007/s12571-020-01118-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-020-01118-8,,FEB 2021,16,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Food Science & Technology,RO2FI,,Green Submitted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000619909400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding public perceptions of climate change is thus crucial to both identifying problems and delivering solutions. Investigations of climate change that integrate instrumental records and people's perceptions in the Himalayas are scarce and fragmentary compared to other regions of the world. We analyzed nationally representative data (n=5060) of local peoples' perception of climate change in Nepal, and assessed annual and seasonal trends of temperature and precipitation, onsets of seasons, and trends of climate extremes, based on gridded climate datasets. We firstly used quantitative and spatial techniques to compare local perceptions and the instrumentally observed trends of climate variables. We then examined the possible association of demographic variables, place attachment, regional differences, and prior understanding of climate change with the accuracy of people's perceptions. Instrumental evidence showed consistent warming, increasing hot days and nights, and increasing annual precipitation, wet spells, heavy precipitation and decreasing dry spells in Nepal. Our results indicate that locals accurately perceived the shifts in temperature but their perceptions of precipitation change did not converge with the instrumental records. We suggest that, in future as exposure to changes in weather, particularly extreme events, continues, people may become more likely to detect change which corresponds with observed trends. With some new methodological insights gained through integrating community perceptions with observed climate data, the results of this study provides valuable information to support policies to reduce climate-related risk and enhance climate change adaptation.","[Shrestha, Uttam Babu; Aryal, Suman] Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Agr & Environm, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Shrestha, Uttam Babu; Shrestha, Sujata] Global Inst Interdisciplinary Studies, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Shrestha, Asheshwor Man] Univ Adelaide, Discipline Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Gautam, Madhu Sudan] Kathmandu Univ, Sch Educ, Dhulikhel, Nepal; [Ojha, Hemant] Inst Studies & Dev Worldwide IFSD, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Southern Queensland; University of Adelaide; Kathmandu University,"Shrestha, UB (corresponding author), Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Agr & Environm, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia.;Shrestha, UB (corresponding author), Global Inst Interdisciplinary Studies, Kathmandu, Nepal.",ubshrestha@yahoo.com,"Ojha, Hemant/C-7490-2011","Ojha, Hemant/0000-0003-2654-4092; Shrestha, Uttam/0000-0002-8766-279X",,,,,47,27,27,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

While previous studies have focused on understanding the influence of SST oscillations on drought frequency over the CONUS, this information has not been integrated with global warming for future drought risk assessment at the decadal scale. In this study, we use the support vector machines (SVMs) to handle correlation between input variables for quantifying the influence of internal variability [Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO)] and global warming on the decadal changes in the severity of seasonal droughts over the CONUS during 1901-2015. The regional drivers of drought severity identified using SVMs are used for the assessment of decadal drought risk in the near future. We find internal variability as the dominant driver of decadal changes in drought severity in the southern and central Great Plains and global warming as the dominant driver for the southeastern and southwestern United States. In the southern Plains, the existing pattern of increasing drought severity is likely to persist in the near future if AMO and PDO remain in their positive and negative phases, respectively, while global warming is likely to contribute to increasing drought severity in the Southeast and Southwest. This study suggests an emerging role of global warming in drought risk over the southern states, where near-term climate change adaptation is necessary.","[Apurv, Tushar; Cai, Ximing] Univ Illinois, VenTe Chow Hydrosyst Lab, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Yuan, Xing] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Cai, XM (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, VenTe Chow Hydrosyst Lab, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",xmcai@illinois.edu,"Yuan, Xing/G-8392-2011","Yuan, Xing/0000-0001-6983-7368; Apurv, Tushar/0000-0003-1622-8029; Cai, Ximing/0000-0002-7342-4512","Institute for Sustainability, Energy and Environment (iSEE), University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","Institute for Sustainability, Energy and Environment (iSEE), University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","We are grateful for the financial support for this study by the Institute for Sustainability, Energy and Environment (iSEE), University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

How well do we understand these potential changes today, and what are implications for water resources management, climate change adaptation, and evolving water policy? To answer above questions, we have examined 11 case study regions with the goal of providing a global overview, identifying research gaps and formulating recommendations for research, management and policy. After setting the scene regarding water stress, water management capacity and scientific capacity in our case study regions, we examine the state of knowledge in water resources from a highland-lowland viewpoint, focusing on mountain areas on the one hand and the adjacent lowland areas on the other hand. Based on this review, research priorities are identified, including precipitation, snow water equivalent, soil parameters, evapotranspiration and sublimation, groundwater as well as enhanced warming and feedback mechanisms. In addition, the importance of environmental monitoring at high altitudes is highlighted. We then make recommendations how advancements in the management of mountain water resources under climate change could be achieved in the fields of research, water resources management and policy as well as through better interaction between these fields. We conclude that effective management of mountain water resources urgently requires more detailed regional studies and more reliable scenario projections, and that research on mountain water resources must become more integrative by linking relevant disciplines. In addition, the knowledge exchange between managers and researchers must be improved and oriented towards long-term continuous interaction.","[Viviroli, D.; Schaedler, B.] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Viviroli, D.; Schaedler, B.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Archer, D.

Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an approach for creating and managing an inventive 3D model simulating digital information that is useful to project management, monitoring and operation of a specific asset during the whole life cycle assessment (LCA). BIM application can help to provide an efficient cost management and time schedule and reduce the project delivery time throughout the whole life cycle of the project. In this study, an innovative DT has been developed using BIM integration through a life cycle analysis. Minnamurra Railway Bridge (MRB), Australia, has been chosen as a real-world use case to demonstrate the extended application of BIM (i.e., the DT) to enhance the operation, maintenance and asset management to improve the sustainability and resilience of the railway bridge. Moreover, the DT has been exploited to determine GHG emissions and cost consumption through the integration of BIM. This study demonstrates the feasibility of DT technology for railway maintenance and resilience optimisation. It also generates a virtual collaboration for co-simulations and co-creation of values across stakeholders participating in construction, operation and maintenance, and enhancing a reduction in costs and GHG emission.","[Kaewunruen, Sakdirat; AbdelHadi, Mohannad] Univ Birmingham, Sch Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, England; [Kongpuang, Manwika] Prince Songkla Univ, Dept Min & Mat Engn, Hat Yai 90110, Thailand; [Pansuk, Withit] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Engn, Ctr Excellence Innovat Construct Mat, Dept Civil Engn, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Remennikov, Alex M.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Civil Min & Environm Engn, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Birmingham; Prince of Songkla University; Chulalongkorn University; University of Wollongong,"Kaewunruen, S (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, England.",s.kaewunruen@bham.ac.uk,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Kaewunruen, Sakdirat/A-6793-2008","Kaewunruen, Sakdirat/0000-0003-2153-3538; Pansuk, Withit/0000-0001-8910-2043",European Commission; H2020-RISE Project [691135]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Sciences [JSPS-L15701]; MDPI's Invited Paper Initiative,"European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); H2020-RISE Project; Japan Society for the Promotion of Sciences(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); MDPI's Invited Paper Initiative","The research was funded by the European Commission for the financial sponsorship of the H2020-RISE Project No. 691135; and by Japan Society for the Promotion of Sciences for Invitation Research Fellowship (Long-term), Grant No. JSPS-L15701.

Qualitative data for the study were gathered through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with 25 local Black women from Inanda, Ntuzuma, KwaMashu and Umlazi. Five key informants from the eThekwini (Durban) metropolitan municipality were also interviewed. Findings from the study showed that although there is improved economic development in the selected settlements, which constitute informal settlements designated for Black South Africans during the apartheid era, such an economic development approach has not significantly improved the livelihoods and adaptive capacity of the local women.

Using a unique dataset of 343 married women, logistic regression analysis is used to examine adaptation practices ranging from agricultural to coping and livelihood diversification strategies. Specifically, we investigate the role of wives' intrahousehold decision-making participation in adaptation decisions. Drawing on the literatures of intrahousehold bargaining and agricultural technology adoption, we argue that although extrahousehold factors are important determinants of households' adaptation behaviour, adaptation outcomes can also be different when decided by husbands or by wives. We find that when wives are more involved in intrahousehold adaptation decision-making, they are also more likely to choose to be engaged in non-farm income-earning activities, and their households are more likely to plant cover crops and drought-resistant crops. We argue that in general Tanzanian smallholders' adaptation options are limited and their intrahousehold bargaining sets relatively narrow, leaving little room for differing intrahousehold adaptation preferences, especially in the case of quasi-public household goods.","[Van Aelst, Katrien; Holvoet, Nathalie] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management IOB, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Van Aelst, K (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management IOB, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",katrien.vanaelst@uantwerpen.be,"Holvoet, Nathalie/N-8096-2019","Holvoet, Nathalie/0000-0003-4413-1208",Research Fund of the University of Antwerp; VLIR-UOS Institutional University Cooperation,Research Fund of the University of Antwerp; VLIR-UOS Institutional University Cooperation,This work was supported by Research Fund of the University of Antwerp (DOCPRO4) and VLIR-UOS Institutional University Cooperation.,,43,8,8,0,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Climate adaptation requires new interdisciplinary approaches in which different disciplines as well as research and practice proactively co-create and collaborate on adaptation to reduce the ongoing effects of anthropogenic climate change. Although awareness on climate adaptation is on the rise, new approaches for urban development are still in development. Moreover, existing approaches mainly focus on local-scale levels or lack a crossover with urban and landscape planning. The present contribution offers an example of an integrated approach bridging urban climatology, landscape planning, and governance to assess and develop climate adaptation solutions linking city and district levels. The city of Verona was taken as a case study to test this approach and its implications for the development of a green and blue infrastructure with a climate-responsive master plan for the district of Verona South. Through critical reflection on the application of the approach to the case study, we aimed to identify its potentials and barriers. Based on this reflection, we provide herein recommendations on how climate modelling can be integrated into planning, as well as on how urban planners and urban climatologists can support each other in making credible and salient climate adaptation solutions.","[Tomasi, Marika] Univ Kent, Kent Sch Architecture & Planning, Canterbury CT2 7NR, Kent, England; [Tomasi, Marika] CRA Carlo Ratti Associati, I-10131 Turin, Italy; [Favargiotti, Sara; Giovannini, Lorenzo; Zonato, Andrea] Univ Trento, Dept Civil Environm & Mech Engn, I-38123 Trento, Italy; [van Lierop, Martina] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, TUM Strateg Landscape Planning & Management, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",University of Kent; University of Trento; Technical University of Munich,"Tomasi, M (corresponding author), Univ Kent, Kent Sch Architecture & Planning, Canterbury CT2 7NR, Kent, England.;Tomasi, M (corresponding author), CRA Carlo Ratti Associati, I-10131 Turin, Italy.",mt622@kent.ac.uk; sara.favargiotti@unitn.it; martina.van-lierop@tum.de; lorenzo.giovannini@unitn.it; andrea.zonato@unitn.it,"Giovannini, Lorenzo/A-5468-2015","Giovannini, Lorenzo/0000-0003-1650-0344; Tomasi, Marika/0000-0002-4369-3295; Favargiotti, Sara/0000-0003-3598-1518",University of Trento within the initiative Opportunities of international mobility for thesis research/final examination abroad,University of Trento within the initiative Opportunities of international mobility for thesis research/final examination abroad,The three-month period spent at the Technical University of Munich was funded by the University of Trento within the initiative Opportunities of international mobility for thesis research/final examination abroad.,,77,1,1,2,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2021,13,12,,,,,,,6851,10.3390/su13126851,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13126851,,,28,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,SZ2BW,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000666378400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper uses the experiment of co-producing an adaptation plan for a small municipality in the Western Cape Province, South Africa, to illustrate how opportunities were leveraged. The findings suggest that a shift from strengthening the science-policy interface to the knowledge-policy interface might be more appropriate in the context of adaptation planning that requires an understanding of the local context as well as of global science. In order to align adaptation plans with developmental priorities and to secure support from actors at multiple levels, the integration of multiple knowledge forms, including climate science, should be prioritized. Such a task could be strengthened if co-production is prioritized.

However, while many statements point to the reliance that is placed on technology, and to the power of induced innovation, the actual process of agricultural research and development has received little explicit consideration in the context of climatic constraints on food production. This paper offers both a descriptive assessment and empirical analysis of the place of technology research and development in climate adaptation research and planning. Insights into the assumed role of technology are developed through a review of the published literature and recent commentary. The role of technological innovation in the handling of climatic risks is then explored empirically in an analysis of innovation research and development in the Ontario soybean industry. This reveals an array of technological innovations that have helped Ontario soybean-growers manage climatic challenges to date, as well as a range of potential constraints on the innovation process itself.

The present study advances that agenda by focusing on the federally funded retreat of homes and residents from flood-prone urban neighborhoods. While officially organized by rational engineering and technocratic calculations, its implementation cannot escape the racialized landscapes of U.S. cities. To illustrate, we review how a century of unequal environmental planning and housing policy has forged today's racialized urban landscapes. Then, we turn to the federal government's entrance into those landscapes via its policy of managed retreat that purchases flood-prone homes and returns them to nature. Here we draw on nationwide data to reveal the policy's increasing urban orientation. We then present evidence from Houston to reveal how the racial composition and turnover of local neighborhoods influence program implementation and subsequent relocation. While not every city may experience the same racialized patterns as Houston, they will exhibit some patterns due to the powerful social and environmental force that race has long exerted in U.S. cities. Failing to account for that force will compromise efforts to adapt effectively to climate change.","[Loughran, Kevin] Temple Univ, Sociol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Elliott, James R.] Rice Univ, Sociol, Houston, TX USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; Rice University,"Loughran, K (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Sociol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",kevin.loughran@temple.edu,,,,,,,48,5,5,3,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1051-1482,2152-050X,,HOUS POLICY DEBATE,Hous.

Locally-specific natural resource threats, associated with population growth and tourism, exacerbate these systemic risks, which are particularly acute where community well-being is subsistence-based and directly reliant on ecosystem services. Garden productivity is falling as the cropping/fallow cycle intensifies and culturally and there is loss of observance of traditional resource taboos, eroding the effectiveness of customary management. Ecosystem based adaptations (EbA) provide a fruitful range of interventions and are beginning to attract development funding. We undertook a social benefit cost analysis for a suite of interconnecting EbAs for Tanna in Vanuatu. We found that funds targeted at increasing the productivity of the gardens returns significant social benefit. This also reduces pressure on natural resource threats and can potentially be adopted by all households on Tanna. In addition, increasing the community's capacity to balance formal forest and reef conservation with customary management can provide small, but nevertheless important complimentary benefits. Our programme design included interlinking activities, including a series of demonstration garden plots, extension officers, community radio, a community ranger programme and a tree nursery.","[Buckwell, Andrew; Fleming, Christopher] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, South Bank Campus,226 Grey St, South Bank, Qld 4101, Australia; [Ware, Dan; Mackey, Brendan; Nalau, Johanna] Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Southport, Qld, Australia; [Smart, James C.

Achieving the SDGs should increase social-ecological resilience to shocks like climate change and its impacts. Here, we consider the relationship amongst the three elements-the SDGs, social-ecological resilience and climate change-as a positive feedback loop. We argue that long-term memory encoded in historical, archaeological and related 'palaeo-data' is central to understanding each of these elements of the feedback loop, especially when long-term fluctuations are inherent in social-ecological systems and their responses to abrupt change. Yet, there is scant reference to the valuable contribution that can be made by these data from the past in the SDGs or their targets and indicators. The historical and archaeological records emphasise the importance of some key themes running through the SDGs including how diversity, inclusion, learning and innovation can reduce vulnerability to abrupt change, and the role of connectivity. Using paleo-data, we demonstrate how changes in the extent of water-related ecosystems as measured by indicator 6.6.1 may simply be related to natural hydroclimate variability, rather than reflecting actual progress towards Target 6.6. This highlights issues associated with using SDG indicator baselines predicated on short-term and very recent data only. Within the context of the contributions from long-term data to inform the positive feedback loop, we ask whether our current inability to substantively combat anthropogenic climate change threatens achieving both the SDGS and enhanced resilience to climate change itself. We argue that long-term records are central to understanding how and what will improve resilience and enhance our ability to both mitigate and adapt to climate change. However, for uptake of these data to occur, improved understanding of their quality and potential by policymakers and managers is required.","[Allen, K.

Therefore, recognition of spatial and temporal variations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration both globally and regionally is critical. The goal of this study was to analyze spatiotemporal patterns of atmospheric CO2 concentration (XCO2) for Iran over the period from 2003 to 2020 to shed light on the role of various biotic and abiotic controls. First, by using atmospheric XCO2 data obtained from the SCIAMACHY and GOSAT satellite instruments, a series of spatio-temporal XCO2 distribution maps were developed. Second, to understand of the potential causes underlying the spatio-temporal distributions in XCO2, the correlations between monthly XCO2 and vegetation abundance, air temperature, precipitation, and fossil fuel CO2 emissions were examined. The spatio-temporal patterns in XCO2 indicated an increasing gradient of XCO2 from north to south and from west to east in Iran, with the highest XCO2 in the central, southern and southeastern parts of the country. The findings revealed that XCO2 was negatively correlated with vegetation abundance and precipitation, and positively correlated with air temperature in different months from 2003 to 2020. Among the different explanatory variables, vegetation abundance explained most of the spatial variation in XCO2. Furthermore, in spring (April and May), which has the highest amount of vegetation abundance and precipitation, biotic controls had a substantial impact on the diffusion and absorption of XCO2 in the northern and northwestern parts of Iran. Our results suggest that CO2 is moved from the center of Iran to the outer parts of the country in summer (July-September) and vice-versa in winter (January-March). Our findings provide policy and decision makers with crucial information regarding the spatio-temporal dynamics in XCO2 to reduce and, ultimately, halt its increase.","[Mousavi, Seyed Mohsen; Dinan, Naghmeh Mobarghaee] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Dept Environm Planning & Design, Tehran 1983969411, Iran; [Ansarifard, Saeed] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Dept Phys, GC, Tehran 19839, Iran; [Ansarifard, Saeed] Inst Res Fundamental Sci IPM, Sch Phys, POB 19395-5531, Tehran, Iran; [Sonnentag, Oliver] Univ Montreal, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Shahid Beheshti University; Shahid Beheshti University; Universite de Montreal,"Mousavi, SM; Dinan, NM (corresponding author), Shahid Beheshti Univ, Dept Environm Planning & Design, Tehran 1983969411, Iran.",se_mousavi@sbu.ac.ir; n_mobarghaee@sbu.ac.ir; ansarifard@ipm.ir; oliver.sonnentag@umontreal.ca,"Mousavi, Seyed Mohsen/HCH-0992-2022","Mousavi, Seyed Mohsen/0000-0002-7954-7070",Iran National Science Foundation [98027555]; GOSAT Project of Japan; NASA; University of Bremen,Iran National Science Foundation(Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)); GOSAT Project of Japan; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); University of Bremen,"This work was supported by Iran National Science Foundation (Grant Number: 98027555) .

While awareness of the existence and consequences of climate change is becoming widespread, the specific effects on agriculture and the extent to which innovative climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices are being adopted remain unclear. This study was conducted in three local municipalities of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa to determine the patterns of smallholder choice of alternative climate-smart agricultural practices and the factors affecting such choices. It was particularly crucial to investigate why adaptation of CSA practices continues to be lower than expectation despite awareness of their benefits, thus highlighting the social and cultural limits to adaptation to climate change. A total of 210 households were enumerated on the basis of their involvement in crop and livestock farming. The data were analyzed by means of multinomial logistic model, which was applied separately to individual local municipality data sets and a combined provincial data set, and it was revealed that most farmers were not being sufficiently motivated to move from established practices to adopt new CSA practices. The most influential factors in the decision process as to what CSA practice to adopt were primary occupation, farming system type, household size, age and membership of farmer groups. It seemed that asset fixity constrained farmers to continue with existing practices rather than shift to new, more profitable practices, a situation that can be resolved by external intervention by government agencies and/or other entities. Awareness creation targeting remote rural areas as well as institutions to ease farmers' access to credit and information will contribute to higher adoption rates, which are likely to lead to enhanced food security and standard of living for rural dwellers as their agricultural production and productivity improve.","[Obi, Ajuruchukwu; Maya, Okuhle] Univ Ft Hare, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, ZA-5700 Alice, South Africa",University of Fort Hare,"Obi, A (corresponding author), Univ Ft Hare, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, ZA-5700 Alice, South Africa.",aobi@ufh.ac.za; 201012974@ufh.ac.za,"Obi, Ajuruchukwu/I-3620-2013","Obi, Ajuruchukwu/0000-0002-5545-8946; MAYA, OKUHLE/0000-0001-8103-7320",South African Water Research Commission (WRC); South African Agricultural Research Council (ARC),South African Water Research Commission (WRC); South African Agricultural Research Council (ARC),This research was funded by the South African Water Research Commission (WRC) and the South African Agricultural Research Council (ARC).

In this study, various climatic zones of Iran were investigated to assess the relationship between the trend and the stationarity of the climatic variables. The Mann-Kendall test was considered to identify the trend, while the trend free pre-whitening approach was applied for eliminating serial correlation from the time-series. Meanwhile, time series stationarity was tested by Dickey-Fuller and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin tests. The results indicated an increasing trend for mean air temperature series at most of the stations over various climatic zones, however, after eliminating the serial correlation factor, this increasing trend changes to an insignificant decreasing trend at a 95% confidence level. The seasonal mean air temperature trend suggested a significant increase in the majority of the stations. The mean air temperature increased more in northwest towards central parts of Iran that mostly located in arid and semiarid climatic zones. Precipitation trend reveals an insignificant downward trend in most of the series over various climatic zones; furthermore, most of the stations follow a decreasing trend for seasonal precipitation. Furthermore, spatial patterns of trend and seasonality of precipitation and mean air temperature showed that the northwest parts of Iran and margin areas of the Caspian Sea are more vulnerable to the changing climate with respect to the precipitation shortfalls and warming. Stationarity analysis indicated that the stationarity of climatic series influences on their trend; so that, the series which have significant trends are not static. The findings of this investigation can help planners and policy-makers in various fields related to climatic issues, implementing better management and planning strategies to adapt to climate change and variability over Iran.","[Mirdashtvan, Mahsa; Mohseni Saravi, Mohsen] Univ Tehran, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Range & Watershed Management, Karaj 3158777871, Iran",University of Tehran,"Mirdashtvan, M (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Range & Watershed Management, Karaj 3158777871, Iran.",mirdashtevan@ut.ac.ir,,,Iran National Science Foundation [9583187],Iran National Science Foundation(Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)),This research was supported by the Iran National Science Foundation (9583187).,,57,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1674-6767,2194-7783,,J ARID LAND,J.

Maintaining ecosystems that deliver critical services to communities can also provide co-benefits beyond adaptation, such as climate mitigation and protection of biological diversity and livelihoods. EbA has, to a limited extent, drawn upon indigenous and local knowledge for defining critical services and for implementing EbA in decision-making. This is a paradox given that the primary focus of EbA is to enable communities to adapt to climate change. The purpose of this study was to elucidate EbA strategies that take into account the knowledge of Sami reindeer herders about pastures in tundra regions. We first examined what constitutes critical services through a synthesis of data and literature. We thereafter used content analysis of 91 land use cases from 2010 to 2018 to investigate to what extent the herders' knowledge and maps over seasonal pastures and migratory routes are used in local decision-making. Finally, we propose EbA strategies of relevance to Sami communities and pastoral communities elsewhere. Our analysis revealed that reindeer herders and organizations representing their interests perceived threats from green energy development, tourism, recreation, public road construction and powerlines. These threats included the loss of key habitats and the loss of connectivity for migration between seasonal pastures. Pastoralists' knowledge is incorporated through participatory tools to protect the ecosystems and services crucial for pastoralists, but multiple competing land uses result in incremental loss of pastures regardless. Synthesis and applications. Protecting pasture ecosystems and the services they deliver, including the connectivity between pastures, are necessary Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) strategies to buffer the adverse effects of climate change. Drawing on pastoralists' knowledge to elicit EbA strategies can inform decision-making, but it is equally important to implement this knowledge for prioritizing adaptation needs in the assessment of competing land use.","[Hausner, Vera H.; Engen, Sigrid] UiT, Arctic Sustainabil Lab, AMB, Tromso, Norway; [Engen, Sigrid; Fauchald, Per] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Tromso, Norway; [Brattland, Camilla] UiT, Ctr Sami Studies, Tromso, Norway; [Brattland, Camilla] UiT, Dept Social Sci, Tromso, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; Norwegian Institute Nature Research; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Hausner, VH (corresponding author), UiT, Arctic Sustainabil Lab, AMB, Tromso, Norway.",vera.hausner@uit.no,"Brattland, Camilla/ABC-3652-2021; Fauchald, Per/AAV-4242-2021","Hausner, Vera Helene/0000-0001-9825-0419",Norges Forskningsrad [259416]; The FRAM Centre,Norges Forskningsrad; The FRAM Centre,"The FRAM Centre; Norges Forskningsrad, Grant/Award Number: 259416",,38,11,11,2,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

In this study a new approach is presented to assess the risk of seasonal low flow in the Pleistocene landscape of the Federal State of Brandenburg in Germany. Seasonal low flow and drought in small streams is very common in this region and is predicted to increase due to climate change within the next decades. Data of 15 years (1991-2006) of daily discharge at 37 small catchments (<500 km(2)) and rainfall data from the same region were used. Principal component analyses were applied to the two data sets separately. The first five principal components of the discharge data, principal components of a precipitation data set covering the same catchments and catchment characteristics were used to explain the patterns found. The first five discharge components explained 72.9% of the total variance in the data set. The first component reflected the general regional discharge pattern. Components 2 and 3 of the discharge data could be related to spatial patterns of precipitation. Components 4 and 5 of the discharge data reflected geohydrologic processes within the catchments. In order to identify catchments with high risk with respect to low flows, component three and five were important as they both identified catchments with faster decrease of flows during summer. These components were used to estimate low flow risk. Catchments located in the northeast of Brandenburg, especially those in the Barnim highlands north and east of Berlin, were identified to be prone to seasonal low flow. There water management measures to adapt to climate change are needed the most. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

One approach to address this problem encourages scientists and decision-makers to co-produce usable information collaboratively. Researchers have proposed general principles for climate science co-production, yet few studies have applied and evaluated these principles in practice. In this study, climate change researchers and natural resource managers co-produced climate-related knowledge that was directly relevant for on-going habitat management planning. We documented our methods and assessed how and to what extent the process led to the near-term use of co-produced information, while also identifying salient information needs for future research. The co-production process resulted in: 1) an updated natural resource management plan that substantially differed from the former plan in how it addressed climate change, 2) increased understanding of climate change, its impacts, and management responses among agency staff, and 3) a prioritized list of climate-related information needs that would be useful for management decision-making. We found that having a boundary spanner-an intermediary with relevant science and management expertise that enables exchange between knowledge producers and users-guide the co-production process was critical to achieving outcomes. Central to the boundary spanner's role were a range of characteristics and skills, such as knowledge of relevant science, familiarity with management issues, comfort translating science into practice, and an ability to facilitate climate-informed planning. By describing specific co-production methods and evaluating their effectiveness, we offer recommendations for others looking to co-produce climate change information to use in natural resource management planning and implementation.","[Cross, Molly S.; Oakes, Lauren E.; Kretser, Heidi E.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Bronx, NY 10460 USA; [Oakes, Lauren E.] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA USA; [Kretser, Heidi E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Ithaca, NY USA; [Bredehoft, Raymond; Dey, Paul; Mahoney, Anika; Smith, Noelle; Tator, Ian; Wasseen, Jim] Wyoming Game & Fish Dept, Cheyenne, WY USA",Wildlife Conservation Society; Stanford University; Cornell University,"Cross, MS (corresponding author), Wildlife Conservat Soc, Bronx, NY 10460 USA.",mcross@wcs.org,,,"United States Geological Survey [G19AC00001, G18AC00325]",United States Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey),This work was supported by the United States Geological Survey (Grant and Cooperative Agreements No. G19AC00001 and No. G18AC00325).,,43,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0364-152X,1432-1009,,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

As the frequency and intensity of climate change impacts increase, ranchers will be front-line workers in the climate crisis-both adapting to climate impacts and managing landscapes with mitigation potential. This Forum paper first summarizes recent peer-reviewed research on ranchers and climate change in the western United States and then offers conceptual clarification of climate change adaptation based on this empirical research. Many ranchers remain unconvinced by climate science and express skepticism about long-term and anthropogenic climate change, though this may change as climate extremes intensify. Researchers working with ranchers often avoid climate change terminology, instead focusing on impacts, especially drought. Ranchers adjust their land and livestock management practices, as well as livelihood strategies, to cope with weather variability. Ranchers identify increasing management flexibility and diversifying ranch income as key adaptation strategies. While studies often focus on how to transition ranchers from reactive and toward proactive adaptation planning, few ranchers are actively planning for climatic change. Yet in this ranching context, many practices that begin as reactive coping strategies become longer-term adaptations as the impact, such as drought or recurrent wildfire smoke, persists. As ranchers observe positive outcomes of short-term adaptations or are unable to return to previous strategies, reactive coping strategies become proactive. We provide a conceptual clarification of adaptation in ranching systems, forwarding adaptation as a process, inclusive of a continuum from coping actions to more transformative adaptation strategies. Centering ranchers' experiences, perceptions, and responses related to climate change can help land managers, agricultural advisors, and policy makers increase the pace and scale of adaptation and mitigation in range systems.

Yet, little data exist documenting environmental and human health vulnerabilities in slums or how to move research to action. Citizen science, where residents co-define research objectives with professionals, collect and analyze data, and help translate findings into ameliorative actions, can help fill data gaps and contribute to more locally relevant climate justice interventions. This paper highlights a citizen-science, climate justice planning process in the Mukuru informal settlement of Nairobi, Kenya. We describe how residents, non-governmental organizations and academics partnered to co-create data-gathering processes and generated evidence to inform an integrated, climate justice strategy called the Mukuru Special Planning Area, Integrated Development Plan. The citizen science processes revealed that <1% of residents had access to a private in-home toilet, and 37% lacked regular access to safe and affordable drinking water. We found that 42% of households were subject to regular flooding, 39% reported fair or poor health, and 40% reported a child in the household was stunted. These and other data were used in a community planning process where thousands of residents co-designed improvement and climate change adaptation strategies, such as flood mitigation, formalizing roads and pathways with drainage, and a water and sanitation infrastructure plan for all. We describe the participatory processes used by citizen scientists to generate data and move evidence into immediate actions to protect human health and a draft a long-range, climate justice strategy. The processes used to create the Mukuru Special Planning Area redevelopment plan suggest that participatory, citizen-led urban science can inform local efforts for health equity and global goals of climate justice.","[Corburn, Jason] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Corburn, Jason] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept City & Reg Planning, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Njoroge, Patrick; Weru, Jane; Musya, Maureen] Akiba Mashinani Trust, POB 20509-00100, Nairobi, Kenya",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Corburn, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Corburn, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept City & Reg Planning, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jcorburn@berkeley.edu; patrick.njorogee@gmail.com; janeweru1@gmail.com; musyamaureen96@gmail.com,,"Corburn, Jason/0000-0002-2160-348X",International Development Research Centre (IDRC) [109711-001],International Development Research Centre (IDRC),"Parts of this research were funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), grant number #109711-001.",,75,1,1,8,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2413-8851,,URBAN SCI,Urban Sci.,JUN,2022,6,2,,,,,,,36,10.3390/urbansci6020036,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/urbansci6020036,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,2K4UC,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000816331900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Not much is known on household latrine use in the long term in the absence of an intervention. The current work assesses drivers and barriers to sustained use of a ventilated improved pit latrine (Blair VIP) design where it originated and how rural households adapt it to climate change. MethodsA mixed methods study was conducted from November 2020 to May 2021 among rural households of Mbire district, Zimbabwe. A cross sectional survey of 238 households with Blair ventilated improved pit (BVIP) latrines was conducted using a questionnaire and a latrine observation checklist. Data were analysed using logistic regression. Qualitative data were collected using six focus groups among house heads and analysed by thematic analysis. ResultThe latrine has perceived health, non-health and hygiene benefits for its sustained use. However, there are design, environmental and social barriers. The quantitative study indicated that determinants of latrine use were contextual (individual and household levels) and technology (individual level) factors. Focus groups indicated that latrine use was influenced by social, technology and contextual factors at multiple level factors. Interplay of factors influenced the intention to adapt the BVIP latrine to climate change. Local climate change adaptation strategies for the latrine were odour and erosion control, construction of the conventional latrine design and raised structures. ConclusionThe conventional BVIP latrine design is durable and relatively resilient to climate change with high local household use. High construction cost of the latrine causes households to build incomplete and poor quality designs which affect odour and fly control. These are barriers to sustained latrine use. The government should implement the new sanitation policy which considers alternative sanitation options and offer community support for adapting sanitation to climate change.","[Kanda, Artwell; Ncube, Esper Jacobeth; Voyi, Kuku] Univ Pretoria, Fac Hlth Sci, Sch Hlth Syst & Publ Hlth, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Kanda, A (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Fac Hlth Sci, Sch Hlth Syst & Publ Hlth, Pretoria, South Africa.",alzkanda@gmail.com,"Voyi, Kuku/O-6007-2015","Voyi, Kuku/0000-0001-5076-3143",,,,,57,1,1,3,4,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,,2022,17,4,,,,,,,e0265077,10.1371/journal.pone.0265077,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265077,,,24,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,1T5DI,35363790,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000804748600031,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we assess changes in temperature and heat waves over different regions of the African continent, with a focus on spatiotemporal trends and the time of emergence of change in hot extremes from natural variability. We analyse absolute and relative threshold indices. Data sets include temperatures from observations (CRUTS4.03 and BEST) and from three representative state-of-the-art reanalyses (ERA5, MERRA2 and JRA-55) for the common period 1980-2018. Statistically significant warming is observed over all regions of Africa in temperature time series from CRU observations and reanalysis data, although the trend strength varies between data sets. Also, extreme temperatures and heat wave indices from BEST observations and all reanalysis data sets reveal increasing trends over all regions of the African continent. However, there are differences in both trend strength and time evolution of heat wave indices between different reanalysis data sets. Most data sets agree in identifying 2010 as a peak heat year over Northern and Western Africa while Eastern and Southern Africa experienced the highest heat wave occurrence in 2016. Our results clearly reveal that heat wave occurrences have emerged from natural climate variability in Africa. The earliest time of emergence takes place in the Northern Africa region in the early 2000s while in the other African regions emergence over natural variability is found mainly after 2010. This also depends on the respective index metrics, where indices based on more consecutive days show later emergence of heat wave trends. Overall, significant warming and an increase in heat wave occurrence is found in all regions of Africa and has emerged from natural variability in the past one or two decades.","[Engdaw, Mastawesha Misganaw; Steiner, Andrea K.] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change WEGC, Graz, Austria; [Engdaw, Mastawesha Misganaw] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, FWF DK Climate Change, Graz, Austria; [Ballinger, Andrew P.; Hegerl, Gabriele C.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Steiner, Andrea K.] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Geophys Astrophys & Meteorol, Inst Phys, Graz, Austria",University of Graz; University of Graz; University of Edinburgh; University of Graz,"Engdaw, MM (corresponding author), Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change WEGC, Graz, Austria.;Engdaw, MM (corresponding author), Karl Franzens Univ Graz, FWF DK Climate Change, Graz, Austria.",mastawesha.engdaw@uni-graz.at,"Steiner, Andrea K/F-7980-2017","Steiner, Andrea K/0000-0003-1201-3303; Ballinger, Andrew/0000-0003-3704-1976; Engdaw, Mastawesha Misganaw/0000-0001-8224-2369",Austrian Science Fund [W1256],Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"Austrian Science Fund, Grant/Award Number: W1256",,55,5,6,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

However, trees may also have a negative effect on fodder production. Such trade-offs between productivity and sustainability in farming are poorly understood, especially in high-latitude areas. We studied hay production in two sites in the same wooded meadow in western Norway, one restored 6 years earlier than the other, to examine whether there were differences in hay production over a 4-year pollarding cycle. We measured production in transects starting from the trunks of pollarded and non-pollarded (reference) trees and running out into open meadow, and transects entirely in open meadow. We examined whether pollarding influenced hay production, and whether hay production was related to the distance from the tree trunk. Total production differed between the two sites, indicating that both time since restoration and differences in overall tree influence affected hay production. We observed a strong and immediate pollarding effect (increase in hay production) due to reduced tree influence. Trees have a negative influence on production as demonstrated by the increase in hay production with increasing distance from the tree trunk. However, additional dry fodder produced by harvesting leaves from pollarded trees more than compensates for reduction in hay production under pollarded trees. Moreover, the understorey production in the wooded hay meadow is at the same level as fertilized meadows in Norway when we include the fodder consumed by sheep during spring and autumn grazing. A wooded hay meadow is an environmentally friendly production system that does not compromise food production. Its tree component can also play an important role in climate change adaptation and mitigation, and supports higher biodiversity than industrial food production systems.","[Rydgren, Knut; Austad, Ingvild; Hamre, Liv Norunn] Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Environm Sci, POB 133, N-6851 Sogndal, Norway; [Topper, Joachim P.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Thormohlensgate 55, N-5006 Bergen, Norway",Western Norway University of Applied Sciences; Norwegian Institute Nature Research,"Rydgren, K (corresponding author), Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Environm Sci, POB 133, N-6851 Sogndal, Norway.",knut.rydgren@hvl.no; ingvild.austad@hvl.no; liv.hamre@hvl.no; Joachim.Topper@nina.no,"Töpper, Joachim/AAG-6410-2020","Töpper, Joachim/0000-0002-6996-7223; Rydgren, Knut/0000-0001-8910-2465",Research Council of Norway,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),Research Council of Norway.,,62,0,0,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,1572-9680,,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

In addition to their role in mitigating climate change, SCS practices play a role in delivering agroecosystem resilience, climate change adaptability and food security. Environmental heterogeneity and differences in agricultural practices challenge the practical implementation of SCS, and our analysis addresses the associated knowledge gap. Previous assessments have focused on global potentials, but there is a need among policymakers to operationalise SCS. Here, we assess a range of practices already proposed to deliver SCS, and distil these into a subset of specific measures. We provide a multidisciplinary summary of the barriers and potential incentives towards practical implementation of these measures. First, we identify specific practices with potential for both a positive impact on SCS at farm level and an uptake rate compatible with global impact. These focus on: (a) optimising crop primary productivity (e.g. nutrient optimisation, pH management, irrigation); (b) reducing soil disturbance and managing soil physical properties (e.g. improved rotations, minimum till); (c) minimising deliberate removal of C or lateral transport via erosion processes (e.g. support measures, bare fallow reduction); (d) addition of C produced outside the system (e.g. organic manure amendments, biochar addition); (e) provision of additional C inputs within the cropping system (e.g. agroforestry, cover cropping). We then consider economic and non-cost barriers and incentives for land managers implementing these measures, along with the potential externalised impacts of implementation. This offers a framework and reference point for holistic assessment of the impacts of SCS. Finally, we summarise and discuss the ability of extant scientific approaches to quantify the technical potential and externalities of SCS measures, and the barriers and incentives to their implementation in global agricultural systems.","[Sykes, Alasdair J.; Macleod, Michael; Eory, Vera; Rees, Robert M.; Payen, Florian] Scotlands Rural Coll SRUC, West Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland; [Payen, Florian; Myrgiotis, Vasilis; Williams, Mathew; Sohi, Saran] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hillier, Jon; Moran, Dominic] Univ Edinburgh, Global Acad Agr & Food Secur, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Manning, David A.

How contemporary extent and severity of wildfires compare to the pre-settlement patterns to which ecosystems are adapted is debated. We compared large wildfires in Pacific Northwest forests from 1984 to 2015 to modeled historic fire regimes. Despite late twentieth-century increases in area burned, we show that Pacific Northwest forests have experienced an order of magnitude less fire over 32 yr than expected under historic fire regimes. Within fires that have burned, severity distributions are disconnected from historical references. From 1984 to 2015, 1.6 M ha burned; this is 13.3-18.9 M ha less than expected. Deficits were greatest in dry forest ecosystems adapted to frequent, low-severity fire, where 72-10.3 M ha of low-severity fire was missing, compared to a 0.2-1.1 M ha deficit of high-severity fire. When these dry forests do burn, we observed that 36% burned with high-severity compared to 6-9% historically. We found smaller fire deficits, 0.3-0.6 M ha, within forest ecosystems adapted to infrequent, high-severity fire. However, we also acknowledge inherent limitations in evaluating contemporary fire regimes in ecosystems which historically burned infrequently and for which fires were highly episodic. The magnitude of contemporary fire deficits and disconnect in burn severity compared to historic fire regimes have important implications for climate change adaptation. Within forests characterized by low- and mixed-severity historic fire regimes, simply increasing wildfire extent while maintaining current trends in burn severity threatens ecosystem resilience and will potentially drive undesirable ecosystem transformations. Restoring natural fire regimes requires management that facilitates much more low- and moderate-severity fire.","[Haugo, Ryan D.; Kellogg, Bryce S.; Kemp, Kerry B.; Robertson, James C.; Metlen, Kerry L.] Nature Conservancy, 821 SE 14th Ave, Portland, OR 97214 USA; [Cansler, C.

MOENCH; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; STRIGA INFESTATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SUDAN SAVANNA; SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; FARMING SYSTEMS,"Declining soil fertility and limited farmer access to inorganic fertilizer frequently cause sub-optimal grain yields throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Farm productivity is also at risk from extreme weather and future climate change. Significant uncertainty remains in predicting climate in Africa, increasing the challenge of planning for climate change adaptation. Sorghum is adapted to African climate patterns and is predicted to maintain widespread suitability across different African climatic zones under climate change. Sorghum's drought tolerance and ability to withstand water logging make it an important crop for maintaining productive agroecosystems under a changing climate. Due to its status as a staple grain, improved sorghum management can provide smallholder farmers with stability in their household nutritional needs. We reviewed sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) yield trends across nutrient management scenarios using meta-analysis. We compared yield across eight nutrient management practices: (i) N-only, (ii) P-only, (iii) N and P, (iv) N and P microdose, (v) legume management, (vi) manure addition, (vii) organic matter (OM) amendment, and (viii) mixed amendment. Our review demonstrated (1) yield improvement considering all scenarios averaged 66 % relative to no nutrient inputs, (2) yield under chemical fertilizer amendment increased by 47-98 % of control yield, (3) yield under organic nutrient amendment increased by 43-87 % of control yield, and (4) the profitability of a management scenario was not solely determined by the magnitude of yield increase. For example, due to the high cost of fertilizer, addition of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) generated the largest yield increase, but the lowest profit, in two of three countries analyzed. In contrast, an edible legume in rotation averaged 43 % yield improvement relative to no nutrient inputs and a net profit of US $146 to $263 per hectare. Facilitating access to both fertilizer inputs and diversified rotations has the greatest potential to increase grain yield in Africa.","[Tonitto, Christina] Cornell Univ, Cornell Int Inst Food Agr & Dev, B75 Mann Lib, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Ricker-Gilbert, Jacob E.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 West State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Cornell University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Tonitto, C (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Cornell Int Inst Food Agr & Dev, B75 Mann Lib, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",ctonitto@cornell.edu; jrickerg@purdue.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,,,,,117,24,26,6,87,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1774-0746,1773-0155,,AGRON SUSTAIN DEV,Agron.

Design/methodology/approach The research design adopted for this study is the cross-sectional survey method. Five research questions guided the study. Two sets of instruments were used for data collection, a sample of 1,258 respondents (0.1%) were selected for the study. The researchers personally administered the instruments and collected the same back, two instruments were not properly filled, so they were rejected. Findings The finding of the study revealed that rural farmers have some level of climate change awareness, which they got from radio, newspapers, awareness campaigns, flyers, billboards, among others. Six out of the nine strategies listed were adopted by the rural farmers to mitigate climate change effects among these rural farmers. There is a significant difference in gender workload burden between women and male in the area, the result is positively skewed toward women, implying that the burden of workload for women increased over those of men. The result also shows that EE can influence their attitude toward climate change through awareness creation, knowledge provisions and also encourage members participation in climate change effect mitigation, prevention and adaptation. Research limitations/implications With this result, EE can be used as a tool for the creation of knowledge, awareness, attitude and encourage the participation of these rural farmers toward mitigating and prevention climate change effects among these rural farmers. It was recommended among others that deliberate policies should be designed to make EE help create the needed awareness on climate change, beginning from the causes, effects and mitigation strategies among rural farmers in their community. Practical implications Already, most Environmental Educators have been trained, the government should design and formulate practical policies to use them as extension agent on climate change effort to go to these rural communities and create the needed awareness, knowledge, skills and attitude to help them combat climate change effects including trees and cover crops planting and also re-introducing the use of irrigation agriculture in these farming communities. Social implications With the creation of awareness, social groups and individuals can also make a social investment from these activities and also improve their social capitals, thereby reducing social burdens and improving their living conditions within the rural settings. Originality/value This research is an original research paper from the effort. the purpose is to assess the extent of climate change awareness level and how the effects of climate change increase or reduces the burden of gender workload among rural farmers and the strategies which can be used by these rural farmers to prevent, mitigate and adapt to climate change effects and the roles EE can play. This study has an original value in the sense that in the course of the study, the study hardly saw articles on these specific variables in whole research, hence the resolve to assess these variables.","[Eneji, Chris-Valentine Ogar; Onnoghen, Nkanu Usang; Diwa, Juliana Bebuo] Univ Calabar, Dept Environm Educ, Calabar, Nigeria; [Acha, Joseph Odama] Univ Calabar, Dept Continuing Educ & Dev Studies, Calabar, Nigeria",University of Calabar; University of Calabar,"Eneji, CVO (corresponding author), Univ Calabar, Dept Environm Educ, Calabar, Nigeria.",vcogareneji@gmail.com,,"ENEJI (PhD), CHRIS-VALENTINE OGAR/0000-0001-9958-4082",,,,,53,2,2,2,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

There are large uncertainties related to unknowns around the future and society's responses to these threats. Uncertainty' as other words with the prefix un' (unknown, untold, unrest) often has negative connotations. Yet, uncertainty is manifested in virtually everything we do. To many in science, uncertainty is akin to error that should be minimised, a lack of knowledge that needs to be rectified. We argue that uncertainty rather should be embraced as a starting point for discussing pathways to climate adaptation. Here we follow a definition of pathways to adaptation' as representing a set of proactive changes in the present that move people from a climatically unsafe place, to positions of safety (self-defined as representing freedom from harm or adverse effect). This article applies an inter-discursive analytical approach where (un)certainty and (un)safety are used to deepen the understanding around the positions of people in Senegal, and their livelihoods, with respect to climate hazards. We examine the discursive socio-cultural values active in the climate adaptive space. Our findings show that people's adaptive decisions often were not based on climate information, but on discursive values and emotions that guided them in the direction of responses that felt right. We conclude that acknowledging different understandings and perceptions of uncertainty, and the goal of achieving safety, allows issues of power to be discussed. We contend that this process helps illuminate how to navigate pathways of adaptation to the impacts of climate variability and change.","[Ayeb-Karlsson, Sonja] Univ Sussex, BSMS, Room 308,Arts Bldg C,Arts Rd, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England; [Ayeb-Karlsson, Sonja] United Nat Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, Bonn, Germany; [Fox, Gino; Kniveton, Dominic] Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Dept Geog, Brighton BN1 9QJ, E Sussex, England",University of Brighton; University of Sussex; University of Sussex,"Ayeb-Karlsson, S (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, BSMS, Room 308,Arts Bldg C,Arts Rd, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England.;Ayeb-Karlsson, S (corresponding author), United Nat Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, Bonn, Germany.",S.Ayeb-Karlsson@sussex.ac.uk; G.Fox@sussex.ac.uk; D.R.Kniveton@sussex.ac.uk,,"Ayeb-Karlsson, Dr Sonja/0000-0001-6124-2730",Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC); Department for International Development (DFID) under the Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) programme [NE/M02024X/1]; AMMA-2050 project [NEC05274]; NERC [NE/M020428/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Department for International Development (DFID) under the Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) programme; AMMA-2050 project; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This research was partly funded by the Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC) and Department for International Development (DFID) under the Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) programme (NE/M02024X/1).

This has led to a growing interest among political scientists investigating the European Parliament's ability to negotiate such ambitious climate legislation. These studies generally focus on the voting behaviour of members of the European Parliament, which allows us to know more about their positions when it comes to accepting or rejecting legislative acts. However, we know surprisingly little about how they debate and justify their positions in Parliament. In these debates, members of the European Parliament not only identify the problem (i.e., climate change and its adverse effects) but also discuss potential solutions (i.e., their willingness or ambition to fight and adapt to climate change). In addition, plenary debates are ideal for making representative claims based on citizens' interests on climate action. Therefore, this article aims to understand how climate policy ambitions are debated in the European Parliament and whose interests are represented. We propose a new manual coding scheme for climate policy ambitions in parliamentary debate and employ it in climate policy debates in the ninth European Parliament (2019-present). In doing so, this article makes a methodological contribution to operationalising climate policy ambition from a parliamentary representation and legitimation perspective. We find debating patterns that connect quite detailed ambitions with clear representative claims and justifications. There is more agreement on what to do than how to get there, with divides emerging based on party, ideological, and member-state characteristics.","[Kinski, Lucy; Servent, Ariadna Ripoll] Univ Salzburg, Salzburg Ctr European Union Studies, Salzburg, Austria",Salzburg University,"Kinski, L (corresponding author), Univ Salzburg, Salzburg Ctr European Union Studies, Salzburg, Austria.",lucy.kinski@plus.ac.at,,"Kinski, Lucy/0000-0003-1995-3656; Ripoll Servent, Ariadna/0000-0002-1399-6535",,,,,47,1,1,5,5,COGITATIO PRESS,LISBON,"RUA FIALHO ALMEIDA 14, 2 ESQ, LISBON, 1070-129, PORTUGAL",2183-2463,,,POLITICS GOV,Politics Gov.,,2022,10,3,,,,,251,263,,10.17645/pag.v10i3.5479,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/pag.v10i3.5479,,,13,Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Government & Law,4Y1SM,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000861312100008,View Full Record in Web of Science

We used the object-oriented classification method with the maximum likelihood algorithm to classify six types of land uses. The series of land-use maps we produced had an overall accuracy of more than 80%. We then conducted a spatial analysis of the 5-year land-use change using ArcGIS software. In addition, we surveyed 150 farm households using a structured questionnaire regarding the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and land uses, as well as farmers' adaptation and responses. The results showed that from 2005 to 2020, cropland decreased, while aquaculture land and forest land increased. We observed that the most remarkable decreases were in the area of rice (485.58 ha), the area of perennial crops (109.7 ha), and the area of non-agricultural land (747.35 ha). The area of land used for aquaculture and forest increased by 566.88 ha and 772.60 ha, respectively. We found that the manifestations of climate change, such as extreme weather events, saltwater intrusion, drought, and floods, have had a profound impact on agricultural production and land uses in the district, especially for annual crops and aquaculture. The results provide useful information for state authorities to design land-management strategies and solutions that are economic and effective in adapting to climate change.","[Nong, Duong H.; Ngo, An T.; Nguyen, Thuy T.; Nguyen, Lan T.] Vietnam Natl Univ Agr, Fac Nat Resources & Environm, Hanoi 131001, Vietnam; [Nguyen, Hoa P.

Soil moisture variability has a direct impact on agriculture, water security and ecosystem services. Nevertheless, there is currently little information on how soil moisture across different biomes responds to drought. In this study, we used satellite soil moisture data from the European Space Agency, from 2009 to 2015, to analyze differences in soil moisture responses to drought for each biome of Brazil: Amazon, Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, Cerrado, Pampa and Pantanal. We found an overall soil moisture decline of -0.5% yr(-1) (p < 0.01) at the national level. At the biome level, Caatinga presented the most severe soil moisture decline (-4.4% yr(-1)), whereas the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado biomes showed no significant trend. The Amazon biome showed no trend but had a sharp reduction of soil moisture from 2013 to 2015. In contrast, the Pampa and Pantanal biomes presented a positive trend (1.6% yr(-1) and 4.3% yr(-1), respectively). These trends are consistent with vegetation productivity trends across each biome. This information provides insights into drought risk reduction and soil conservation activities to minimize the impact of drought in the most vulnerable biomes. Furthermore, improving our understanding of soil moisture trends during periods of drought is crucial to enhance the national drought early warning system and develop customized strategies for adaptation to climate change in each biome.","[Ribeiro, Flavio Lopes] Univ Delaware, Disaster Res Ctr, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Guevara, Mario; Vazquez-Lule, Alma; Vargas, Rodrigo] Univ Delaware, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Newark, DE 19717 USA; [Cunha, Ana Paula; Zeri, Marcelo] Natl Ctr Monitoring & Early Warning Nat Disasters, Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil; [Guevara, Mario] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Environm Sci, 900 Univ Ave, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Guevara, Mario] ARS, US Salin Lab, USDA, 450 West Big Springs Rd, Riverside, CA 92507 USA",University of Delaware; University of Delaware; University of California System; University of California Riverside; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Ribeiro, FL (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Disaster Res Ctr, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Newark, DE 19716 USA.;Guevara, M (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Newark, DE 19717 USA.;Guevara, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Environm Sci, 900 Univ Ave, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.;Guevara, M (corresponding author), ARS, US Salin Lab, USDA, 450 West Big Springs Rd, Riverside, CA 92507 USA.",flavio.psi@hotmail.com; mguevara@ucr.edu,"Vargas, Rodrigo/C-4720-2008; Guevara, Mario/AAH-9539-2019; Cunha, Ana Paula M.

Projected changes in heat stress in rice provide an assessment of the potential impact on crop production and can direct measures for adaptation to climate change. In this study, we calculated heat stress indices using statistical scaling techniques, which can efficiently downscale output from general circulation models (GCMs). Data across the rice belt in southern China were obtained from 28 GCMs in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) with two emissions scenarios (RCP4.5 for current emissions and RCP8.5 for increasing emissions). Multi-model ensemble projections over the historical period (1960-2010) reproduced the trend of observations in heat stress indices (root-mean-square error RMSE = 6.5 days) better than multi-model arithmetic mean (RMSE 8.9 days) and any individualGCM(RMSE 11.4 days). The frequency of heat stress events was projected to increase by 2061-2100 in both scenarios (up to 185 and 319% for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively), especially in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. This increasing risk of exposure to heat stress above 30 degrees C during flowering and grain filling is predicted to impact rice production. The results of our study suggest the importance of specific adaption or mitigation strategies, such as selection of heat-tolerant cultivars and adjustment of planting date in a warmer future world.","[He, Liang] Natl Meteorol Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Cleverly, James; Yu, Qiang] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, POB 123 Broadway, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Cleverly, James; Liu, De Li] Wagga Wagga Agr Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2650, Australia; [Jin, Ning; Yu, Qiang] Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Mi, Chunrong] Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yu, Qiang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","University of Technology Sydney; NSW Department of Primary Industries; Northwest A&F University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","He, L (corresponding author), Natl Meteorol Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",heliang@cma.gov.cn,", De Li Liu/Y-4656-2019; Yu, Qiang/D-3702-2009; Cleverly, Jamie Rose/L-2134-2016; Wang, Bin/AFI-6568-2022","Yu, Qiang/0000-0001-6950-1821; Cleverly, Jamie Rose/0000-0002-2731-7150; Wang, Bin/0000-0002-6422-5802; He, Liang/0000-0002-4234-5782; Liu, De Li/0000-0003-2574-1908",Talent Project Plan (Thousand Talents Program) in Northwest AF University; Special Fund for Public Welfare Industry (Meteorology) [GYHY201506001]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41371119],Talent Project Plan (Thousand Talents Program) in Northwest AF University; Special Fund for Public Welfare Industry (Meteorology); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the Talent Project Plan (Thousand Talents Program) in Northwest A&F University, Special Fund for Public Welfare Industry (Meteorology, No. GYHY201506001), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41371119).",,40,39,41,1,66,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

This study documents Sereer farmers' observations of local environmental changes in the Fatick region of Senegal and explores how the farmers use crop diversity to adapt to those changes. Their observations of environmental changes were documented through focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews. Variations in crop diversity, as well as farmers' explanations for these variations, were assessed through surveys in two villages (n = 126 households). Sereer farmers identify four distinct periods of similar climate trends and reported how they managed crop diversity in response to the climate variations between periods. Three management responses stand out: 1) abandonment of long-cycle varieties during drought periods, 2) adoption of short-cycle varieties during periods with shorter rainy seasons, and 3) reinstating of long-cycle varieties with the return of rains. Sereer farmers consider that climate variations are important reasons to modify their crop varieties, although variety selection is also affected by other socio-economic and cultural reasons. This study illustrates the contributions that local knowledge can bring to understanding the local impact of climate change on smallholder farmers. Understanding how they use crop diversity to adapt to climate variations can be the basis of climate change adaptation policies that address local needs and constraints.","[Ruggieri, Faustine; Labeyrie, Vanesse] CIRAD, UMR SENS, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Labeyrie, Vanesse] Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, SENS, IRD,UPVM, Montpellier, France; [Porcuna-Ferrer, Anna; Reyes-Garcia, Victoria] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Barcelona, Spain; [Gaudin, Alexandre] AgroParisTech, Montpellier Rech Management, Montpellier, France; [Faye, Ndeye Fatou] Inst Senegalais Rech Agr, Bur Anal Macroecon, Dakar, Senegal; [Reyes-Garcia, Victoria] Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats ICREA, Barcelona, Spain",CIRAD; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Autonomous University of Barcelona; AgroParisTech; Universite de Montpellier; ICREA,"Labeyrie, V (corresponding author), CIRAD, UMR SENS, F-34398 Montpellier, France.;Labeyrie, V (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, SENS, IRD,UPVM, Montpellier, France.",vanesse.labeyrie@cirad.fr,"Labeyrie, Vanesse/AAF-7767-2021","Porcuna Ferrer, Anna/0000-0003-3887-9914; Ruggieri, Faustine/0000-0003-4474-8339","Agropolis Fondation under Investissements d'avenir program (Labex Agro) [ANR-10-LABX-0001-01, 1603-002]; European Research Council under an ERC Consolidator Grant [FP7-771056LICCI]; Niakhar Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS)",Agropolis Fondation under Investissements d'avenir program (Labex Agro)(French National Research Agency (ANR)); European Research Council under an ERC Consolidator Grant; Niakhar Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS),"We thank Robert Diatte for helping with surveys, translation, and guiding us during fieldwork.

However, in a local context such as in mountain regions of the developing world different water risks are intertwined and shaped by multi-dimensional natural and socio-economic drivers. Progressing glacier melt and the associated growing number of lakes rises the threat of glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs); at the same time declining melt water supply changes the hydrological regime, resulting in changing water availability, especially during dry seasons. Here, we address this challenge by integratively assessing water scarcity and GLOF risks and their interactions for two study sites in glacierized catchments in the Cordillera Blanca and Urubamba in the Peruvian Andes. We used hydrological modelling, GLOF flow path modelling, and interviews with local people and technical experts to assess the hazard and risks of water scarcity and GLOFs. We incorporate perspectives of people living in those areas in order to gain a more comprehensive view on risks. While metrics of flood and water scarcity hazards are difficult to compare, we found insightful results using a comparative analysis of elements at risk from different water related hazards with different probabilities of occurrence. Furthermore, our study shows that considering the diverse local perspectives on risks as well as the social, cultural, economic and political context is essential to more successful and sustainable disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation and integrated water management.","[Motschmann, Alina; Huggel, Christian; Munoz, Randy; Thuer, Angela] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Motschmann, A (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",alina.motschmann@geo.uzh.ch,,"Munoz, Randy/0000-0001-6797-3999; Motschmann, Alina/0000-0003-3822-3878",Swiss National Science Foundation [205121L_166272],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This study has been funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation by the Project AguaFuturo (project no. 205121L_166272), within this study has been written.

The uptake of small grains has been very low among smallholder farmers in climate change affected districts in Zimbabwe in spite of expert advice. The paper seeks to interrogate this refusal by smallholder farmers to adapt through small grains. Data were collected using fifty (50) in-depth semi-structured interviews and five (5) key informant interviews in Tsholotsho, Zimbabwe to understand why smallholder farmers are not shifting to small grains production en masse in response to climate change to address food insecurity gaps. The paper finds that there are a plethora of reasons leading to the non-adoption of small grains as a climate change adaptation strategy. The explanations vary. The paper thematically provided a critical overview and analysis of the attitude of smallholder farmers on small grains cultivation. The literature systematically selected, provided a wide coverage of the small grains production value chain. The narratives of farmers through interviews reveal their lived experiences and attitudes on small grains. This paper provides a new understanding of why small grains programming has not been successful in Zimbabwe over the years. The paper recommends that the government takes practical steps to enhance the uptake of small grains production through assisting farmers by training and funding projects of such nature for resilience building.","[Phiri, Keith] Univ Ft Hare, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, 50 Church St, East London, South Africa; [Dube, Thulani] Lupane State Univ, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Lupane, Zimbabwe; [Moyo, Philani] Ft Hare Inst Social & Econ Res, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, East London, South Africa; [Ncube, Cornelius; Ndlovu, Sibonokuhle] Lupane State Univ, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Dev Studies, Lupane, Zimbabwe",University of Fort Hare,"Phiri, K (corresponding author), Univ Ft Hare, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, 50 Church St, East London, South Africa.",kephirih@gmail.com; thutsdube@gmail.com; Pmoyo@ufh.ac.za; corneliasncube@gmail.com; boomagwala@gmail.com,"Phiri, Keith/AAY-7662-2021; Dube, Thulani/AAZ-3082-2021","Phiri, Keith/0000-0003-0356-3338; Dube, Thulani/0000-0002-8919-9989; Ndlovu, Sibonokuhle/0000-0002-0917-6956; Moyo, Philani/0000-0002-9089-7565; Ncube, Cornelias/0000-0002-6958-8389",,,,,50,8,8,1,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1886,,,COGENT SOC SCI,Cogent Soc.

We have previously argued that water resources planning should focus upon metrics of risk of water restrictions, accompanied by extensive simulation and scenario-based exploration of uncertainty. However, the results of optimization subject to risk constraints can be sensitive to the specification of tolerable risk, which may not be precisely or consistently defined by different stakeholders. In this paper, we recast the water resources planning problem as a multiobjective optimization problem to identify least cost schemes that satisfy a set of criteria for tolerable risk, where tolerable risk is defined in terms of the frequency of water use restrictions of different levels of severity. Our proposed method links a very large ensemble of climate model projections to a water resource system model and a multiobjective optimization algorithm to identify a Pareto optimal set of water resource management plans across a 25 years planning period. In a case study application to the London water supply system, we identify water resources management plans that, for a given financial cost, maximize performance with respect to one or more probabilistic criteria. This illustrates trade-offs between financial costs of plans and risk, and between risk criteria for four different severities of water use restrictions. Graphical representation of alternative sequences of investments in the Pareto set helps to identify water management options for which there is a robust case for including them in the plan.","[Borgomeo, Edoardo; Mortazavi-Naeini, Mohammad; Hall, Jim W.] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England; [O'Sullivan, Michael J.] Univ Auckland, Engn Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Watson, Tim] ICS Consulting Ltd, Little Smeaton, N Yorkshire, England",University of Oxford; University of Auckland,"Borgomeo, E (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England.",edoardo.borgomeo@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Parween, Shama/AFQ-4232-2022; Hall, Jim W/ABF-1407-2020; OSullivan, Mike/AAK-4034-2020","Hall, Jim W/0000-0002-2024-9191; OSullivan, Mike/0000-0002-5621-4206; Borgomeo, Edoardo/0000-0002-8351-9064","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Environment Agency [SC120053]; Thames Water; Natural Environment Research Council (MaRIUS: Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of droughts and water Scarcity) [NE/L010364/1]; NERC [NE/L010364/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/L010364/1] Funding Source: researchfish","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Environment Agency; Thames Water; Natural Environment Research Council (MaRIUS: Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of droughts and water Scarcity); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","Edoardo Borgomeo is funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the Environment Agency (science project SC120053), and Thames Water.

Machine learning (ML) allows for high resolution modeling of the water table depth beyond the capabilities of conventional numerical physically-based hydrological models with respect to spatial resolution and overall accuracy. For this, in-situ well and proxy observations are used as training data in combination with high resolution covariates. The objective of this study is to model the depth of the uppermost water table for a typical summer and winter condition at 10 m spatial resolution over entire Denmark (43,000 km(2)). CatBoost, a state of the art implementation of gradient boosting decision trees, is employed in this study to model the water table depth and the associated uncertainties. The groundwater domain has not been the most prominent field of applications of recent hydrological ML advances due to the lack of big data. This study brings forward a novel knowledge-guided ML framework to overcome this limitation by integrating simulation results from a physically-based groundwater flow model. The simulation data are utilized to (1) identify wells that represent the uppermost water table, (2) augment missing training data by accounting for simulated water level seasonality, and (3) expand the list of covariates. The curated training dataset contains around 13,000 wells, 19,000 groundwater proxy observations at lakes, streams and coastline as well as 15 covariates. Cross validation attests that the ML model generalizes well with a mean absolute error of around 115 cm considering solely well observations and a MAE of <50 cm taking also the proxy observations into consideration. Quantile regression is applied to estimate confidence intervals and the estimated uncertainty is largest for moraine clay soils that are characterized with a distinct geological heterogeneity. This study highlights a novel research avenue of knowledge-guided ML for the groundwater domain by efficiently supporting a ML model with a physically-based hydrological model to predict the depth of the water table at unprecedented spatial detail and accuracy.","[Koch, Julian; Gotfredsen, Jane; Schneider, Raphael; Troldborg, Lars; Stisen, Simon; Henriksen, Hans Jorgen] Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland, Dept Hydrol, Copenhagen, Denmark",Geological Survey Of Denmark & Greenland,"Koch, J (corresponding author), Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland, Dept Hydrol, Copenhagen, Denmark.",juko@geus.dk,"Schneider, Raphael/H-7499-2018; Koch, Julian/D-2509-2015","Schneider, Raphael/0000-0001-9628-0809; Koch, Julian/0000-0002-7732-3436; Henriksen, Hans Jorgen/0000-0003-4821-5310",Danish Digitalization Strategy (FODS) through the HIP (Hydrological Informationand Prognosis-system) project,Danish Digitalization Strategy (FODS) through the HIP (Hydrological Informationand Prognosis-system) project,The study has been funded by the Danish Digitalization Strategy (FODS) through the HIP (Hydrological Informationand Prognosis-system) project related to FODS 6.1.,,58,6,6,5,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9375,,FRONT WATER,Front.

Within the framework of the United Nations (UN) sustainable development goals established in 2015, the solution to poverty and inequality thus comes into conflict with climate change mitigation. The existing international system of climate regulation does not address this contradiction. Today, global climate governance relies on estimates of aggregate emissions by countries without considering their level of development and the distribution of emissions among income groups within each country. Emissions from production are being monitored, while consumption-related emissions, albeit known to experts, rarely underlie decision-making. Meanwhile, income distribution has a higher impact on consumption-based emissions in comparison to production-based ones. Decisions on emissions regulation are made at the national level by countries with different development agendas in which climate change mitigation often gets less priority in comparison to other socio-economic objectives. This paper proposes a set of principles and specific mechanisms that can link climate change and inequality within a single policy framework. First, we highlight the need to modify the global emission monitoring system for the sake of accounting for emissions from consumption (rather than production) by income groups. Second, we suggest the introduction of a new redistribution system to address climate change which would include the imposition of a fine on households with the highest levels of emissions. Such a system follows the principles of progressive taxation but supports climate mitigation objectives and should be understood not as taxation of high incomes but rather as payment for a negative externality. Third, we outline the need to adjust climate finance criteria; priority should be given to projects designed to reduce carbon-intensive consumption by social groups entering the middle class, or to help the poorest population groups adapt to climate change. A special role in the implementation of these principles may belong to BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), which may view this as an opportunity for a proactive transition to inclusive, low-carbon development.","[Grigoryev, L.; Makarov, I] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Sch World Econ, 20 Myasnitskaya, Moscow 101000, Russia; [Sokolova, A.] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Ctr Comprehens European & Int Studies, 20 Myasnitskaya, Moscow 101000, Russia; [Pavlyushina, V; Stepanov, I] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Lab Climate Change Econ, 20 Myasnitskaya, Moscow 101000, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Grigoryev, L (corresponding author), Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Sch World Econ, 20 Myasnitskaya, Moscow 101000, Russia.",lgrigor1@yandex.ru; imakarov@hse.ru; aksokolova@hse.ru; pa_victoria@mail.ru; iastepanov@hse.ru,"Makarov, Igor/F-5594-2017","Makarov, Igor/0000-0001-8183-4215",,,,,42,4,5,4,17,NATL RESEARCH UNIV HIGHER SCH ECONOMICS,MOSCOW,"SHABOLOVKA, 26, MOSCOW, 119049, RUSSIA",1996-7845,,,VESTN MEZHDUNARODNYK,Vestn.

Exploring the impacts of climate change on crop evapotranspiration (ET) is of importance for water management and agricultural sustainability. The VIP (Vegetation Interface Processes) process-based ecosystem model and WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) modeling system are applied to quantify ET responses of a wheat-maize cropping system to climate change. The ensemble projections of six General Circulation Models (GCMs) under the B2 and A2 scenarios in the 2050s over the NCP are used to account for the uncertainty of the projections. The thermal time requirements (TTR) of crops are assumed to remain constant under air warming conditions. It is found that in this case the length of the crop growth period will be shortened, which will result in the reduction of crop water consumption and possible crop productivity loss. Spatially, the changes of ET during the growth periods (ETg) for wheat range from -7 to 0 % with the average being -1.5 +/- 1.2 % under the B2 scenario, and from -8 to 2 % with the average being -2.7 +/- 1.3 % under the A2 scenario/consistently, changes of ETg for maize are from -10 to 8 %, with the average being -0.4 +/- 4.9 %, under the B2 scenario and from -8 to 8 %, with the average being -1.2 +/- 4.1 %, under the A2 scenario. Numerical analysis is also done on the condition that the length of the crop growth periods remains stable under the warming condition via breeding new crop varieties. In this case, TTR will be higher and the crop water requirements will increase, with the enhancement of the productivity. It is suggested that the options for adaptation to climate change include no action and accepting crop loss associated with the reduction in ETg, or breeding new cultivars that would maintain or increase crop productivity and result in an increase in ETg. In the latter case, attention should be paid to developing improved water conservation techniques to help compensate for the increased ETg.","[Mo, Xingguo; Guo, Ruiping; Liu, Suxia; Lin, Zhonghui; Hu, Shi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Guo, Ruiping] Minist Environm Protect, Nucl & Radiat Safety Ctr, Beijing 100082, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Mo, XG (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",moxg@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Hu, Shi/ABE-4524-2021","Hu, Shi/0000-0002-3550-4538; LIN, Zhonghui/0000-0002-1793-9714","Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology Projects [2010CB428404]; Natural Science Foundation of China [31171451]; Key Project for the Strategic Science Plan in IGSNRR, CAS [2012ZD003]; Sino-US PhD joint-training program","Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology Projects; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Project for the Strategic Science Plan in IGSNRR, CAS; Sino-US PhD joint-training program","This study was jointly supported by the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology Projects (2010CB428404), the Natural Science Foundation of China grants (31171451), and the Key Project for the Strategic Science Plan in IGSNRR, CAS (2012ZD003), Thanks to Prof. Zongliang Yang at the University of Arizona, USA for his support in using WRF system when the second co-author was working with him supported by Sino-US PhD joint-training program.

Eco-environmental health, which refers to the interdependencies between ecological systems and population health and well-being, is likely to be significantly influenced by climate change. The aim of this study was to examine perceptions from government stakeholders and other relevant specialists about the threat of climate change, their capacity to deal with it, and how to develop and implement a framework for assessing vulnerability of eco-environmental health to climate change. Methods: Two focus groups were conducted in Brisbane, Australia with representatives from relevant government agencies, non-governmental organisations, and the industry sector (n = 15) involved in the discussions. The participants were specialists on climate change and public health from governmental agencies, industry, and non-governmental organisations in South-East Queensland. Results: The specialists perceived climate change to be a threat to eco-environmental health and had substantial knowledge about possible implications and impacts. A range of different methods for assessing vulnerability were suggested by the participants and the complexity of assessment when dealing with multiple hazards was acknowledged. Identified factors influencing vulnerability were perceived to be of a social, physical and/or economic nature. They included population growth, the ageing population with associated declines in general health and changes in the vulnerability of particular geographical areas due to for example, increased coastal development, and financial stress. Education, inter-sectoral collaboration, emergency management (e. g. development of early warning systems), and social networks were all emphasised as a basis for adapting to climate change. To develop a framework, different approaches were discussed for assessing eco-environmental health vulnerability, including literature reviews to examine the components of vulnerability such as natural hazard risk and exposure and to investigate already existing frameworks for assessing vulnerability. Conclusion: The study has addressed some important questions in regard to government stakeholders and other specialists' views on the threat of climate change and its potential impacts on eco-environmental health. These findings may have implications in climate change and public health decision-making.","[Strand, Linn B.; Tong, Shilu; Aird, Rosemary] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Publ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia; [Strand, Linn B.; Tong, Shilu] Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia; [McRae, David] Queensland Govt, Queensland Climate Change Ctr Excellence, Dept Environm & Resource Management, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Queensland; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Tong, SL (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Publ Hlth, Victoria Pk Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia.",s.tong@qut.edu.au,,,Australian Research Council [LP0776918]; NHMRC [553043]; Australian Research Council [LP0776918] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); NHMRC(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),The authors would like to thank all of those people who took part in the focus group discussions.

Knowledge of the range and geographical context of expected climate change impacts on disease transmission and spread, combined with knowledge of effective adaptation strategies and responses, can help to identify gaps and best practices to mitigate future health impacts. To investigate the types of evidence for impacts of climate change on two major mosquito-borne diseases of global health importance, malaria and dengue, and to identify the range of relevant policy responses and adaptation strategies that have been devised, we performed a scoping review of published review literature. Three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus and Epistemonikos) were systematically searched for relevant published reviews. Inclusion criteria were: reviews with a systematic search, from 2007 to 2020, in English or French, that addressed climate change impacts and/or adaptation strategies related to malaria and/or dengue. Data extracted included: characteristics of the article, type of review, disease(s) of focus, geographic focus, and nature of the evidence. The evidence was summarized to identify and compare regional evidence for climate change impacts and adaptation measures. Results A total of 32 reviews met the inclusion criteria. Evidence for the impacts of climate change (including climate variability) on dengue was greatest in the Southeast Asian region, while evidence for the impacts of climate change on malaria was greatest in the African region, particularly in highland areas. Few reviews explicitly addressed the implementation of adaptation strategies to address climate change-driven disease transmission, however suggested strategies included enhanced surveillance, early warning systems, predictive models and enhanced vector control. Conclusions There is strong evidence for the impacts of climate change, including climate variability, on the transmission and future spread of malaria and dengue, two of the most globally important vector-borne diseases. Further efforts are needed to develop multi-sectoral climate change adaptation strategies to enhance the capacity and resilience of health systems and communities, especially in regions with predicted climatic suitability for future emergence and re-emergence of malaria and dengue. This scoping review may serve as a useful precursor to inform future systematic reviews of the primary literature.","[Kulkarni, Manisha A.; Duguay, Claudia; Ost, Katarina] Univ Ottawa, Sch Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Kulkarni, MA (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Sch Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",Manisha.kulkarni@uottawa.ca,"Ost, Katarina/ABE-4307-2021","Ost, Katarina/0000-0001-9688-4979",,,,,48,4,4,7,19,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1744-8603,,GLOBALIZATION HEALTH,Global.

With the release of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), 24 GCMs from CMIP5 and CMIP6 were comparatively evaluated for precipitation and air temperature simulations based on the China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD). Rank score results showed that CMIP6 models generally performed better than CMIP5 for precipitation and surface air temperature over the TP. According to multimodel ensembles (MMEs) of the optimal GCMs for each climate variable, the overestimation of precipitation was both present in CMIP5 and CMIP6, but the results of CMIP6 MMEs were relatively lower in the mid-west and northern edge of the TP. Furthermore, CMIP6 offered a better performance of precipitation in summer and autumn. For temperature, CMIP6 MMEs were able to reduce the relatively large cold bias that appeared in CMIP5 MMEs in northwest areas to about 1 degrees C and had a smaller bias in spring and winter. Moreover, the investigation into the simulation effects of precipitation at different elevation zones demonstrated that the improved ability of CMIP6 MMEs to reduce bias was mainly concentrated in the elevation zones of 2,000-3,000 m and over 5,000 m, where the precipitation bias was more than 200%. Additionally, CMIP6 MMEs of temperature were able to reduce the bias to less than 2 degrees C in each elevation zone, with the minimum bias of -0.22 degrees C distributed in the region with altitudes from 3,000 to 4,000 m, while the biases of CMIP5 MMEs in the region of 4,000-5,000 m and over 5,000 m were smaller than those of CMIP6 MMEs. Findings obtained in this study could provide a scientific reference for related climate change research over the TP. GCMs of CMIP6 perform better than those of CMIP5 for precipitation and temperature over the TP. Multimodel ensembles (MMEs) of CMIP6 effectively reduce the overestimation of precipitation from CMIP5 MMEs by 40 mm at the annual scale. Improved ability of CMIP6 MMEs shows a significant elevation dependency, especially in elevation zones of 2,000-3,000 m and over 5,000 m for precipitation.","[Lun, Yurui; Liu, Liu] China Agr Univ, Coll Water Resources & Civil Engn, 17 Tsinghua East Rd, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Liu] China Agr Univ, Ctr Agr Water Res China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Lei] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Lei] Hubei Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Water Resources, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Lei] Wuhan Univ, Hubei Prov Key Lab Water Syst Sci Sponge City Con, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiuping] Chinese Acad China, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Hao] Univ Ghent, Lab Hydrol & Water Management, Ghent, Belgium; [Xu, Zongxue] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Water Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Zongxue] Beijing Key Lab Urban Hydrol Cycle & Sponge City, Beijing, Peoples R China","China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University; Wuhan University; Wuhan University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Ghent University; Beijing Normal University","Liu, L (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Water Resources & Civil Engn, 17 Tsinghua East Rd, Beijing, Peoples R China.",liuliu@cau.edu.cn,,"Cheng, Lei/0000-0002-5298-9573; Liu, Liu/0000-0002-4915-206X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51961145104, 52079138, 91647202]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 51961145104, 52079138, 91647202",,63,40,45,55,220,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

It is linked to decreased vegetation cover, high proportions of artificial impervious surfaces, and high proportions of anthropogenic heat discharge. We evaluated the surface heat balance to clarify the contribution of anthropogenic heat discharges into the urban thermal environment. We used a heat balance model and satellite images (Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images acquired in 1989 and 2001), together with meteorological station data to assess the urban thermal environment in the city of Fuzhou, China. The objective of this study was to estimate the anthropogenic heat discharge in the form of sensible heat flux in complex urban environments. In order to increase the accuracy of the anthropogenic heat flux analysis, the sub-pixel fractional vegetation cover (FVC) was calculated by linear spectral unmixing. The results were then used to estimate latent heat flux in urban areas and to separate anthropogenic heat discharge from heat radiation due to insolation. Spatial and temporal distributions of anthropogenic heat flux were analysed as a function of land-cover type, percentage of impervious surface area, and FVC. The accuracy of heat fluxes was assessed using the ratios of sensible heat flux (H), latent heat flux (L), and ground heat flux (G) to net radiation (R-n), which were compared to the results from other studies. It is apparent that the contribution of anthropogenic heat is smaller in suburban areas and larger in high-density urban areas. However, seasonal disparities of anthropogenic heat discharge are small, and the variance of anthropogenic heat discharge is influenced by urban expansion, land-cover change, and increasing energy consumption. The results suggest that anthropogenic heat release probably plays a significant role in the UHI effect, and must be considered in urban climate change adaptation strategies. Remote sensing can play a role in mapping the spatial and temporal patterns of UHIs and can differentiate the anthropogenic heat from the solar radiative fluxes. The findings presented here have important implications for urban development planning.","[Zhang, Youshui; Wu, Xiongchang] Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Geog, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China; [Balzter, Heiko] Univ Leicester, Ctr Landscape & Climate Res, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Balzter, Heiko] Univ Leicester, Dept Geog, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",Fujian Normal University; University of Leicester; University of Leicester,"Zhang, YS (corresponding author), Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Geog, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China.",zhangyoushui@sina.com,"Balzter, Heiko/B-5976-2008","Balzter, Heiko/0000-0002-9053-4684",,,,,50,22,22,1,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0143-1161,1366-5901,,INT J REMOTE SENS,Int.

However, in most adaptation actions, risks such as greenhouse gas emissions, and those that impose negative externalities on global communities and ecosystems, are often overlooked. This article contextualises adaptation of maize stover (MS) as a dairy cattle feed among resource-poor farmers in western Kenya. In so doing, it attempts to establish the nexus between resource constraint and maladaptation to climate change. Simulation of methane emissions was carried out from secondary data and a survey of dairy cattle feeding strategies by resource-poor farmers. The level of greenhouse gas emissions in dairy feeding strategies is used as a measure and indicator of sustainability. Using disaster risk reduction principles, policymakers and community of practice in climate change action are encouraged to design and implement policies and strategies that take cognisance of poverty-maladaptation-environmental degradation nexus.","[Volenzo, Tom E.; Odiyo, John O.] Univ Venda, Sch Environm Sci, Dept Hydrol & Water Resources, Thohoyandou, South Africa; [Obiri, John] Masinde Muliro Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Disaster Management & Sustainable Dev, Kakamega, Kenya",University of Venda,"Volenzo, TE (corresponding author), Univ Venda, Sch Environm Sci, Dept Hydrol & Water Resources, Thohoyandou, South Africa.",volenztom@gmail.com,"Obiri, John/GLT-7807-2022",,"University of Venda; National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation (Nacosti)","University of Venda; National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation (Nacosti)","The authors thank the University of Venda for sponsoring the postdoctoral studies and the National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation (Nacosti) providing funds for field work at the Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology.",,49,3,3,0,14,AFRICAN CENTRE DISASTER STUDIES,POTCHEFSTROOM,"INTERNAL BOX 265, NORTH-WEST UNIV, PRIVATE BAG X6001, POTCHEFSTROOM, 2520, SOUTH AFRICA",1996-1421,2072-845X,,JAMBA-J DISASTER RIS,Jamba-J.

In the Philippines, climate change related extreme weather events such as typhoons, floods, and droughts have detrimental impacts on crop production and have significantly affected the livelihoods of cash crop focused rural villages. A shift from crop to livestock production is emerging as a buffer activity to recover from crop losses; however, whether this adaptive response is viable is still unexplored. The aim of this study is to understand how farmers perceive water buffalo as a transformative opportunity and how they use water buffalo in the adaptation process to sustain their livelihoods when the climate becomes more volatile. Data were collected from farming villages in the Nueva Ecija province, the Philippines using mixed methods. It was found that farmers' livelihood patterns evolved as economic consequences of recurrent crop failures caused by typhoons, flooding, and dry spells. Farmers' changed their farming activities as an adaptive response driven by past experiences of climatic changes, farmers' social relations, household capacity, and resources available. The increasing trend of shifting to water buffalo dairying demonstrated farmers' preferences for less risky sources of income in lieu of the opportunities and options available. Thus, local adaptation can be understood to be an outcome of both farmers' livelihood survival strategies and the institutional dynamics in their localities. The results imply a need to integrate adaptation programs that are linked to local livelihood development, particularly in the Carabao Development Program (CDP). This study concludes by suggesting issues to be considered for water buffalo dairying as a viable adaptation option for climate-resilient livelihoods.","[Escarcha, Jacquelyn F.; Lassa, Jonatan A.; Zander, Kerstin K.] Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Palacpac, Eric P.] Philippine Carabao Ctr, Natl Headquarters & Gene Pool 3120 Sci City Munoz, Nueva Ecija, Philippines; [Zander, Kerstin K.] German Dev Inst, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Charles Darwin University; Philippine Carabao Center; Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE),"Escarcha, JF (corresponding author), Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia.",jacquelyn_escarcha@yahoo.com,"Lassa, Jonatan/M-6112-2019; Lassa, Jonatan/D-2205-2017; Zander, Kerstin/M-2888-2013","Lassa, Jonatan/0000-0002-8432-842X; Lassa, Jonatan/0000-0002-8432-842X; Escarcha, Jacquelyn/0000-0003-4607-2117; Zander, Kerstin/0000-0002-2237-1801; Palacpac, Eric/0000-0003-3674-2113","Charles Darwin University, Australia","Charles Darwin University, Australia","This research was conducted as part of a PhD project financially supported by Charles Darwin University, Australia.

Researchers suggest this is necessary but insufficient, noting the importance of integrating subjectivity in a more comprehensive approach to adaptation and in moving toward deliberate transformation in a climate change context. Here, I consider how to expand the scope and depth of 'adaptation' as it is currently defined and practiced, presenting an Integral conceptual framework that integrates the 'interior' forms of adaptation and thus can account for the diverse ways that local people are responding to entangled changes at the local level. Drawing on case study research in Guatemala, I explore how a more balanced integration of subjective and objective adaptive capacities, in individuals and collectives, leads to four types of adaptation-personal, practical, critical-structural, and co-generative. Findings describe: 1) how critical-structural adaptations were helpful in disrupting structural arrangements in ways that practical adaptations alone were not; and 2) that the interior adaptations (personal and co-generative) were less emphasized overall but can be effectively integrated, either implicitly or explicitly, with dominant forms of adaptation practice. This study demonstrates how a more comprehensive approach to adaptation may better position communities to engage in transformative change. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

The new urban agenda considers public spaces indispensable for sustaining the productivity of cities, social cohesion and inclusion, civic identity, and quality of life. Accordingly, there is no doubt about the importance of public spaces, while their quality is generated through the symbiosis of various elements. On the basis of normative theories of urban design, several public space design frameworks have been established in order to define what makes a good public place. Such a framework for public space quality evaluation is developed and tested at the Chair for Planning and Design in Landscape Architecture at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Forestry. The framework covers six criteria which illuminate key aspects of public spaces: safety and security, accessibility, legibility, comfort, inspiration and sensitivity and liveability. In this research, special attention is paid to the criteria of comfort analysed on two scale levels in Belgrade, Serbia. In the past, Belgrade was affected by extreme weather events that caused serious and sometimes disastrous consequences. The most pronounced challenges among them are heat waves in summer that, due to the shortage of vegetation combined with the proliferation of tarmac and concrete surfaces and reduced air ventilation, particularly threaten the densely populated central municipalities of Stari Grad, Sayski Venac and Vracar. The first scale level covers the analysis of the public space network and the degree of establishment of green infrastructure in Lower Dorcol quartier, which is located in the Municipality of Stari Grad, using quantitative and qualitative indicators and GIS (Geographic Information System) digital tools. The aim of this study is to observe the actual state of the public space network and to define a future scenario of its development in line with climate change challenges. Jevrejska Street, as an element of the above-mentioned public space network, is the subject of the next phase of the research. The study on this scale level will cover qualitative and quantitative analysis of public space elements such as paving, urban equipment, greenery, lighting, water facilities, etc. Next to that, by using the ENVI Met platform, the actual and proposed improvement of the street will be explored. The final part of this research will include a discussion about the research methodology used in order to improve the public space design process and to point out the need for the careful consideration of comfort as an important aspect of good public space.","[Vukmirovic, Milena; Gavrilovic, Suzana; Stojanovic, Dalibor] Univ Belgrade, Fac Forestry, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Vukmirovic, M (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Fac Forestry, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",milena.vukmirovic@sfb.bg.ac.rs; suzana.gavrilovic@sfb.bg.ac.rs; student.daliborstojanovic1853023@sfb.bg.ac.rs,"Vukmirovic, Milena/AAV-7201-2020","Vukmirovic, Milena/0000-0002-0239-3157; Gavrilovic, Suzana/0000-0002-2769-4933","Ministry of Education, Science and Technology of the Republic of Serbia [177009, 43007]","Ministry of Education, Science and Technology of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)","A part of this research was carried out during the second part of 2018 within the elective Master Course Open Public Space Design at the University of Belgrade-Faculty of Forestry, chaired by Milena Vukmirovic, PhD, while this paper was carried out within two national scientific projects funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology of the Republic of Serbia: No. 177009 Modernization of the Western Balkans and No. 43007 Studying climate change and its influence upon the environment: impacts, adaptation and mitigation.",,50,11,11,5,31,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2019,11,23,,,,,,,6546,10.3390/su11236546,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11236546,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KD9MV,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000508186400018,View Full Record in Web of Science

A climate-crop modeling approach was employed by using the CSM-CERES-Wheat model in some arid regions of northeast Iran to project the effects of CC on irrigated winter wheat production. Current climate data for 1990-2019 and climate projections of three climate models for the near-future climate period of 2021-2050 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios were used to run the crop model. Two irrigation scenarios with different irrigation efficiencies were also simulated to investigate the impacts of water scarcity associated with changing climate and irrigation management on winter wheat productivity. Results indicated that mean temperature is projected to increase in the range of 1.74-2.73 degrees C during the reproductive growth period of winter wheat over the study areas. The precipitation projections also indicated that the precipitation rates would decrease over most of the wheat-growing period. The length of the vegetative growth period will extend in some regions and shorten in others under the near future climate period due to a cooling and warming trend, respectively. However, the grain filling duration will be reduced by about 2-4 days across all regions. The mean seasonal potential evapotranspiration is expected to decrease by about 24 mm from 2021 to 2050 in Mashhad, Sabzevar, and Torbat-e Jam. A mean overall reduction in winter wheat yield due to future climate conditions would be about 12.3% across the study areas. However, an increase of 15-30% in the irrigation efficiency will be able to offset yield reductions associated with limited water supply under future climate scenarios. The results suggest that CC will exacerbate limited irrigation water resource availability, so implementing high-efficiency irrigation systems should be a priority to adapt to climate change in the arid cropping system of north-east of Iran.","[Saberali, Seyed Farhad; Nasrabadi, Hossein Nastari] Univ Torbat E Jam, Dept Hort Sci & Engn, Torbat E Jam, Khorasan Razavi, Iran; [Shirmohammadi-Aliakbarkhani, Zahra] Univ Torbat E Jam, Dept Water Sci & Engn, Torbat E Jam, Khorasan Razavi, Iran",,"Saberali, SF (corresponding author), Univ Torbat E Jam, Dept Hort Sci & Engn, Torbat E Jam, Khorasan Razavi, Iran.",sf.saberali@yahoo.com; masoumeh.shirmohamadi@gmail.com; ho_nastari@yahoo.com,,"Saberali, Seyed Farhad/0000-0002-1868-1313",University of Torbat-e Jam,University of Torbat-e Jam,This work has been financially supported by the vice-chancellor for research of the University of Torbat-e Jam.,,64,0,0,3,7,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

The aim of this work is to review the thermal performance of buildings integrated with various energy-saving strategies and to recommend suitable passive techniques for buildings located in various climatic types. The passive techniques such as PCM, insulation, natural and/or night ventilation techniques were investigated and recommendations were made based on the Koppen-Geiger climatic classifications. A variety of reviews discussing the different aspects of the selection of passive techniques for building applications are available in the literature. Still, knowledge of which technique suits a particular climate and the factors that influence its selection is necessary for all engineers, architects, research personnel, and students who are into building applications. The outcomes of the detailed literature review are as follows: Buildings integrated with PCM, insulation, natural and/or night ventilation significantly reduce the building's energy demands. The crucial factors in selecting an appropriate technique for a specific building are building type and location, weather patterns, and ventilation potential and strategies. Hence, before selecting any technique, it is recommended to analyse the feasibility of the technique for a particular building for an entire year in terms of thermal performance and cost benefits; and Finally, insulation integration at the outer building surface is recommended for Type A and B climates, while insulation integration at the inner building surface is recommended for Type C and D climates. In general, PCM integration is not beneficial for Type A climates, while integrating PCM at the outer building surface is recommended for Type B climates. Similarly, PCM integration at the middle or innermost layer of the building envelopes yielded better results for Type C and D climates. Reframing the building codes and standards for reducing greenhouse gases and adapting to climatic changes is recommended for a healthy, comfortable lifestyle and a clean environment.

Recent water and fisheries management projects in Bangladesh have established new local institutions for floodplain management based on community organizations. Although the Flood Action Plan (FAP) was the culmination of an earlier emphasis on technical and structural 'solutions' to managing floods and water in Bangladesh, the expected large engineering works were never built. One legacy of FAP lies in a contested process that accelerated emphasis on public participation, smaller scale hazard adjustments and maintaining a wider range of floodplain resource values including conserving and restoring fisheries. This paper compares institutional arrangements and outcomes in two fisheries and two water management projects taken up after FAR Local organizations appeared generally successful in sustaining themselves and continuing floodplain resource management. Facilitation, the extent of consensus among different stakeholders, and fit between institutional arrangements and scale of resource were all important influences on effectiveness. Local organizations have sustained in smaller floodplains, but in larger areas co-management bodies were a key to effective coordination and troubleshooting among a series of linked community organizations. Local leaders tend to dominate after projects end, especially where planning was less participatory and organizational structures were determined from above. Participants stressed that for continued success formally recognized well-run organizations are needed with accountable and adaptable decision-making processes and good leaders. This process built on participatory guidelines from FAP but the local institutions have not addressed hazard risks. Community resource management institutions could develop a more integrated approach that internalizes the interactions between water, land and fishery management. So far, local planning for floods has been a notable gap in the activities of community institutions, but the enhanced social capital could be a basis for adaptation to climate change. For this, an enabling policy environment is needed, which could be facilitated by the open high-profile debate on floodplain issues that characterized FAP.","[Sultana, Parvin; Thompson, Paul] Middlesex Univ, Flood Hazard Res Ctr, London N14 4YZ, England",Middlesex University,"Sultana, P (corresponding author), Middlesex Univ, Flood Hazard Res Ctr, Trent Pk,Bramley Rd, London N14 4YZ, England.",parvin@agni.com,,,,,,,38,15,16,2,31,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1747-7891,1878-0059,,ENVIRON HAZARDS-UK,Environ.

Little is however known on whether and how global warming may affect the atmosphere's predictability and thus our ability to produce accurate weather forecasts. Here, we combine a state-of-the-art climate and a state-of-the-art ensemble weather prediction model to show that, in a business-as-usual 21st century setting, global warming could significantly change the predictability of the atmosphere, defined here via the expected error of weather predictions. Predictability of synoptic weather situations could significantly increase, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. This can be explained by a decrease in the meridional temperature gradient. Contrarily, summertime predictability of weekly rainfall sums might significantly decrease in most regions. Plain Language Summary Due to the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, it is impossible to make weather forecasts that are completely accurate. Therefore, all weather forecasts are inherently uncertain to a certain degree. However, this uncertainty-and thus the difficulty of making good forecastsis not the same for all forecasts. This opens up the highly important question whether global warming will affect the difficulty of weather forecasts. Due to the enormous socioeconomic importance of accurate weather forecasts, it is essential to know whether climate change adaption policies also need to take into account potential changes in the difficulty and accuracy of weather forecasts. We show that in a warmer world, it will be easier to predict fields such as temperature and pressure. Contrarily, it will be harder to make accurate precipitation forecasts, which might strongly affect both disaster prevention and rainfall-dependent industries such as the energy sector, all of which heavily rely on accurate precipitation forecasts. Additionally, we show that the uncertainty of predictions of pressure fields is to a large extent controlled by fluctuations in the temperature difference between the North Pole and the equator. This is a new and important insight into the fundamentals of weather forecast uncertainty.","[Scher, S.; Messori, G.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Scher, S.; Messori, G.] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Messori, G.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Uppsala, Sweden",Stockholm University; Uppsala University,"Scher, S (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, Stockholm, Sweden.;Scher, S (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Stockholm, Sweden.",sebastian.scher@misu.su.se,,,Department of Meteorology of Stockholm University; Vetenskapsra det grant [2016-03724],Department of Meteorology of Stockholm University; Vetenskapsra det grant,"We thank Erland Kallen, Rodrigo Caballero, and HeiniWernli for their input in discussing the results of this study, and Glenn Carver from the openIFS support for his help in running the openIFS model.

It challenges environmental health and the sustainability of global development. Wastewater irrigation can make a sterling contribution to reducing water demand, recycling nutrients, improving soil health and cutting the amount of pollutants discharged into the waterways. However, the resource must be carefully managed to protect the environment and public health. Actions promoting wastewater reuse are every where, yet the frameworks for the protection of human health and the environment are lacking in most developing countries. Global change drivers including climate change, population growth, urbanization, income growth, improvements in living standard, industrialization, and energy intensive lifestyle will all heighten water management challenges. Slowing productivity growth, falling investment in irrigation, loss of biodiversity, risks to public health, environmental health issues such as soil salinity, land degradation, land cover change and water quality issues add an additional layer of complexity. Against this backdrop, the potential for wastewater irrigation and its benefits and risks are examined. These include crop productivity, aquaculture, soil health, groundwater quality, environmental health, public health, infrastructure constraints, social concerns and risks, property values, social equity, and poverty reduction. It is argued that, wastewater reuse and nutrient capture can contribute towards climate change adaptation and mitigation. Benefits such as avoided freshwater pumping and energy savings, fertilizer savings, phosphorous capture and prevention of mineral fertilizer extraction from mines can reduce carbon footprint and earn carbon credits. Wastewater reuse in agriculture reduces the water footprint of food production on the environment; it also entails activities such as higher crop yields and changes in cropping patterns, which also reduce carbon footprint. However, there is a need to better integrate water reuse into core water governance frameworks in order to effectively address the challenges and harness the potential of this vital resource for environmental health protection. The paper also presents a blueprint for future water governance and public policies for the protection of environmental health. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier GmbH.

The impacts of coastal flooding are also expected to increase in the future as a consequence of global climate change and sea-level rise. This paper presents a comprehensive assessment of the potential risks raised by storm surge and sea-level rise on multiple coastal targets (i.e., population, buildings, infrastructures, agriculture, natural and semi-natural environments and cultural heritage) in the Northern Adriatic coast in Italy. Through the assessment of hazard, exposure, vulnerability and risk, a Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) methodology allowed identifying and prioritizing hot-spot risk areas and targets requiring particular attention for the definition of adaptation strategies. Hazard scenarios were based on the analysis of tide gauge data (elaborated with the Joint Probability Method) and of different sea-level rise projections for the year 2100. Geographical-information analysis was then used to characterize vulnerability patterns of exposed natural and human systems and to make a spatial ranking of risks. Maps produced for the worst scenario showed that beaches are the target at higher risk (with more than 90% of the surface in the higher relative risk class) due to the low elevation and high proximity to the coastline. Also cultural heritage (i.e., villas, historical buildings and roads) and wetlands are highly threatened by storm surge flooding. The relative risks will be lower (i.e., between 25% and 40% of their surface/length in the higher relative risk class) for most of the other receptors (i.e., local roads, railways, natural and semi-natural environments and agricultural areas), including population and buildings that are mostly classified in lower risk classes. The overall results of the assessment, including maps and risk metrics, can be useful to rise the attention of coastal managers about the need to adapt to climate change, developing climate-proof policies and programs for the sustainable management of coastal zones.","[Rizzi, J.; Torresan, S.; Zabeo, A.; Critto, A.; Marcomini, A.] Fdn Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Via Augusto Imperatore 16, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Rizzi, J.; Critto, A.; Tomasin, A.; Marcomini, A.] Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Via Torino 155, I-30172 Venice, Italy; [Tosoni, A.] Ist Ctr Previs & Segnalaz Maree, S Marco 4090, I-30124 Venice, Italy",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Marcomini, A (corresponding author), Fdn Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Via Augusto Imperatore 16, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.;Marcomini, A (corresponding author), Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Via Torino 155, I-30172 Venice, Italy.",marcom@unive.it,"Zabeo, Alex/O-4573-2019; Rizzi, Jonathan/P-2004-2019; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Zabeo, Alex/0000-0001-7162-5364; Rizzi, Jonathan/0000-0002-2549-3994; TORRESAN, Silvia/0000-0002-9758-7084","Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA) Venice; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research; Italian Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea under GEMINA","Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA) Venice; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Italian Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea under GEMINA(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea)","This paper is a result of the CLIMDAT project, funded by the Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA) Venice.

One of the key measures to achieve such reductions as a way to mitigate and adapt to climate change is to increase food and energy self-sufficiency in residential areas. The objective of this study is to explore the potential self-sufficiency in terms of food and energy in generic residential districts in Singapore and Southeast Asia. Computational tools are employed to obtain quantifiable indicators based on sunlight availability. A series of building typologies and urban forms was created as abstractions from actual residential developments in Singapore (1.3 degrees N). In total, 57 cases were assessed in terms of sunlight availability and the impact of three density and geometry parameters: plot ratio, site coverage and building height were considered. Results from selected cases were compared to Hanoi's conditions (21 degrees N). The results show that the indicators having the higher impact on the food and energy self-sufficiency are plot ratio and building height. The cases with the lowest plot ratio (PR < 1.9) achieved food self-sufficiency when a hybrid higher-yield farming method was applied. Regarding energy harvesting, the cases with the lowest building height (<42 m) achieve energy self-sufficiency due to the maximum exposed area with PV per number of residents. In low-latitude regions, solar access is more evenly distributed among all facade orientations than in higher latitudes, therefore providing all facade orientations with food and energy harvesting potential. Food and energy self-sufficiency in equatorial regions is more heavily influenced by the available farming and PV area in relation to the total population than by the reduction of sunlight availability due to building typology and morphology.

However, the manifestations of farmer-led bottom-up restoration efforts at individual and collective levels, and how they add up to landscape-scale restoration outcomes remain understudied. We analyze the nature of restoration efforts across interlocked forest and agricultural landscapes, estimate the extent of farmlands under restoration, and examine the contextual drivers and barriers of restoration. We use a mixed-methods approach combining a multivariate Tobit regression model and a Poisson model based on a 2019 household survey (N = 480 households), and qualitative insights from seven focus group discussions from Malawi's Dedza and Ntchisi Districts. The estimated mean total area of restored farmlands per household was 1.10 ( +/- 0.76) and 1.07 ( +/- 0.72) acres, representing, on average, about 54 % and 43 % of the total household landholdings in Dedza and Ntchisi, respectively. Results also indicate restoration diversification and intensification patterns whereby farmers generally combine two or more land-management practices based on complementarities in achieving specific livelihoods, food security, and ecological goals of restoration, and on compatibility regarding labor and other inputs demand. Land configuration mattered. Land plots that were spatially consolidated and tenure-secured were associated with higher restoration efforts. Also, women restoration efforts are limited by their inadequate access to productive inputs. Therefore, restoration policies should center on strategies that improve landownership security while minimizing fragmentation within landholdings and promote gender-responsive interventions. Drivers of collective resources restoration include strong local leadership; perceived tangible benefits for firewood, NTFPs, and timber resources; secure rights to collect firewood and free access to grazing areas; and perceived balanced among payoffs for energy needs, climate change adaptation, and ecological goals. These can inform restoration programs involving collective actions and their governance.","[Djenontin, Ida Nadia S.; Zulu, Leo C.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, Environm & Spatial Sci & Environm Sci & Policy Pro, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Djenontin, Ida Nadia S.] Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England; [Richardson, Robert B.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Michigan State University,"Djenontin, INS (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, Environm & Spatial Sci & Environm Sci & Policy Pro, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",I.N.Djenontin@lse.ac.uk,,,"College of Social Sciences of Michigan State University (MSU), USA; Environmental Science and Policy Program (ESPP) of MSU, USA; Graduate Women International (GWI), Switzerland","College of Social Sciences of Michigan State University (MSU), USA; Environmental Science and Policy Program (ESPP) of MSU, USA; Graduate Women International (GWI), Switzerland","This research benefitted from a funding support through the Research Scholars Award by the College of Social Sciences of Michigan State University (MSU), USA.

Aiming to initiate a climate-centered dialogue, a hybrid team of scientists and artists collected local narratives within the Kerourien neighbourhood, in the city of Brest in Brittany, France. Kerourien is a place known for its stigmatizing crime, poverty, marginalization and state of disrepair. Social work is higher on the agenda than climate action. The team thus acknowledged that local narratives might not make much mention of climate change, and recognized part of the work might be to shift awareness to the actual or potential, current or future, connections between everyday non-climate concerns and climate issues. Such a shift called for a practical intervention, centered on local culture. The narrative collection process was dovetailed with preparing the neighbourhood's 50th anniversary celebration and establishing a series of art performances to celebrate the neighbourhood and its residents. Non-climate and quasi-climate stories were collected, documented, and turned into art forms. The elements of climate service co-production in this process are twofold. First, they point to the ways in which non-climate change related local concerns may be mapped out in relation to climate change adaptation, showing how non-climate change concerns call for climate information. Secondly, they show how the co-production of climate services may go beyond the provision of climate information by generating procedural benefits such as local empowerment - thus generating capacities that may be mobilized to face climate change. We conclude by stressing that place-based climate service co-production for action may require questioning the nature of the services rendered, questioning the nature of place, and questioning what action entails. We offer leads for addressing these questions in ways that help realise empowerment and greater social justice.","[Baztan, Juan; Vanderlinden, Jean-Paul; Zhu, Zhiwei] Univ Paris Saclay, CEARC, UVSQ, F-78280 Guyancourt, France; [Jaffres, Lionel] Le Grain, F-29200 Brest, France; [Jorgensen, Bethany] Cornell Univ, Civ Ecol Lab, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Cornell University,"Baztan, J (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, CEARC, UVSQ, F-78280 Guyancourt, France.",juan.baztan@uvsq.fr,,"Jorgensen, Bethany/0000-0002-8216-1398",FORMAS (SE); BELSPO (BE); BMBF (DE); BMWFW (AT); IFD (DK); MINECO (ES); ANR (FR); European Union [690462],FORMAS (SE); BELSPO (BE); BMBF (DE)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); BMWFW (AT); IFD (DK); MINECO (ES)(Spanish Government); ANR (FR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)); European Union(European Commission),"Thanks to All the Kerourien inhabitants for their kindness.

Combining key informant interviews (n = 18) with documentary analysis, it explores the institutional tensions between adaptive management approaches emphasising openness to uncertainty and to alternative policy options on the one hand and risk-based ones that close them down by transforming uncertainties into calculable risks whose management can be rationalized through cost-benefit analysis and nationally consistent, risk-based priority setting on the other hand. These alternative approaches to managing uncertainty about the first-order risks to society from future flooding are shaped by institutional concerns with managing the second-order, 'institutional' risks of criticism and blame arising from accountability for discharging those first-order risk management responsibilities. In the case of river flooding the poorly understood impacts of future climate change were represented with a simplistic adjustment to peak flow estimates, which proved robust in overcoming institutional resistance to making precautionary allowances for climate change in risk-based flood management, at least in part because its scientific limitations were acknowledged only partially. By contrast in the case of coastal flood risk management, greater scientific confidence led to successively more elaborate guidance on how to represent the science, which in turn led to inconsistency in implementation and increased the institutional risks involved in taking the uncertain effects of future sea level rise into account in adaptation planning and flood risk management. Comparative analysis of these two cases then informs some wider reflections about the tensions between adaptive and risk-based approaches, the role of institutional risk in climate change adaptation, and the importance of such institutional dynamics in shaping the framing uncertainties and policy responses to scientific knowledge about them.

Unfortunately, mechanistic models generally demonstrated a limited ability to characterise in appropriate detail how complex coastal systems and their constituent parts may respond to climate change drivers and to possible adaptation initiatives. The research reported here develops an innovative methodological framework, which integrates different research areas participatory and probabilistic modelling, and decision analysis - within a coordinated process aimed at decision support. The effectiveness of alternative adaptation measures in a lagoon in north-east Italy is assessed by means of Bayesian Decision Network (BDN) models, developed upon judgments elicited from selected experts. A concept map of the system was first developed in a group brainstorming context and was later evolved into BDN models, thus providing a simplified quantitative structure. Conditional probabilities, quantifying the causal links between the direct and indirect consequences of SLR on the area of study, are elicited from the experts. The proposed methodological framework allows the integrated assessment of factors and processes belonging to different domains of knowledge. Moreover, it activates an informed and transparent participatory process involving disciplinary experts and policy makers, where the main risk factors are considered together with the expected effects of the adaptation options, with effective treatment and communication of the uncertainty pervading the SLR issue. Finally, the framework shows potentials for being further developed and applied to consider new evidences and/or different adaptation strategies, and it results sufficiently flexible to be adopted and effectively reused in other similar case studies.

Changes in temperature and precipitation will result in changes in land and water regimes that will subsequently affect agricultural productivity. Given the gradual change of climate in the past, historically, farmers have adapted in an autonomous manner. However, with large and discrete climate change anticipated by the end of this century, planned and transformational changes will be needed. In light of these, the focus of this review is on farm-level and farmers responses to the challenges of climate change both spatially and over time. In this review of adapting agriculture to climate change, the nature, extent, and causes of climate change are analyzed and assessed. These provide the context for adapting agriculture to climate change. The review identifies the binding constraints to adaptation at the farm level. Four major priority areas are identified to relax these constraints, where new initiatives would be required, i.e., information generation and dissemination to enhance farm-level awareness, research and development (R&D) in agricultural technology, policy formulation that facilitates appropriate adaptation at the farm level, and strengthening partnerships among the relevant stakeholders. Forging partnerships among R&D providers, policy makers, extension agencies, and farmers would be at the heart of transformational adaptation to climate change at the farm level. In effecting this transformational change, sustained efforts would be needed for the attendant requirements of climate and weather forecasting and innovation, farmer's training, and further research to improve the quality of information, invention, and application in agriculture. The investment required for these would be highly significant. The review suggests a sequenced approach through grouping research initiatives into short-term, medium-term, and long-term initiatives, with each initiative in one stage contributing to initiatives in a subsequent stage. The learning by doing inherent in such a process-oriented approach is a requirement owing to the many uncertainties associated with climate change.","[Anwar, Muhuddin Rajin; Liu, De Li] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Wagga Wagga Agr Inst, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2650, Australia; [Anwar, Muhuddin Rajin; Liu, De Li] EH Graham Ctr Agr Innovat, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2650, Australia; [Macadam, Ian] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Kelly, Georgina] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Beecroft, NSW 2119, Australia",NSW Department of Primary Industries; University of New South Wales Sydney; NSW Department of Primary Industries,"Anwar, MR (corresponding author), NSW Dept Primary Ind, Wagga Wagga Agr Inst, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2650, Australia.",muhuddin.anwar@dpi.nsw.gov.au,", De Li Liu/Y-4656-2019","Macadam, Ian/0000-0002-1167-0195; Liu, De Li/0000-0003-2574-1908",,,,,195,107,110,12,324,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

These challenges require changes in current agricultural systems and therefore, environmentally-friendly agricultural systems must be designed and their sustainability assessed. Over the past several years, various methods have been developed for making such assessments (e.g. the Balancing and Ranking Method, MEACROS, MODAM, the modelling framework of Pacini et al., ROTAT + Farm Images, MASC, and ROTOR) but few studies put forward simple solutions for selecting one method over another. In this paper, we propose a simple guide to distinguish methods one from another. Categories of the guide include the type of systems to assess, the spatial and temporal scales at which systems are assessed, the dimensions of sustainability for which systems are assessed, the type of visualisation for comparing options, the target users, and the ability to generate alternative systems. The guide was developed and tested with a group of farm advisors involved in a three-year project called RotAB, which aimed to assess the sustainability of organic arable farming systems: the advisors looked for a method for sustainability assessment of cropping systems. We presented seven recent assessment methods as well as the guide to advisors. The guide's key points allowed them to clearly express their requirements: the method they looked for had to evaluate cropping systems and helped advisors to propose new ones; it had to evaluate multiple sustainability criteria that are easily understandable by farmers; indicators had to be scientifically based, without the need for many input data; the method had to be easy to use and produced graphical output that can be discussed with farmers. Finally, the guide helped advisors to choose one of the seven methods (in that case they chose MASC). This guide can help decision-makers distinguish assessment tools from one another using simple categories and choose the one best adapted to their expectations. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to investigate the climate change effects on the hydrology of Lakhmass catchment in Tunisia. Lakhmass catchment is a part of the Medium Valley of Medjerda in northwestern Tunisia that drains an area of 126 km(2). First, the Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning light (HBV-light) model was calibrated and validated successfully at a daily time step to simulate discharge during the 1981-1986 period. The Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency and Percent bias (NSE, PBIAS) were (0.80, +2.0%) and (0.53, -9.5%) for calibration (September 1982-August 1984) and validation (September 1984-August 1986) periods, respectively. Second, HBV-light model was considered as a predictive tool to simulate discharge in a baseline period (1981-2009) and future projections using data (precipitation and temperature) from thirteen combinations of General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Regional Climatic Models (RCMs). We used two trajectories of Representative Concentration Pathways, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, suggested by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Each RCP is divided into three projection periods: near-term (2010-2039), mid-term (2040-2069) and long-term (2070-2099). For both scenarios, a decrease in precipitation and discharge will be expected with an increase in air temperature and a reduction in precipitation with almost 5% for every +1 degrees C of global warming. By long-term (2070-2099) projection period, results suggested an increase in temperature with about 2.7 degrees C and 4 degrees C, and a decrease in precipitation of approximately 7.5% and 15% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. This will likely result in a reduction of discharge of 12.5% and 36.6% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. This situation calls for early climate change adaptation measures under a participatory approach, including multiple stakeholders and water users.","[Ben Nsir, Siwar; Khlifi, Slaheddine] Univ Jendouba, Unite Rech Gest Ressources Eau & Sol, Ecole Super Ingenieurs Medjez El Bab, Route Kef Km 5, Medjez El Bab 9070, Tunisia; [Ben Nsir, Siwar; Jomaa, Seifeddine; Zhou, Xiangqian; Rode, Michael] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Aquat Ecosyst Anal & Management, Bruckstr 3a, D-39114 Magdeburg, Germany; [Yildirim, Umit] Bayburt Univ, Fac Arts & Designing, Dept Interior Architecture & Environm Designing, Baberti Settlement, TR-69000 Bayburt, Turkey; [D'Oria, Marco] Univ Parma, Dept Engn & Architecture, Parco Area Sci 181-A, I-43124 Parma, Italy; [Rode, Michael] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany",Universite de Jendouba; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Bayburt University; University of Parma; University of Potsdam,"Ben Nsir, S (corresponding author), Univ Jendouba, Unite Rech Gest Ressources Eau & Sol, Ecole Super Ingenieurs Medjez El Bab, Route Kef Km 5, Medjez El Bab 9070, Tunisia.;Ben Nsir, S (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Aquat Ecosyst Anal & Management, Bruckstr 3a, D-39114 Magdeburg, Germany.",siwarbenncir1@gmail.com; seifeddine.jomaa@ufz.de; umit.yildirim.1907@gmail.com; xiangqian.zhou@ufz.de; marco.doria@unipr.it; michael.rode@ufz.de; slaheddinekhlifi@gmail.com,"D'ORIA, Marco/B-1526-2019; Yildirim, Umit/A-3124-2016; Jomaa, Seifeddine/P-7534-2017","D'ORIA, Marco/0000-0002-5154-7052; Ben Nsir, Siwar/0000-0001-9495-7062; Yildirim, Umit/0000-0002-7631-7245; Jomaa, Seifeddine/0000-0003-4782-9468",University of Jendouba in Tunisia; Ministry of High Education and Scientific Research,University of Jendouba in Tunisia; Ministry of High Education and Scientific Research,"The data sets utilized in this study in part originated from the Master's dissertation of the author Siwar Ben Nsir, which was supported by the Higher School of Engineers of Medjez El Bab, University of Jendouba in Tunisia, under the supervision of Slaheddine Khlifi and Seifeddine Jomaa.

In Morocco, rising temperatures and declining precipitation are having daunting effects on the vulnerability of crops. This study examines the vulnerability of barley, maize, and wheat to variations in growing season precipitation and socio-economic proxies of adaptive capacity such as literacy and poverty rates at both national and sub-national scales in Morocco. The methodology is based on a composite vulnerability index (vulnerability is a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity). National and sub-national crop yield data used to compute the sensitivity index were downloaded from FAOSTAT and the global crop yield gaps Atlas. The mean annual growing season precipitation data at both the national and sub-national scales used to compute the exposure index were downloaded from the world bank climate portal. Proxy data for adaptive capacity in the form of literacy and poverty rates were downloaded from the world bank, figshare, and MPR archives. The CANESM model was used to validate the crop yield observations. The results show that wheat shows the lowest vulnerability and the highest adaptive capacity, while maize has the highest vulnerability and lowest adaptive capacity. Sub-nationally, vulnerability indexes decrease northwards while adaptive capacity and normalized growing season precipitation increase northwards. Wheat also shows the lowest vulnerability and highest adaptive capacity and normalized growing season precipitation at each latitude northward. Model validation shows that the models used here reproduce most of the spatial patterns of the crops concerned. These findings have implications for climate change adaptation and climate policy in Morocco, as it becomes evident which of these most cultivated crops are more vulnerable nationally and spatially. These results have implications for future research, as it might be important to understand how these crops perform under growing season temperature as well as what future projections and yield gaps can be observed.","[Achli, Soumia; Epule, Terence Epule; Dhiba, Driss; Chehbouni, Abdelghani] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ UM6P, Int Water Res Inst IWRI, Lot 660, Hay Moulay Rachid 43150, Ben Guerir, Morocco; [Chehbouni, Abdelghani; Er-Raki, Salah] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ UM6P, Ctr Remote Sensing Applicat CRSA, Lot 660, Hay Moulay Rachid 43150, Ben Guerir, Morocco; [Er-Raki, Salah] Univ Cadi Ayyad, Fac Sci & Tech, Dept Phys Appl, ProcEDE, Marrakech 40000, Morocco",Mohammed VI Polytechnic University; Mohammed VI Polytechnic University; Cadi Ayyad University of Marrakech,"Epule, TE (corresponding author), Mohammed VI Polytech Univ UM6P, Int Water Res Inst IWRI, Lot 660, Hay Moulay Rachid 43150, Ben Guerir, Morocco.",soumia.achli@um6p.ma; epule.terence@um6p.ma; driss.dhiba@um6p.ma; abdelghani.chehbouni@um6p.ma; s.erraki@uca.ma,"; chehbouni, abdelghani/K-2096-2016","Epule, Terence Epule/0000-0002-5756-382X; DHIBA, Driss/0000-0001-8431-9649; chehbouni, abdelghani/0000-0002-0270-1690; Er-Raki, Salah/0000-0002-8595-7949",Pan Moroccan Yield and Precipitation Gaps Project (PAMCPP) at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University,Pan Moroccan Yield and Precipitation Gaps Project (PAMCPP) at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University,"This research and the APC fees were funded by the Pan Moroccan Yield and Precipitation Gaps Project (PAMCPP), awarded to T.E.E. at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in 2021.",,80,3,3,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Population is a key element in disaster risk management and climate change adaptation. Employing a variety of datasets including gridded population data, DEM data, sea-level extremes data, and urban boundary data, this study explores the spatiotemporal patterns and dynamics of population in the LECZ of YRD, and estimates the population exposure to inundation in the context of SLR over 1990-2100. Our results show that: (1) the population in the LECZ in 2015 approximates 104 million, with an increase of 29.3 million (39.2%) over 1990. There shows a trend of remarkable population growth in areas close to the coastline (less than 40 km from the coastline) and in areas at lower altitudes (below 4 m above sea level). Meanwhile, driven by rapid urbanization, population in the LECZ concentrates steadily in urban areas with increasing spatial polarization and heterogeneity. (2) In 2020-2100, the projected population in the LECZ of YRD will experience a rise followed by a fall. Under shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) with various factors of fertility, mortality, migration and urbanization levels, population will rise gradually from 2020 to 2040 with a peak of near 132 million (SSP5), and then fall remarkably until 2100. (3) Overlaying the SLR with representative concentration pathways (RCPs), the exposed population to inundation will reach 86 million (RCP4.5-SSP2) and 100 million (RCP8.5-SSP5) by 2050, an increase of 13.5% and 32.2% over 2015, respectively. The exposed population will then decrease to 55 million (RCP4.5-SSP2) and 63 million (RCP8.5-SSP5) by 2100, slightly lower than those in 2015. In contrast to population growth, the contribution of SLR to population exposure will steadily increase. (4) Long-term trend of population exposure to SLR will pose considerable challenges to the regional development and planning. Different adaptation efforts should be taken in urban and rural settlements to avoid exacerbating impacts induced by SLR.","[Lv, Yamin; Li, Weijiang; Wen, Jiahong; Xu, Hui; Du, Shiqiang] Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Environm & Geog Sci, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China; [Du, Shiqiang] Shanghai Normal Univ, Inst Urban Studies, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China",Shanghai Normal University; Shanghai Normal University,"Li, WJ (corresponding author), Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Environm & Geog Sci, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China.",lwj@shnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51761135024, 41771540, 41871200]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC1503001]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 51761135024, 41771540, 41871200) , the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFC1503001) .",,72,3,3,1,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

The intensity of high-temperature extremes is anticipated to escalate between 0.25 to 1.8 degrees C and 0.6 to 4 degrees C under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, respectively, with Sahara and West Southern Africa projected to warm faster than the rest of the regions. On average, warm days frequency is also expected to upsurge under SSP2-4.5 (26-59%) and SSP5-8.5 (30-69%) relative to the recent climate. By the mid-21st century, continental population exposure is expected to upsurge by -25% (28%) of the reference period under SSP2-4.5|SSP2 (SSP5-8.5|SSP5). The highest increase in exposure is expected in most parts of West Africa (WAF), followed by East Africa. The projected changes in continental exposure (-353.6 million person-days under SSP2-4.5|SSP2 and-401.4 million person-days under SSP5-8.5|SSP5) are mainly due to the interaction effect. However, the climates influence is more than the population, especially for WAF, South-East Africa and East Southern Africa. The study findings are vital for climate change adaptation.

Such policies concentrate primarily on on-farm development and overlook rich prospects for off-farm diversification. Livelihood diversification of small-scale farmers plays a major role in reducing hunger and mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change. Therefore, this paper seeks to analyze livelihood diversification in managing catastrophic risks among rural farm households of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan. We have interviewed a total of 600 farm households through a standardized questionnaire in two districts (Nowshera and Charsadda) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan that were badly affected by the 2010 flood. For empirical analysis, a logistic regression model was chosen to analyze the important attributes that are correlated to livelihood diversification of the rural households in flood-susceptible areas of Pakistan. The survey findings indicate that 50% of the total sample respondents adopted off-farm livelihood diversification strategies, while 40.5% of farm households adopted on-farm livelihood diversification strategies in managing catastrophic risks. The logistic regression model results show that attributes including socioeconomic and demographic, institutional, and risk perception significantly influenced households' choices of livelihood diversification. Also, the findings indicated a wide range of livelihood diversification constrained including climatic risks and uncertainties (23%), inadequate natural resources (17%), limited level of skills and training (15%), lack of institutional support (12%), lack of credit facilities (11%), poor infrastructure including markets and roads (16%), and lack of labor availability (4%). The study urges the need for robust climate change adaptation policies, in particular, by aiming at training initiatives, improving access to services, and enhancing institutional assistance, and better infrastructure. The livelihood of small-scale farmers could only improve if the Government pays due consideration and adopts the right policy initiatives that promote the diversification of livelihoods as part of the creation of national jobs to save many lives and improve livelihoods.","[Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad; Gong, Zaiwu; Khan, Nasir Abbas] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad; Gong, Zaiwu; Khan, Nasir Abbas] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Khan, Imran] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Binjiang Coll, Wuxi 21400, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ali, Muhammad] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Dept Econ, Sch Social Sci & Humanities S3H, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Naqvi, Syed Asif Ali] Govt Coll Univ Faisalabad, Dept Econ, Faisalabad, Pakistan",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Wuxi University; National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan; Government College University Faisalabad,"Gong, ZW; Khan, NA (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.;Gong, ZW; Khan, NA (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",ahmad.ashfaq1986@gmail.com; zwgong26@163.com; nasirkhanpk@outlook.com,"Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad/J-2476-2019; Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad/AAT-7073-2021; Khan, Nasir Abbas/Z-3608-2019","Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad/0000-0001-9142-2441; Khan, Nasir Abbas/0000-0002-6079-715X",,,,,71,12,12,2,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

Climate change along with other global change forcings will diminish the opportunities for sustainability of cities, especially in coastal areas in low-income countries. Climate forcings include global temperature and heatwave increases that are expanding the equatorial tropical belt, sea-level rise, an increase in the frequency of the most intense tropical cyclones, both increases and decreases in freshwater inputs to coastal zones, and increasingly severe extreme precipitation events, droughts, freshwater shortages, heat waves, and wildfires. Current climate impacts are already strongly influencing natural and human systems. Because of proximity to several key warming variables such as sea-level rise and increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves, coastal cities are a leading indicator of what may occur worldwide. Climate change alone will diminish the sustainability and resilience of coastal cities, especially in the tropical-subtropical belt, but combined with other global changes, this suite of forcings represents an existential threat, especially for coastal cities. Urbanization has coincided with orders of magnitude increases in per capita GDP, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn has led to unprecedented demand for natural resources and degradation of natural systems and more expensive infrastructure to sustain the flows of these resources. Most resources to fuel cities are extracted from ex-urban areas far away from their point of final use. The urban transition over the last 200 years is a hallmark of the Anthropocene coinciding with large surges in use of energy, principally fossil fuels, population, consumption and economic growth, and environmental impacts such as natural system degradation and climate change. Fossil energy enabled and underwrote Anthropocene origins and fueled the dramatic expansion of modern urban systems. It will be difficult for renewable energy and other non-fossil energy sources to ramp up fast enough to fuel further urban growth and maintenance and reverse climate change all the while minimizing further environmental degradation. Given these trajectories, the future sustainability of cities and urbanization trends, especially in threatened areas like coastal zones in low-income countries in the tropical to sub-tropical belt, will likely diminish. Adaptation to climate change may be limited and challenging to implement, especially for low-income countries.","[Day, John W.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Gunn, Joel D.] Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Dept Anthropol, Greensboro, NC USA; [Burger, Joseph Robert] Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro; University of Kentucky,"Day, JW (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",johnday@lsu.edu,,,University of North Carolina-Greensboro Office of Research and Engagement; UNCG University Libraries,University of North Carolina-Greensboro Office of Research and Engagement; UNCG University Libraries,Partial funding of this research was supported by aggregate funding from University of North Carolina-Greensboro Office of Research and Engagement and the UNCG University Libraries.,,103,5,5,7,24,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

Sea level rise and extreme weather events are projected to be more severe in coming decades, which, without additional action, will increase the number of people at risk of climate-sensitive diseases, challenging the health system. This article summaries the results of a health vulnerability and adaptation (V&A) assessment conducted in Vietnam as evidences for development of the National Climate Change Health Adaptation Plan to 2030. METHODS: The assessment followed the first 4 steps outlined in the World Health Organization's Guidelines in conducting Vulnerability and Adaptation Assessments. A framework and list of indicators were developed for semi-quantitative assessment for the period 2013 to 2017. Three sets of indicators were selected to assess the level of (1) exposure to climate change and extreme weather events. (2) health sensitivity, and (3) adaptation capacity. The indicators were rated and analyzed using a scoring system from 1 to 5. RESULTS: The results showed that climate-sensitive diseases were common, including dengue fever, diarrheal, influenza, etc, with large burdens of disease that are projected to increase. From 2013 to 2017. the level of exposure to climate change-related hazards of the health sector was high' to very high,' with an average score from 3.5 to 4.4 (out of 5.0). For health sensitivity, the scores decreased from 3.8 in 2013 to 3.5 in 2017, making the overall rating as high. For 'adaptive capacity, the scores were from 4.0 to 4.1, which meant adaptive capacity was very low. The overall V&A rating in 2013 was very high risk (score 4.1) and high risk with scores of 3.8 in 2014 and 3.7 in 2015 to 2017. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptation actions of the health sector are urgently needed to reduce the vulnerability to climate change in coming decades. Eight adaptation solutions, among recommendations of V&A assessment, were adopted in the National Health Climate Change Adaptation Plan.","[Tran Thi Tuyet Hanh; Le Thi Thanh Huong; Ha Van Nhu; Luu Quoc Toan; Nguyen Ngoc Bich] Hanoi Univ Publ Hlth, Fac Environm & Occupat Hlth, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Nguyen Thi Lien Huong; Manh Cuong] Vietnam Hlth Environm Management Agcy, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Tran Nu Quy Linh] Griffith Univ, Ctr Environm & Populat Hlth, Sch Med, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Nguyen Huu Quyen] Inst Hydrol & Meteorol Sci & Climate Change, Climate Res & Climate Forecasting Div, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Nguyen Thi Trang Nhung] Hanoi Univ Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Ebi, Kristie] Univ Washington, Ctr Hlth & Global Environm, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Nguyen Dinh Cuong] ADB TA Project, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Tran Mai Kien] Inst Hydrol & Meteorol Sci & Climate Change, Climate Change Res Ctr, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Hales, Simon] Univ Otago, Publ Hlth Dept, Otago, New Zealand; [Nguyen Thi Thi Tho] Natl Inst Hyg & Epidemiol, Dept Noncommunicable Dis Prevent & Control, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Hoang Van Minh] Hanoi Univ Publ Hlth, 1A Duc Thang Rd, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam",Hanoi University of Public Health; Griffith University; Hanoi University of Public Health; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Otago; National Institute of Hygiene & Epidemiology (NIHE); Hanoi University of Public Health,"Huong, LTT (corresponding author), Hanoi Univ Publ Hlth, 1A Duc Thang Rd, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam.",lth@huph.edu.vn,"Tran, Linh/AAU-7091-2020; Van Hoang, Minh/AET-0962-2022","Tran, Linh/0000-0002-2807-8323; Le, Huong/0000-0002-3844-8041; Tran Thi, Tuyet-Hanh/0000-0002-9191-577X",Asian Development Bank [TA-8898 REG],Asian Development Bank,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The assessment received technical and financial support from Asian Development Bank under the project titled TA-8898 REG: Regional Capacity Development for Strengthening Resilience to Climate Change in the Health Sector in the Greater Mekong Sub-region.",,32,3,3,4,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1178-6302,,,ENVIRON HEALTH INSIG,Environ.

In the context of anthropogenic climate change, ecological calendars based on Indigenous knowledge may enable communities to anticipate seasonal phenomena. We conducted research with communities in the Standing Rock Nation (North and South Dakota, USA) to develop ecological calendars based on their ecological knowledge. We present ecological calendars developed in seven communities through a series of workshops and interviews. These calendars are rich with knowledge about temporal relations within each community's ecosystem, including the use of plants and animals as seasonal indicators and cues for food system activities. However, the calendars also reveal the impacts of cultural genocide wrought by the United States government in its efforts to colonize the lands and minds of Indigenous communities. Given the diversity of knowledge among Standing Rock communities, we identify opportunities for knowledge exchange to revitalize ecological relations at the heart of food sovereignty.

However, very little is known in relation to climate change and health. This article provides information on potential climate change impact on health, magnitude of climate-sensitive diseases, and baseline scenarios of health systems to climate variability and change. Design: A cross-sectional study using multistage cluster sampling framework was conducted in 2012 among 6,720 households of 224 rural villages in seven vulnerable districts of Bangladesh. Information was obtained from head of the households using a pretested, interviewer-administered, structured questionnaire. A total of 6,720 individuals participated in the study with written, informed consent. Results: The majority of the respondents were from the low-income vulnerable group (60% farmers or day labourers) with an average of 30 years' stay in their locality. Most of them (96%) had faced extreme weather events, 45% of people had become homeless and displaced for a mean duration of 38 days in the past 10 years. Almost all of the respondents (97.8%) believe that health care expenditure increased after the extreme weather events. Mean annual total health care expenditure was 6,555 Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) (1 USD = 77 BDT in 2015) and exclusively out of pocket of the respondents. Incidence of dengue was 1.29 (95% CI 0.65-2.56) and malaria 13.86 (95% CI 6.00-32.01) per 1,000 adult population for 12 months preceding the data collection. Incidence of diarrhoea and pneumonia among under-five children of the households for the preceding month was 10.3% (95% CI 9.16-11.66) and 7.3% (95% CI 6.35-8.46), respectively. Conclusions: The findings of this survey indicate that climate change has a potential adverse impact on human health in Bangladesh. The magnitude of malaria, dengue, childhood diarrhoea, and pneumonia was high among the vulnerable communities. Community-based adaptation strategy for health could be beneficial to minimise climate change attributed health burden of Bangladesh.","[Kabir, Md Iqbal; Smith, Wayne; Milton, Abul Hasnat] Univ Newcastle, Ctr Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Fac Hlth & Med, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Kabir, Md Iqbal] NIPSOM, Natl Inst Prevent & Social Med, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Kabir, Md Iqbal] Minist Hlth & Family Welf, Climate Change & Hlth Promot Unit, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Rahman, Md Bayzidur] UNSW, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Fac Med, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Lusha, Mirza Afreen Fatima] Hlth Commun Network, Dhaka, Bangladesh",University of Newcastle; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Kabir, MI (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Ctr Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Fac Hlth & Med, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",mdiqbal.kabir@uon.edu.au,,,"Climate Change and Health Promotion Unit (CCHPU) of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Bangladesh, under the project of Climate Change Trust of the Ministry of Environment and Forest","Climate Change and Health Promotion Unit (CCHPU) of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Bangladesh, under the project of Climate Change Trust of the Ministry of Environment and Forest","We are grateful for the financial support provided for this study by the Climate Change and Health Promotion Unit (CCHPU) of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Bangladesh, under the project of Climate Change Trust of the Ministry of Environment and Forest.

Some of the most valuable methods for ensuring the long-term sustainability of groundwater aquifers are those that provide artificial recharge. This study was conducted to determine the effect of artificial recharge on groundwater levels and quality in Iraq's Dibdibba unconfined aquifer, utilizing groundwater modeling system software (GMS). Reclaimed water (tertiary treatment) from Kerbala's central wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was used as raw water to recharge the aquifer. The effects of this artificial recharge were determined using built-up groundwater flow (MODFLOW) and dissolved transport (MT3DMS) simulation models. Model calibration and validation were implemented based on groundwater monitoring data from 2016 to 2017. The model matched observed elevations at R-2 = 0.96 for steady state and R-2 = 0.92 in transient state simulations. After the 3D numerical model was calibrated and validated, two scenarios were explored based on the daily production of 5000 and 10,000 m(3)/d from Karbala's WWTP. The results indicated that the pumping of the treated wastewater through the pond would increase water levels by more than 20 cm for more than 78.2 and 110 km(2) for pumping rates of 5000 and 10,000 m(3)/day, respectively. More than 40 km(2) would be added (reclaimed) to the agricultural areas in the region as a result of the use of artificial recharge using a pond. Groundwater quality was also improved, as the TDS decreased by more than 55%, down to 1900 ppm, and the EC decreased by more than 68%, down to 1500 mu.S/cm. The findings of this study can assist decision-makers in developing strategies to reduce water scarcity and adapt to climate change.","[Hassan, Waqed H.] Univ Warith Al Anbiyaa, Coll Engn, Kerbala 56001, Iraq; [Hassan, Waqed H.; Mahdi, Fatima A.; Nile, Basim K.] Univ Kerbala, Coll Engn, Kerbala 56001, Iraq; [Ghanim, Abdulnoor A.

These concepts have become more mainstream, critical in helping water organisations decide on and implement policies, and generating economic returns. Their application still tends to be often limited to education or 'training'. KCD requires an understanding of the physical world, how institutions must be strengthened to manage it, and how pedagogical and knowledge-management tools, in turn, strengthen the institutions. The private sector first applied knowledge management. The international development theory highlighted the deficiency of governments in implementation capacity. The health and environmental communities are developing an 'implementation science' to enhance the capacity to operationalise know-how faster. Advances in KCD include the following: (1) knowledge and capacity converging in nested levels (individual, organisational, institutional, and societal) to cause effective action; (2) six arenas/contexts of KCD application; and (3) pedagogy and knowledge-management through which learning occurs and knowledge is imparted. KCD is a 'sticky', slow process. Policy analyses tend to overlook the role of KCD. The water sector is facing acute challenges: a new one of building resilient water-and-land systems and adapting to climate change, and the outstanding one of achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Thus, the current KCD must be scaled up, and also structured with a longer-term perspective to support change and reform at policy and organisational levels building on iterative adaption. Policies should become pro-active shaped by modelled forecasts; and organisations more able to change and adapt to future scenarios that are complex, uncertain, and evolving rapidly. Enhancing the capacity to implement policies, establish 'learning organisations', and design iterative adaptive pathways requires sustained political commitment. While adopting a long-term programme, supportive KCD activities should stay realistic and manageable.","[Alaerts, G. J.] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Delft, Netherlands; [Kaspersma, J.

Policy-makers emphasise that the required transformation begins with local action. Yet, there is a gap in understanding why local action can remain largely locked-in to maladaptive cycles, with variable on-ground evidence of transformative change. Using 'the politics of scale,' we interrogated 'the local' using ethnographic interviews. We found that although local actors are engaged in various ways, 'doing' environmental work at a very local scale, their practices are constrained, reinforced by cultural, political, and economic arguments. We conceptualise 'hyper-localism' and 'temporal passivity' as emergent conditions that mask connectivity to wider social and ecological networks leading to transformative possibilities. We argue that global climate change discourses reinforce these internal conditions by failing to acknowledge the complexity associated with the 'politics of scale'. The local scale of change is not necessarily more manageable, or its actions likely to create a shared vision. Adaptation is reduced to performative tasks rather than connected processes, impacting the scope and effectiveness of change on ground. Further, in this Australian case study, we see how local 'doing' is still subject to the cross-scale impacts of diminishing nation-state government resourcing reflecting the far-reaching consequences of small government austerity models, and the foisting of responsibility for adaptation to the least powerful and least resourced sectors of civic society. We conclude with the idea that if local adaptation is to lead to transformative outcomes that connect to a global transcendence to affect climate direction, systems of governance need to be linked to strategic visions that deliberately engage with the 'politics of scale', and to affirm more complex processes in engaging with the fluidity of a purposeful global-local nexus.","[Lambert, Ana Elisa] Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Beilin, Ruth] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Baldwin Spencer Bldg, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",Yale University; University of Melbourne,"Lambert, AE (corresponding author), Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",ana.lambert@aya.yale.edu; rbeilin@unimelb.edu.au,,,Fox International Fellowship at Yale University,Fox International Fellowship at Yale University,"This work was supported by the Fox International Fellowship at Yale University, undertaken at Melbourne University.",,68,0,0,1,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

However, the mechanisms that guide this phenomenon, especially along latitude gradients, remain unclear. Leaf traits data, namely specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen content, leaf phosphorus content and leaf dry matter content in northeast China along the latitude was used to identify potential underlying climate and soil drivers of latitudinal gradients in plant traits. (1) Leaf traits of all life forms showed a wide variation across the study locations in northeastern China and the variation was strongly correlated with latitude. The latitudinal interpretation of leaf N and P content spatial differentiation is higher than other functional traits. (2)The latitudinal differences of functional traits were significantly correlated with climatic factors. With the increase of annual average temperature and annual average precipitation (MAT and MAP), specific leaf area (SLA) of leaves increased significantly, while leaf dry matter content (LDMC) decreased significantly (P < 0.05), The N content and P content of leaves showed significant nonlinear changes. The explanation degree of MAT to the spatial differentiation of most leaf traits is higher than the annual average precipitation (MAP). Soil factors also play an important role in shaping the spatial differentiation of leaf functional properties. With the increase of soil N and P content, leaf SLA and leaf N and P content also increased significantly (P < 0.05). The contribution of soil N content is higher than that of soil P content in shaping leaf traits.

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to partition space with a high-resolution grid to assess the temperature-mortality relationship in a territory with wide climate diversity, over a period with notable climate warming. METHODS: The 16,487,668 death certificates of persons > 65 years of age who died of natural causes in continental France (1968-2009) were analyzed. A 30-km x 30-km grid was placed over the map of France. Generalized additive model regression was used to assess the temperature-mortality relationship for each grid square, and extract the MMT and the RM25 and RM25/18 (respectively, the ratios of mortality at 25 degrees C/MMT and 25 degrees C/18 degrees C). Three periods were considered: 1968-1981 (P1), 1982-1995 (P2), and 1996-2009 (P3). RESULTS: All temperature-mortality curves computed over the 42-year period were U/J-shaped. MMT and mean summer temperature were strongly correlated. Mean MMT increased from 17.5 degrees C for P1 to 17.8 degrees C for P2 and to 18.2 degrees C for P3 and paralleled the summer temperature increase observed between P1 and P3. The temporal MMT rise was below that expected from the geographic analysis. The RM25/18 ratio of mortality at 25 degrees C versus that at 18 degrees C declined significantly (p = 5 x 10(-5)) as warming increased: 18% for P1, 16% for P2, and 15% for P3.

Here, we quantitatively demonstrate the role and significance of different drivers (climate change, fertilizer use, change in rice cultivation area, and changes in crop varieties and management) in explaining rice yield development in China, through the use of two temporally and regionally calibrated crop models - EPIC and DSSAT. China's rice yield has increased from 4324 kg ha(-1) in 1981 to 6553 kg ha(-1) in 2010, with an evidently slowing growth rate over this time period. The observed flattening growth trend is well captured by both crop models. EPIC simulated a yield increase of 2024 kg ha(-1) up to 2010, with agricultural intensification together with increased application of chemical fertilizer and improved crop varieties and management dominating the growth, contributing 64% and 37% respectively, while changes in climate (2%) and cultivation area (-3%) contributed only minimally. The recent slowing rate of rice yield growth is largely interpreted as a decreasing relative contribution of fertilizer, that is not being compensated by relative benefits from improved varieties and management. We also find that adaptation to climate change may have contributed to the observed increase of rice yield by facilitating the relocation of rice growing areas and the adoption of improved rice cultivars. Crop model simulations demonstrate that additional yield increases could be achieved through the introduction of rice cultivars and management optimized for climate, suggesting viable options for reversing the slowing of rice yield growth. Moving towards an agriculture that utilizes climate benefits more smartly is one of the solutions to enhance future food supply in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we collocated a comprehensive feature space for these river basins including Earth observation time series on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), surface water area (SWA), and snow cover area (SCA) in combination with driving variables between December 2002 and November 2020. First, we evaluated changes using multi-faceted trend analyses. Second, we employed the causal discovery algorithm Peter and Clark Momentary Conditional Independence (PCMCI) to disentangle interac-tions within the feature space. PCMCI quantifies direct and indirect relationships between variables and has been rarely applied to remote sensing applications. The results showed that vegetation greening continues significantly. Irrigated croplands in the Indus basin indicated the highest trend magnitude (0.042 NDVI/decade-1). At annual and basin scale, positive trends were also identified for SWA in the Indus (837 km2/decade-1) and Ganges basin (677 km2/decade-1). Annual trends in SCA were insignificant at basin scale. Considering elevation zones, negative SCA trends were found in high altitudes of the Ganges and Brahmaputra river basins. Similarly, NDVI and SWA showed positive trends in high elevations. Furthermore, the causal analysis revealed that NDVI was controlled by water avail-ability. SWA was directly influenced by river discharge and indirectly by precipitation. In high altitudes, SWA was controlled by SCA and temperature. Precipitation and temperature were identified as important drivers of SCA with spatio-temporal variations. With amplified climate change, the joint exploitation of time series will be of increasing importance to further enhance the understanding of land surface change and complex interplays across the spheres of the Earth system.

In general, urban green infrastructure (UGI) represents a vital sustainable strategy that can achieve climate change 'adaptation and mitigation' simultaneously. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of UGI in reducing SUHI in Baghdad city. Risafa municipality was selected as a case study, as it suffers from a high level of SUHI risk. Using a computer climatic simulation program; ENVI-met, the temperature of different surfaces in the study area was assessed, and two typical models were selected. Surface temperature (Ts) of different points in these two models was measured according to the base case scenario and to three proposed scenarios of UGI. The results show that UGI has an apparent role in declining Ts in both models. It was also found that the cooling effects of injecting UGI scenarios in similar surfaces of the two models are convergent. This confirms the UGI great effectiveness in reducing SUHI in Baghdad City. It is also found that the effectiveness of UGI in cooling the existing surfaces depends on the original condition of the surfaces and the intensity and types of the injected UGI assets.

Whilst there is extensive literature on adaptation options, there is a pressing need to understand what interventions have been successful in building smallholder's adaptive capacity, and how these have been transferred (nationally and internationally) through learning outcomes. The aim of this rapid evidence assessment was to assess the extent to which learning outcomes have supported initiatives to mainstream adaptation, focussing on three key areas, (i) scaling up climate sensitive adaptive interventions, (ii) the role of knowledge management to promote effective adaptive solutions, and (iii) human-ecosystem interactions in climate change adaptation. A protocol for the review was defined, from which 806 sources of evidence were retrieved. After screening for relevance using inclusion criteria, 91 were selected and the salient evidence extracted and synthesised. Access to knowledge remains one of the most important determinants of smallholders' decisions to respond to climate risk and a critical element in building adaptive capacity. The way knowledge is generated and exchanged is also directly relevant to securing effective scaling-up pathways. Learning platforms through participatory action research, farmer field schools and community-based initiatives were found to be particularly effective. However, knowledge based on local practices alone may be insufficient to prompt transformative action. Bridging local and external knowledge is critical because it widens the smallholders' knowledge base and encourages 'proactive' adaptation alongside more typical 'reactive' strategies. The contribution of evidence reviews to provide new insights to inform decision-making and investment in international development and the implications for advocating climate-sensitive policies at national and global levels are discussed.","[Silici, Laura] Via Gaspare Balbi 16, I-00122 Rome, Italy; [Rowe, Andy] 160 Westcott Rd, Salt Spring Isl, BC V8K 1C2, Canada; [Suppiramaniam, Nanthikesan] IFAD, Via Paolo di Dono 44, I-00142 Rome, Italy; [Knox, Jerry W.] Cranfield Univ, Cranfield Water Sci Inst, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England",Cranfield University,"Knox, JW (corresponding author), Cranfield Univ, Cranfield Water Sci Inst, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England.",j.knox@cranfield.ac.uk,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Knox, Jerry/A-4793-2010","Knox, Jerry/0000-0002-0473-6440",International Fund for Agriculture (IFAD),International Fund for Agriculture (IFAD),"This research was funded by the International Fund for Agriculture (IFAD) as part of a broader thematic evaluation of their global development programme on smallholder adaptation to climate change.

Up to date, most of related literatures only focus on one fold of the following issues concerning the derivation of AOR using the GCMs ensemble, including: (1) consideration of different scenario weighing methods, or (2) analysis of different positions to locate scenario weights. And less concern is given to the latter compared with the former. However, few studies identify the relationship between (1) and (2) in the derivation of AOR based on the GCMs ensemble. In this study, we attempt to investigate where to use Equal and REA scenario weights in the derivation of reservoir operating rules under climate change. Equal weights (EW) and unequal weights based on the reliability ensemble average (REA) method are used in two positions: (I) the optimization objective of the reservoir operation model, which is to maximize the weighted average hydropower generation for all future scenarios; and (II) the incorporation of GCMs ensemble climate projections into the weighted climate conditions, and then it is input into the reservoir operation model with the objective of maximizing annual hydropower generation. Four AORs, including EW-AOR(I), REA-AOR(I), EW-AOR(II) and REA-AOR(II), are derived, and their optimized parameters are obtained by the simulation-based optimization (SBO) method with the Complex algorithm. The case study in the Jinxi Reservoir in China indicates that REA-AOR(I) outperforms the other three operation schemes, and EW-AOR(II) performs better than REA-AOR(II). Therefore, equal weights are preferably used to incorporate climate conditions, while unequal weights based on REA method can improve the performance of the reservoir operation model. Generally, REA-AOR(I) and EW-AOR(II) are suggested for adaptive reservoir management under climate change.","[Zhang, Wei; Liu, Pan; Wang, Hao] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Lei, Xiaohui; Wang, Xu; Wang, Hao] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Song, Peibing] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research; Zhejiang University,"Lei, XH (corresponding author), China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.",rainfields@qq.com,"liu, pan/HIR-9103-2022; lei, xiaohui/P-9669-2017",,National Key Research and Development Project [2016YFC0402208]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51709276]; National Key Technology RD Program [2015BAB07B03],National Key Research and Development Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Technology RD Program(National Key Technology R&D Program),"The authors would like to thank the editor and anonymous reviewers for their valuable suggestions, which helped to improve the quality of the paper.

Numerous studies have examined the relationship between socio-ecological factors and HFMD however the research findings were inconsistent. This study examined the association between socio-ecologic factors and HFMD in multiple provinces across Vietnam. Methods: We applied a spatial autoregressive model using a Bayesian framework to examine the relationship between HFMD and socio-demographic factors. We used a Generalized Linear Model (GLD) with Poisson family to examine the province-specific association between monthly HFMD and climatic factors while controlling for spatial lag, seasonality and long-term trend of HFMD. Then, we used a random-effect meta-analysis to generate pooled effect size of climate-HFMD association for regional and country scale. Results: One percent increase in newborn breastfed within 1 h of birth, households with permanent houses, and households accessed to safe water resulted in 1.57% (95% CI: -2.25, -0.93), 0.96% (-1.66, -0.23), and 1.13% (-2.16, -0.18) reduction in HFMD incidence, respectively. At the country-level, HFMD increased 7% (RR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.052-1.088) and 3.1% (RR: 1.031, 95% CI: 1.024-1.039) for 1 degrees C increase in monthly temperature above 26 degrees C and 1% increase in monthly humidity above 76%. Whereas, HFMD decreased 3.1% associated with 1 mm increase in monthly cumulative rainfalls. The climate-HFMD relationship was varied by regions and provinces across the country. Conclusions: The findings reflect an important implication for the climate change adaptation strategies and public-health decision, of which development of weather-based early warning systems should be considered to strengthen communicable disease prevention system.

As such one of its core goal is to align research and pilot projects with infrastructure development constraints and priorities. Under NAS, the integrated contribution of natural infrastructure to Disaster Risk Reduction is valued in the context of an identified growing need for climate robust infrastructure. The potential of NAS benefits and trade-off are explored by through the alternative lens of Disaster Resilience Enhancement (DRE). Such a system requires a joint effort of specific knowledge transfer from research groups and stakeholders to potential future NAS developers and investors. We therefore match the knowledge gaps with operational stages of the development of NAS from a project designer perspective. We start by highlighting the key role of the insurance industry in incentivizing and assessing disaster and slow onset resilience enhancement strategies. In parallel we place the public sector as potential kick-starters in DRE initiatives through the existing initiatives and constraints of infrastructure procurement. Under this perspective the paper explores the required alignment of Integrated Water resources planning and Public investment systems. Ultimately this will provide the possibility for both planners and investors to design no regret NBS and mixed Grey-Green infrastructures systems. As resources and constraints are widely different between infrastructure development contexts, the framework does not provide explicit methodological choices but presents current limits of knowledge and know-how. In conclusion the paper underlines the potential of NAS to ease the infrastructure gap in water globally by stressing the advantages of investment in the protection, enhancement and restoration of natural capital as an effective climate change adaptation investment.","[Denjean, Benjamin] Beijing Forestry Univ, 35 Qinghua E Rd, Wudaokou 100085, Haidian Qu, Peoples R China; [Denjean, Benjamin] Asia Ctr, 71 Blvd Raspail, F-75006 Paris, France; [Altamirano, Monica A.] Deltares, Water Resources & Delta Management, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands; [Graveline, Nina] Univ Montpellier, BRGM, 1039 Rue Pinville, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Giordano, Raffaele] CNR, Water Res Inst, Via De Blasio 5, I-70132 Bari, Italy; [van der Keur, Peter] Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland GEUS, Dept Hydrol, Oster Voldgade 10, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Moncoulon, David] CCR, Modelling R&D Tech Studies Reinsurance Dept, 157 Blvd Haussmann, F-75008 Paris, France; [Weinberg, Josh] Stockholm Int Water Inst, Linnegatan 87A, SE-10055 Stockholm, Sweden; [Costa, Maria Manez] Helmholtz Ctr Geesthacht, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, Eingang B Fischertwiete 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany; [Kozinc, Zdravko] Inst Dev Local Potentials, Retece 215, Skofja Loka 4220, Slovenia; [Mulligan, Mark] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Pengal, Polona] REVIVO, Inst Ichthyol & Ecol Res, PE Ljubljana, Staretova 1, SI-1233 Dob, Slovenia; [Matthews, John] Alliance Global Water Adaptat, 7640 NW Hoodview Circle, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA; [van Cauwenbergh, Nora] IHE Delft, Inst Water Educ, Dept Integrated Water Syst & Governance, Westvest 7,POB 3015, NL-2601 DA Delft, Netherlands; [Gunn, Elena Lopez] Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Bresch, David N.] ETH, Inst Environm Decis, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Denjean, Benjamin] 21 Rue Jacques Fereol Mazas, F-34500 Beziers, France",Beijing Forestry University; Deltares; Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM); Universite de Montpellier; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Ricerca sulle Acque (IRSA-CNR); Geological Survey Of Denmark & Greenland; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; University of London; King's College London; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; University of Leeds; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Denjean, B (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, 35 Qinghua E Rd, Wudaokou 100085, Haidian Qu, Peoples R China.;Denjean, B (corresponding author), Asia Ctr, 71 Blvd Raspail, F-75006 Paris, France.;Denjean, B (corresponding author), 21 Rue Jacques Fereol Mazas, F-34500 Beziers, France.",ben.denjean@gmail.com; Monica.altamirano@deltares.nl; n.graveline@brgm.fr; Raffaele.giordano@cnr.it; pke@geus.dk; dmoncoulon@ccr.fr; Josh.Weinberg@siwi.org; maria.manez@hzg.de; zdravko.kozinc@iskriva.net; mark.mulligan@kcl.ac.uk; Polona.pengal@ozivimo.si; johoma@alliance4water.org; n.vancauwenbergh@un-ihe.org; elopezgunn@icatalist.eu; dbrsch@meteoswiss.ch,"Graveline, Nina/AAG-5114-2020; Giordano, Raffaele/B-7388-2015; Costa, Maria Mánez/P-1225-2017; Mulligan, Mark/V-9275-2019; GIORDANO, RAFFAELE/AAX-7089-2020; Bresch, David N./D-5298-2018; Van Cauwenbergh, Nora/M-7205-2013; van der Keur, Peter/H-6311-2018","Graveline, Nina/0000-0002-7976-0007; Giordano, Raffaele/0000-0002-8103-4055; Costa, Maria Mánez/0000-0001-5415-0811; Bresch, David N./0000-0002-8431-4263; Mulligan, Mark/0000-0002-0132-0888; Altamirano, Monica A./0000-0002-7892-3345; Van Cauwenbergh, Nora/0000-0002-3005-0952; van der Keur, Peter/0000-0001-6988-6266",,,,,100,29,29,6,68,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0013-9351,1096-0953,,ENVIRON RES,Environ.

This comparison focuses on global-scale changes in extremes as summarized in two summary tables from the AR4 and SREX, respectively. Many of the compared SREX and AR4 assessments of changes in extremes are essentially identical or in partial agreement, once the different language and different approaches to estimating uncertainty are taken into account. Two main exceptions are tropical cyclones and droughts. In the case of tropical cyclones, a less confident SREX assessment of past changes reflects post-AR4 studies that have improved our understanding of the uncertainties in the historical tropical cyclone records, the incomplete understanding of the physical mechanisms linking tropical cyclone metrics to climate change, and the degree of tropical cyclone variability. In the case of droughts, (d)efinitional issues and lack of dataaEuro broken vertical bar plus the inability of models to include all the factors likely to influence droughts have led to overall weaker SREX assessments than was the case in AR4, both for observed and projected changes, although differences in the statements being assessed also explain some of the differences. Increased consistency of approach between assessments would simplify future attempts to compare the assessed uncertainties associated with changes in extremes, although changes in the wording of such assessments also needs to be considered. For instance, some aspects of the SREX assessments were the consequence of the revised IPCC uncertainty guidance, which was prepared mid-way through the SREX process.","[Nicholls, Neville] Monash Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Seneviratne, Sonia I.] ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland",Monash University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Nicholls, N (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia.",Neville.Nicholls@monash.edu,"Seneviratne, Sonia I./G-8761-2011; Nicholls, Neville/A-1240-2008","Seneviratne, Sonia I./0000-0001-9528-2917; Nicholls, Neville/0000-0002-1298-4356",Australian Research Council [DP0877417]; Australian Research Council [DP0877417] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The Lead Authors of the SREX Chapter 3 (David Easterling, Clare M.

To make the best use of these potentials, agricultural management should be adjusted to local climatic conditions. As these conditions change over time, understanding climatic limitations and their trends in time and space is essential for the planning of suitable adaptation measures. In this study, we provide a detailed spatio-temporal analysis of climatic yield potentials for grain maize and winter wheat in Switzerland. We find that current climatic suitability for grain maize is mostly limited by sub-optimal temperatures, radiation and water scarcity, while climatic suitability for winter wheat is mostly limited through excess water, insufficient radiation, as well as frost and heat stress. Over the investigated period from 1983 to 2010, few regional trends in climate suitability were identified for the two crops, indicating that grain maize has benefitted slightly from increasing growth temperatures with recent warming (0.5 degrees C/decade), while winter wheat suitability decreased slightly due to suboptimal radiation/temperature ratios with warming. Despite only small trends in climate suitabilities, which are restricted to particular regions, future climatic changes could lead to more pronounced shifts. The tendencies of climate limitations identified in this study are mostly consistent with findings from other studies, and it can thus be anticipated that maize may continue to benefit from increasing temperatures on the short term, but may also be increasingly limited by water scarcity as summer precipitation decreases. For winter wheat, the relevance of heat stress is likely to increase with increasing temperatures. These results may help to support short-term adaptation planning.

Disasters are increasingly uncertain and complex due to rapid environmental and socio-economic changes occurring at multiple scales. Understanding the causes and impacts of disasters requires comprehensive, systematic and multi-disciplinary analysis. This paper introduces recent multidisciplinary work on resilience, disaster risk reduction (DRR), climate change adaptation (CCA) and adaptive governance and then proposes a new and innovative framework for adaptive and integrated disaster resilience (AIDR). AIDR is defined as the ability of nations and communities to build resilience in an integrated manner and strengthen mechanisms to build system adaptiveness. AIDR provides the ability to face complexities and uncertainties by designing institutional processes that function across sectors and scales, to engage multiple stakeholders and to promote social learning. Based on the review of existing academic and non-academic literature, we identify seven pathways to achieve AIDR. These pathways are a conceptual tool to support scholars, policy makers and practitioners to better integrate existing DRR strategies with CCA and more general development concerns. They describe institutional strategies that are aimed at dealing with complexities and uncertainties by integrating DRR, CCA and development; strengthening polycentric governance; fostering collaborations; improving knowledge and information; enabling institutional learning; self-organisation and networking; and provision of disaster risk finance and insurance. We also examine the implications of these pathways for Indonesia, one of the most vulnerable countries to natural hazards and climate change impacts. Our findings suggest that there is an urgent need to commit more resources to and strengthen multi-stakeholder collaboration at the local level. We also argue for placing the community at the centre of an integrated and adaptive approach to DRR and CCA.","[Djalante, Riyanti; Thomalla, Frank] Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Holley, Cameron] Univ New S Wales, Fac Law, Natl Ctr Groundwater Res & Training Connected Wat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Carnegie, Michelle] Australian Catholic Univ, Sch Arts & Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Macquarie University; University of New South Wales Sydney; Australian Catholic University,"Djalante, R (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",riyanti.djalante@mq.edu.au,"Holley, Cameron/N-3314-2016; Djalante, Riyanti/X-3179-2019","Holley, Cameron/0000-0003-2747-9587; Djalante, Riyanti/0000-0001-6301-8409; Carnegie, Michelle/0000-0001-6493-6922",Australia Development Scholarship; CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship,Australia Development Scholarship; CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),"The first author is an Indonesian PhD student supported by the Australia Development Scholarship and top-up scholarship from CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship.

Drawing on these perspectives, it is worthwhile to find out whether and how disagreements among public authorities create barriers to public sector adaptation and preparedness. As the literature on weather vulnerabilities and climate adaptation recommends increased public sector coordination, exploring the possibilities of governance can contribute to the improvement of lifeline conditions. Insights from a Norwegian case study suggest that the different mandates of responsible public authorities sometimes clash. Such clashes limit the abilities to sustain welfare and business conditions when avalanches and blizzards cause highway outages. The findings also show that governance might only partly improve public sector peril response measures, as there is rarely sufficient flexibility to consider specific interests or preferences, for example, to keep a highway open until a school bus or a freight delivery has passed.","[Leiren, Merethe Dotterud] CICERO Ctr Int Climate Res, Climate Policy, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Jacobsen, Jens Kr Steen] Inst Transport Econ, Dept Mobil & Org, Oslo, Norway",Institute of Transport Economics,"Leiren, MD (corresponding author), CICERO Ctr Int Climate Res, Climate Policy, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",merethe.leiren@cicero.oslo.no,,"Jacobsen, Jens Kr.

Alternatives formed in the scenario approach allow identifying an aggregate of possible directions of environment development and thus create a basis for making strategic decisions. This paper considers theoretical and methodological basis of scenario planning, including various approaches and methods of scenario formation. Experience of this method application in Kazakhstan and abroad was studied. The paper identifies natural factors affecting water-supply conditions. Advisability of forming external environment development scenarios was justified for further development of alternative strategies for hydrogeological survey improvement. Based on the algorithm of forming and transboundary levels until 2030 of the proposed principles, scenarios were developed for creating plans of sustainable water-supply under conditions of climatic and anthropogenic changes at the regional, national and transboundary levels. In order to develop strategies and scenarios, as well as to identify vulnerabilities and negative impacts of climate change, it is necessary to have complete information and data on the entire basin. Therefore, it is necessary to collect and share the necessary information, data and models related to the basin as a whole, as well as all components of the water cycle. Managing the process of adaptation to climate change, it is necessary to monitor the situation and regularly update assessments, climate change scenarios and forecasts of the state of the water balance. Climate change should be considered as one of the main causes of changes in the environment of water basins, and as one of the many factors that put pressure on water resources. Therefore, adaptation scenarios for specific basins should take into account not only climate change, but also changes in the demographic situation, economic growth dynamics, dietary preferences, and so on. These scenarios should be developed with the greatest possible cooperation with neighboring countries, and most importantly, using data and models that are consistent with them.","[Mukhamedzhanov, M.

The newly generated information was used to support discussions with the participating farmers in the search for options to design more profitable and sustainable farming systems in Queensland Australia. The four case studies contrasted in key systems characteristics: opportunism in decision making, i.e. flexible versus rigid crop rotations; function, i.e. production of livestock or crops; and level of intensification, i.e. dryland versus irrigated agriculture. Tested tactical and strategic changes under a baseline and climate change scenario (CCS) involved changes in the allocation of land between cropping and grazing enterprises, alternative allocations of limited irrigation water across cropping enterprises, and different management rules for planting wheat and sorghum in rainfed cropping. The results show that expected impacts from a likely climate change scenario were evident in the following increasing order: the irrigated cropping farm case study, the cropping and grazing farm, the more opportunistic rainfed cropping farm and the least opportunistic rainfed cropping farm. We concluded that in most cases the participating farmers were operating close to the efficiency frontier (i.e. in the relationship between profits and risks). This indicated that options to adapt to climate change might need to evolve from investments in the development of more innovative cropping and grazing systems and/or transformational changes on existing farming systems. We expect that even though assimilating expected changes in climate seems to be rather intangible and premature for these farmers, as innovations are developed, adaptation is likely to follow quickly. The multiple interactions among farm management components in complex and dynamic farm businesses operating in a variable and changing climate, make the use of whole farm participatory modelling approaches valuable tools to quantify benefits and trade-offs from alternative farming systems designs in the search for improved profitability and resilience.

The water table level has declined rapidly due to intensive pumping. Artificial recharge methods and good management strategies are vital for the sustainable production of groundwater resources. Managed aquifer recharge is an artificial way of recharging the subsurface aquifers using surplus surface water, treated wastewater, and stormwater. It is a potential strategy for increasing freshwater supply and adapting to climate change. The present study proposes a method to delineate potential zones for MAR suitability in the Kuchlak Sub-Basin. INOWAS, a web-based tool, is utilized for narrowing down the available MAR techniques based on the hydrogeologic parameter and objectives of the study area. A geographic information system (GIS) coupled with the multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), commonly known as GIS-MCDA, is used to develop the MAR suitability map. Six criterion maps, including geology, land use, slope analysis, drainage density, soil, and rainfall, were created in ArcGIS for suitability mapping. The criterion maps are ranked and weighted based on their relative contribution to the groundwater recharge and published literature using the Multi Influence Factor (MIF) method. The final suitability map was developed by overlaying all the criterion maps using a weighted linear combination (WLC) technique. The MAR suitability map was divided into five zones, namely, very high, high, moderate, very low, and low. The unsuitable zones reflect the urban and slope constraints that reduce surface infiltration. The suitability map reveals that 45% of the Kuchlak Sub-Basin exists in a very high-high suitability zone, 33% in moderate, and 17% in a very low-low suitability zone, while 5% of the study area was unsuitable due to the urban and slope constraints. The MAR suitability map developed in this study can serve as a basis for conducting a focused analysis of MAR implementation. Furthermore, the technique and results of this study may aid in mapping MAR suitability in any arid or semi-arid region.","[Sardar, Hassan; Akhter, Gulraiz] Quaid i Azam Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Akhter, Gulraiz] CAS HEC, China Pakistan Joint Res Ctr Earth Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Ge, Yonggang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Ge, Yonggang] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Mt Hazards & Earth Surface Proc, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Haider, Syed Ammar] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Phys & Appl Geol, Budapest, Hungary","Quaid I Azam University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Mountain Hazards & Environment, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Eotvos Lorand University","Akhter, G (corresponding author), Quaid i Azam Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan.;Akhter, G (corresponding author), CAS HEC, China Pakistan Joint Res Ctr Earth Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan.",agulraiz@qau.edu.pk,,,International Science & Technology Cooperation Program of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative [2018YFE0100100];  [2021VCA0010],International Science & Technology Cooperation Program of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative; ,This research is financially supported by the International Science & Technology Cooperation Program of China (2018YFE0100100) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative (Grant No. 2021VCA0010).,,52,0,0,1,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

Hence, the reservoir operation model, based on historical climate conditions, may not guarantee sustainable water resources management in the future. To enable stakeholders to design reliable adaptation strategies, this study aims to propose a cascading framework to quantify the impacts of climate change on the operational performance and sustainability of a multipurpose reservoir. The Danjiangkou Reservoir (DJKR), which serves as the water source for the middle route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project in China, was selected as a case study. To achieve the aforementioned aims, bias-corrected simulations from 13 global climate models (GCMs) were first input into five hydrological models [i.e., one data-driven [deep belief network (DBN)], three conceptual [SIMHYD, HBV, and Xin'anjiang (XAJ)], and one physically-based [variable infiltration capacity (VIC)]. The simulated reservoir inflows were then fed into a 10-day reservoir simulation model where DJKR operation followed the designed operating rules to evaluate reservoir operational performance. Finally, a data envelopment analysis (DEA) model was proposed to assess reservoir sustainability under both historical (1976-2005) and future (2021-2050) climate conditions. The results show that the combination of the GCM ensembles and the SIMHYD, HBV, XAJ, and VIC models exhibit similar growth patterns in the reservoir inflow and operational benefits for the future period. However, the DBN model produces consistent decreases in most cases, which may be attributed to its inability to generate accurate estimates of extreme events. The results indicate that hydrological models may be extensively utilized in decision making with greater confidence, and the data-driven model should be interpreted with caution when used in hydrological climate change impact studies. The efficiency metrics suggest that decision makers should focus more on increasing operational benefits, which can subsequently enhance reservoir sustainability. Overall, the framework proposed in this study provides a foundation for evaluating the reservoir sustainability and adaptability to climate change from water managers' perspective.","[Xu, Wenxin; Chen, Jie; Su, Tianhua; Kim, Jong-Suk; Gu, Lei] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Xu, Wenxin; Chen, Jie; Su, Tianhua; Kim, Jong-Suk; Gu, Lei] Wuhan Univ, Hubei Key Lab Water Syst Sci Sponge City Construc, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Lee, Joo-Heon] Joongbu Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Goyang Si 10279, Gyeunggi Do, South Korea; [Lee, Joo-Heon] Joongbu Univ, Drought Res Ctr, Goyang Si 10279, Gyeunggi Do, South Korea",Wuhan University; Wuhan University; Joongbu University; Joongbu University,"Chen, J (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.;Chen, J (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Hubei Key Lab Water Syst Sci Sponge City Construc, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",2015301580222@whu.edu.cn; jiechen@whu.edu.cn; 576019449@qq.com; jongsuk@uos.ac.kr; shisan@hust.edu.cn; leejh@joongbu.ac.kr,"Gu, Lei/GWQ-6785-2022","Gu, Lei/0000-0001-8291-9894; Kim, Jong-Suk/0000-0002-5274-5085","Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [2020CFA100]; Natural Science Foundation of China [51779176, 52079093]; Overseas Expertise Introduction Project for Discipline Innovation (111 Project) - Ministry of Education and State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs, P.R.

Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate future climate scenarios and the responses of hydrological variables such as precipitation, actual (ETreal) and potential evapotranspiration (ETc), and recharge rate. Climate change scenarios were based on temperature and precipitation variations predicted by CMIP5. Four representative concentrations pathways (RCP) were considered according to different greenhouse emissions to the atmosphere for the nearby future until the end of the twenty-first century (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5). Furthermore, one more scenario called RCP0.0 was considered, which is related to the actual climate conditions and represents the base line. In the study area, nitrogen (N) fertilization is a widely used practice to increase crop yields. This work assesses the impact of future climate on soil water fluxes and N compounds fate based on numerical simulations carried out with HYDRUS 1D. Actual evapotranspiration is going to increase between 1 and 6% from low to high climate-change scenarios. Although an increase in precipitation is also expected during all months of the year, there are periods when water availability will not be enough to supply the new potential evapotranspiration demand. The worst case is RCP8.5, where the ETreal/ETc ratio is expected to decline by 4%. Annual recharge is expected to decrease by 2.5% in the RCP2.6 scenario, while the rest of the scenarios shown positive trends. N leachate in the form of nitrates showed an increase of 2.8% in the RCP4.5 scenario which was also the one with the highest recharge rate raise. The use of a mathematical model as a predictive tool in soil water fluxes and fertilizers use is essential for planning the sustainable management of agroecology adapted to climate changes.","[Scherger, Leonardo E.; Zanello, Victoria] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CCT Bahia Blanca, Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Scherger, Leonardo E.; Zanello, Victoria; Lexow, Claudio] Univ Nacl Sur UNS, Dept Geol, Av Alem 1253, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Valdes-Abellan, Javier] Univ Alicante UA, Dept Ingn Civil, Alicante, Spain",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); National University of the South; Universitat d'Alacant,"Scherger, LE (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CCT Bahia Blanca, Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina.;Scherger, LE (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Sur UNS, Dept Geol, Av Alem 1253, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",leonardo.scherger@uns.edu.ar,"Valdes-Abellan, Javier/K-1993-2017","Valdes-Abellan, Javier/0000-0003-3570-4983; Leonardo Ezequiel, Scherger/0000-0002-8361-6315",Universidad Nacional del Sur (UNS); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),Universidad Nacional del Sur (UNS); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)),This research is financially supported by the Universidad Nacional del Sur (UNS) and Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET).,,68,6,6,0,0,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2509-9426,2509-9434,,EARTH SYST ENVIRON,Earth Syst.

In the past 10 years, the central government has implemented the Rural Regeneration Project (RRP) aimed at revitalization and sustainable development in rural Taiwan. During the project's implementation, communities have faced several disasters as a result of climate change-induced extreme rainfall events. Perceptions and adaptation practices of climate change-induced extreme events are critical to community sustainability and resilience. The gap between perceived and actual risks that communities experience creates challenges for policy-makers in achieving sustainability goals. This study aims to evaluate the perceived climate change-induced flooding hazard perceptions compared to the scientific projection and actual hazard events in 287 rural communities implementing the RRP. This study revealed consistency in risk perception, in that communities facing high potential exposure to extreme rainfall showed higher awareness of various impacts of climate change. However, when comparing climate actions, communities exposed to low-potential hazard areas had a relatively higher degree of recognition of the benefits of adaptation to climate change. Moreover, 59 rural communities with low awareness and exposed to high potentials of extreme events were widely distributed among hills of western, southern, and northern Taiwan, where compound disasters such as mudslides can occur. This research suggests that there is a need to integrate climate change planning and work with communities to bridge the gap between perceived and actual climate risks. In particular, capacity training, counseling services, and implementation of adaptation practices should be integrated into institutional planning and management for providing assistance in disaster prevention, relief, and post-event restoration; also, encouraging climate actions can directly improve community resilience toward climate change. While investing in the sustainable development of rural communities is largely based on revitalizing economic development, this study revealed the link to ensure resilience and social-ecological sustainability in rural communities under climate change impacts.","[Lai, Chun-Hsien; Wang, Yung-Chieh] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Soil & Water Conservat, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Liao, Pi-Ching; Wu, Chen-Fa] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Hort, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Chen, Szu-Hung] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Int Master Program Agr, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Cheng, Chingwen] Arizona State Univ, Design Sch, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",National Chung Hsing University; National Chung Hsing University; National Chung Hsing University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Wu, CF (corresponding author), Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Hort, Taichung 402, Taiwan.",wulai.studio@smail.nchu.edu.tw; d105032007@mail.nchu.edu.tw; vickey@dragon.nchu.edu.tw; wangyc@nchu.edu.tw; Chingwen.Cheng@asu.edu; cfwu@dragon.nchu.edu.tw,,"Wang, Yung-Chieh/0000-0002-8812-3894; Chen, Szu-Hung/0000-0003-0016-1982; Wu, Chen-Fa/0000-0001-9417-0681","Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China, Taiwan [MOST 105-2621-M-005 -003 -MY3, 108-2625-M-005 -010]; Ministry of Education, Taiwan, R.O.C. under the Higher Education Sprout Project","Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Ministry of Education, Taiwan, R.O.C. under the Higher Education Sprout Project","The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China, Taiwan, for financially supporting this research under Contract No. MOST 105-2621-M-005 -003 -MY3, 108-2625-M-005 -010 and the Ministry of Education, Taiwan, R.O.C. under the Higher Education Sprout Project.",,71,10,10,8,37,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2021,13,7,,,,,,,3651,10.3390/su13073651,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13073651,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RL4FM,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000638931300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we implement a readily portable procedure for building an upgradable long-term homogeneous climate dataset using monthly and daily observations of temperature and precipitation over a given area of interest, exemplified here with Abruzzo, a region in Central Italy characterized by complex orography. We process the dataset according to a preliminary ranking of stations based on data quantity and quality, and we exploit the Climatol algorithm for inhomogeneity correction. The corrected time series show trends in broad agreement with external databases (CRU, Berkeley Earth, E-OBS), and highlight the importance of relying on a local network for a better representation of gradients and variability over the territory. We estimate that maximum (TX) and minimum temperature (TN) increased by similar to 1.6 and similar to 2.2 degrees C/century, respectively, over the period 1930-2019, while in the recent decades 1980-2019 we found an accelerated trend of similar to 5.7 and similar to 3.9 degrees C/century. Precipitation (RR) decreased by similar to 10%/century in 1930-2019, while it has been increasing at a rate of similar to 26%/century in 1980-2019. The Koppen-Geiger climate classification is sensitive to the increase of precipitation in the recent decades, which is attributable to decreased summer precipitation overcompensated by more rain in late spring and early autumn. The cold climate types are retreating upwards along the slopes of the mountain ranges. Over the period 1980-2019, extreme values are also displaying significant trends. Every 2 years, there is one less frost day (TN <0 degrees C) and one more summer day (TX >25 degrees C) in the Apennines area, while there is one more tropical night (TN >20 degrees C) in the Adriatic coastal area. Precipitation extremes are increasing, especially along the coast, with rain accumulated in the rainiest days increasing at a rate of 1-2%/year.","[Curci, Gabriele; Di Antonio, Ludovico] Univ Aquila, Dipartimento Sci Fis & Chim, Laquila, Italy; [Curci, Gabriele] Univ Aquila, Ctr Excellence Telesensing Environm & Model Predi, Laquila, Italy; [Guijarro, Jose A.; Scorzini, Anna Rita] Agencia Estatal Meteorol AEMET, Delegac Terr Illes Balears, Palma De Mallorca, Spain; [Di Bacco, Mario] Univ Aquila, Dipartimento Ingn Civile, Edile Architettura, Ambientale, Laquila, Italy; [Di Lena, Bruno] Ctr Agrometeorol Reg, Scerni, Regione Abruzzo, Italy",University of L'Aquila; University of L'Aquila; Agencia Estatal de Meteorologia (AEMET); University of L'Aquila,"Curci, G (corresponding author), Univ Aquila, Dipartimento Sci Fis & Chim, Laquila, Italy.",gabriele.curci@univaq.it,"Curci, Gabriele/A-2020-2011; Di Bacco, Mario/AAZ-6559-2020","Curci, Gabriele/0000-0001-9871-5570; Di Bacco, Mario/0000-0002-2483-3977; Di Antonio, Ludovico/0000-0003-0528-7082",,,,,54,12,12,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has a low agricultural portion, but it is an increasing minority, which plays an important role in regional food security due to growing population. The region of Brahmaputra River and its two tributaries in Tibet Autonomous Region (BRIT) is the main alpine agricultural area in the TP. Rapid warming has substantially affected agro-climate resources there and altered cropland pattern as well as cropping intensity. In this study, we explored how climate warming affected cropping intensity in past decades in BRTT. The potentially spatial distributions of single and double cropping systems in different decades (1970s, 19805, 1990s and 2000s) were simulated based on a cropping suitability model, considering climatic, terrain and water factors. The results showed a significant increase of cropping intensity in some regions, in response to climate warming. The area suitable for single cropping increased from 19 110 km(2) in 1970s to 19 980 km(2) in 2000s, expanding from the downstream valleys of Lhasa River and Nyang Qu River of the tributaries of Brahmaputra to upstream valleys. The area suitable for double cropping gradually increased from 9 km(2) in 1970s to 2015 km(2) in 2000s, expanding from the lower reaches of Brahmaputra River in Lhoka Prefecture to the upper ones, as well as the Lhasa River tributaries. The upper limit elevation suitable for single cropping rose vertically from 5001 m above sea level (ASL) to 5032m ASL from 1970s to 2000s, meanwhile that of double cropping rose from 3608 m ASL to 3813 m ASL. Overall, increased cropland area and cropping intensity due to climatic warming could increase food production in BRIT to some extent. Further investigation about potential uncertain effects from warming is still needed for regional agricultural adaption to climate change. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Exploring factors that constrain or facilitate the adaptation process in complex fisheries socio-ecological systems can enable greater insight into why certain adaptation strategies may succeed or fail and help inform adaptation planning. Using data collected from interviews and workshops in four commercial fishing communities in New England along the Northeast US coastline, we ask what barriers and enablers of climate adaptation are being experienced or perceived, and where within the fisheries socio-ecological system they are emerging. Thematic analysis identified a variety of barriers and enablers of adapta-tion, of which many were shared across communities, while others were unique to particular localities. Barriers included fisheries specialisation and dependency, overcapitalisation, working waterfront issues, limited access to alternative fisheries, management system responsiveness, wider community perceptions, and workforce chal-lenges. Enablers included perceived industry and community adaptability, knowledge and learning capacity, working waterfront protections, diverse shoreside services, and fisher-led conservation efforts. Barriers and enablers therefore arose not just among fishers themselves, but emerged throughout the socio-ecological system, highlighting the importance of multi-scale influences on adaptation processes. Climate adaptation planning in fisheries contexts should extend beyond approaches that consider the resource and resource user to also account for the changes, barriers and opportunities occurring shoreside and influencing the future of the fishing com-munity as a whole.","[Maltby, Katherine M.; Kerin, Sabrina; Mills, Katherine E.] Gulf Maine Res Inst, 350 Commercial St, Portland, ME 04101 USA",Gulf of Maine Research Institute,"Maltby, KM (corresponding author), Gulf Maine Res Inst, 350 Commercial St, Portland, ME 04101 USA.",kmaltby@gmri.org,,,NOAA's Coastal and Ocean Climate Applications program [NA150AR4310120],NOAA's Coastal and Ocean Climate Applications program,"We are very grateful to interview and workshop participants who engaged in this research and subsequent meeting and workshops.

In order to enable learning by comparing and generating new knowledge from multiple NBS related studies, a novel data and knowledge base is needed which requires a specified methodological approach for its development. This paper provides conceptual and methodological context and techniques for constructing such a data and knowledge base that will systematically support the process of NBS monitoring and assessment: A methodology presents the comprehensive, multi-step approach to the NBS data and knowledge development that helps to guide work and influence the quality of an information included. The paper describes the methodology and main steps/phases for developing a large data and knowledge base of NBS that will allow further systematic review. The suggested methodology explains how to build NBS related databases from the conceptualization and requirements phases through to implementation and maintenance. In this regard, such a methodology is iterative, with extensive NBS stakeholders' and end-user's involvement that are packaged with reusable templates or deliverables offering a good opportunity for success when used by practitioners and other end-users. The NBS data and knowledge base gathers information about different NBS models and generations into one easy-to-find, easy-to-use place and provides detailed descriptions of each of the 1490 NBS cases from urban centers in Europe. The data and knowledge base thus helps users identify the best and most appropriated NBS model/type for addressing the particular goals and, at the same time, considers the local context and potential. The data obtained can be used for the further meta-analysis by applying statistics or searching for specific sample cases and thus enables to generate and expand the knowledge from multiple NBS related studies, in both qualitative and quantitative ways.

The applied climate datasets were performed in the framework of the COordinated Regional climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX-Africa) project. After evaluation of the historical runs of the climate models' ensemble, a statistical bias correction (empirical quantile mapping) was applied to daily precipitation. Temperature and bias corrected precipitation data from the ensemble of RCMs-GCMs was then used as input for the Water flow and balance Simulation Model (WaSiM) to simulate water balance components. The mean hydrological and climate variables for two periods (1971-2000 and 2021-2050) were compared to assess the potential impact of climate change on water resources up to the middle of the 21st century under two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios, the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. The results indicate (i) a clear signal of temperature increase of about 0.1 to 2.6 degrees C for all members of the RCM-GCM ensemble; (ii) high uncertainty about how the catchment precipitation will evolve over the period 2021-2050; (iii) the applied bias correction method only affected the magnitude of the climate change signal; (iv) individual climate models results lead to opposite discharge change signals; and (v) the results for the RCM-GCM ensemble are too uncertain to give any clear direction for future hydrological development. Therefore, potential in-crease and decrease in future discharge have to be considered in climate change adaptation strategies in the catchment. The results further underline on the one hand the need for a larger ensemble of projections to properly estimate the impacts of climate change on water resources in the catchment and on the other hand the high uncertainty associated with climate projections for the West African region. A water-energy budget analysis provides further insight into the behavior of the catchment.","[Yira, Yacouba; Diekkrueger, Bernd; Steup, Gero] Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, Meckenheimer Allee 166, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Bossa, Aymar Yaovi] West African Sci Serv, Ctr Climate Change & Adapted Land Use WASCAL, POB 9507, Ouagadougou 06, Burkina Faso; [Bossa, Aymar Yaovi] Univ Abomey Calavi, Natl Inst Water, Dept Hydrol & Water Resources Management, POB 526, Cotonou 01, Benin",University of Bonn; University of Abomey Calavi,"Yira, Y (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, Meckenheimer Allee 166, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",yira_y@uni-bonn.de,"Diekkrüger, Bernd/D-9410-2013","Diekkrüger, Bernd/0000-0001-9234-7850",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under West African Science Service Centre for Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL) project [01LG1202E],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under West African Science Service Centre for Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL) project(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),The authors are grateful for the financial support provided by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) (grant no. 01LG1202E) under the auspices of the West African Science Service Centre for Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL) project.

Conventional, hard adaptation measures are often associated with high costs, inflexibility and conflicting interests related to the dense urban fabric, and ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) has emerged as a potentially cost-efficient, comprehensive, and multifunctional approach. This paper reviews and systematises research on urban EbA. We propose an analytical framework that draws on theory from ecosystem services, climate change adaptation and sustainability science. It conceptualises EbA in terms of five linked components: ecological structures, ecological functions, adaptation benefits, valuation, and ecosystem management practices. Our review identified 110 articles, reporting on 112 cities, and analysed them using both quantitative statistical and qualitative content analysis. We found that EbA research in an urban context is fragmented due to different disciplinary approaches and concepts. Most articles focus on heat or flooding, and the most studied ecological structures for reducing the risk of such hazards are green space, wetlands, trees and parks. EbA is usually evaluated in bio-geophysical terms and the use of economic or social valuations are rare. While most articles do not mention specific practices for managing ecological structures, those that do imply that urban EbA strategies are increasingly being integrated into institutional structures. Few articles considered issues of equity or stakeholder participation in EbA. We identified the following challenges for future EbA research. First, while the large amount of data generated by isolated case studies contributes to systems knowledge, there is a lack of systems perspectives that position EbA in relation to the wider socio-economic and bio-geophysical context. Second, normative and ethical aspects of EbA require more thought, such as who are the winners and losers, especially in relation to processes that put people at risk from climate-related hazards. Third, there is room for more forward-looking EbA research, including consideration of future scenarios, experimentation in the creation of new ecological structures and the role of EbA in transformative adaptation.

A major barrier preventing informed climate-change adaptation planning is the difficulty accessing, analyzing, and interpreting climate-change information. To address this problem, we developed a powerful, yet easy to use, web-based tool called Climate Wizard (http://ClimateWizard.org) that provides non-climate specialists with simple analyses and innovative graphical depictions for conveying how climate has and is projected to change within specific geographic areas throughout the world. Methodology/Principal Findings: To demonstrate the Climate Wizard, we explored historic trends and future departures (anomalies) in temperature and precipitation globally, and within specific latitudinal zones and countries. We found the greatest temperature increases during 1951-2002 occurred in northern hemisphere countries (especially during January-April), but the latitude of greatest temperature change varied throughout the year, sinusoidally ranging from approximately 50 degrees N during February-March to 10 degrees N during August-September. Precipitation decreases occurred most commonly in countries between 0-20 degrees N, and increases mostly occurred outside of this latitudinal region. Similarly, a quantile ensemble analysis based on projections from 16 General Circulation Models (GCMs) for 2070-2099 identified the median projected change within countries, which showed both latitudinal and regional patterns in projected temperature and precipitation change. Conclusions/Significance: The results of these analyses are consistent with those reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, but at the same time, they provide examples of how Climate Wizard can be used to explore regionally- and temporally-specific analyses of climate change. Moreover, Climate Wizard is not a static product, but rather a data analysis framework designed to be used for climate change impact and adaption planning, which can be expanded to include other information, such as downscaled future projections of hydrology, soil moisture, wildfire, vegetation, marine conditions, disease, and agricultural productivity.","[Girvetz, Evan H.; Lawler, Joshua J.] Univ Washington, Sch Forest Resources, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Girvetz, Evan H.; Zganjar, Chris] Nature Conservancy, Global Climate Change Program, Arlington, VA USA; [Raber, George T.] Univ So Mississippi, Dept Geog & Geol, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA; [Maurer, Edwin P.] Santa Clara Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [Kareiva, Peter] Nature Conservancy, Worldwide Off, Seattle, WA USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Nature Conservancy; University of Southern Mississippi; Santa Clara University; Nature Conservancy,"Girvetz, EH (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Forest Resources, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",girvetz@u.washington.edu,"Maurer, Edwin P/C-7190-2009; Girvetz, Evan/B-3533-2010","Maurer, Edwin P/0000-0001-7134-487X; ",Nature Conservancy Climate Change Program,Nature Conservancy Climate Change Program,"E.

Sustainable urban drainage system (SUDS) constructs include the introduction of natural elements, such as riparian buffers, vegetative filters, rain beds, water spills, watermark filters, retainers and dams, and are an integral part of these climate adaptation measures. SUDS are commonly undertaken at a municipal level in Norway but, unfortunately, the implementation of SUDS projects has lagged behind expectation. Norway is a normative and egalitarian society, where public resistance to local projects is a factor in the delayed adoption of SUDS. That is why a greater understanding of public perceptions and priorities is needed to build consensus and support for these climate adaptation measures. This research looked at the Blaklibekken SUDS case study in Trondheim, Norway. A cross-section of interviews with the municipality and users was undertaken to establish themes within local perceptions of the project. Themes of environmental benefit, child-related activities, maintenance of the site and funding were established to provide a better understanding of public expectations and what aspects of the project correlated with public acceptance or resistance. This work provides a starting point for further research to establish public 'themes of interest' that can provide decision makers greater insight into public priorities.","[Thodesen, Bridget; Kvande, Tore] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Time, Berit] SINTEF Community, Dept Architecture Mat & Struct, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Thodesen, B (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",bridget.thodesen@ntnu.no; berit.time@sintef.no; tore.kvande@ntnu.no,,"Kvande, Tore/0000-0003-0522-9974",Research Council of Norway [237859],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"This research was funded by the Research Council of Norway, grant number 237859.",,53,0,0,3,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,APR,2022,11,4,,,,,,,589,10.3390/land11040589,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11040589,,,19,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0Q6YK,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000785061300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Knowledge about the decision making process of farmers can help in identifying the determinants of adaptation to them. It is very important to model the farmers' behaviour and decision making process to answer the reasons for farmers' suicides and inequalities arising out within the farmers belonging to same group. Our study identifies the factors responsible for increasing inequalities, crop failure and differential decision making capabilities of farmers by surveying 400 farmers in eighteen villages of Maharashtra, India. We analysed how combination of various factors such as social, economic, infrastructural and institutional affect the decision making process of farmers which brings out the novelty of the present work that can be replicated across a spectrum of such studies. Further, different adaptation options were categorized into the most and least preferred adaptive strategies by considering the farmers' perception. Our work has also identified which particular factor i.e. climatic, institutional, infrastructural or socio-economic is the major challenge towards the adaptation of farmers. The study has followed logit model in investigating the farmers' adaptation to multiple stressors. The study has also addressed the on-going argument regarding the scale of policy formulation i.e., whether policy formulation should take place at micro scale (Decentralization) or at larger region (State/National) level. Findings revealed that farmers perceive climate variability in terms of monsoon and temperature variability and respond as per their indigenous knowledge and experience. Model results revealed that institutional, social and climatic factors should be the focus point of government for improving the adaptation profile of farmers.","[Swami, Deepika; Parthasarathy, Devanathan] Interdisciplinary Program Climate Studies, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Parthasarathy, Devanathan] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Bombay, Maharashtra, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Swami, D (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Comp Lab, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India.",dsdeepika782@gmail.com,,"Swami, Deepika/0000-0001-8506-9020","Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Centre of Excellence in Climate Studies (IITB-CECS) project of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), New Delhi, India","Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Centre of Excellence in Climate Studies (IITB-CECS) project of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), New Delhi, India","This work was supported by the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Centre of Excellence in Climate Studies (IITB-CECS) project of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), New Delhi, India.

Governments in modern welfare states have generally addressed it through a zero fire policy, focusing on suppression and professionalization. Such approach provides security to local populations, who in turn may detach from the socio-ecologic phenomenon of wildfire and become passive actors. In the face of increasingly virulent wildfires, local communities are often not prepared with consequent damages and casualties. Yet, some regions show pro-active locals organizing their efforts to tackle wildfires. These fire volunteer groups suppose a social innovation in rural communities that help in their adaptation to climate change. Going beyond homeowners' preparedness, the actions of volunteers range from supporting firefighters' efforts, first attack and/or year-round prevention. The investigation of these communities is in its infancy despite its practitioner and policy interest. In this study, we shed light on this civil society engagement across different Mediterranean forest settings, namely from predominantly public forest ownership in Greece, to predominantly private in Catalonia (Spain) and virtually entirely private in Portugal. Collecting data through a survey, the type of activities of these volunteer groups, their relations with fire and local actors (i.e. social capital) and trajectory have been analysed to find possible trends. Statistical results show that their portfolio of activities relates to their group size (i.e. available human resources) and their structural and relational social capital. Preliminary insights show an improvement in trust with fire and forest actors owing to the fire volunteer group establishment. No evidence has been found of forest area covered by fire volunteers, recent fire experience or variety in members' profile to affect the type of activities. The results are discussed in the frame of social capital theory and suggestions for further research are put forward.","[Gorriz-Mifsud, Elena; Burns, Matthew; Marini Govigli, Valentino] European Forest Inst, Mediterranean Facil, Barcelona, Spain; [Burns, Matthew] Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Gorriz-Mifsud, E (corresponding author), European Forest Inst, Mediterranean Facil, Barcelona, Spain.",elena.gorriz@efi.int,"Górriz Mifsud, Elena/AAH-5669-2019; marini govigli, valentino/ABF-3723-2021; Gorriz-Mifsud, Elena/ABE-3171-2021","Górriz Mifsud, Elena/0000-0002-2112-5780; Marini Govigli, Valentino/0000-0002-7164-5522",European Commission through the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [677622],European Commission through the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme,"This research has been conducted within the SIMRA project (Social Innovation in Marginalised Rural Areas), funded by the European Commission through the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme, under Grant Agreement 677622.

TRM helps to address problems resulting from different anthropogenic and structural development activities, and it has been successful in helping coastal communities to adapt to climate change and rising sea level vulnerability by forming new land in Tidal Basins. Hence, it is essential to measure sustainability impacts of TRM from the environmental, socio-economic and institutional perspectives. Therefore, firstly, the study identifies sustainability indicators of TRM considering ecosystem services and secondly, develops an inclusive conceptual framework to understand the important impacts of each indicator at various spatial and temporal scales. The conceptual framework is followed by the construction of a Sustainability Index of Tidal River Management (SITRM). It has advantages over the Ramsar Convention framework (2007) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) framework (2012) to measure water sustainability as it includes a sustainable model to project future vulnerability of the community, river and Tidal Basin, emphasizing on climate change issues. It also involves trade-offs analysis, livelihood analysis and SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis for a complete impact assessment to enable decision-makers to focus on those services most likely to be of risks and weaknesses or opportunities and strengths for the sustainability of TRM. Moreover, the framework is a useful guide for policymakers in identifying the sustainability impacts of TRM so that they can choose best coping strategies for coastal people to effectively deal with adverse effects of water-logging and undesired climatic events as well as environmental and socio-economic changes in coastal areas.","[Al Masud, Md.

Because the process-based and statistical approaches to simulating crop yields are different in nature, a comparison between them is needed. This study investigates the accuracy of crop yield simulations in the historical period as well as future projections using two modelling approaches: 1) a process-based approach employing the Soil and Water Assessment Tool+ (SWAT+) model, and 2) a statistical approach employing a data-driven model, Feed Forward Back Propagation Neural Network (FFBPNN) over a medium-sized catchment in north-western Poland. The application of two potential evapotranspiration methods (Penman-Monteith and Hargreaves) in SWAT+ permitted calibration (2004-2011) and validation (2012-2019) of runoff and yields of winter wheat and spring barley. Different combinations of climatic parameters with a drought index based on Joint Deficit Index were applied to simulate and project rainfed crop yields (winter wheat, barley, potato, rye, rapeseed, sugar beets, cereals, maize for grain, maize for green forage, pulses) with FFBPNN. The results reveal that adding the new drought index helped increase the FFBPNN performance. This approach showed that future yields of the studied crops would slightly increase under RCP8.5 by 2060. Winter wheat and spring barley projections from SWAT+ showed very small changes using both the Penman-Monteith and Hargreaves method. Policy-wise, the results should be of interest to climate change adaptation practitioners and food security experts.

Yet, the geographic distribution of home gardens, their setup, management, and the effects on nutrition outcomes have not been fully described. This scoping review aimed to map and synthesize recent evidence on home gardening for two exemplar countries: Burkina Faso and Kenya. Between June and August 2020, we searched, screened, and extracted evidence about home garden projects in both countries, following the PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews. Peer-reviewed scientific publications, and gray literature in English and French that reported about subsistence horticulture in rural settings of Burkina Faso or Kenya were included. The characteristics of the documents and the data pertaining to our research objectives were extracted into predefined spreadsheets. The data were synthesized in the form of a narrative review. Our search yielded 949 documents, of which 20 documents were included in the synthesis (Burkina Faso: 8, Kenya: 12). While the gardens varied in composition and size, the majority provided green leafy vegetables and indigenous horticultural crops. The challenges for successful home garden implementation comprised unfavorable climatic conditions, access to and affordability of inputs, water and land, and lack of know-how. We identified trends for improved food security, diet quality, and nutritional status among the target populations. This scoping review found that there is limited evidence on home garden practices in rural Burkina Faso and Kenya. To enhance the sustainability of home gardens, research and resources should he invested in codesigning context-specific home gardening projects. Pending rigorous impact evaluation, home gardens appear to be a promising tool for climate change adaptation while simultaneously improving food security and the nutritional situation among women and young children in these two exemplar countries of sub-Saharan Africa.","[Hansen, Lea-Sophie; Sorgho, Raissa; Mank, Isabel; Schwerdtle, Patricia Nayna; Agure, Erick; Barnighausen, Till; Danquah, Ina] Heidelberg Univ, Fac Med, Heidelberg Inst Global Hlth HIGH, Heidelberg, Germany; [Hansen, Lea-Sophie; Sorgho, Raissa; Mank, Isabel; Schwerdtle, Patricia Nayna; Agure, Erick; Barnighausen, Till; Danquah, Ina] Heidelberg Univ, Univ Hosp, Heidelberg, Germany; [Mank, Isabel] German Inst Dev Evaluat Deval, Bonn, Germany; [Schwerdtle, Patricia Nayna] Monash Univ, Fac Med Nursing & Hlth Sci, Monash Nursing & Midwifery, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Barnighausen, Till] Africa Hlth Res Inst AHRI, Kwa Zulu, South Africa",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Monash University; Africa Health Research Institute,"Hansen, LS (corresponding author), Univ Klinikum Heidelberg, Heidelberger Inst Global Hlth HIGH, Neuenheimer Feld 324, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",lea-sophie.hansen@uni-heidelberg.de,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Hansen, Lea-Sophie/0000-0002-2116-5088",German Research Foundation (DFG) [DA 1881/3-1]; Robert Bosch Foundation (RBS) [01000035-002]; Fiat Panis Foundation; Heidelberg Graduate School of Global Health,German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Robert Bosch Foundation (RBS); Fiat Panis Foundation; Heidelberg Graduate School of Global Health,"This work received funding from the German Research Foundation (DFG) (reference: DA 1881/3-1) (ID, RS), the Robert Bosch Foundation (RBS) (reference: 01000035-002) (ID, IM), the Fiat Panis Foundation (LSH), and the Heidelberg Graduate School of Global Health (LSH).",,113,2,2,6,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2048-3694,,,FOOD ENERGY SECUR,Food Energy Secur.,AUG,2022,11,3,,,,,,,e388,10.1002/fes3.388,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fes3.388,,MAY 2022,19,Agronomy; Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,3Z1MD,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000799805200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Farmers' adoption of improved water management practices and technologies can play an important part in the region's climate change adaptation strategy. To facilitate the diffusion of agricultural beneficial management practices (BMPs), it is essential to examine the factors that influence farmers' decision-making, and the barriers and facilitators of adoption. While determinants of adoption have been studied extensively, past research suggests that they are context dependent and that a gap exists in relation to understanding how BMP characteristics are perceived and how they shape adoption. Therefore, this article identifies some of the key factors in the adoption of improved water management systems in Ontario and Que ' bec by focusing on differences between adopters and non-adopters. This study uses data from a survey of 70 fruit and vegetable growers. Results show that Canadian growers find important being good stewards of the land - being interested in minimizing their farms' impact on the environment and making good use of scarce resources. Farmers also believe society should help support the costs associated with safeguarding the environment. Growers interested in adopting the BMPs were likely to have less farming experience, diverse farming goals, higher educational attainment, and a higher degree of specialization in the production of tomatoes, cranberries or onions. While the majority of growers perceived the BMPs to be profitable, a better alternative and having capacity to reduce water use and improve yields, growers not interested in adopting these BMPs identified several issues that in their view act as barriers - initial cost of investment, and market instability. Policy responses aimed at enhancing diffusion of the BMPs, can be better targeted on priority regions and growers, incorporating in their communication strategy messages that resonate with growers' needs and take note of concerns they raise.","[Bogdan, Ana-Maria] Univ Saskatchewan, Canadian Hub Appl & Social Res, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Kulshreshtha, Suren N.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",University of Saskatchewan; University of Saskatchewan,"Kulshreshtha, SN (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",suren.kulshreshtha@usask.ca,,"Kulshreshtha, Suren(dea)/0000-0001-9056-4683; Bogdan, Ana-Maria/0000-0002-2300-2899",Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada,Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada(Agriculture & Agri Food Canada),"Authors would like to thank Professor C.

Here, we evaluated historical total inorganic N (TIN) load from land to sea through the rivers surrounding the East China sea using biogeochemical model 'VISIT' combined with a newly developed VISIT Off-line River Nitrogen scheme (VISIToRN). VISIT calculated N cycling in both natural and agricultural ecosystems and VISIToRN calculated inorganic N transport and riverine denitrification through the river channels at half degree spatial resolution. Between 1961 and 2010, the estimated TIN load from land to the sea surrounding the East China Sea increased from 2.7 Tg-N Year(-1) to 5.5 Tg-N Year(-1), a twofold increase, while the anthropogenic N input to the East China Sea basin (N deposition, N fertilizer, manure, and human sewage) increased from 12.9 Tg-N Year(-1) to 36.9 Tg-N Year(-1), an increase of about 3 times. This difference in the rate of increase is due in large part to the terrestrial nitrogen budget, and the results of the model balance indicate that TIN load to rivers has been suppressed by improvements in fertilizer application rates, harvesting on agricultural land, and nitrogen accumulation in forests. The results of the model balance showed that the increase rate of nitrogen runoff from Chinese rivers has been declining since 2000. In our estimation by VISIToRN, the amount of nitrogen removed by river denitrification in the river channel before the mouth is not negligible, ranging from 1.6 Tg-N Year(-1) to 2.16 Tg-N Year(-1). The N load from agricultural sources is still significant and needs to be further reduced. TIN load tended to increase in years with high precipitation. In order to effectively reduce TIN load, it is necessary to consider climate change-adaptive agricultural N management.","[Nishina, K.; Ito, A.; Hayashi, S.] Natl Inst Environm Studies, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Zhou, F.] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sino France Inst Earth Syst Sci, Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Yan, X.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Winiwarter, W.] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Winiwarter, W.] Univ Zielona Gora, Inst Environm Engn, PL-65417 Zielona Gora, Poland","National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil Science, CAS; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); University of Zielona Gora","Nishina, K (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.",nishina.kazuya@nies.go.jp,"Zhou, Feng/C-9377-2011; Winiwarter, Wilfried/F-5073-2017; Ito, Akihiko/P-2624-2017","Zhou, Feng/0000-0001-6122-0611; Winiwarter, Wilfried/0000-0001-7131-1496; Ito, Akihiko/0000-0001-5265-0791; Nishina, Kazuya/0000-0002-8820-1282",Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan [JPMEERF20182R02]; JSPS KAKENHI [17H01867]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H01867] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors would like to thank the members of INMS East-Asian demonstration.

This is especially so for projections of future precipitation in most tropical regions, at the spatial scale of many adaptation decisions in water-related sectors. Attempts have been made to constrain the uncertainty in climate projections, based on the recognised premise that not all of the climate models openly available perform equally well. However, there is no agreed 'good practice' on how to weight climate models. Nor is it clear to what extent model weighting can constrain uncertainty in decision-relevant climate quantities. We address this challenge, for climate projection information relevant to 'high stakes' investment decisions across the 'water-energy-food' sectors, using two case-study river basins in Tanzania and Malawi. We compare future climate risk profiles of simple decision-relevant indicators for water-related sectors, derived using hydrological and water resources models, which are driven by an ensemble of future climate model projections. In generating these ensembles, we implement a range of climate model weighting approaches, based on context-relevant climate model performance metrics and assessment. Our case-specific results show the various model weighting approaches have limited systematic effect on the spread of risk profiles. Sensitivity to climate model weighting is lower than overall uncertainty and is considerably less than the uncertainty resulting from bias correction methodologies. However, some of the more subtle effects on sectoral risk profiles from the more 'aggressive' model weighting approaches could be important to investment decisions depending on the decision context. For application, model weighting is justified in principle, but a credible approach should be very carefully designed and rooted in robust understanding of relevant physical processes to formulate appropriate metrics.","[Kolusu, Seshagiri Rao] Met Off, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Kolusu, Seshagiri Rao; Todd, Martin C.] Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Brighton BN1 9QS, E Sussex, England; [Siderius, Christian; Conway, Declan] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Siderius, Christian] Uncharted Waters Res, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Bhave, Ajay] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [James, Rachel; Washington, Richard] Univ Oxford, Climate Res Lab, Ctr Environm, Oxford, England; [Geressu, Robel; Harou, Julien J.] Univ Manchester, Dept Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Harou, Julien J.] UCL, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, London, England; [Kashaigili, Japhet J.] Sokoine Univ Agr, Morogoro, Tanzania",Met Office - UK; University of Sussex; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Newcastle University - UK; University of Oxford; University of Manchester; University of London; University College London; Sokoine University of Agriculture,"Kolusu, SR (corresponding author), Met Off, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.;Kolusu, SR (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Brighton BN1 9QS, E Sussex, England.",seshagirirao.kolusu@metoffice.gov.uk,"Conway, Declan/HCH-7778-2022; kolusu, seshagirirao/AAO-3460-2020; James, Rachel Anne/GQI-4427-2022","kolusu, seshagirirao/0000-0002-6090-5624; James, Rachel Anne/0000-0001-5738-1092; Washington, Richard/0000-0003-2521-4614","UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/M020258, NE/M020398/1]; UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); NERC [NE/M020398/1, NE/M020258/1, NE/M020037/1] Funding Source: UKRI",UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work was carried out under the Future Climate for Africa UMFULA project, with financial support from the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), grant refs: NE/M020258, NE/M020398/1 see http://www.futureclimateafrica.org/, last access: 01 July 2020 and the UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID).",,42,7,7,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Its characteristics are determinant for a wide range of natural processes and human activities. However, ongoing climate change is modifying these characteristics, which may have important implications. Climatic changes on wind speed and direction, wind shear intensity, and helicity, over the 21st century and for 26 cities in the Iberian Peninsula, under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 anthropogenic forcing scenario, are assessed. For this purpose, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used, with initial and boundary conditions being obtained from simulations with the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model (MPI-ESM-LR) climate model and ERA-Interim reanalysis. Quantile-quantile bias correction was applied to the simulated data prior to subsequent analysis. Overall, the results hint at a reduction in the intensity of both near-surface and 850 hPa (approx. 5%) wind in the future. Nevertheless, for the 300 hPa level, a decrease in summertime wind speed is accompanied by a slight increase in the remaining months. Furthermore, significant increases in the number of occurrences of extreme wind events were also identified, mainly in northwestern Iberia. For wind shear, an intensity increase is projected throughout most of the year (approx. 5% in the upper quantiles), mainly in southwestern Iberia. Helicity is also projected to undergo a strengthening, mostly in summer months and over southwestern Iberia, with greater emphasis on events of longer duration and intensity. This study highlights some important projected changes in the wind structure and profile under future anthropogenic forcing. This knowledge may support decisions on climate change adaptation options and risk reduction of several major sectors, such as energy and aviation, thus deserving further research.","[Martins, Joana; Rocha, Alfredo; Viceto, Carolina; Pereira, Susana Cardoso] Univ Aveiro, CESAM Dept Phys, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Martins, Joana; Santos, Joao A.] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, Ctr Res & Technol Agroenvironm & Biol Sci, UTAD, P-5000801 Vila Real, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro,"Rocha, A (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, CESAM Dept Phys, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",joanamartins@utad.pt; alfredo.rocha@ua.pt; carolinaviceto@ua.pt; susana.cardoso@ua.pt; jsantos@utad.pt,"Santos, João/HHZ-5595-2022; Santos, João Andrade/G-8805-2011; Pereira, Susana Cardoso/M-8605-2013; rocha, alfredo/E-1201-2011; Viceto, Carolina/V-1188-2018","Santos, João Andrade/0000-0002-8135-5078; Pereira, Susana Cardoso/0000-0003-3521-7026; rocha, alfredo/0000-0003-4940-6522; Viceto, Carolina/0000-0001-8841-263X; Martins, Joana/0000-0001-9466-4606",FCT/MCTES [UIDB/50017/2020+UIDP/50017/2020]; FCT-Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [UIDB/04033/2020],FCT/MCTES(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FCT-Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"This research was partially funded by FCT/MCTES through financial support to CESAM (UIDB/50017/2020+UIDP/50017/2020) and was was also supported by FCT-Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, under the project UIDB/04033/2020.",,69,5,5,1,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,SEP,2020,11,9,,,,,,,1001,10.3390/atmos11091001,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11091001,,,40,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,OE8SG,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000580792900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

UUS has been long acknowledged to be important to the urban development agenda: sustainability, resilience, livability, and creating a better urban environment in particular. These issues are traditionally monitored using urban indicators, however UUS has not been properly included and considered in urban indicator lists (sets or systems) yet - the gap this paper is aiming to bridge. The paper reviews existing approaches to the composition of urban indicator lists, highlighting indicator types, challenges related to data collection, and agencies that are concerned with the issue. Further the paper has identified the importance of UUS inclusion in the lists that give integrated assessment and monitor urban sustainability, resilience, climate change adaptation and mitigation, as well as progress towards smart, livable, and compact cities. Existing global quantitative data on UUS have been examined in 8 cities; and three key indicators (descriptors) were suggested to monitor UUS use: Developed UUS volume (m(3)); UUS use density (m(3)/m(2)); and Developed UUS volume per person (m(3)/person). Current average UUS use densities in cities are identified as up to about 0.05 (m(3)/m(2)) (which can be interpreted as a virtual depth of UUS use of 5 cm), and the developed UUS volume per person is up to about 10 m(3)/person; while city central areas (central business districts) can have a virtual depth of developed UUS of several metres (m(3)/m(2)). Compatibility, comparability, uniformity, and sustained monitoring of urban indicators data (including UUS indicators) found to be posing significant challenges to the research across geographies, and industry/economic sectors.

Progress towards CCD requires multi-stakeholder, multi-sector working and the development of partnerships between actors who may not otherwise have worked together. This creates challenges and opportunities that require careful examination at project and institutional levels and necessitates the sharing of experiences between different settings. In this paper, we draw on the outcomes from a multi-stakeholder workshop held in Mozambique in 2012, the final in a series of activities in a regional project assessing emerging CCD partnerships across southern Africa. The workshop involved policymakers, researchers and representatives from NGOs and the private sector. We employ a content analysis of workshop notes and presentations to identify the progress and challenges in moving four case study countries (the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe) towards CCD pathways, by exploring experiences from both project and policy levels. To advance institutional support for the development of successful CCD policies, practices and partnerships, we conclude that there is a need for: (a) institutional development at the national level to strengthen coordination and more clearly define roles and responsibilities across sectors, based on the identification of capacity and knowledge gaps; (b) partnership development, drawing on key strengths and competences of different stakeholders and emphasising the roles of the private sector and traditional authorities; (c) learning and knowledge-sharing through national and regional fora; and (d) development of mechanisms that permit more equitable and transparent distribution of costs and benefits. These factors can facilitate development of multi-stakeholder, multi-level partnerships that are grounded in community engagement from the outset, helping to translate CCD policy statements into on-the-ground action.","[Stringer, Lindsay C.; Dougill, Andrew J.; Dyer, Jen C.; Leventon, Julia] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Vincent, Katharine] Kulima Integrated Dev Solutions Pty Ltd, ZA-3200 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Vincent, Katharine] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Architecture & Planning, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Fritzsche, Florian] GIZ Botswana, Gaborone, Botswana; [Falcao, Mario Paulo] Eduardo Mondlane Univ, Dept Forestry, Maputo, Mozambique; [Manyakaidze, Pascal] Shurugwi Partners CBO, Gweru, Zimbabwe; [Syampungani, Stephen] Copperbelt Univ, Sch Nat Resources, Kitwc, Zambia; [Powell, Philip] Ecolivelihoods, Apricot Cottage, Collingham LS22 5AR, W Yorkshire, England; [Kalaba, Gabriel] Univ Lubumbashi, Fac Agr, Lubumbashi, DEM REP CONGO",University of Leeds; University of Witwatersrand; Eduardo Mondlane University; Copperbelt University,"Stringer, LC (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",l.stringer@leeds.ac.uk,"Vincent, Katharine/L-5669-2019; Leventon, Julia/AGW-8398-2022","Vincent, Katharine/0000-0003-3152-1522; Leventon, Julia/0000-0002-2447-8522; Stringer, Lindsay/0000-0003-0017-1654; Dougill, Andrew/0000-0002-3422-8228",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,60,35,36,1,36,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Current projections of climate change impacts on tropical crop yields, even though on average negative, remain largely uncertain: there is need for more consistent, large-scale, quantitative assessments. In this study we use a newly developed agro-DGVM (Dynamical Global Vegetation Model including an explicit representation of croplands) driven by projections from several climate models and two SRES scenarios to evaluate climate change impacts on potential C4 crop productivity over Africa and India from 1960 to 2100. We specifically separate the effect of increasing atmospheric CO2 levels. We perform transient simulations directly forced by climate model outputs: to preserve consistency in the analysis despite regional biases in climate models, we analyze yield change on a bioclimatic basis (using the Koppen classification) rather than on a geographical basis. We find that the potential productivity of one of the most important staple crops in those regions, millet, will overall decrease, on average over all models and scenarios, by -6% (individual model projections ranging from -29% to +11%). The bioclimatic analysis allows us to highlight the main climate drivers of these changes. The main impact is a moderate but robust temperature-driven yield decrease over Equatorial and Temperate Koppen zones; larger but much more inconsistent yield changes occur in Arid Koppen zones, reflecting the uncertainty in precipitation projections from climate models. The uncertainty in aggregated impacts reflects the uncertainty over these areas, underlining the need to narrow the uncertainty in precipitation projections over dry areas if more reliable agricultural impact assessments over tropical regions are to be provided. Our results are also consistent with the limited magnitude of the impact of increased atmospheric CO2 levels on C4 crop yields described in the literature. While such climatic impacts further increase the challenge of achieving future food security in developing countries in the Tropics, most of these impacts can arguably be mitigated through adaptation measures and improved agricultural practices.

In contrast to trees inside of closed-canopy forests, not much is known about the spatial extent and distribution of scattered trees at a global scale. Due to the cost of high-resolution satellite imagery, global monitoring systems rely on medium-resolution satellites to monitor land use and land use change. However, detecting and monitoring scattered trees with an open canopy using medium-resolution satellites is difficult because individual trees often cover a smaller footprint than the satellites' resolution. Additionally, the variable background land uses and canopy shapes of trees cause a high variability in their spectral signatures. Here we present a globally consistent method to identify trees with canopy diameters greater than 3 m with medium-resolution optical and radar imagery. Biweekly cloud-free, pan-sharpened 10 metres Sentinel-2 optical imagery and Sentinel-1 radar imagery are used to train a fully convolutional network, consisting of a convolutional gated recurrent unit layer and a feature pyramid attention layer. Tested across more than 215 thousand Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 pixels distributed from - 60 degrees to +60 degrees latitude, the proposed model exceeds 75% user's and producer's accuracy identifying trees in hectares with a low to medium density (<40%) of tree cover, and 95% user's and producer's accuracy in hectares with dense (>= 40%) tree cover. In comparison with common remote-sensing classification methods, the proposed method increases the accuracy of monitoring tree presence in areas with sparse and scattered tree cover (<40%) by as much as 20%, and reduces commission and omission error in mountainous and very cloudy regions by nearly half. When applied across large, heterogeneous landscapes, the results demonstrate potential to map trees in high detail and consistent accuracy over diverse landscapes across the globe. This information is important for understanding current land cover and can be used to detect changes in land cover such as agroforestry, buffer zones around biological hotspots, and expansion or encroachment of forests.","[Brandt, John; Stolle, Fred] World Resources Inst, Forests Program, Washington, DC 20006 USA",,"Brandt, J (corresponding author), World Resources Inst, Forests Program, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",john.brandt@wri.org,,,,,,,88,5,5,1,46,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0143-1161,1366-5901,,INT J REMOTE SENS,Int.

Commonly used urban design storms, such as the Chicago (K-C) storm and Pilgrim and Cordery (P-C) storm, are calculated using prescribed or historical hyetographs. A prescribed hyetograph is unsuitable for a particular urban region in most cases, and a historical hyetograph takes no account of the spatiotemporal variations between the rainfall pattern at the rain station and that within the calculated region. Additionally, neither method can make adaptive adjustments for climate change. To obtain a more practical design storm with consideration of spatiotemporal variations and climatic changes, this study introduced proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to urban design storm study. To demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed methodology, four cities (London, New York, Sydney, Wuhan) in different continents with different climatic characteristics were selected as case studies. The principal results are as follows. (1) Breaking the assumption of a uniform precipitation distribution, the proposed DMD-POD method is effective in capturing design storms under current climatic conditions and is sufficiently flexible to adapt to climate change. (2) The low-order representation of the rainfall field indicates substantial change in the storm patterns in urban areas. The peak discharge in New York and Wuhan is almost 10% higher than before urbanization, while that in Sydney and London is more than 10% lower on average. The peak time is largely unchanged in New York and Sydney, while it is 4 and 5 h later in London and Wuhan, respectively. (3) Compared with the K-C storm and P-C storm, the flood peak of POD storm increases and appears slightly earlier. The flood peak time in Wuhan simulated with the POD storm is 1 h (2 h) earlier than that simulated with the K-C storm (P-C storm). The peak flow obtained by the POD storm is 9.55% (25.05%) greater than that obtained by the K-C storm (P-C storm), which means that the POD design storm demands a higher level of safety for an engineering project under the same return period.","[Zhao, Ye; Zhang, Xiang; Wang, Xincheng; Gong, Li] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Ye; Zhang, Xiang; Gong, Li] Hubei Key Lab Water Syst Sci Sponge City Construc, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Feng] Changjiang Water Resources Commiss, Bur Hydrol, Wuhan 430010, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Zhang, X (corresponding author), Hubei Key Lab Water Syst Sci Sponge City Construc, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",zhaoyeah@whu.edu.cn; zhangxiang@whu.edu.cn; fxiong07@whu.edu.cn; xc_wang@whu.edu.cn; 1076807541@qq.com,,"Wang, Xincheng/0000-0003-0792-0005",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41890823]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFC0408901],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China,"This research is supposed by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41890823) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2019YFC0408901).

By analysing key policy documents over the last 15 years, this study identifies and explains the development of an adaptation policy. Most recently, a bureaucratic process set in motion by Russia's ratification of the Paris Agreement produced a set of policy documents addressing adaptation to negative climate impacts. These documents employed a bureaucratic-administrative approach, and the effectiveness of expected measures can be questioned. From 2020, a deeper reassessment of climate challenges has evolved, triggered by radical climate changes observed in the Russian Arctic, but also by developments in international climate policies and the energy transition. Economic adaptation to these trends has come to the forefront, raising questions of the need for structural change in the Russian economy. Opposition to reform remains strong, but the scope for discussion of possible pathways has widened considerably. Further development of low-carbon policies in Russia are contingent on international cooperation and integration of Russia in the world economy. The isolation of Russia, following the invasion of Ukraine, will make it difficult to influence Russian climate policies. Key policy insights Unlike the West, Russian climate policy has focused on adaptation, rather than mitigation. But policies have been weak, and adaptation not mainstreamed. Detailed recommendations for adaptation to climate change impacts adopted in 2021 signalled higher political attention, but framed adaptation largely as a technical task. Since 2020, a broader climate change and adaptation discourse entered Russian politics where adaptation to international climate policies and the energy transition is at the centre. Debate on Russia's role in the changing energy market had started, but the invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing international isolation of Russia is likely to reduce Russia's capacity and incentives to carry out low-carbon policies. Western countries will have to consider how they can provide climate policy incentives to Russia in the new international situation, as Russia will remain essential for the success of the climate regime.

The purpose of the paper is to present the results of research on the assessing of the ecological-economic efficiency of the implementation of reclamation projects taking into account the quality of irrigation water (on an example of the specific projects under soil-and-climatic conditions of Kharkiv and Donetsk regions). Methodology / approach. The research methodology is based on the use of an interdisciplinary approach. The study used the following methods: monographic (to generalize methodological and practical experience in the use of irrigation projects); laboratory-analytical (to determine the quality indicators of irrigation water); constructive-calculated (for calculating the indicators of economic efficiency of yield growth under irrigation conditions); Monte Carlo method (for simulation of crop yields without irrigation and under irrigation conditions); statistical (analysis of variance) (to assess the reliability of the results); generalizations (to summarize the intermediate and general results of ecological-economic analysis of experimental and model data). Results. As a result of laboratory analysis, water quality was assessed, which can be used for irrigation. The advantages of the project of organization of agricultural production under the conditions of drip irrigation are substantiated, and the investment attractiveness of this project was estimated. It is proved that the use of drip irrigation contributes not only to the economic effect, but also to adaptation to climate change. The economic efficiency of irrigation in agriculture, in particular, limited to suitable water (low quality) during the cultivation of various crops, was evaluated. Given the economic assessment, the cultivation of most crops under irrigated conditions with limited suitable water is ineffective. Originality / scientific novelty. The scientific novelty of the paper is that the provisions on ecological and economic efficiency of reclamation projects taking into account the quality of irrigation water has been further developed. This is one of the first paper devoted to the economic management of irrigation projects in Ukrainian agriculture in the context of climate change. Practical value / implications. The results of the study allow to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the implementation of drip irrigation projects, taking into account potential economic risks and expected benefits. The results of simulation modeling of crop yields under irrigation conditions can be used by agricultural enterprises to manage project risks.","[Kucher, Lesia; Ulko, Yevhenii] Kharkiv Natl Agr Univ, Kharkiv, Ukraine; [Drokin, Serhii] Kharkov Natl Univ, Kharkiv, Ukraine; [Ulko, Yevhenii] NSC Inst Soil Sci & Agrochem Res, Kharkiv, Ukraine",State Biotechnological University; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; VN Karazin Kharkiv National University; National Academy of Agrarian Sciences of Ukraine; National Scientific Center Institute for Soil Science & Agrochemistry Research named after O.N.

We demonstrate that wild. re area burned (WFAB) in the American West was controlled by climate during the 20th century (1916-2003). Persistent ecosystem-specific correlations between climate and WFAB are grouped by vegetation type (ecoprovinces). Most mountainous ecoprovinces exhibit strong year-of-fire relationships with low precipitation, low Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), and high temperature. Grass-and shrub-dominated ecoprovinces had positive relationships with antecedent precipitation or PDSI. For 1977-2003, a few climate variables explain 33-87% (mean = 64%) of WFAB, indicating strong linkages between climate and area burned. For 1916-2003, the relationships are weaker, but climate explained 25-57% (mean = 39%) of the variability. The variance in WFAB is proportional to the mean squared for different data sets at different spatial scales. The importance of antecedent climate (summer drought in forested ecosystems and antecedent winter precipitation in shrub and grassland ecosystems) indicates that the mechanism behind the observed. re-climate relationships is climatic preconditioning of large areas of low fuel moisture via drying of existing fuels or fuel production and drying. The impacts of climate change on. re regimes will therefore vary with the relative energy or water limitations of ecosystems. Ecoprovinces proved a useful compromise between ecologically imprecise state-level and localized gridded fire data. The differences in climate . re relationships among the ecoprovinces underscore the need to consider ecological context (vegetation, fuels, and seasonal climate) to identify specific climate drivers of WFAB. Despite the possible influence of. re suppression, exclusion, and fuel treatment, WFAB is still substantially controlled by climate. The implications for planning and management are that future WFAB and adaptation to climate change will likely depend on ecosystem-specific, seasonal variation in climate. In fuel-limited ecosystems, fuel treatments can probably mitigate. re vulnerability and increase resilience more readily than in climate-limited ecosystems, in which large severe. res under extreme weather conditions will continue to account for most area burned.","[Littell, Jeremy S.; McKenzie, Donald] Univ Washington, Joint Inst Study Atmosphere & Ocean, Climate Impacts Grp, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Littell, Jeremy S.; McKenzie, Donald] Univ Washington, Ctr Earth Syst Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Littell, Jeremy S.] Univ Washington, Fire & Mt Ecol Lab, Coll Forest Resources, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [McKenzie, Donald; Peterson, David L.] USDA Forest Serv, Pacific NW Res Stn, Seattle, WA 98103 USA; [Westerling, Anthony L.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Div Climate Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"Littell, JS (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Joint Inst Study Atmosphere & Ocean, Climate Impacts Grp, Box 355672, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jlittell@u.washington.edu,,,NOAA OGP; Western Mountain Initiative; Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO); NOAA Cooperative Agreement [NA17RJ1232],NOAA OGP(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Western Mountain Initiative; Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO); NOAA Cooperative Agreement(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"We thank Steve McKay and Janice Peterson (USDA Forest Service PNW Research Station) for compiling the original 1916-2003 state-level area-burned data.

Precipitation and extreme weather in this region are mainly associated with either Cyprus Lows or the wet Red Sea Troughs. Current regional climate projections indicate that the region may become warmer and drier in future decades. Here, we analyze the influence of enhanced greenhouse gas forcing on the climatological properties of the 'wet' and 'dry' Red Sea Trough (WRST & DRST, respectively). With this aim, a regional synoptic classification and a downscaling algorithm based on past analogs are applied to eighteen rain stations over the main ground water basins in Israel. The algorithms are applied to the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data for 1986-2005 and to eight CMIP5 model simulations for the historical (1986-2005) and end of the century (2081-2100) climate conditions according to the RCP8.5 scenario. For the historical period, the CMIP5 models are largely able to represent the characteristics of the Red Sea Trough. Based on the multi-model mean, significant changes are found for WRST and DRST for the late XXI Century. First, an increase in the meridional pressure gradient is found for both the WRST and the DRST, implying stronger horizontal winds. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the occurrence of the WRST (- 20%) and a significant increase in the frequency of the DRST (+ 19%) are identified. Accordingly, the persistence of the WRST decreases (- 9%), while for DRST increases (+ 9%). The decline in the frequency of WRST occurs primarily in the transition seasons, while the increase for DRST is found throughout the wet season. In total, the daily rainfall associated with the WRST system is projected to significantly decline (- 37%) by the end of the XXI century. These results document the projected changes in a dominant synoptic system in this area, which can facilitate a better estimation of the arising challenges, e.g., related to shortage of water resources and associated political unrest, reduced agricultural potential, and increased air pollution and forest fires. Such a pathway can ultimately foster novel mitigation strategies for water resources management and regional climate change adaptation.","[Hochman, Assaf; Pinto, Joaquim G.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Dept Tropospher Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Rostkier-Edelstein, Dorita] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Freddy & Nadine Hermann Inst Earth Sci, Jerusalem, Israel; [Rostkier-Edelstein, Dorita] Israel Inst Biol Res, Dept Environm Phys, Environm Sci Div, Ness Ziona, Israel; [Kunin, Pavel] Life Sci Res Israel, Ness Ziona, Israel",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Hochman, A (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Dept Tropospher Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.",assaf.hochman@kit.edu,"Pinto, Joaquim G/A-7352-2009","Pinto, Joaquim G/0000-0002-8865-1769; Rostkier-Edelstein, Dorita/0000-0003-2191-1236",German Helmholtz Association [12.01.02]; AXA research fund,German Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association); AXA research fund(AXA Research Fund),"Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

The purpose of this study is to examine farmers' perceptions and adaptation practices to climate change and variability in accordance with actual recorded weather data of the Vea catchment in Upper East Region of northern Ghana during the time interval from 1972 to 2012. Methods: Climatic data over 41-years (1972-2012) from four stations in vicinity of the catchment was evaluated to identify actual weather outcomes. A survey questionnaire targeting farmers with at least 30-years of farming experience in the area was administered in six of the eleven agricultural enumeration areas in the catchment covering 305 km(2). Of the 466 farmers interviewed, 79 % utilized rain-fed practices while 21 % utilized some form of irrigation. Results: Results indicate that nearly 90 % of the farmers interviewed believe that temperature increased over the past 30-years, while over 94 % of the farmers believe that amount of rainfall, duration, intensity and rainy days has decreased. Nearly 96 % of the farmers believe that their farms are extremely vulnerable to decreased rainfall, droughts and changed timing of rainfall events. Climatic data of the catchment indicates a rising trend in temperature but no long-term changes in annual and monthly rainfall, thereby possibly increasing levels of evapotranspiration. While no statistical differences were found between rain-fed and irrigation agricultural types regarding receipt of external support, their approaches to climatic change adaptation do differ. Patently, 94 and 90 % of farmers relying on rain-fed and irrigation strategies respectively receive some form of support, primarily via extension services. Farmers using rain-fed practices adjust to climate variability by varying crop types via rotation without fertilizer while farmers employing irrigation practices are more likely to offset climate variability with a greater use of fertilizer application. Conclusion: The Vea catchment faces rising temperature and evapotranspiration trends. Farmers are aware of these climatic changes and are adapting strategies to cope with the effects but require support. Adequate extension services and irrigation facilities are needed to assist farmers in order to sustain their livelihoods on the long run.","[Limantol, Andrew Manoba] Univ Abomey Calavi, West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapte, Grad Res Program GRP Climate Change & Water Resou, Cotonou, Benin; [Keith, Bruce Edward] US Mil Acad, Ctr Nation Reconstruct & Capac Dev, Dept Syst Engn, West Point, NY 10996 USA; [Azabre, Bismark Atiayure] Univ Dev Studies, Planning & Management Dept, Wa Campus, Wa, Ghana; [Lennartz, Bernd] Univ Rostock, Agr & Environm Sci, D-18055 Rostock, Germany",University of Abomey Calavi; United States Department of Defense; United States Army; United States Military Academy; University for Development Studies; University of Rostock,"Limantol, AM (corresponding author), Univ Abomey Calavi, West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapte, Grad Res Program GRP Climate Change & Water Resou, Cotonou, Benin.",limantol@yahoo.co.uk,"Lennartz, Bernd/M-3823-2019","Lennartz, Bernd/0000-0003-3020-7312",German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF),German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This work has been conducted as part of a doctorate research scholarship under West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL) project funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).

This has inadvertently resulted in little attention to the other important link between energy and climate, namely energy access and climate adaptation. In particular, the potential role of reliable, affordable and sustainable modern energy services in strengthening societies' adaptive capacities to address climate disaster events has been ignored across both policy and practice. This paper probes these links and argues for a critically co-dependent conceptual relationship between energy access, rural development, and climate adaptation and disaster management. It then explores how, if at all, these links may exist in Odisha, one of India's most climate vulnerable states with low socio-economic development. The paper concludes that a deep-seated policy reform is necessary to bring about a shift in how we a) measure 'successful' disaster policy, b) understand the role of energy in a disaster context, and c) recognise, and seek greater synergies between energy access, rural development and climate adaptation objectives.","[Sharma, Vigya] Univ Queensland, Energy & Poverty Res Grp, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Sharma, V (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Energy & Poverty Res Grp, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",v.sharma@uq.edu.au,,,,,,,104,6,6,4,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-6296,2214-6326,,ENERGY RES SOC SCI,Energy Res.

To provide evidence on both effect from humidity on people's thermal comfort and their humidity adaptation, a comparative study has been conducted in a controlled climate chamber. During the experiment, the air temperature was set as 25 degrees C and 28 degrees C respectively and the relative humidity was changing between 20% and 90%. There were twenty four participants involved in this experiment, with half living in High Humidity (HH) regions of China, such as Chongqing, for over 20 years, and another half recently moved to Chongqing from Low Humidity (LH) regions in northwestern China. During the experiment, mean skin temperature was measured as an objective important parameter and subjective questionnaires were used to subjectively collect people's sensations with respect to heat, humidity and sweating. The data collected demonstrated that people living in HH regions showed a better adaptive ability to humidity changes than those came from LH regions. Climate adaptation also reduced the sensitivity of HH subjects' thermal responses. When air humidity was over 70%, subjects started to show stronger thermal responses. Based on these results, an upper limit of humidity of 17 g/kg has been proposed for Chongqing, China. The results from this study will help to broaden the adaptive thermal comfort theory and can provide important references regarding to humidity control for buildings.","[Kong, Deyu; Liu, Hong; Wu, Yuxin; Li, Baizhan; Yuan, Mengwei] Chongqing Univ, Minist Educ, Joint Int Res Lab Green Bldg & Built Environm, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China; [Kong, Deyu; Liu, Hong; Wu, Yuxin; Li, Baizhan; Yuan, Mengwei] Chongqing Univ, Minist Sci & Technol, Natl Ctr Int Res Low Carbon & Green Bldg, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China; [Wei, Shen] UCL, Bartlett Sch Construct & Project Management, London WC1E 7HB, England",Chongqing University; Chongqing University; University of London; University College London,"Liu, H (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Minist Educ, Joint Int Res Lab Green Bldg & Built Environm, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China.",liuhong1865@163.com,"li, bing/GWQ-9617-2022; li, bz/GVR-7133-2022","Wei, Shen/0000-0001-9644-5095; Wu, Yuxin/0000-0002-7293-0325","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2018CDYJSY0055, 2018CDJDCH0015]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0702700]; 111 Project [B13041]","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Key Research and Development Program of China; 111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project)","This research is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 2018CDYJSY0055, 2018CDJDCH0015), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFC0702700), and the 111 Project (Grant No. B13041).",,65,49,51,3,36,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

However, existing studies have yet to examine the climate impacts on transportation networks systematically rather than independently assessing the infrastructures at a component level. Therefore, it is crucial to configure alternative shipping routes from a systematic perspective to reduce climate vulnerabilities and optimise the resilience of the whole shipping network. This paper aims to assess the global shipping network focusing on climate resilience by a methodology that combines climate risk indicators, centrality analysis and ship routing optimisation. The methodology is designed for overviewing the climate vulnerability of the current and future scenarios for comparison. First, a multi-centrality assessment defines the global shipping hubs and network vulnerabilities. Secondly, a shipping model is built for finding the optimal shipping route between ports, considering the port disruption days caused by climate change (e.g. extreme weather) based on the climate vulnerability analysis result from the first step. It contributes to a new framework combining the global and local seaport climate vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it recommends changing shipping routes by a foreseeable increase in port disruptions caused by extreme weather for climate adaptation.","[Poo, Mark Ching-Pong; Yang, Zaili] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Logist Offshore & Marine Res Inst, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Liverpool John Moores University,"Yang, ZL (corresponding author), Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Logist Offshore & Marine Res Inst, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",z.yang@ljmu.ac.ukLiverpool,"zhao, yang/GXF-4424-2022; yang, zaili/A-6493-2013; Poo, Mark Ching-Pong/Q-2235-2017","yang, zaili/0000-0003-1385-493X; Poo, Mark Ching-Pong/0000-0002-9921-3107",H2020 European Research Council [EU H2020 ERC-COG-2019 project] [TRUST 864724],H2020 European Research Council [EU H2020 ERC-COG-2019 project],This work was supported by the H2020 European Research Council [EU H2020 ERC-COG-2019 project (TRUST 864724)].,,39,1,1,34,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-8839,1464-5254,,MARIT POLICY MANAG,Marit.

Many solutions in related research have been proposed to enhance urban adaptation to climate change, including urban flooding simulations, risk reduction and urban flood-resistance capacity. In this paper we provide a thorough review of urban flood-resilience using scientometric and systematic analysis. Using Cite Space and VOS viewer, we conducted a scientometric analysis to quantitively analyze related papers from the Web of Science Core Collection from 1999 to 2021 with urban flood resilience as the keyword. We systematically summarize the relationship of urban flood resilience, including co-citation analysis of keywords, authors, research institutions, countries, and research trends. The scientometric results show that four stages can be distinguished to indicate the evolution of different keywords in urban flood management from 1999, and urban flood resilience has become a research hotspot with a significant increase globally since 2015. The research methods and progress of urban flood resilience in these four related fields are systematically analyzed, including climate change, urban planning, urban system adaptation and urban flood-simulation models. Climate change has been of high interest in urban flood-resilience research. Urban planning and the adaptation of urban systems differ in terms of human involvement and local policies, while more dynamic factors need to be jointly described. Models are mostly evaluated with indicators, and comprehensive resilience studies based on traditional models are needed for multi-level and higher performance models. Consequently, more studies about urban flood resilience based on local policies and dynamics within global urban areas combined with fine simulation are needed in the future, improving the concept of resilience as applied to urban flood-risk-management and assessment.","[Gao, Meiyan; Wang, Zongmin; Yang, Haibo] Zhengzhou Univ, Yellow River Lab, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Gao, Meiyan; Wang, Zongmin; Yang, Haibo] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Water Conservancy Engn, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China",Zhengzhou University; Zhengzhou University,"Yang, HB (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, Yellow River Lab, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China.;Yang, HB (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Water Conservancy Engn, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China.",gmeiyan123@163.com; zmwang@zzu.edu.cn; yanghb@zzu.edu.cn,,", Haibo/0000-0001-8794-1476",National Key R&D Program of China [2021YFC3200205]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51739009],National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The study was supported by National Key R&D Program of China (grant number 2021YFC3200205) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No: 51739009).,,122,2,2,80,100,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Yet current studies of the electricity-climate relationship focus on developed countries. Little was known about the energy-use behavior in group living. By using college students' monthly electricity-use data from September 2018 to August 2019 in Beijing, China, we build a weighted least square regression model and found a Ushaped relationship between temperature and electricity consumption. The results show that one additional day of temperature exceeding 30 degrees C would cause a 16.8% increase in monthly electricity consumption with reference to 18-22 degrees C while one additional day of temperature below -6 degrees C will increase it by 6%. The magnitudes of temperature effect on electricity are much greater than those in Shanghai and California. Further, we find that building structures, such as windows orientation and floor height, play important roles in the temperature-electricity relationship. Finally, we predict the changes in electricity use in a collection of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP). It finds that the electricity use in summer in north China would increase by 72.8% in RCP 4.5, 79.5% in RCP6.0, and 91.2% in RCP8.5. Our study could be extended to the urban area in northern China, and indicates how the electricity use would respond to climate change in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration, covering 8.1% of China's population and 8.4% of gross domestic product. Climate change impact on electricity use in residential and commercial sectors is significant and varying in regions. To achieve sustainable and environmental-friendly development, building structures could play a more effective role in energy saving and adaptation to climate change. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The typical characteristics of large urban agglomerations, including land use (such as commercial, industrial, and residential areas) with few public spaces and fragmented landscapes, make it difficult to apply these solutions to the urban fabric, forcing decision-makers and planners to act in informal settlements, highways, and industrial parks. One proposed area is an enclave with unused or underutilized lots, where fragments of the Atlantic Forest, parks, landfills, and rapidly expanding informal settlements can be found. This manuscript examines the socioeconomic and environmental processes that shaped this potential urban greenway between Santo Andre, Maua, and Ribeirao Pires, which are part of the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPRM), the largest in South America. A survey was conducted based on municipal and regional plans, the environmental and urban laws of Brazil, and the socioeconomic history of this part of the SPRM. In addition, satellite images were used to analyze land use evolution through geotechnologies. Finally, we prepared land use recommendations, considering opportunities and threats, highlighting the possibilities of protection and expansion of the Atlantic Forest. To this end, we examined the literature on environmental urban planning and design, green infrastructure, and other concepts. This study intends to stimulate researchers, planners, and decision-makers regarding the urban greening process in the Global South. According to the recommendations, this stimulus would develop these concepts according to the real situation of the region, which would combine the protection of wild habitats and urban environmental amenities. However, this effort makes no sense if one of the defining Global South characteristics not addressed is social inequality. Therefore, we recommend that an effort be made to develop and incorporate processes from urban greening in slum upgrading.","[Moreno, Robson da Silva; Galvao Cesar Braga, Diego Rafael] Fed Univ ABC, Engn Modeling & Appl Social Sci Ctr, Sao Bernardo Do Campo, Brazil; [Xavier, Luis Felipe] Sao Caetano do Sul Univ, Architecture Sch, Sao Caetano do Sul, Brazil",Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC),"Moreno, RD (corresponding author), Fed Univ ABC, Engn Modeling & Appl Social Sci Ctr, Sao Bernardo Do Campo, Brazil.",robson.moreno@ufabc.edu.br,,,"Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) [2018/06685-9, 2019/05644-0, 2015/03804-9]",Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),"The Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) supported this study with the Processes 2018/06685-9 and 2019/05644-0, which are part of the Thematic Project MacroAmb Environmental Governance in Sao Paulo Macro Metropolis in a climate variability context (2015/03804-9).",,86,0,0,2,8,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9634,,FRONT SUSTAIN CITIES,Front.

Despite this, a lack of evidence prevents a realistic analysis of whether such services are delivering on their potential. This paper reviews 66 studies that have evaluated outcomes and/or impacts of agricultural WCS in Africa, highlighting areas that have received relatively more attention as well as persistent gaps. While the evaluation of WCS outcomes is relatively straightforward, estimates of the number of people who access and use these services are uneven (covering a small number of communities in 23 of 54 African countries) and highly variable (with access estimates ranging from 2 to 86%, depending on the service and the population). Meanwhile, 22 documents estimate the impact of WCS with respect to yields and/or income. Developed with a variety of methods, these estimates are also wide ranging and illustrate how impact is conditioned on a number of characteristics of the service, the user, and the context in which both operate. The paper uses lessons developed through this review to develop a learning agenda, or evidence-building roadmap, to establish priorities that can guide work to improve the design, delivery, and impact of agricultural WCS in Africa. Priority learning areas include activities that can strengthen the evidence of access, use, and impacts of WCS, along with those that can advance the use and usability of evidence so as to improve the design and targeting of WCS services.

Applications in agricultural adaptation in western Kenya,MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Adaptation; Climate change; Costing; Cost benefit analysis; Decision-making; Multi-stakeholder; Participatory planning; Smallholder agriculture,CLIMATE-CHANGE; STRENGTHS; POLICY,"Adaptation to climate change is an important theme in the strategy and policy of institutions around the world. Billions of dollars are allocated every year, based on cost estimates of actions to cope with, or benefit from the impacts of climate change. Costing adaptation, however, is complex, involving multiple actors with differing values and a spectrum of possible adaptation strategies and pathways. Currently, expert driven, top-down approaches dominate adaptation costing in practice. These approaches are subject to misallocation, with global funds not always reaching vulnerable communities in most need. This paper introduces an analytical framework called Participatory Social Return on Investment (PSROI), which provides a structured framework for multi-stakeholder planning, selection and valuation of appropriate methods of adaptation. The broader economic, social and environmental impacts of these adaptation actions are explored and valued through a participatory process. PSROI is strength-based, building local capacity and generating stakeholder buy-in. The financial valuation generated provides an additional tool for examining and prioritizing adaptation actions based on their impact. Results from a pilot of the PSROI framework in a smallholder farming community in Western Kenya provide empirical evidence for the difference between expert driven desk-based and ground-based cost estimates that involve local communities. There was an approximate 70 % reduction in the valuation of an agroforestry intervention, selected by the local community, when compared between the desk-based valuation and that of the local community, using primary field data. This reduced expectation of the desk-based PSROI is justified by coherent explanations such as lack of knowledge about the intervention, misconception about the potential costs and benefits, and the risk-averse nature of the farmers. These and other important insights are fundamental for planning and decision-making, as well as appropriate targeting and delivery of funding for adaptation.","[Chaudhury, Abrar S.; Helfgott, Ariella; Thornton, Thomas F.; Sova, Chase] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Chaudhury, Abrar S.; Helfgott, Ariella; Sova, Chase] CGIAR, Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur CCAFS, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Helfgott, Ariella] Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Oxford; CGIAR; University of Adelaide,"Chaudhury, AS (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",abrarchaudhury@gmail.com,"Thornton, Tom/AAJ-5105-2020","Chaudhury, Abrar/0000-0002-3094-7639","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN)","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN)","This paper would not have been possible without the project and financial support of CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) and Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN).

An evaluation framework, and an application to Indian cities",LAND USE POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; Cities; Spatial planning; Urban planning; Evaluation framework,GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; ADAPTATION; IMPACTS; MITIGATION; STRATEGIES; ECONOMICS; AGENDA,"Addressing climate change issues require different response actions at various spatial scales. However, the incorporation of climate change issues in the form of agreement, framework and climate policies has tended to focus on international and national scale but lacking at local level. The spatial policies at local level, although not directly linked to climate change, if implemented effectively may become a viable policy instrument to mitigate and adapt to climate change issues. Policy makers at the local level have not explored these local policy options widely. Drawing from the case study in India, this paper aims at understanding how spatial plans in India are incorporating climate change issues and identifying potential gaps. Spatial plans across various cities in India were examined. The skeleton of the review framework is developed upon Moser and Loers (2008) work. To analyze these spatial plans 40 criteria were identified and divided into three components namely awareness, analysis and action. The results of this study show that the roles of spatial plan to integrate climate change issues at the city level in India are still limited. The overall performance of spatial plans shows that they have a low level of awareness, moderate level of analytical capability and limited action response to integrate climate change issues at local level. The result of the study identifies that spatial policies in various cities in India are still limited to physical and economic issues and undermine the issues of climate change. The majority of the sampled spatial plan failed to integrate climate change issues at various fronts of spatial policy process and required to recognize climate change as a critical issue among other issues. Finally the finding of this study creates a platform for discussion and decision making process on the potential aspects where climate change issues can become part of spatial planning policy.

Employing comprehensive data from 2822 farm households in Ethiopia and Kenya (East Africa; EA) and 1902 farm households in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal (South Asia; SA), this study investigates the main climate risks that farmers faced and the adaptation strategies they used. Among others, excessive rainfall and heightened crop pest/disease incidence are commonly observed climate-induced risks in all study areas, while cyclones and salinity are unique to Bangladesh. Drought is prevalent in Ethiopia, India, Kenya, and Nepal. Farmers in those countries responded with strategies that include change in farming practices, sustainable land management, reduce consumption, sell assets, use savings and borrowings, seek alternative employment and assistance from government or NGO. In general, farmers faced several multiple climate risks simultaneously and they responded with multiple adaptation strategies. Therefore, this study used a multivariate probit (MVP) approach to examine the factors influencing the adoption of adaptation strategies. Unlike other studies, we also tested and corrected for possible endogeneity in model estimation. All the countries mentioned have low adaptive capacity to address climate change, which is further weakened by inadequate governance and inefficient institutions. We observed significant differences in the choice of adaptation strategies between male-headed households (MHHs) and female-headed households (FHHs), as well as across countries. Generally, MHHs are more likely to seek additional employment and change agricultural practices, while FHHs and households headed by older persons tend to reduce consumption and rely on savings and borrowings. Institutional support for adaptation is much less in EA compared to SA. Training on alternative farming practices, enhancing non-farm employment options, better institutional support, and social security for older farmers are crucial for climate change adaptation in both regions.","[Prakash Aryal, Jeetendra; Sapkota, Tek Bahadur; Rahut, Dil Bahadur; Stirling, Clare M.] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Carretera Mexico Veracruz,Km 45, El Batan 56237, Texcoco, Mexico; [Rahut, Dil Bahadur] Asian Dev Bank Inst ADBI, Chiyoda Ku, Kasumigaseki Bldg 8F,3-2-5 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1006008, Japan; [Marenya, Paswel] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Nairobi, Kenya; [Stirling, Clare M.] Mondelez Int, Cocoa Life, Global R&D Technol Lead, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); Mondelez International,"Aryal, JP; Sapkota, TB; Rahut, DB (corresponding author), Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Carretera Mexico Veracruz,Km 45, El Batan 56237, Texcoco, Mexico.;Rahut, DB (corresponding author), Asian Dev Bank Inst ADBI, Chiyoda Ku, Kasumigaseki Bldg 8F,3-2-5 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1006008, Japan.",jeetenaryal@gmail.com; t.sapkota@cgiar.org; drahut@adbi.org,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Rahut, Dil Bahadur/AAD-8370-2022","Marenya, Paswel/0000-0003-2496-2303; Rahut, Dil Bahadur/0000-0002-7505-5271; Aryal, Jeetendra/0000-0002-9128-5739",CGIAR Fund Donors; Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR); Australian International Food Security Research Centre (AIFSRC) [CSE/2009/024],CGIAR Fund Donors(CGIAR); Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)(Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res); Australian International Food Security Research Centre (AIFSRC),"This work was carried out by International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), with support from CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.

It provides the basis to decide 'what' adaptation measures are needed 'where'. Vulnerability which is defined as a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity, differs spatially and evolves temporally. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the dynamics of vulnerability at sub-national scales to be prepared for and respond to current and future climatic risks. This paper focuses on Ethiopia where a sub-national understanding of vulnerability dynamics in smallholder agriculture systems is missing to date. The paper assesses the vulnerability of crop-based smallholder systems in Ethiopia for the past (1996-2005), current (2006-2015), and two future (2036-2045 and 2066-2075) climate scenarios using an indicator-based approach. The future scenarios are based on two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) RCP 2.6 and RCP 6.0 from four general circulation models. Results show the emergence of highly vulnerable zones that were missing in the past scenario. With Paris agreement pathway, keeping global warming under 2 degrees C (RCP 2.6), reduction in vulnerability of 10% of the zones is noted in far future (2066-75) as compared to RCP 6.0 where the exposure increases, making 30% of the zones highly vulnerable. The projected increase in exposure to climatic hazards will worsen the vulnerability of smallholder agricultural systems in future unless the current adaptation deficit is sufficiently addressed. This study maps the temporal dynamics of vulnerability unlike the prevailing snapshot assessments at subnational-level for Ethiopia. The study seeks to assist the decision-making process to build resilience to climate change in Ethiopia and other low-income countries with similar geophysical and socio-economic conditions.","[Shukla, Roopam; Gleixner, Stephanie; Yalew, Amsalu Woldie; Schauberger, Bernhard; Sietz, Diana; Gornott, Christoph] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Shukla, Roopam; Gleixner, Stephanie; Yalew, Amsalu Woldie; Schauberger, Bernhard; Sietz, Diana; Gornott, Christoph] Leibniz Assoc, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Gornott, Christoph] Univ Kassel, Fac Organ Agr Sci, Agroecosyst Anal & Modelling, Kassel, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Universitat Kassel,"Shukla, R (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.;Shukla, R (corresponding author), Leibniz Assoc, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",shukla@pik-potsdam.de,"S, D/HJB-2910-2022; Gornott, Christoph/ABI-8107-2020","S, D/0000-0002-2309-2134; Gornott, Christoph/0000-0003-3933-3358; Yalew, Amsalu Woldie/0000-0002-1778-8477",Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); ClimSec project - German Foreign Office,Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); ClimSec project - German Foreign Office,"We acknowledge the support of our funders of our research.

Publication trends were analyzed in English, Spanish and Portuguese. Publications in English (87%) were selected for network and data mining analysis. Most of the research was conducted in the USA, followed by India and China. The main research methods were identified through correlation networks. In many cases, social studies of perception are related to climatic methods and vegetation analysis supported by GIS. The analysis of keywords identified ten research topics: adaptation, risk, community, local, impact, livelihood, farmer, household, strategy, and variability. Adaptation is in the core of the correlation network of all keywords. The interdisciplinary analysis between social and environmental factors, suggest improvements are needed for research in this field. A single method cannot address understanding of a phenomenon as complicated as the socio-environmental. This study provides valuable information for future research by clarifying the current context of perception work carried out in the coastal regions; and identifying the tools best suited for carrying out this type of research.","[Becerra, Melgris Jose; De Souza, Everaldo Barreiros] Univ Fed Para UFPA, Inst Geocincias, BR-60440554 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Pimentel, Marcia Aparecida] Univ Fed Para UFPA, Programa Posgrad Geog, BR-60440554 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Ibrahin Tovar, Gabriel] Univ Buenos Aires UBA, Fac Farm & Bioquim, Dept Quim Analit & Fisicoquim, C1113AAD, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Ibrahin Tovar, Gabriel] Univ Buenos Aires UBA, CONICET, Inst Quim & Metab Farmaco IQUIMEFA, C1111AAI, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Universidade Federal do Para; Universidade Federal do Para; University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires,"De Souza, EB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Para UFPA, Inst Geocincias, BR-60440554 Belem, Para, Brazil.;Tovar, GI (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires UBA, Fac Farm & Bioquim, Dept Quim Analit & Fisicoquim, C1113AAD, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Tovar, GI (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires UBA, CONICET, Inst Quim & Metab Farmaco IQUIMEFA, C1111AAI, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",everaldo@ufpa.br; gtovar@conicet.gov.ar,"Tovar, Gabriel Ibrahin/R-8163-2017; De Souza, Everaldo/V-5163-2017","Tovar, Gabriel Ibrahin/0000-0003-1642-4126; Becerra Ruiz, Melgris Jose/0000-0001-6675-7370; De Souza, Everaldo/0000-0001-6045-0984",OAS-GCUB; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior [CAPES] [001],OAS-GCUB; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior [CAPES](Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"M.J.B. is grateful for his fellowship granted by OAS-GCUB.

As some scholars argue, risk messaging strategies that make climate change personally relevant may help overcome this barrier. In this article, we report a large-n survey experiment on San Francisco Bay Area residents to investigate how providing spatially-resolved risk information to individuals shapes their climate risk perceptions in the context of sea-level rise. Our results suggest that personalized risk messaging can sometimes reduce concern about sea-level rise. These experimental effects are limited to respondents who believe that climate change is happening. Further, we do not find an effect of providing local risk messages on an individual's willingness to pay for regional climate adaptation measures. Our results emphasize that local messaging strategies around sea-level rise risks may not have the clear impacts that some advocates and scholars presume.","[Mildenberger, Matto] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Polit Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Lubell, Mark] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Hummel, Michelle] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Civil Engn, Arlington, TX 76019 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Mildenberger, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Polit Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",mildenberger@ucsb.edu,,"Lubell, Mark/0000-0001-5757-7116",National Science Foundation [1541056],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Thanks to Jennifer Marlon and two anonymous reviewers for comments on earlier drafts of this paper.

This has been a prominent and enduring paleoclimate theory. We show that incorrect assumptions and other problems invalidate this theory. Seven alternative concepts are presented that suggest North American fossil giant tortoises could have evolved necessary adaptations including cold-adaptive morphology, behavioural thermoregulation, burrowing, use of caves as shelters, tolerance of prolonged cessation of food consumption, cryoprotection and supercooling (protection from freezing), and gigantothermy (metabolic and structural thermoregulation) to survive northern winters and in montane areas.

By considering online networks and narratives as evidence of offline influence, it effectively repurposes publicly available data from digital sources such as social media and websites by employing text mining and social network analysis to assess the influence and reach of the program among stakeholder at various levels. Results show that CCAFS has supported increased public awareness of CSA; that it actively engages with key actors within a network of stakeholders with more than 60 thousand members; that it has positively shifted the debate on climate adaptation among strategic partners through increased message alignment and space in the policy agenda; and that the program's reach is potentially amplified to 5.8 M users on Twitter.","[Carneiro, Bia] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies, Colegio S Jeronimo, Apartado 3087, P-3000995 Coimbra, Portugal; [Resce, Giuliano] Univ Molise, Dept Econ, Via Francesco De Sanctis 1, I-86100 Campobasso, Italy; [Laderach, Peter; Schapendonk, Frans; Pacillo, Grazia] Alliance Biovers Int, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Via Tre Denari 472-A, I-00054 Rome, Italy; [Laderach, Peter; Schapendonk, Frans; Pacillo, Grazia] CIAT, Headquarters Rome, Via Tre Denari 472-A, I-00054 Rome, Italy",Universidade de Coimbra; University of Molise,"Carneiro, B (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies, Colegio S Jeronimo, Apartado 3087, P-3000995 Coimbra, Portugal.",biacarneiro@ces.uc.pt,,"Resce, Giuliano/0000-0002-3913-0510; Carneiro, Bia/0000-0002-7957-8694",,,,,88,1,1,4,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

It finds challenges to and opportunities for strengthening the science, policy, and practice interfaces for forest carbon in a changing climate, and proposes reforms to strengthen the capacity of forests to be a long-term contributor to Australia's emission targets and climate adaptation policy.

Financial resources may enable smallholder farmers to implement adaptation practices and diversify income and investments, which has the potential to affect household income and food security. Here we explore relationships between access to different types of financial resources among male and female-headed households and women vs. men, use of financial resources, and its relationship to food security. We use data from the CGIAR Climate Change, Agriculture, and Food Security (CCAFS) program from four sites including Nyando (Western Kenya) and Wote (Eastern Kenya), Rakai (Uganda) and Kaffrine (Senegal), to represent major farming systems and agro-ecological zones across Africa. We find that male and female-headed households do not attempt to borrow financial resources in significantly different quantities; however, female-headed households are less likely to have access to financial resources if they wanted them. We find that men and male-headed households are more likely to access formal loans. As well, we find that male and female-headed households spend their financial resources differently with female-headed households most likely to use their credit for food, medical expenses and education and male-headed households most likely to use it on food, agriculture/ livestock inputs and education. Formals loans were more frequently associated with credit spent on agriculture/livestock inputs while informal loans were more likely to be utilized for buying food and medical care. In the context of food security we find that all households and sexes that attempted to borrow money in the past 12 months were less likely to borrow food or other goods, but that female-headed households were more than twice as likely to borrow food or other goods overall. These results add nuance to the relationship of financial resources to food security, suggesting that for many smallholders, especially women, credit is often used to obtain food and other health outcomes as compared to on-farm investment. The use of financial resources for these varying purposes likely has different short-term vs. long-term returns and tradeoffs, which could influence smallholder farmer capacity for climate change adaptation.","[Carranza, Marissa; Niles, Meredith T.] Univ Vermont, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Niles, Meredith T.] Univ Vermont, Food Syst Program, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont; University of Vermont,"Niles, MT (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.;Niles, MT (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Food Syst Program, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",mtniles@uvm.edu,,,USDA HATCH grant [VT-H02303],USDA HATCH grant,This project was funded in part by USDA HATCH grant number VT-H02303 to MN.,,53,6,6,6,14,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

Currently, management approaches are being proposed that intend to (1) mitigate climate change by enhancing forest carbon stores and (2) foster adaptation by maintaining compositionally and structurally complex forests. However, little is known about the compatibility of these two objectives or the long-term efficacy of a given management regime at simultaneously achieving adaptation and mitigation. To address this need, we examined stand-level carbon and complexity responses using five long-term (> 50 yrs) silviculture experiments within the upper Great Lakes region, USA. In particular, live tree carbon stores and sequestration rates, and compositional and structural complexity were analyzed from three thinning experiments in Pinus resinosa and two selection method experiments in northern hardwood systems to elucidate the long-term effects of management on these ecosystem attributes and the general compatibility of mitigation and adaptation objectives. As expected, we observed a general increase in large tree densities with stand age and positive relationships between stand stocking level and live tree carbon stores. More importantly, our results clearly identify tradeoffs between the achievement of mitigation and adaptation objectives across each study. For example, maintaining higher stocking levels (i.e., enhanced mitigation by increasing carbon stores) resulted in decreases in stand-level structural and compositional complexity (i.e., reduced adaptation potential). In addition, rates of live tree carbon increment were also the lowest within the highest stocking levels; despite the benefits of these stand conditions to maximizing carbon stores. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of avoiding rigid adherence to a single objective, such as maximum on-site carbon stores, without recognizing potential consequences to other ecosystem components crucial to ensuring long-term ecosystem functioning within the context of environmental change. One potential stand-level strategy for balancing these goals may be to employ multi-aged management systems, such as irregular shelterwood and selection systems, that maintain a large proportion of carbon stores in retained mature trees while using thinning to create spatial heterogeneity that promotes higher sequestration rates in smaller, younger trees and simultaneously enhances structural and compositional complexity.

Physicians are considered trustworthy and are well positioned to discuss climate change with patients. A unified strategy by all U.S. medical societies is essential to effectively mitigate their carbon footprint and address health concerns. Methods We conducted a review of the public facing websites of member organizations of the AMA House of Delegates and the AMA, which were scored based on inclusion of content related to climate change in position statements or policies, task forces or committees, patient education materials, practice recommendations and any official society publications. Membership in the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health or participation in the organization My Green Doctor were recorded as indicators of a commitment to providing educational resources about mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The availability of a virtual option for annual meetings, as a potential means to reduce the carbon footprint of attendees, was trended from 2021 to 2022. Results Fifty out of 111 U.S. medical organizations (45%) had at least one metric with a reference to climate change and sixty-one organizations (55%) had no evidence of such website content. Out of 111 websites, only 20% (N = 22) had position statements or policies pertaining to climate change, 11% (N = 12) had committees or task forces dealing with climate change, 8% (N = 9) provided patient education resources on climate change, 21% (N = 23) included green practice recommendations and 45% (N = 50) had an article in an official society publication addressing climate change. Only 14% (N = 15) were listed as member societies of the Medical Consortium on Climate Change and 2% (N = 2) were participating organizations with My Green Doctor. Conclusions Viewed through the lens of medical society websites, there was a wide variation in efforts to address climate change. The high performing organizations can serve as a guide for other societies to help mitigate and adapt to the climate emergency.","[Bush, Thomas; Jensen, William A.] Santa Clara Valley Med Ctr, Dept Med, San Jose, CA 95128 USA; [Katsumoto, Tamiko R.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Immunol & Rheumatol, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA",Santa Clara Valley Medical Center; Stanford University,"Katsumoto, TR (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Immunol & Rheumatol, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.",tkatsum@stanford.edu,,"Katsumoto, Tamiko/0000-0002-7978-0315",,,,,41,0,0,1,1,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2458,,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,BMC Public Health,OCT 21,2022,22,1,,,,,,,1950,10.1186/s12889-022-14339-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14339-7,,,12,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",5M4FR,36271371,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000871053700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

At present, levels of groundwater use and access in the EIGP lag far behind other areas of South Asia despite abundant available groundwater resources. A key reason for prevailing access constraints is the dependence on diesel pumpsets for accessing groundwater, which are typically unsubsidised and therefore expensive to purchase and operate. To date, efforts to reduce access costs have focused almost exclusively on how to incentivise adoption of alternative electric or solar-powered pumping technologies, which are viewed as being cheaper to operate and less environmentally damaging due to their lower operational carbon emissions. In contrast, there has been little attention paid to identifying opportunities to make existing diesel pump systems more cost effective for farmers to operate in order to support adaptation to climate change and reduce poverty. In this study, we use evidence from 116 detailed in-situ pump tests along with interviews with pumpset dealers, mechanics and farmers in the Nepal Terai to assess how and why fuel efficiency and operational costs of diesel pump irrigation are affected by farmers' pumpset selection decisions. We show that costs diesel pumpset irrigation can be reduced significantly by supporting and incentivising farmers (e.g., through equipment advisories, improved supply chains for maintenance services and spare parts) to invest in newer low-cost, portable and smaller horsepower pumpset designs that are more effectively matched to local operating conditions in the EIGP than older Indian manufactured engines that have historically been preferred by farmers in the region. Such interventions can help to unlock potential for intensified irrigation water use in the EIGP, contributing to goals of improving agricultural productivity and resilience to climate extremes while also strengthening farmers capacity to invest in emerging low-carbon pumping technologies.","[Foster, Timothy] Univ Manchester, Dept Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Adhikari, Roshan] Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Adhikari, Subash; Justice, Scott; Tiwari, Baburam; Urfels, Anton] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Sustainable Intensificat Program, Nepalganj, Nepal; [Urfels, Anton] Wageningen Univ & Res, Water Resources Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Urfels, Anton] Wageningen Univ & Res, Ctr Crop Syst Anal, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Krupnik, Timothy J.] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Sustainable Intensificat Program, Dhaka, Bangladesh",University of Manchester; University of Manchester; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Foster, T (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Dept Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England.",timothy.foster@manchester.ac.uk,,"Adhikari, Roshan/0000-0002-1932-6225",United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) [OPP1052535]; USAID,United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)CGIAR); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"This study was made possible through the support provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) to the Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia (CSISA; http://csisa.org) Phase III project (Grant No. OPP1052535) and USAID supported CSISA Agronomy and Seed Systems Scaling project.

This includes focusing on win-win management practices that simultaneously provide short-term benefits to farmers and improve the sustainability and resiliency of agricultural systems with respect to climate change. In the Northwest U.S., a collaborative process has been used to engage individuals spanning the research-practice continuum. This collaborative approach was utilized at a 2016 workshop titled  Agriculture in a Changing Climate, that included a broad range of participants including university faculty and students, crop and livestock producers, and individuals representing state, tribal and federal government agencies, industry, nonprofit organizations, and conservation districts. The Northwest U.S. encompasses a range of agro-ecological systems and diverse geographic and climatic contexts. Regional research and science communication efforts for climate change and agriculture have a strong history of engaging diverse stakeholders. These features of the Northwest U.S. provide a foundation for the collaborative research and extension prioritization presented here. We focus on identifying research and extension actions that can be taken over the next 5 years in four areas identified as important areas by conference organizers and participants: (1) cropping systems, (2) livestock systems, (3) decision support systems to support consideration of climate change in agricultural management decisions; and (4) partnerships among researchers and stakeholders. We couple insights from the workshop and a review of current literature to articulate current scientific understanding, and priorities recommended by workshop participants that target existing knowledge gaps, challenges, and opportunities. Priorities defined at the Agriculture in a Changing Climate workshop highlight the need for ongoing investment in interdisciplinary research integrating social, economic, and biophysical sciences, strategic collaborations, and knowledge sharing to develop actionable science that can support informed decision-making in the agriculture sector as the climate changes.","[Yorgey, Georgine G.; Kruger, Chad E.] Washington State Univ, Ctr Sustaining Agr & Nat Resources, Mt Vernon, IA USA; [Allen, Elizabeth R.; Rajagopalan, Kirti] Washington State Univ, Ctr Sustaining Agr & Nat Resources, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Whitefield, Elizabeth M.] Washington State Univ, Puyallup Res & Extens Ctr, Puyallup, WA 98371 USA; [Embertson, Nichole M.] Whatcom Conservat Dist, Lynden, WA USA; [Jones, Vincent P.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Tree Fruit Res & Extens Ctr, Wenatchee, WA USA; [Roesch-McNally, Gabrielle E.; Van Horne, Beatrice] USDA, Northwest Climate Hub, Corvallis, OR USA; [Abatzoglou, John T.] Univ Idaho, Dept Geog, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Collins, Harold P.] USDA ARS, Grassland Soil & Water Res Lab, Temple, TX 76502 USA; [Houston, Laurie L.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Ewing, Timothy W.] Washington State Univ, Ctr Sustaining Agr & Nat Resources, Puyallup, WA USA",Washington State University; Washington State University; Washington State University; Washington State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Idaho; University of Idaho; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Oregon State University; Washington State University,"Yorgey, GG (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Ctr Sustaining Agr & Nat Resources, Mt Vernon, IA USA.",yorgey@wsu.edu,"Abatzoglou, John T/ABE-6134-2020; Hall, Sonia/HLH-3458-2023; Abatzoglou, John T/C-7635-2012","Abatzoglou, John T/0000-0001-7599-9750; Abatzoglou, John T/0000-0001-7599-9750; Allen, Elizabeth/0000-0002-3579-5398; Hall, Sonia A/0000-0002-3442-814X; Karimi, Tina/0000-0003-2801-8854","U.S. Department of Agriculture Northwest Climate Hub [15JV11261954075]; U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2016-67007-24889, 2011-68002-30191]","U.S. Department of Agriculture Northwest Climate Hub; U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","This material is based upon work that was supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Northwest Climate Hub under award number 15JV11261954075, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, under award numbers 2016-67007-24889, Catalyzing and Coordinating Northwest Agricultural Research and Extension Efforts for Food Security in a Changing Climate, and 2011-68002-30191, Regional Approaches to Climate Change for Pacific Northwest Agriculture (REACCH-PNA).",,177,7,7,12,31,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

However, to fully understand how well early humans were adapted to climate change, a truly precise dating of the Paleolithic sites is required. Here, we established a high-resolution astronomical timescale for the Xiantai and Donggutuo fluvio-lacustrine successions at the eastern margin of the Nihewan Basin employing low-field magnetic susceptibility (x) as a climatic indicator, aiming to further refine the ages of the Xiantai, Donggutuo and Maliang Paleolithic sites. Starting from an initial age model constrained by geomagnetic reversals, larger-scale x cycles were firstly tuned to orbital obliquity using an automatic orbital tuning method. This first-order tuning was followed by simultaneously tuning x to both obliquity and precession. The finally tuned x records can be correlated almost cycle-by-cycle with the quartz grain-size record of the Chinese loess sequence and the marine delta O-18 record. The astronomically estimated age of the Xiantai Paleolithic site is ca. 1.48 Ma, corresponding to paleosol layer S-20 of the Chinese loess sequences or marine oxygen isotope stage (MIS) 49, an interglacial period. The astronomical estimate for the Donggutuo Paleolithic site ranges from similar to 1.06 Ma to 1.12 Ma, corresponding to paleosol/loess layers S-11-S-12 or MIS 31-33, spanning both interglacial and glacial periods. The astronomically estimated age of the Maliang Paleolithic site is similar to 0.79 Ma, corresponding to loess layer L-8 or MIS 20, a glacial period. This astronomical finding further implies that early humans may have permanently occupied China as far north as 40 degrees N since at least 1.1 Ma, and before this time the occupation may be intermittent.

Previous studies have mostly concentrated on evaluating the impacts of climate change on non-point source pollution in agricultural watersheds. Few studies have assessed the impacts of climate change on the water quality of river basins with complex point and non-point pollution sources. In view of the gap, this paper aims to establish a framework for stochastic assessment of the sensitivity of water quality to future climate change in a river basin with complex pollution sources. A sub-daily soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model was developed to simulate the discharge, transport, and transformation of nitrogen from multiple point and non-point pollution sources in the upper Huai River basin of China. A weather generator was used to produce 50 years of synthetic daily weather data series for all 25 combinations of precipitation (changes by -10, 0, 10, 20, and 30%) and temperature change (increases by 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 degrees C) scenarios. The generated daily rainfall series was disaggregated into the hourly scale and then used to drive the subdaily SWAT model to simulate the nitrogen cycle under different climate change scenarios. Our results in the study region have indicated that (1) both total nitrogen (TN) loads and concentrations are insensitive to temperature change; (2) TN loads are highly sensitive to precipitation change, while TN concentrations are moderately sensitive; (3) the impacts of climate change on TN concentrations are more spatiotemporally variable than its impacts on TN loads; and (4) wide distributions of TN loads and TN concentrations under individual climate change scenario illustrate the important role of climatic variability in affecting water quality conditions. In summary, the large variability in SWAT simulation results within and between each climate change scenario highlights the uncertainty of the impacts of climate change and the need to incorporate extreme conditions in managing water environment and developing climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.","[Yang, Xiaoying; Tan, Lit] Fudan Univ, Dept Environm Engn Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [He, Ruimin; Wang, Guoqing] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Fu, Guangtao] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Ctr Water Syst, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Ye, Jinyin] Anhui Prov Meteorol Observ, Hefei 230001, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qun] Zhumadian City Bur Environm Protect, Zhumadian 463000, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute; University of Exeter,"Yang, XY (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Dept Environm Engn Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.;Wang, GQ (corresponding author), Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xiaoying@fudan.edu.cn; gqwang@nhri.cn,"Fu, Guangtao/ABE-3874-2021","Fu, Guangtao/0000-0003-1045-9125",Open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering [2016490411]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0601501]; Chinese Natural Science Foundation [41201191]; Chinese National Engineering Laboratory for Circular Economy,Open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering; National Key Research and Development Program of China; Chinese Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese National Engineering Laboratory for Circular Economy,"This work was supported by the Open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering (2016490411), National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFA0601501), Chinese Natural Science Foundation (41201191), and Chinese National Engineering Laboratory for Circular Economy.",,51,9,10,9,73,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

J,"Qiu, GY; Yin, J; Shu, G",,,,Qiu Guo-yu; Yin Jin; Shu Geng,,,Impact of Climate and Land-Use Changes on Water Security for Agriculture in Northern China,JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,water resources; climate change; land-use; dryness; riverflow; sustainable development,,"North China is the most important food basket of China, where the majority of wheat and corn are produced. Most crops grown in North China are irrigated, thus water security is food security. Since the 1980s, drying has been frequently observed, as shown by a reduction in precipitation, cutoff in riverflow, and shrinkage of lakes. This increase in drying cannot be explained by climate change alone. We propose that intensive land-use in this area in recent decades has had a significant impact. The objectives of the study are to develop a quantitative model of the concurrent processes of climate change and land-use in North China, and to estimate the relative contributions of each on the observed drying. We integrated relevant socioeconomic data, land-use data, and climate data in the model, and carried out a detailed multi-temporal (decade, year, day) analysis. Results showed that land-use has greatly changed since 1999. This change is mainly associated with an extremely important 1999 national policy of returning farmland and grazing land to forest and grassland. We found an interesting interaction between climate change and land use policy on riverflow, runoff, and evapotranspiration. During 1970s and 1980s, climate change explained more than 80%, while the land-use change explained only 10% of the riverflow change. The relative contributions were 45 and 45% in the 1980s-1990s and 35 and 55% in the 1990s-2000s respectively for climate change and land-use change. Since the 1990s land-use change has also contributed more to runoff change than climate change. The opposite trend was found for changes in evapotranspiration. Water availability for agriculture in northern China is simultaneously stressed by extensive changes in land-use and rapid climate change. Adaptation of ecological principles, such as the returning farmland/grazing land to forest and grassland policy, and other adjustments of economic developmental strategies can be effective tools to mitigate the water shortage problem in northern China and promote sustainable agricultural and food development.","[Qiu Guo-yu; Shu Geng] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Sch Environm & Energy, Key Lab Urban Habitat Environm Sci & Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Shu Geng] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Yin Jin] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China",Peking University; University Town of Shenzhen; University of California System; University of California Davis; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research,"Shu, G (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Sch Environm & Energy, Key Lab Urban Habitat Environm Sci & Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",sgeng@ucdavis.edu,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [91025008, 30972421]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We acknowledge, with gratitude, the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (91025008 and 30972421).",,19,26,29,6,85,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2095-3119,,,J INTEGR AGR,J.

Generally, the fact that climate change is not a new phenomenon has attracted scholars to conduct numerous relevant studies. Unfortunately, most past researches were not from the perspectives of social science of the Asian's community. Hence, the present study reviewed a considerable amount of past studies on the act of adjusting with environmental change among the Asian fishermen which is known as one of the communities that are highly dependent on nature stability. Meanwhile, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was adopted for the review of the current research which utilised two main journal databases, namely Scopus and Web of Science. Accordingly, the searching efforts resulted in a total of 18 articles that can be analysed systematically. Most importantly, the review managed to formulate five main themes, namely livelihood diversification, social, physical infrastructure, awareness-knowledge-experience, and conservation and enforcement based on the thematic analyses. Overall, further analysis of the five themes resulted in the establishment of a total of 21 sub-themes. Finally, a number of recommendations were presented at the end of this research for the reference of future scholars. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This encompassing assessment of the existing literature likewise scrutinises existing scientific hurdles in approaching existing/future human thermal wellbeing in local urban contexts. The respective hurdles are subsequently framed into new research opportunities concerning human biometeorology and its increasing interdisciplinary significance in multifaceted urban thermal adaptation processes.

Data and information on spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC), current practices that could enhance climate adaptation including management of organic resources were collected through biophysical assessments and snap community surveys. Even though homestead fields were more frequently cultivated, higher amounts of SOC (15 +/- 2gkg(-1)) were observed in homesteads when compared to the periphery cropped sections in bushes (SOC=9 +/- 1gkg(-1)). Possibly, a combination of household wastes, droppings of domestic animals that are mostly reared in a free-range system, manures applied to crops and cultural norms of chieftaincy, which cause short-term fallowing of homestead fields could account for the differences in SOC. Use of organic resources for soil amendment among farmers was low (31% of interviewed farmers) due largely to ignorance of fertilizer values of manures and residues, traditions for bush-burning and competing use of organic resources for fuels. Our findings suggest a need for effective management practices, training and awareness aimed at improving management of organic resources and, consequently, increasing SOC and resilience to climate-change-induced risks.","[Heve, William K.] Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA; [Heve, William K.] Minist Food & Agr, Plant Protect & Regulatory Serv Directorate, Pokuase Accra, Ghana; [Olesen, Jorgen E.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Agroecol, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark; [Chirinda, Ngonidzashe] Ctr Int Agr Trop, Cali, Colombia; [Adiku, Samuel G.

We also investigated whether traditional thinning (selection of one to a few stems per stump) could mitigate the consequences of increased drought in oak coppices. Increased drought reduced the number of reproductive trees, mean number of female flowers produced and acorn crop size, although most of these effects appeared only in the last 2 years of the experiment. In a different way, thinning enhanced all reproductive attributes, but its main effects were transient and covered only 1 or 2 years after the application of the treatments. Our results indicate that a moderate reduction in rainfall (15 per cent) reduces the reproductive ability of Q. ilex. This may have long-term negative consequences for recruitment as well as for the fauna feeding on acorns. Although traditional thinning may mitigate the consequences of increased drought, it has a remarkably short-term effect. This highlights the need to re-examine traditional forestry practices as potential adaptive strategies for coping with climate change in Mediterranean regenerating forests.","[Sanchez-Humanes, Belen; Maria Espelta, Josep] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Ctr Ecol Res & Forestry Applicat CREAF, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); University of Barcelona,"Sanchez-Humanes, B (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Ctr Ecol Res & Forestry Applicat CREAF, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",belen.sanchez@creaf.uab.es,"Espelta, Josep M/I-3891-2016","Espelta, Josep M/0000-0002-0242-4988",Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA) [RTA2005-00100-CO2]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MCIIN) [CGL2008-04847-C02-02]; Consolider-Ingenio Montes [CSD2008-00040]; Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia,"Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA)(Instituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA)); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MCIIN)(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); Consolider-Ingenio Montes(Spanish Government); Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia(Spanish Government)","Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA RTA2005-00100-CO2), Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MCIIN CGL2008-04847-C02-02) and Consolider-Ingenio Montes (CSD2008-00040); Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia (FPU Grant) to B.S.H",,61,52,53,2,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0015-752X,1464-3626,,FORESTRY,Forestry,JAN,2011,84,1,,,,,73,82,,10.1093/forestry/cpq045,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/forestry/cpq045,,,10,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,720AI,,Bronze,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000287252200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

First, the design and verification of a single fog cooling unit was identified through an indoor experiment. Second, the temperature reduction effect of the installed fog cooling system was measured based on a sensor and verified through a finite volume method (FVM)-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. Third, a numerical analysis of the optimal fog cooling arrangement was designed and performed in the Indongchon area. The temperature reduction design manual and model equations, which can be used by decision-makers, were analyzed through numerical analysis. The measured temperature reduction and simulation values had a high accuracy of R-2 > 0.8. Based on the verified model, scenarios A-D were designed and analyzed according to the fog cooling arrangement. Scenario B, in which the fog cooling was arranged vertically to the wind direction, appeared to be the most efficient. In this case, the volume average temperature where fog cooling was installed could be reduced by up to 3.02 degrees C. It was also found that efficiency is higher when the fog cooling system is positioned at narrow intervals of <5 m than at wide intervals of >10 m, considering the wind direction. The results of this study can aid decision makers-including urban policymakers and planners-for estimating the potential extent of temperature reduction and increase in humidity by adopting fog cooling.","[Kim, Jaekyoung; Kang, Junsuk] Seoul Natl Univ, Interdisciplinary Program Landscape Architecture, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Kim, Jaekyoung; Kang, Junsuk] Seoul Natl Univ, Transdisciplinary Program Smart City Global Conver, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Kang, Junsuk] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Rural Syst Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Kang, Junsuk] Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Kang, J (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Interdisciplinary Program Landscape Architecture, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",kimnam124@snu.ac.kr; junkang@snu.ac.kr,,,"Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of South Korea [21CTAP-C163682-01, 21NSPS-B149833-04]; Ministry of Environment of South Korea","Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of South Korea(Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA)Ministry of Land, Infrastructure & Transport (MOLIT), Republic of Korea); Ministry of Environment of South Korea(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea)","This work is supported by the Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) grant funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of South Korea (Grant 21CTAP-C163682-01, 21NSPS-B149833-04) and knowledge-based environmental program funded by Ministry of Environment of South Korea.",,93,1,1,8,13,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

Large regional differences of PAR during the maize growing season were found in the study area ranging from 4107.2 to 5937.3 mol center dot m(-2), which gradually decreased from west to east. Compared to the SMA, the IMA exhibited 12.7% greater PAR during the past 54 years, while IMA showed lower LUE in 1961 - 1999 and 28.9% higher than SMA since the 2000s. Both SMA the IMA have experienced a continuous dimming trend in the maize growing season as the total PAR has decreased by 4.63%, with an average change rate of - 36.04 mol center dot m(-2)center dot 10a(-1). However, a significant increasing trend for the maize LUE at the farmer's level was found in 1961-2014, which has changed from 0.39 to 2.90% in IMA and 0.39 to 2.19% in SMA, respectively. Furthermore, large LUE gaps exist between farmer's level and high record level, as the highest LUE has reached 6.74% in the study area. The inconsistent changes between the PAR and the LUE resulted from the increased yield. The positive effect of agricultural technology and crop varieties' improvement on maize yield compensated for the negative impact of PAR reduction. In summary, asymmetry dynamic change trends between the PAR and the LUE were found during the maize growing season in North China, and the IMA showed higher maize yield, PAR, and LUE. Making full use of radiation resources may be one of the effective ways to improve the maize yield in the SMA, which could help maize production better adapt to climate change.","[He, Huayun; Hu, Qi; Wang, Jing; Xing, Mengyuan; Liu, Yuanyuan; Wang, Xiaochen; Li, Rong; Pan, Xuebiao; Pan, Zhihua; Huang, Binxiang; He, Qijin] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Hu, Q (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",hehuayun0715@163.com; huq@cau.edu.cn,"liu, 园园/HJI-4438-2023; liu, yuanyuan/GWZ-5838-2022",,National Key Research and Development Project [2021YFD1901104-1]; Major Science and Technology Projects of Inner Mongolia [2020ZD0005-0101],National Key Research and Development Project; Major Science and Technology Projects of Inner Mongolia,National Key Research and Development Project (Grant No. 2021YFD1901104-1); Major Science and Technology Projects of Inner Mongolia (Grant No. 2020ZD0005-0101).,,63,0,0,5,10,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

Eurostat data regarding cereals production and price at farm gate and also prices for farm inputs were used, graphically illustrated including trend regression equation and coefficient of determination. The results pointed out that EU cereals output accounted for 272.6 million tonnes in 2022, being by-8.2% lower than the peak of 2019. Wheat and maize production is 128.19 million tonnes and, respectively, 55.1 million tonnes, meaning lower levels than before. Cereals output declined in the main producing countries: France, Germany, Romania, Spain, Italy, Hungary, but increased in Poland. High temperatures, heat waves, severe and long droughts, low precipitations were the main causes related to climate change. Cereals price at the farm gate increased, and also production costs went up due to the raise in farm input prices which started since 2021 and exploded in 2022. High price for diesel, seeds, fertilizers, plant protection products, herbicides, were recorded compared to their levels in 2015. The highest increase of producer's price ranged between +60.7% in Hungary and +31.8% in Spain. In Romania it was +40%. Compared to 2015, in 2021, the growth rate of farm inputs price was: +15.8% for diesel, +10.8% for seeds, +9.8% for fertilizers, +5,13% for herbicides and +3% for plant protection products. In the future, farmers have to increase production rethinking cereals structure, using more high potential varieties and hybrids, resistant to drought, diseases and pests; to extend biodiversity and use crop rotation to preserve soil nutrients; to implement technologies with fewer inputs and conservative agriculture for assuring the sustainable development of cereals production, protecting environment and preserving biodiversity.","[Popescu, Agatha; Erban, Valentin S.; Ciocan, Horia Nicolae] Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med Bucharest, 59 Marasti Blvd,Dist 1, Bucharest 011464, Romania; [Popescu, Agatha] Acad Agr & Forestry Sci Gheorghe Ionescu Sisesti, 61 Marasti Blvd,Dist 1, Sisesti 011464, Romania; [Popescu, Agatha] Acad Romanian Scientists, 1 Ilfov St, Bucharest 030167, Romania; [Stanciu, Mirela] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Fac Agr Sci Food Ind & Environm Protect, 7-9, Dr Ion Ra?iu St, Sibiu, Romania",University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest; Academy of Romanian Scientists (AOSR); Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,"Popescu, A (corresponding author), Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med Bucharest, 59 Marasti Blvd,Dist 1, Bucharest 011464, Romania.;Popescu, A (corresponding author), Acad Agr & Forestry Sci Gheorghe Ionescu Sisesti, 61 Marasti Blvd,Dist 1, Sisesti 011464, Romania.;Popescu, A (corresponding author), Acad Romanian Scientists, 1 Ilfov St, Bucharest 030167, Romania.",agatha_popescu@yahoo.com; agatha_popescu@yahoo.com; srbn.valentin@yahoo.com; ciocan.horia@managusamv.ro,"Stanciu, Mirela Aurora/U-4859-2017","Stanciu, Mirela Aurora/0000-0002-9797-376X",,,,,47,0,0,2,2,UNIV AGRONOMIC SCIENCES & VETERINARY MEDICINE BUCHAREST - USAMV,BUCHAREST,"59 MARASTI BOULEVARD, DISTRICT 1, BUCHAREST, 011464, ROMANIA",2284-7995,2285-3952,,SCI PAP-SER MANAG EC,Sci.

Most comparisons, however, focus either on output efficiency such as yields or on impacts of different nutrient management strategies on the sustainability of the agrosystems, and the impacts of each on the agricultural food webs and beneficial insects responsible for pest control - or outbreaks - has been often overlooked. While standard cropping models can explain if, why and how organic nutrient and crop management work and how they should be adapted to climate change, the lack of mechanistic models of agroecology prevents us from explaining why and how passive and active biocontrol and integrated pest management function, when they do not function, and what optimal management strategies could be employed. In this research, we show that agroecological food web models calibrated with field population dynamics data can be used to demonstrate the mechanisms behind food web dynamics that have been previously observed in the field. Results of scenario simulations show that chemical control provides immediate relief from pest pressures, but at high risk of later pest resurgence if control is not repeated; on the contrary, biological control requires more time to reduce pest populations to acceptable levels but with minimal risk of causing resurgence. In all cases, success of pest control measures is highly dependent on the date of action. In addition, the use of modelling tools to optimise biological control application dates led to much better control than either fixed date or pest population threshold-based applications. These analyses and resulting integrated pest management intervention recommendations are only possible with agroecological food web population dynamics models. We encourage future studies to examine more complex food webs from a variety of agroecosystems to test whether functional responses differ significantly, and hope that this approach will succeed in bringing agroecological food web predictive modelling to the level where it can routinely be used as a decision-making support tool, as hydrological and crop models are employed today.","[Malard, Julien J.; Adamowski, Jan Franklin; Diaz, Marcela Rojas; Nassar, Jessica Bou; Ramiro Melgar-Quinonez, Hugo] McGill Univ, Dept Bioresource Engn, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ, Canada; [Anandaraja, Nallusamy] Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Tuy, Hector] Univ Rafael Landivar, IARNA, Guatemala City, Guatemala; [Andres Arevalo-Rodriguez, Luis] Univ Valle Guatemala, Guatemala City, Guatemala",McGill University; Tamil Nadu Agricultural University; Universidad Rafael Landivar; Universidad del Valle de Guatemala,"Malard, JJ (corresponding author), Dept Bioresource Engn, 21111 Lakeshore, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.",Julien.malard@mail.mcgill.ca,"Tuy, Héctor/M-4525-2019; Tuy, Héctor/G-4131-2012; Malard-Adam, Julien Jean/AFA-9605-2022","Tuy, Héctor/0000-0002-5963-6607; Malard-Adam, Julien Jean/0000-0001-6636-6935; Arevalo-Rodriguez, Luis Andres/0000-0001-7328-740X; Bou Nassar, Jessica/0000-0002-2658-3692",NSERC Discovery Grant [RGPIN-2015-05554]; FQRNT Bourse de 3e cycle; Bourse du CRDI aux chercheurs candidats au doctorat [107759-99906075-017]; Bourse d'etudes superieures du Canada Vanier; Supplement pour etudes a l'etranger Michael-Smith (Programme de bourses d`etudes superieures du Canada) scholarship,NSERC Discovery Grant(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); FQRNT Bourse de 3e cycle(FQRNT); Bourse du CRDI aux chercheurs candidats au doctorat; Bourse d'etudes superieures du Canada Vanier; Supplement pour etudes a l'etranger Michael-Smith (Programme de bourses d`etudes superieures du Canada) scholarship,"This research was supported by an NSERC Discovery Grant (Grant number: RGPIN-2015-05554) held by Jan Adamowski, as well as an FQRNT Bourse de 3e cycle, a Bourse du CRDI aux chercheurs candidats au doctorat (Award number 107759-99906075-017), a Bourse d'etudes superieures du Canada Vanier and a Supplement pour etudes a l`etranger Michael-Smith (Programme de bourses d`etudes superieures du Canada) scholarship held by Julien Malard.",,40,8,8,2,40,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,1872-7026,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

Even in similar settings, adaptation experiences and prospects can differ markedly. Why? This paper provides empirical evidence of comparative adaptation experiences in two regions of Aotearoa-New Zealand the Coromandel Peninsula and the Hawke's Bay coast. We critically examine how local barriers and enablers influence the trajectory of adaptation in two regions that face similar risks, have essentially the same institutional architecture, and yet have had very different adaptation experiences. We investigate the situational differences and similarities, and their implications for adaptation in each region. We found that the evolution of adaptation is shaped by the perceptions of the actors, especially local authority leaders, and opportunities that arise at a context-specific point in time. Such perceptions and opportunities can amount to barriers in one location and enablers in another. Growing concern about coastal hazard risk, improving levels of trust and legitimacy, community engagement, and collaborative governance were key to innovative long-term adaptation planning in the Hawke's Bay but their absence has led to short-term business as usual practices in the Coromandel. Yet even in the latter case, change is underway and longer-term adaptation planning is commencing. We conclude that there is a 'rising tide' of adaptation action in the face of escalating climate risk - with long-term planning and local action triggered by cumulative hazard experience and / or extreme events that raise public concern and make climate change salient to local community members and leaders. Both local and regional interests and concerns shape local response appetites. Proactive, local authority-led engagement and long-term strategic planning are foundational for mobilizing effective adaptation responses. Enabling national policy, guidance and institutional provisions are key to prompting and sustaining such efforts, and to facilitating broad consistency in locally appropriate responses. Notwithstanding efforts to foster locally appropriate but nationally aligned adaptation responses, our research shows that coastal communities and their local authorities follow pathways consistent with local risk appetites, understanding about climate change, and the political will and capacity of local government to mobilize key governance actors around long-term strategic planning.","[Schneider, Paul; Glavovic, Bruce] Massey Univ, Sch People Environm & Planning, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Lawrence, Judy] Victoria Univ Wellington, Climate Change Res Inst, Wellington, New Zealand; [Ryan, Emma] Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Auckland, New Zealand; [Blackett, Paula] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res NIWA, Christchurch, New Zealand",Massey University; Victoria University Wellington; University of Auckland; National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand,"Schneider, P (corresponding author), Massey Univ, Sch People Environm & Planning, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",p.p.schneider@massey.ac.nz,"Glavovic, Bruce/AAM-2684-2021","Glavovic, Bruce/0000-0001-5235-1425","Aoteaoroa-New Zealand government National Science Challenge: Resilience to Nature's Challenges - Kia manawaroa - Nga Akina o Te Ao Turoa: The Living at the Edge, Coastal, and Resilience Governance projects [GNS-RNC005]; Aotearoa-New Zealand Earthquake Commission (EQC)","Aoteaoroa-New Zealand government National Science Challenge: Resilience to Nature's Challenges - Kia manawaroa - Nga Akina o Te Ao Turoa: The Living at the Edge, Coastal, and Resilience Governance projects; Aotearoa-New Zealand Earthquake Commission (EQC)","The authors acknowledge with thanks funding from the Aoteaoroa-New Zealand government National Science Challenge: Resilience to Nature's Challenges - Kia manawaroa - Nga Akina o Te Ao Turoa (GNS-RNC005): The Living at the Edge, Coastal, and Resilience Governance projects; and the Aotearoa-New Zealand Earthquake Commission (EQC).

Previous studies lack systematic and explicit assessment of these three fundamental aspects of climate change on crop yield. This research attempts to separate out the impacts on rice yields of climatic trend (linear trend change related to mean value), fluctuations (variability surpassing the fluctuation threshold which defined as one standard deviation (1 SD) of the residual between the original data series and the linear trend value for each climatic variable), and extreme events (identified by absolute criterion for each kind of extreme events related to crop yield). The main idea of the research method was to construct climate scenarios combined with crop system simulation model. Comparable climate scenarios were designed to express the impact of each climate change component and, were input to the crop system model (CERES-Rice), which calculated the related simulated yield gap to quantify the percentage impacts of climatic trend, fluctuations, and extreme events. Six Agro-Meteorological Stations (AMS) in Hunan province were selected to study the quantitatively impact of climatic trend, fluctuations and extreme events involving climatic variables (air temperature, precipitation, and sunshine duration) on early rice yield during 1981-2012. The results showed that extreme events were found to have the greatest impact on early rice yield (-2.59 to -15.89%). Followed by climatic fluctuations with a range of -2.60 to -4.46%, and then the climatic trend (4.91-2.12%). Furthermore, the influence of climatic trend on early rice yield presented trade-offs among various climate variables and AMS. Climatic trend and extreme events associated with air temperature showed larger effects on early rice yield than other climatic variables, particularly for high-temperature events (-2.11 to -12.99%). Finally, the methodology use to separate out the influences of the climatic trend, fluctuations, and extreme events on crop yield was proved to be feasible and robust. Designing different climate scenarios and feeding them into a crop system model is a potential way to evaluate the quantitative impact of each climate variable.","[Wang, Zhu; Shi, Peijun; Zhang, Zhao; Meng, Yongchang; Luan, Yibo; Wang, Jiwei] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhu; Shi, Peijun; Zhang, Zhao; Meng, Yongchang; Luan, Yibo; Wang, Jiwei] Beijing Normal Univ, Acad Disaster Reduct & Emergency Management, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhu; Shi, Peijun; Zhang, Zhao; Meng, Yongchang; Luan, Yibo; Wang, Jiwei] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University,"Shi, PJ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Shi, PJ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Acad Disaster Reduct & Emergency Management, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Shi, PJ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",spj@bnu.edu.cn,"张|Zhang, 朝|Zhao/AAF-8815-2019","Shi, Peijun/0000-0002-2968-7331",Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41321001]; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology; Faculty of Geographical Science of Beijing Normal University,Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology; Faculty of Geographical Science of Beijing Normal University,"We are thankful for the comments of anonymous reviewers and the editors.

The Pacific region is particularly vulnerable to climate change; a strong health-care system is required to respond during times of disaster. This paper examines the capacity of the health sector in Pacific Island Countries to adapt to changing disaster response needs, in terms of: (i) health workforce governance, management, policy and involvement; (ii) health-care capacity and skills; and (iii) human resources for health training and workforce development. Methods: Key stakeholder interviews informed the assessment of the capacity of the health sector and disaster response organizations in Pacific Island Countries to adapt to disaster response needs under a changing climate. The research specifically drew upon and examined the adaptive capacity of individual organizations and the broader system of disaster response in four case study countries (Fiji, Cook Islands, Vanuatu and Samoa). Results: 'Capacity' including health-care capacity was one of the objective determinants identified as most significant in influencing the adaptive capacity of disaster response systems in the Pacific. The research identified several elements that could support the adaptive capacity of the health sector such as: inclusive involvement in disaster coordination; policies in place for health workforce coordination; belief in their abilities; and strong donor support. Factors constraining adaptive capacity included: weak coordination of international health personnel; lack of policies to address health worker welfare; limited human resources and material resources; shortages of personnel to deal with psychosocial needs; inadequate skills in field triage and counselling; and limited capacity for training. Conclusion: Findings from this study can be used to inform the development of human resources for health policies and strategic plans, and to support the development of a coordinated and collaborative approach to disaster response training across the Pacific and other developing contexts. This study also provides an overview of health-care capacity and some of the challenges and strengths that can inform future development work by humanitarian organizations, regional and international donors involved in climate change adaptation, and disaster risk reduction in the Pacific region.","[Rumsey, Michele; Fletcher, Stephanie M.; Thiessen, Jodi; Daly, John; Buchan, James] Univ Technol Sydney, World Hlth Org WHO Collaborating Ctr Nursing Midw, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Gero, Anna; Kuruppu, Natasha; Willetts, Juliet] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; World Health Organization; University of Technology Sydney,"Rumsey, M (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, World Hlth Org WHO Collaborating Ctr Nursing Midw, POB 123,Broadway, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",Michele.Rumsey@uts.edu.au,"Daly, John/G-2012-2017; Fletcher-Lartey, Stephanie/E-1079-2011","Fletcher-Lartey, Stephanie/0000-0002-8897-2351; Gero, Anna/0000-0001-7047-4250; , natasha/0000-0001-9018-826X; Thiessen, Jodi/0000-0001-7364-5940; Willetts, Juliet/0000-0002-3975-9642",,,,,58,14,14,1,45,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1478-4491,,HUM RESOUR HEALTH,Hum.

The multi-objective approach demonstrates the OptiPres Model is trans -formative, transparent, and transferable for providing cultural resource decision support and enhancing the sustainability of cultural heritage globally.","[Li, Peizhe; Xiao, Xiao] Arizona State Univ, Sch Community Resources & Dev, 411 N Cent Ave,Suite 550, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [Li, Peizhe; Xiao, Xiao] Hainan Univ, Hainan Univ Arizona State Univ Joint Int Tourism, 58 Renmin Rd, Haikou 570004, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Seekamp, Erin] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism Management, Box 8004,Biltmore Hall, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix; Hainan University; North Carolina State University,"Xiao, X (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Community Resources & Dev, 411 N Cent Ave,Suite 550, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.",peizhel1@asu.edu; xiao.xiao.7@asu.edu; elseekam@ncsu.edu,"Xiao, Xiao/Z-1199-2019","Seekamp, Erin/0000-0001-5082-1921; Xiao, Xiao/0000-0001-5124-0985; Li, Peizhe/0000-0003-3102-2897",U.S. Geological Survey through the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center; Department of Interior Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center [G15AP00141]; National Park Service Climate Change Response Program through U.S. Department of Interior Inter-Agency Agreement [P17PG00197],U.S. Geological Survey through the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center; Department of Interior Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center; National Park Service Climate Change Response Program through U.S. Department of Interior Inter-Agency Agreement,The data used in this paper was supported by the U.S. Geological Survey (https:// www.usgs.gov) through the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center (https://casc.usgs.gov/) and the Department of Interior Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center (https://globalchange.ncsu.edu/secsc/) through grant agreement G15AP00141 (project title: Connecting Landscape Adaptation and National Cultural Resource Policy to Climate Change and Cultural Resource Adaptation Decisions) .

Predicting whether a given location will act as a C source or sink using terrestrial ecosystem models (TEMs) is challenging due to net flux being the difference between far larger, spatially and temporally variable fluxes with large uncertainties. Uncertainty in projections of future dynamics, critical for policy evaluation, has been determined using multi-TEM intercomparisons, for various emissions scenarios. This approach quantifies structural and forcing errors. However, the role of parameter error within models has not been determined. TEMs typically have defined parameters for specific plant functional types generated from the literature. To ascertain the importance of parameter error in forecasts, we present a Bayesian analysis that uses data on historical and current C cycling for Brazil to parameterise five TEMs of varied complexity with a retrieval of model error covariance at 1 degrees spatial resolution. After evaluation against data from 2001-2017, the parameterised models are simulated to 2100 under four climate change scenarios spanning the likely range of climate projections. Using multiple models, each with per pixel parameter ensembles, we partition forecast uncertainties. Parameter uncertainty dominates across most of Brazil when simulating future stock changes in biomass C and dead organic matter (DOM). Uncertainty of simulated biomass change is most strongly correlated with net primary productivity allocation to wood (NPPwood) and mean residence time of wood (MRTwood). Uncertainty of simulated DOM change is most strongly correlated with MRTsoil and NPPwood. Due to the coupling between these variables and C stock dynamics being bi-directional, we argue that using repeat estimates of woody biomass will provide a valuable constraint needed to refine predictions of the future carbon cycle. Finally, evaluation of our multi-model analysis shows that wood litter contributes substantially to fire emissions, necessitating a greater understanding of wood litter C cycling than is typically considered in large-scale TEMs.","[Smallman, Thomas Luke; Milodowski, David Thomas; Williams, Mathew] Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Smallman, Thomas Luke; Milodowski, David Thomas; Williams, Mathew] Univ Edinburgh, Natl Ctr Earth Observ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Neto, Eraclito Sousa; Ometto, Jean] INPE, Sao Jose Dos Campos, Brazil; [Koren, Gerbrand] Wageningen Univ, Meteorol & Air Qual, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Koren, Gerbrand] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh; Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE); Wageningen University & Research; Utrecht University,"Smallman, TL (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.;Smallman, TL (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Natl Ctr Earth Observ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",t.l.smallman@ed.ac.uk,"Koren, Gerbrand/X-8545-2019; Ometto, Jean Pierre/B-3351-2013; Sousa Neto, Eraclito/G-4521-2012","Koren, Gerbrand/0000-0002-2275-0713; Ometto, Jean Pierre/0000-0002-4221-1039; Sousa Neto, Eraclito/0000-0002-1140-7872; Smallman, Thomas/0000-0002-0835-1003","UK Space Agency [Forests2020]; National Centre for Earth Observation; Newton Fund (UK Meteorological Office Climate Science for Service Partnership Brazil); European Research Council, H2020 European Research Council [ASICA (649087)]","UK Space Agency; National Centre for Earth Observation; Newton Fund (UK Meteorological Office Climate Science for Service Partnership Brazil); European Research Council, H2020 European Research Council","This research has been supported by the UK Space Agency (grant no.

This paper reviews the status of marine protected areas (MPAs) and networks of MPA in Indonesia, draws on lessons learned, and highlights what has been learned from the design of a network of MPAs for Fisheries Management Area (FMA) 715 across six eastern provinces as an example of how such work can be adapted for other parts of the country and elsewhere. Nationally, the 235,622 km(2) of MPAs are mostly large (average 2,380 km(2)) with use zones and small no-take areas (<15 percent). MPAs are implemented by provincial governments or one of 2 national agencies. The design of a network of MPAs across FMA 715 began with 14 MPAs covering 1,977,276 ha or 4% of the marine waters of FMA 715 in 2016. Now there are 48 MPAs covering 3,062,206 hectares in the planning area, and the design process identified an additional 44 Areas of Interest required to establish new MPAs to augment the existing MPAs in FMA 715 to achieve the objectives of enhancing fisheries, protecting biodiversity, adapting to climate change while supporting community livelihoods and traditional practices. Issues identified in the process are that the scale and complexity of science and management needed is beyond what most stakeholders can easily comprehend; that implementation cuts across multiple jurisdictions with a still-new formal mandate for planning and managing the large network area; and, that the present process could only be possible with outside facilitating expertise. Finally, since the national conservation agency is currently finalizing legal guidelines for the planning and implementation of sub-national networks of MPA, this process has educated many and the result will lend legal and governance support to the continued planning and implementation of the FMA 715 MPA Network and for other areas.","[White, Alan; Rudyanto; Minarputri, Noorafebrianie; Lestari, Asri Puji; Wen, Wen; Tighe, Stacey] US Agcy Int Dev Sustainable Ecosyst Adv Project U, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Agung, Muh Firdaus] Minist Marine Affairs & Fisheries, Directorate Gen Marine Spatial Management, Directorate Marine Conservat & Biodivers, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Fajariyanto, Yusuf; Green, Alison] Yayasan Konservasi Alam Nusantara Indonesia, Oceans Program, Jakarta, Indonesia",Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries,"White, A (corresponding author), US Agcy Int Dev Sustainable Ecosyst Adv Project U, Jakarta, Indonesia.",alanwhite1@hawaiiantel.net,,,United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [AID-497-C-16-00008],United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)CGIAR),The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-Funded Sustainable Ecosystems Advanced (SEA) Project (Contract Number: AID-497-C-16-00008) in Indonesia provided the financial support for the overall development of an MPA network design for FMA 715 through a subcontract to The Nature Conservancy in Indonesia and for a series of meetings and consultations among the authors and other stakeholders that led to the development of this paper.,,33,4,4,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0892-0753,1521-0421,,COAST MANAGE,Coast.

This study examines the implications of rising sea level on coastal tourism in Cape Town, South Africa. Making use of mean sea level data from permanent sea level markers, remote sensing and field observations, supported by key informant interviews, the study found that coastal tourism is under threat from rising sea level. Current and projected rising sea level, as well as other extreme weather events such as the increased storm intensity trigger massive waves and tides that result in storm surges, which overtop and encroach into the land surface area. At least 80% of the city's 2019/2020 Blue Flag beaches are now under threat from rising sea level and coastal erosion. The study also found that some of the iconic tourist attractions such as the Cape Point, V&A Waterfront, Robben Island and several beaches along the False Bay area are under the same threat. Other tourism facilities under threat of weather extremes from climate change include servitudes, coastal roads, railway facilities and tidal pools: all threatening the attractiveness of some resorts. Management implications: Rising sea level is a huge challenge that requires innovative solutions for the city of Cape Town. Given the threat that the industry is facing, there is a need for a public-private partnership aimed at ensuring that there are sufficient resources to help the tourism sector is capable of adapting to climate change. Increase insurance cover is a must to protect businesses from anticipated increased damage from rising sea levels and associated weather extreme events. Continued risk assessment is a must to ensure the industry is abreast with the continued changes which are threats to coastal tourism resorts and infrastructure.","[Dube, Kaitano] Vaal Univ, Andries Potgieter Blvd, ZA-1900 Vanderbijlpark, South Africa; [Nhamo, Godwell; Chikodzi, David] Unisa, Inst Corp Citizenship, Business & Climate Change, POB 392, ZA-0003 Unisa, South Africa",Vaal University of Technology (VUT); University of South Africa,"Dube, K (corresponding author), Vaal Univ, Andries Potgieter Blvd, ZA-1900 Vanderbijlpark, South Africa.",kaitanod@vut.ac.za; nhamog@unisa.ac.za; chikod@unisa.ac.za,"Nhamo, Godwell/N-5165-2015; Dube, Kaitano/I-7261-2016","Nhamo, Godwell/0000-0001-5465-2168; Dube, Kaitano/0000-0002-7482-3945; Chikodzi, David/0000-0002-8922-4275",EXXARO Chair in Business and Climate Change at the University of South Africa,EXXARO Chair in Business and Climate Change at the University of South Africa,"We would to thank the EXXARO Chair in Business and Climate Change at the University of South Africa, South Africa for funding fieldwork, and the Western Cape Provincial Government and City of Cape Town for permiting the research in their jurisdictions.",,64,9,9,2,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-0780,2213-0799,,J OUTDOOR REC TOUR,J.

On a global scale, most of the coastal zones in the world are undergoing rapid and accelerating changes. This coastal syndrome combines two major trends: one linked to the growth of coastal populations, habitat, transport and industrial infrastructures (assets); the other linked to the influence of climate change and its effects in terms of sea-level rise, increased frequency of extreme weather events, acidification and increase in ocean surface temperature, both affecting the health of coastal ecosystems. This situation is also reflected in the increase in coastal engineering solutions, which have significant impacts on coastal hydrodynamics and natural ecosystems. This extremely dynamic context calls for an evolution in conservation and spatial planning strategies in order to better anticipate changes that may affect not only the sustainability of both the distribution and health of natural ecosystems, but also the relevance of conservation efforts. Marine and coastal protected areas help preserve ecological services, and reduce the risks faced by coastal communities. Therefore, it can be argued that the effectiveness of these conservation units will depend on the ability, (i) to take into account their territorial context, and also (ii) to base the management decisions on a prospective and sufficiently anticipated (future-oriented) approach. MPA management must be proactive to cope with such rapid changes. The Nexus approach, promoted by the IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management - coastal ecosystem group (CEM/CEG), places marine and coastal spatial planning as a key integrative element linking conservation, adaptation to climate change and coastal risk reduction, and as a part of no-regret adaptation strategies. This paper highlights the main factors that characterize current coastal dynamics, and then briefly presents three future-oriented pilot operations, implemented in Western Africa at different scales. These operations illustrate how MPAs must become structuring elements for the organization and development of coastal territories if they are to contribute to the resilience of coastal systems and to ensure their own long-term sustainability.","[Goussard, Jean-Jacques; Ducrocq, Mathieu] IUCN, Coastal Ecosystm Grp, World Commiss Ecosyst Management, Gland, Switzerland",,"Goussard, JJ (corresponding author), IUCN, Coastal Ecosystm Grp, World Commiss Ecosyst Management, Gland, Switzerland.",jj.goussard@eco-evaluation.org,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,,,,,28,1,1,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,1099-0755,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

The process of developing adaptation measures at local-scale (e.g., river basins) requires high-quality climate information with higher resolution. Climate projections are available at a coarser spatial resolution from Global Climate Models (GCMs) and require spatial downscaling and bias correction to drive hydrological models. We used the hybrid multiple linear regression and stochastic weather generator model (Statistical Down-Scaling Model, SDSM) to develop a location-based climate projection, equivalent to future station data, from GCMs. Meteorological data from 24 ground stations and the most accurate satellite and reanalysis products identified for the region, such as Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data were used. The Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to assess the impacts of the projected climate on hydrology. Both SDSM and SWAT were calibrated and validated using the observed climate and streamflow data, respectively. Climate projection based on SDSM, in one of the large and agricultural intensive basins in Ethiopia (i.e., Awash), show high variability in precipitation but an increase in maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperature, which agrees with global warming. On average, the projection shows an increase in annual precipitation (>10%), Tmax (>0.4 degrees C), Trnin (>0.2 degrees C) and streamflow (>34%) in the 2020s (2011-2040), 2050s (2041-2070), and 2080s (2071-2100) under RCP2.6-RCP8.5. Although no significant trend in precipitation is found, streamflow during March-May and June-September is projected to increase throughout the 21 century by an average of more than 1.1% and 24%, respectively. However, streamflow is projected to decrease during January-February and October-November by more than 6%. Overall, considering the projected warming and changes in seasonal flow, local-scale adaptation measures to limit the impact on agriculture, water and energy sectors are required.

Although the impacts of climate change on water resources have been relatively well explored for the Mediterranean climatic region, the specific consequences for reservoirs and, in particular, water availability and irrigation issues have been less studied. The objective of this work is two-fold: (i) to assess the impacts of future climate changes on water resources availability, quality (focusing on phosphorus loads as this is the limiting nutrient for eutrophication) and irrigation needs for two multipurpose reservoirs in southern Portugal; (ii) to suggest climate change adaptation strategies, especially for the agricultural sector. To this end, the SWAT model was first calibrated against existing data on reservoir inflows as well as phosphorus loads. Then, SWAT was run with climate derived EURO-CORDEX models (RCA4/RACMO22E) for four periods (1970-2000, 2010-2040, 2040-2070 and 2070-2100). Water availability was analysed using the Water Exploitation Index (WEI) that was calculated for both reservoirs combining changes of inflows and irrigation requirements. The results indicated that climate change will negatively impact water availability in both reservoirs, especially under RCP8.5. In the case of the Monte Novo reservoir, future domestic water supply could be constrained by water quality problems related with phosphorus loads. For Vigia reservoir, the high water exploitation will lead to water scarcity problems, mainly as this reservoir on presentday conditions is restrictive on irrigation requirements. Adaptation strategies such as the implementation of high end technology (e.g. soil moisture and plant water stress probes, satellite imagery and drones to evaluate water stress - NDVI) as well as the renewal of the irrigation network and adequate crop selection can help attenuating the effects of climate change on the water resources in this region.

Additionally, in northern temperate regions, the management and restoration of riparian broadleaf forest is advocated increasingly to dampen variations in stream water temperature and discharge, but might have collateral effects on salmonids by changing allochthonous subsidies. Here, in a cross-sectional analysis of 18 temperate headwaters with different riparian and catchment land use, we use classical fisheries data alongside stable isotope ratios in salmonids and their macroinvertebrate prey to examine whether increasing catchment cover of broadleaf trees could (i) increase the density, biomass and size of salmonids, (ii) increase brown trout (Salmo trutta) dietary reliance on production of terrestrial origin and (iii) mediate allochthonous energy flux between aquatic macroinvertebrates and brown trout. Contrary to expectation, catchment broadleaf cover had no systematic effect on salmonid density or individual size, although salmonid biomass was lowest in streams draining non-native conifers. Moreover, there was no major effect of land use on the dependence of S.trutta on terrestrial production: averaged across all sites, trout used more production from in-stream (623%: mean +/- 1 SE) than terrestrial (38 +/- 3%) sources. Dependence on terrestrial production varied more substantially among individual streams than with riparian land use, mirroring site-specific patterns observed in macroinvertebrates. Although increased broadleaf cover could benefit salmonids by offsetting the impacts of warming related to climate change, these results imply that broadleaf restoration along temperate, upland headwaters is neutral with respect to salmonid biomass, density and terrestrial subsidies. In contrast, the use of non-native conifers for stream shading could have negative effects on salmonid production. Knowledge of the ecological implications of climate change adaptation remains rudimentary, and we advocate further evaluations like ours not only for fresh waters, but for ecosystems more generally.","[Thomas, Stephen M.; Griffiths, Sian W.; Ormerod, Steve J.] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Biosci, Catchment Res Grp, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales; [Thomas, Stephen M.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, Helsinki, Finland",Cardiff University; University of Helsinki,"Thomas, SM (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",stephen.thomas@helsinki.fi,"Griffiths, Sian/A-5240-2010; Ormerod, Steve J/A-4326-2010","Ormerod, Steve J/0000-0002-8174-302X; Griffiths, Sian/0000-0001-6348-7352",Knowledge Economy Skills Scholarship scheme; NERC [NE/J014818/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/J014818/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Knowledge Economy Skills Scholarship scheme; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We thank the Knowledge Economy Skills Scholarship scheme for funding this work, South East Wales Rivers Trust and Natural Resources Wales for help in kind, and Caitlin Pearson, Matthew Dray, Don A'Bear, Susannah Williams, Eleanor Kean, Eleanor Sherrard-Smith, Rhian Wilson and Stuart Rudd for assistance in the field.

The governance of transboundary flood risk management calls for solidarity among riparians, as climate change will make river basins more prone to flooding. 'Solidarity' means that individuals act to support members of a particular community to which they belong. Recently, the solidarity principle has become institutionalized due to its formalization in the EU Floods Directive. However, it is not clear what solidarity means in the upstream-downstream practices of transboundary flood risk management. Understanding the meaning of solidarity is important for the development of cross-border climate adaptation governance. This article discusses the conceptualization of the solidarity principle and explores its meaning for international cooperation in the Dutch North Rhine-Westphalian border region. Our critical case study reveals that although all actors understand the importance of solidarity, they interpret it differently, often based on self-interest related to their position in the catchment. The formal inclusion of the solidarity principle in the Floods Directive can best be seen as a step in the continuous development of transboundary flood risk governance, as no striking changes in practice have been identified after its formalization. Policy relevance As climate change increasingly puts pressure on river basins and other shared resources, cross-border cooperation and solidarity are seen as increasingly important. This article discusses the meaning of solidarity in practice and reveals how this normative principle may contribute to transboundary climate adaptation governance. Understanding its meaning is important for future cross-border climate adaptation governance.","[Van Eerd, Marjolein C.

To advance the discussion on its place in climate policy, it is desirable to be able to quantitatively assess the effects of different principles of distribution on the well-being of unequally vulnerable individuals and groups. Here, we present an agent-based model of a stylized social-environmental system subject to an external stress such as a climate change impact, in which individuals with unequal access to resources attempt to fulfil an essential need through resource consumption. This causes environmental damage, and a balance must be found between the processes of resource consumption and environmental degradation to achieve well-being for people and stability for the environment. We operationalize different principles for redistributing resource access as interaction rules in the model and compare their tendency to allow such a balance to emerge. Our results indicate that while outcome patterns and effectiveness may vary among principles, redistribution generally improves well-being and system stability. We discuss some implications of our findings as they pertain to addressing the climate crisis and end by outlining the next steps for the research.","[Joshi, Aashis; Chappin, Emile; Doorn, Neelke] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol, Policy & Management, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Joshi, A (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol, Policy & Management, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands.",A.R.Joshi@tudelft.nl; E.J.L.Chappin@tudelft.nl; N.Doorn@tudelft.nl,"; Chappin, Emile/H-6315-2014","Joshi, Aashis/0000-0003-1068-5739; Doorn, Neelke/0000-0002-1090-579X; Chappin, Emile/0000-0002-8529-4241",Dutch National Research Council NWO [VI.Vidi.195.119],Dutch National Research Council NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),FundingThis work has been supported by a grant from the Dutch National Research Council NWO (grant no.

The CAEWMPS adopted the construction of water recharge pit at household level in Dharan and recharge ponds at community level in Dhulikhel. The results of household survey reveal that households have employed different coping strategies including minimizing consumption, purchasing from market, harvesting rain water and installing equipment for storing and pumping in both cities. In Dhulikhel, a significant number of households (18.56%) minimize consumption during the dry season but this is not the case in Dharan. Rather, around one-fifth (19.27%) of the households harvest rainwater in Dharan. In addition, households are forced to give-up their regular activities in order to implement coping strategies such as household chores, leisure time, meeting and gardening. The average estimated annual coping cost in Dharan (USD 87.5) is eight times higher than in Dhulikhel (USD 11.05); however, per unit coping cost is nearly equal in both the cities. In terms of benefit-cost ration, the community level recharge ponds in Dhulikhel (5.15) were found to be cost effective compared to the household level recharge pits of Dharan (1.72).

The article examines the potential of experimentation in devising coastal adaptation policies, taking into account its political dimensions. We analysed a multi-level experiment, funded by the French Ministry for the Environment from 2012 to 2015, where coastal municipalities volunteered to simulate the implementation of planned retreat as an adaptation strategy. Using insights from discursive institutionalism, we tracked developments throughout the experiment period. We highlight a combined process of governance experiment, allowing social innovation at local and regional scales, and a more strategic tool for the state, governing and steering local coastal policy with new instruments. We shed light on a particular policy entrepreneur (a public organization dealing with coastal management) playing at the intersection of these two forms, and in the interplay of policy scales. Although the experiment contributed to the innovation of legal and economic instruments and produced policy feedbacks in local planning and governance, learning capacities of the multi-scale architecture are still moderate to make planned retreat a reality in the near future. The conclusion considers performative and interpretive effects of policy experiments as further research questions to explore.","[Rocle, Nicolas; Salles, Denis] Irstea, UR ETBX, 50 Ave Verdun, F-33612 Cestas 2, France",INRAE,"Rocle, N (corresponding author), Irstea, UR ETBX, 50 Ave Verdun, F-33612 Cestas 2, France.",nicolas.rocle@irstea.fr,,"ROCLE, Nicolas/0000-0003-0377-7520",Cluster of Excellence COTE (Programme of the French National Research Agency) [ANR-10-LABX-45]; Aquitaine Regional Council (PERMALA project) [201212004004],Cluster of Excellence COTE (Programme of the French National Research Agency); Aquitaine Regional Council (PERMALA project),"For their helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper, the authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers as well as the participants of the INOGOV workshop held in March 2015 at the Finnish Environment Institute in Helsinki, Finland.

Yet their role is crucial in addressing non- or maladaptation, as their initiative or consent is often necessary to take adaptation measures in or around the house. To address this knowledge gap, this paper explores mainstream and additional roles for residents through a literature review. Mainstream roles are those roles that residents usually take, while additional roles are more specific and local in nature. The latter may, however, provide the seeds for wider change. To structure the results, we made a distinction between three forms of residents' commitment to adaptation: as (1) citizens falling under the jurisdiction of various governmental levels; (2) consumers (including home owners) in the market; and (3) civil society members/partners. While this is an established categorization in other domains of environmental governance, it has not yet been systematically applied to the adaptation domain. The paper's empirical focus regarding mainstream and additional roles is on the Dutch adaptation domains of flood risk management, stormwater management and dealing with heat stress. We found scope for additional roles for residents, especially as consumers in the market and civil society members. The findings are of significance for the global debate on residents' roles in climate adaptation and suggest that addressing all three forms of commitment may enhance the implementation of measures as well as their legitimacy, residents' awareness and societies' potential to innovate.

In excess of ninety percent of global trade by volume is transported by sea. In Ireland, seaports are of strategic importance to the national economy. As an island nation, ninety eight percent of trade by volume comes through its seaports. Climate issues facing Irish ports include increasing storminess, such as the Atlantic storms experienced in the winter of 2014. Ireland provides a particularly valuable case study as the scale of Irish port sizes, analysed in this research, range from 500,000 to 30 million throughput tonnage. This tonnage range, is more typical of port sizes globally, and adds relevance to the study. The specific objectives of this paper are to establish the readiness of the seaport sector in Ireland to build adaptive capacity to respond to climate change and to assess lessons from and for Ireland in the context of international best practice. The research identified a lack of awareness and understanding of climate change amongst the sample population of seventy senior managers (comprising of national regulators and local authorities; commercial port harbour companies; and indigenous and multinational industries located in the port hinterland), as representatives of the maritime sector in Ireland. Evidence of a knowledge gap was identified from in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted over a twelve month period. Many industry stakeholders were actually implementing adaptation measures within their organisational strategies, unaware of the explicit links with climate adaptation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, it investigates whether the relationship between climate risk and bank liquidity creation varies by bank and country characteristics. The results reveal that climate sensitivity and exposure have negative impacts on overall liquidity creation, whereas climate adaptation has positive effects. These effects are more pronounced for larger banks with lower capital, banks located in lower-GDP and developing countries, and those in Asia. The results suggest that policymakers should exercise caution when formulating and implementing climate-related strategies, as these can influence liquidity creation, which in turn can affect macroeconomic stability.","[Lee, Chien-Chiang] Nanchang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chih-Wei; Bui Tien Thinh; Xu, Zhi-Ting] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Finance, Taoyuan, Taiwan",Nanchang University; National Central University,"Wang, CW; Thinh, BT (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Dept Finance, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",redrum3690@gmail.com; buitienthinh.k11401@gmail.com,,"Wang, Chih-Wei/0000-0002-6482-6616",,,,,78,6,6,22,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1057-5219,1873-8079,,INT REV FINANC ANAL,Int.

In this research, both experimental and numerical studies were conducted on an aerogel glazing system. In order to provide climate adaptive designs on the aerogel glazing system with optimal geometric and operating parameters, a generic optimization methodology was developed by flexibly integrating supervised machine learning and advanced teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm. The proposed optimization methodology was thereafter used for optimal system designs in different climate regions. Results indicate that the proposed surrogate model can intelligently and accurately learn and update the optimization function with straightforward mathematical associations between multi-variables and objectives. In addition, within optimal cases, total heat gain and heat flux are dominated by the extinction coefficient in southern cities, whereas the total heat gain is dominated by the thermal conductivity in the northern city, LanZhou. By adopting the proposed technique in this study, compared to optimal results following the Taguchi standard orthogonal array, the total heat gain can be reduced by 62.5% to 36.27 kWh/m(2) in LanZhou, and by 5.9% to 267.18 kWh/m(2) in GuangZhou, respectively.

Acclimation of plant physiological processes to changes in environmental conditions is a key component of plant adaptation to climate change. We assessed the temperature response of leaf photosynthetic parameters in wheat grown under contrasting water regimes and growth temperatures (T-growth). Two independent experiments were conducted under controlled conditions. In Experiment 1, two wheat genotypes were subjected to well-watered or drought-stressed treatments; in Experiment 2, the two water regimes combined with high, medium and low T-growth were imposed on one genotype. Parameters of a biochemical C-3-photosynthesis model were estimated at six leaf temperatures for each factor combination. Photosynthesis acclimated more to drought than to T-growth. Drought affected photosynthesis by lowering its optimum temperature (T-opt) and the values at T-opt of light-saturated net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, mesophyll conductance, the maximum rate of electron transport (J(max)) and the maximum rate of carboxylation by Rubisco (V-cmax). T-opt for V-cmax was up to 40 degrees C under well-watered conditions but 24-34 degrees C under drought. The decrease in photosynthesis under drought varied among T-growth but was similar between genotypes. The temperature response of photosynthetic quantum yield under drought was partly attributed to photorespiration but more to alternative electron transport. All these changes in biochemical parameters could not be fully explained by the changed leaf nitrogen content. Further model analysis showed that both diffusional and biochemical parameters of photosynthesis and their thermal sensitivity acclimate little to T-growth, but acclimate considerably to drought and the combination of drought and T-growth. The commonly used modelling approaches, which typically consider the response of diffusional parameters, but ignore acclimation responses of biochemical parameters to drought and T-growth, strongly overestimate leaf photosynthesis under variable temperature and drought.","[Fang, Liang; Jin, Kaining; Du, Xinmiao; van der Putten, Peter E.

They suffer from the severe effects of increased frequencies and intensities of coastal hazards, particularly flooding, while oftentimes continuing to sprawl into hazard-exposed areas and grow beyond the pace of sufficient infrastructure development. Even though these problems have been quite well understood for a while, there is still comparatively little knowledge and scientific assessment of the solution space, i.e., on the options available for adaptation and the ways in which they are being perceived, framed and evaluated in the scientific literature. Focusing on Jakarta, this study presents findings from a systematic assessment of peer-reviewed scientific literature on the adaptation solution space with regard to current and future flooding. Jakarta is chosen as a case study since it is among the cities with the highest flood risk and adaptation pressure globally while also being one of the most heavily researched coastal cities in this regard, certainly in the Global South. Based on a structured keyword search, we assess 339 articles. Results indicate that the perceived solution space is skewed towards hard protection against flooding, while measures to accommodate flooding or retreat from exposed areas are less widely considered in the scientific debate. Soft adaptation measures for the reduction of social vulnerability receive less attention in the literature than those measures targeting the taming of flood hazards, often through engineering solutions. Likewise, hybrid adaptation approaches, which combine soft and hard measures in a complementary way, are only rarely considered. Looking into the future, the findings suggest that despite the importance of hard flood protection as a main adaptation solution in Jakarta, other fields of the solution space deserve increased scientific attention. This relates in particular to urgently needed feasibility and effectiveness assessments of ecosystems-based solutions for flood mitigation and adaptation options targeting social vulnerability. While the empirical results are specific to Jakarta, heuristic observations from research on other coastal cities suggest that similar scoping exercises of the predominantly perceived solution space might be of relevance in many cities beyond Jakarta.","[Wannewitz, Mia; Garschagen, Matthias] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen LMU, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Wannewitz, M (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen LMU, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",mia.wannewitz@lmu.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LN1710A1],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This research has received funding from the TRANSCEND project sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF; grant no. 01LN1710A1).,,176,2,2,10,15,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1561-8633,1684-9981,,NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS,Nat.

Many Indigenous communities have heightened sensitivity to climate change and food insecurity for multifactorial reasons including close relationships with the local environment and socioeconomic inequities which increase exposures and challenge adaptation to climate change. Pregnant women have additional sensitivity to food insecurity, as antenatal undernutrition is linked with poor maternal-infant health. This study examined pathways through which climate change influenced food security during pregnancy among Indigenous and non-Indigenous women in rural Uganda. Specific objectives were to characterize: 1) sensitivities to climate-associated declines in food security for pregnant Indigenous women; 2) women's perceptions of climate impacts on food security during pregnancy; and 3) changes in food security and maternal-infant health over time, as observed by women. Methods Using a community-based research approach, we conducted eight focus group discussions-four in Indigenous Batwa communities and four in non-Indigenous communities-in Kanungu District, Uganda, on the subject of climate and food security during pregnancy. Thirty-six women with >= 1 pregnancy participated. Data were analysed using a constant comparative method and thematic analysis. Results Women indicated that food insecurity was common during pregnancy and had a bidirectional relationship with antenatal health issues. Food security was thought to be decreasing due to weather changes including extended droughts and unpredictable seasons harming agriculture. Women linked food insecurity with declines in maternal-infant health over time, despite improved antenatal healthcare. While all communities described food security struggles, the challenges Indigenous women identified and described were more severe. Conclusions Programs promoting women's adaptive capacity to climate change are required to improve food security for pregnant women and maternal-infant health. These interventions are particularly needed in Indigenous communities, which often face underlying health inequities. However, resiliency among mothers was strong and, with supports, they can reduce food security challenges in a changing climate.","[Bryson, Julia M.; Patterson, Kaitlin; Harper, Sherilee L.] Univ Guelph, Dept Populat Med, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Bryson, Julia M.] McMaster Univ, Michael G DeGroote Sch Med, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Berrang-Ford, Lea; Ford, James D.] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Lwasa, Shuaib] Makerere Univ, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Climat Sci, Kampala, Uganda; [Namanya, Didacus B.] Ugandan Minist Hlth, Dept Community Hlth, Kampala, Uganda; [Twesigomwe, Sabastian; Kesande, Charity] Batwa Dev Program, Buhoma, Uganda; [Harper, Sherilee L.] Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Guelph; McMaster University; University of Leeds; Makerere University; University of Alberta,"Bryson, JM; Patterson, K; Harper, SL (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Populat Med, Guelph, ON, Canada.;Bryson, JM (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Michael G DeGroote Sch Med, Hamilton, ON, Canada.;Harper, SL (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",brysonj@mcmaster.ca; kpatte08@uoguelph.ca; sherilee.harper@ualberta.ca,"Lwasa, Shuaib/G-3723-2014; Ford, James/A-4284-2013; Harper, Sherilee/L-4996-2013","Lwasa, Shuaib/0000-0003-4312-2836; Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; Patterson, Kaitlin/0000-0002-3444-0472; Harper, Sherilee/0000-0001-7298-8765",University of Guelph; Frederick Banting Doctoral Graduate Scholarship (Canadian Institutes of Health Research); International Development Research Centre doctoral research award; Canadian Institutes of Health Research,University of Guelph; Frederick Banting Doctoral Graduate Scholarship (Canadian Institutes of Health Research)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); International Development Research Centre doctoral research award; Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),"Financial support was provided by a University of Guelph (www.uoguelph.ca) Summerlee travel scholarship awarded to JMB; a Frederick Banting Doctoral Graduate Scholarship (Canadian Institutes of Health Research, cihr-irsc. gc.ca), an International Development Research Centre (www.idrc.ca) doctoral research award, and a University of Guelph (www.uoguelph.ca) Summerlee research grant awarded to KP; and a Canadian Institutes of Health Research (cihr-irsc. gc.ca) grant awarded to SLH, LBF, SL, DBN, JDF and the IHACC Research Team.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between absolute humidity and influenza activity in seven municipalities/provinces covering different climatic zones in China. Weekly meteorological data and influenza surveillance data in seven provinces/municipalities in China were collected from January 2012 to December 2019. A distributed lag nonlinear model was adopted to investigate the association between absolute humidity (AH) and influenza activity in each study site. Then, seven study sites were grouped into three regions: northern, intermediate, and southernmost regions. A multivariate meta-analysis was applied to estimate the exposure-lag-response associations in three regions. The province-specific or municipality-specific curves appeared to be nonlinear, and the association between influenza activity and AH varied across regions. In Beijing and Tianjin, located in northern China, the cumulative relative risks (RRs) increased as weekly average AHmean fell below 3.41 g/m(3) and 6.62 g/m(3). In Guangdong and Hainan, located in southernmost China, the risk of influenza activity increased with rising average AHmean with 16.74 g/m(3) and 20.18 g/m(3) as the break points. In Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Chongqing, the relationship between weekly average AHmean and influenza could be described as U-shaped curves, with the lowest RRs when weekly average AHmean was 11.95 g/m(3), 11.94 g/m(3), and 15.96 g/m(3), respectively. Meta-analysis results showed the cumulative RRs significantly increased as weekly average AHmean fell below 3.86 g/m(3) in the northern region, whereas significantly increased as weekly average AHmean rose above 18.46 g/m(3) and 15.22 g/m(3) in intermediate and southernmost regions, respectively. Both low and high AH might increase influenza risk in China, and the relationship varies geographically. Our findings suggest that public health policies for climate change adaptation should be tailored to the local climate conditions.","[Qi, Li; Li, Qin; Tang, Wenge; Su, Kun; Xiong, Yu] Chongqing Municipal Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Chongqing 400042, Peoples R China; [Qi, Li; Liu, Qiyong] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, State Key Lab Infect Dis Prevent & Control, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Diag & Treatment Infect Di, Natl Inst Communicable Dis Control & Prevent, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Liu, Tian] Jingzhou Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Jingzhou 434000, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yuan] Monash Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Prevent Med, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Tian, Dechao] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Publ Hlth Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518107, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jun] Guangzhou Med Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Guangzhou 511436, Peoples R China; [Feng, Luzhao] Chinese Acad Med Sci & Peking Union Med Coll, Sch Populat Med & Publ Hlth, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China","Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention; National Institute for Communicable Disease Control & Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention; Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis & Treatment of Infectious Diseases; Monash University; Sun Yat Sen University; Guangzhou Medical University; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Peking Union Medical College","Liu, QY (corresponding author), Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, State Key Lab Infect Dis Prevent & Control, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Diag & Treatment Infect Di, Natl Inst Communicable Dis Control & Prevent, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.;Yang, J (corresponding author), Guangzhou Med Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Guangzhou 511436, Peoples R China.;Feng, LZ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Med Sci & Peking Union Med Coll, Sch Populat Med & Publ Hlth, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China.",qili19812012@126.com; jzcdclt@163.com; gaoyuancdc@126.com; Qinlicdc@163.com; wengetang@163.com; tiandch@mail.sysu.edu.cn; 260617392@qq.com; 29864800@qq.com; yangjun_eci@jnu.edu.cn; fengluzhao@cams.cn; liuqiyong@icdc.cn,,,"High-level Medical Reserved Personnel Training Project of Chongqing, Chongqing Health Commission Program [2019GDRC014]; Chongqing Science and Technology Bureau Program [CSTC2021 jscx-gksb-N0005]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019M660754]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [82003552]; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2020A1515011161]; Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People's Republic of China [202046]; China Prosperity Strategic Programme Fund (SPF) [15LCI1]; UK-China Cooperation on Climate Change Risk Assessment [PF3051_CH-WS3HBUE_YR1]","High-level Medical Reserved Personnel Training Project of Chongqing, Chongqing Health Commission Program; Chongqing Science and Technology Bureau Program; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People's Republic of China; China Prosperity Strategic Programme Fund (SPF); UK-China Cooperation on Climate Change Risk Assessment","Dr. Li Qi was supported by the High-level Medical Reserved Personnel Training Project of Chongqing, Chongqing Health Commission Program (grant number 2019GDRC014), Chongqing Science and Technology Bureau Program(grant number CSTC2021 jscx-gksb-N0005) and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (grant number 2019M660754).

Previous results by the team show that present design methods for affordable buildings and structures in India need improvement. The challenges are the disposal of solid waste generated from agro-industrial activities and the energy peak demand in extremely hot and cold seasons. The development of bio-based urban infrastructure which can adapt to the climatic conditions has been proposed. Inclusion of sustainable materials such as agro-industrial by-products and insulation materials has resulted in effective environmental sustainability and climate change adaptability. Precast components are highlighted as a suitable solution for this purpose as well as to fulfil the need of mass housing. India has a lesser record in implementing this prefab technology when compared to a global view. For the first time, a novel and sustainable prefab housing solution is tested for scale-up using industrial waste of co-fired blended ash (CBA) and the results are presented here. A model house of real scale measuring 3 x 3 x 3 m(3) was considered as a base case and is compared with 17 other combinations of model house with varying alignment of prefab panels. Comparison was made with commercially available fly ash brick and CBA brick with a conventional roof slab. A simulation study was conducted regarding cost and energy analysis for all the 18 cases. Various brick and panel compositions with CBA for housing were tried and the superior composition was selected. Similarly, 18 model houses of real scale were simulated, with different combinations of walls made of bricks or panels and different building orientations, to check the impact on energy peak cooling and cost. Results show that peak cooling load can be reduced by six times with bio-based prefab panels. Prefab construction can be considered for mass housing ranging above 100 housing units, each consisting of an area of 25 m(2).","[Chippagiri, Ravijanya; Gavali, Hindavi R.; Ralegaonkar, Rahul V.] VNIT, Dept Civil Engn, Nagpur 440010, Maharashtra, India; [Riley, Mike; Shaw, Andy; Bras, Ana] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Built Environm & Sustainable Technol BEST Res Ins, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England","National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur; Liverpool John Moores University","Chippagiri, R (corresponding author), VNIT, Dept Civil Engn, Nagpur 440010, Maharashtra, India.",ravijanya991@gmail.com; gavali.hr@gmail.com; sanvan28@yahoo.com; m.l.riley@ljmu.ac.uk; A.Shaw@ljmu.ac.uk; a.m.armadabras@ljmu.ac.uk,"Gavali, Hindavi/AAE-4427-2019; ralegaonkar, rahul/O-5198-2015; Bras, Ana/E-7795-2015","Gavali, Hindavi/0000-0003-4022-4589; Shaw, Andy/0000-0001-5961-2464; Chippagiri, Ravijanya/0000-0002-1698-8282; ralegaonkar, rahul/0000-0002-3538-533X; Bras, Ana/0000-0002-6292-2073",LJMU Global Challenge Research Fund 2018-2020,LJMU Global Challenge Research Fund 2018-2020,This research was supported by funding under the grant LJMU Global Challenge Research Fund 2018-2020.,,34,13,13,5,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2021,13,3,,,,,,,1195,10.3390/su13031195,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13031195,,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QD6IZ,,"Green Published, gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000615620600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Warmer temperatures and the associated decrease in air density in future climate, and changes to crosswind and tailwind, can potentially impact aircraft performance. This study evaluates projected changes to aircraft takeoff performance, in terms of weight restriction days and strong tailwind and crosswind occurrences, for 13 major airports across Canada, for three categories of aircraft used for long-, medium- and short-haul flights. To this end, two five-member ensembles of transient climate change simulations performed with a regional climate model, for Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively, are analyzed. Results suggest that the projected increases in weight restriction days associated with the increases in daily maximum temperatures vary with aircraft category and airfield location, with larger increases noted for airfields in the south central regions of Canada. Although avoiding takeoff during the warmest period of the day could be a potential solution, analysis focused on the warmest and coolest periods of the day suggests more weight restriction hours even during the coolest period of the day, for these airfields. Though RCP8.5 in general suggests larger changes to weight restriction hours compared to RCP4.5, the differences between the two scenarios are more prominent for the coolest part of the day, as projected changes to daily minimum temperatures occur at a much faster rate for RCP8.5 compared to RCP4.5, and also due to the higher increases in daily minimum temperatures compared to maximum temperatures. Both increases and decreases to crosswind and tailwind are projected, which suggest the need for detailed case studies, especially for those airfields that suggest increases. This study provides useful preliminary insights related to aircraft performance in a warmer climate, which will be beneficial to the aviation sector in developing additional analysis and to support climate change adaptation-related decision-making.","[Zhao, Yijie] McGill Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Appl Mech, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C3, Canada; McGill Univ, Trottier Inst Sustainabil Engn & Design, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C3, Canada",McGill University; McGill University,"Zhao, YJ (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Appl Mech, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C3, Canada.",yijie.zhao@mail.mcgill.ca; laxmi.sushama@mcgill.ca,,,National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Trottier Institute for Sustainability in Engineering and Design,National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Trottier Institute for Sustainability in Engineering and Design,This research was funded by the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Trottier Institute for Sustainability in Engineering and Design.,,47,3,3,4,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,APR,2020,11,4,,,,,,,418,10.3390/atmos11040418,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11040418,,,21,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,LW9WE,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000539492200105,View Full Record in Web of Science

There are currently no published applications of the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model on quantified effects of climate variability on irrigation service areas for rice production. The study assessed the impacts of climate change on dependable flow and potential irrigable areas of the Maasin River in Laguna, Philippines. Projected variations of rainfall and temperature in 2020 and 2050 developed using PRECIS model based on special report on emission scenarios were employed. The SWAT model was then used to simulate stream flow for each climate change scenario, from which dependable flows were quantified using flow duration analysis. Diversion water requirements for the rice areas in the watershed were determined using CROPWAT. Based on dependable flows and irrigation demand, the potential irrigable areas were estimated. Calibration and validation of the SWAT model showed satisfactory performance in stream flow simulations. The dependable flow in irrigation systems may decline by more than 50% in 2020 and by as much as 97% in 2050, because of seasonal changes in rainfall. In effect, the potential irrigable area may decrease to less than half of the current service area depending on the level of greenhouse gases emissions. SWAT water balance projections suggest surface runoff during wet seasons and increase annual groundwater recharge are possible sources of supplemental irrigation. Provisions of suitable storage reservoir facilities and groundwater development projects will alleviate water scarce conditions. The study demonstrated a technique that may be applied in other irrigation systems in the Philippines and in other countries to quantify the effects of climate change on dependable flows and potential irrigable areas. It can serve as an input to water resources planning and policy recommendations for climate change adaptation and risk reduction strategies. This technique can also be used to assess water resources in other perennial rivers and its viability for the development of new irrigation systems in the Philippines.","[Alejo, Lanie A.] Isabela State Univ, Coll Engn, Echague 3309, Isabela, Philippines; [Ella, Victor B.] Univ Philippines, Los Banos, Laguna, Philippines",Isabela State University; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos; University of the Philippines Open University,"Alejo, LA (corresponding author), Isabela State Univ, Coll Engn, Echague 3309, Isabela, Philippines.",lhan_1023@yahoo.com,"Alejo, Lanie Alejandro/AAG-3756-2020; Ella, Victor/D-5099-2016","Alejo, Lanie Alejandro/0000-0002-8058-483X; Ella, Victor/0000-0001-9993-1822","DOST - Engineering Research and Development for Technology; DOST - Science Education Institute; DOST - Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development","DOST - Engineering Research and Development for Technology(Department of Science & Technology (DOST), Philippines); DOST - Science Education Institute(Department of Science & Technology (DOST), Philippines); DOST - Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development(Department of Science & Technology (DOST), Philippines)","the authors would like to thank the agencies and projects mentioned in this article, which generously shared their data.

Therefore, this study aimed to identify determinants of farmer adaptation strategies with their costs and benefits of each adaptation strategy. The data were collected from 155 farm households using a random sampling method through semistructured questionnaires. The result of the multivariate probit model revealed that the likelihood of farmers to adopt adjustment of planting date, changing crop varieties, intercropping, crop rotation, irrigation, and minimum tillage were 51.6%, 61.9%, 56.1%, 38.1%, 10.3%, and 27.1%, respectively. The joint likelihood of using all adaptation strategies was 4.2%, while their failure to adopt all the adaptation strategies was 9.8%. Among the given adaptation options, intercropping, adjusting planting dates, crop rotation, and changing crop varieties are economically viable climate adaptation strategies. Regarding the intensity of adaptation, 78% of sampled respondents were used more than one adaptation option, and their NPV and BCR were higher when they used at least one adaptation option. Farmers who did not adopt any adaptation options were able to receive the lowest income per unit production. The study recommends that households should use multiple combinations of adaptation practices rather than the use of a single adaptation option. Thus, the government and stakeholders must provide educational and extension service, training, and updated climate information to smallholder crop producers to use and select the best and combination of adaptation strategies.","[Tilahun, Yaregal] Mizan Tepi Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Mizan Tefri, Ethiopia",,"Tilahun, Y (corresponding author), Mizan Tepi Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Coll Agr & Nat Resource, Mizan Tefri, Ethiopia.",yaregalti@gmail.com,,"tilahun, yaregal/0000-0001-9721-8257",,,,,79,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2332-2039,,,COGENT ECON FINANC,Cogent Econ.

This study therefore explores climate change risks that have been recognized as fatal to people and the environment by analyzing multi-influence factors that appear in multiple risk indicators. The climate change risks in this study are based on 73 existing risk indicators; the frame data for multi-influence risk factors are based on 3098 newspaper articles published over 24 years on the impact of climate change in South Korea. The main outcomes for this study were finding climate change risk trend from newspaper articles regarding climate change impacts through text-mining, and figuring out the multi-risk indicators that are likely to occur at the same time with other risk indicators using network analysis. From the network analysis, we found that the major risk indicators have a high degree of interrelationship among risk indicators, including increase in mortality rate from disaster, increase in flood areas due to coastal flooding, and destruction of repair facilities due to flooding (river bank, etc.). The main risk indicators derived from this study can therefore be used as a reasonable standard when identifying the main risks posed by climate change and defining future adaptation planning priorities.","[Kang, Youngeun] Dong A Univ, Ind Acad Collaborat Fdn, Busan 49315, South Korea; [Park, Chang-Sug] Korea Environm Inst, Off Planning & Management Grp, Sejong 30147, South Korea",Dong A University; Korea Environment Institute (KEI),"Kang, Y (corresponding author), Dong A Univ, Ind Acad Collaborat Fdn, Busan 49315, South Korea.",jiyoon8936@gmail.com; plade290@kei.re.kr,,,Korea Environment Institute [2015-03-01]; Korean Ministry of Environment [2014001310006],"Korea Environment Institute; Korean Ministry of Environment(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea)",This study was funded by the Korea Environment Institute (project #2015-03-01) and Korean Ministry of Environment under Grant <Climate Change Correspondence Program 2014001310006>.,,69,6,6,2,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2018,10,5,,,,,,,1596,10.3390/su10051596,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10051596,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ7RP,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000435587100292,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such interactions are ubiquitous, yet changes in LULC are generally made without regard to their biophysical implications. This review considers the potential for LULC to compound, confound, or even contradict changes expected from climate change alone. These properties give LULC the potential to be used as powerful tools capable of modifying local climate and contributing significantly to the net impact of climate change. Management practices based modifications of LULC patterns and processes could be applied strategically to increase the resilience of vulnerable ecological systems and facilitate climate adaptation. These interventions build on the traditional competencies of land management and land protection organizations and suggest that these institutions have a central role in determining the ecological impact of climate change and the development of strategies for adaptation. The practical limits to the use of LULC-based tools also suggest important inflection points between manageable and dangerous levels of climate change.","Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA",National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis,"Pyke, CR (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, 735 State St,Suite 300, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA.",pyke.chris@epa.gov,,,,,,,98,26,27,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

This study explored factors influencing HCWs' disaster management capabilities with the aim of improving their resilience and adaptive capacity in the face of climate change. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with thirteen HCWs who dealt with disasters within two hospitals in Queensland, Australia. Analysis of the results identified two significant themes, HCWs' disaster education and HCWs' wellness and needs. The latter comprised five subthemes: HCWs' fear and vulnerability, doubts and uncertainty, competing priorities, resilience and adaptation, and needs assessment. This study developed an 'HCWs Resilience Toolkit', which encourages mindfulness amongst leaders, managers and policymakers about supporting four priority HCWs' needs: 'Wellness', 'Education', 'Resources' and 'Communication'.

This is because a changing climate makes it quite a challenge to calculate uncertainties, establishing the measurable uncertainty as the basis for quantifying risk. Approaches that are capable of accommodating and possibly countering the wickedness caused by increasing uncertainty are necessary, the argument holds. Following up on previous studies of learning-knowledge and adapting to a changing climate, this article provides an analysis of how differences in the understanding of uncertainty and risk inform and determine governmental adaptation policies and actions of the local and central government in Norway, also discussing governance implications. The study finds that the understanding of uncertainty and risk generally is poor at the local level, but better at the state level, especially among highly educated staff with a background in, for example, natural sciences and engineering. On the other hand, a traditional understanding of uncertainty and risk is dominating: seeking to establish measurable uncertainty as a basis for quantifying risk. The article discusses combining different approaches of uncertainty and risk, thereby introducing a broader basis for governance, also implying multi-level network governance. On the one hand, this may help the local-central government in handling wicked problems of adapting to a changing climate but on other hand, it also possibly nurture struggles between different knowledge bases and stakeholder interest, thereby fuelling the wickedness of adaptation policies.","[Orderud, G.

The aim of this qualitative, exploratory study was to understand the unique motivation dynamics, that is, how the motivation of the farmers to create GBI and other measures on agricultural land starts, develops, changes over time, and is maintained or diminishes. We have categorised farmers on the basis of the degree of implemented GBI, their motivation to implement GBI, and other characteristics into three types: fulfilled farmers, farmers struggling with barriers, and frustrated farmers. The components that affect the motivation are presented in a qualitative model. The data suggests that a combination of the vision of the farm, financial security of a business, the farmer's personality traits, and the fulfilment of his or her basic psychological needs is a prerequisite for the motivation to implement GBI, as is sufficient knowledge about the benefits of GBI. Future policies may benefit from acknowledging differences in motivation dynamics among farmers, the level of their frustration, and their needs.","[Meierova, Tamara; Chvatalova, Veronika] EKOTOXA sro, Fisova 403-7, Brno 602 00, Czech Republic; [Meierova, Tamara] Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Dept Environm Studies, Zerotinovo nam 617-9, Brno 602 00, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Chvatalova, V (corresponding author), EKOTOXA sro, Fisova 403-7, Brno 602 00, Czech Republic.",veronika.chvatalova@ekotoxa.cz,"Meierová, Tamara/GVS-6627-2022; Chvatalova, Veronika/Z-4109-2019","Faberova, Tamara/0000-0002-9681-9234; Chvatalova, Veronika/0000-0002-9601-492X",Technology Agency of the Czech Republic [TL02000431],Technology Agency of the Czech Republic,We would like to appreciate the willingness of farmers and in-formants to participate in this study.

We evaluated the effect of climate change in 2030 compared to a baseline period (1980-1999) by upscaling from farm to the national level. Wheat yields and gross margins under current and projected climates were assessed using current technology and management practices and then compared with 'best adapted' yield achieved by adjustments to planting date, nitrogen fertilizer, and available cultivars for each region. For the baseline climate (1980-1999), there was a potential yield gap modelled as optimized adaptation gave potential up scaled yields (tonne/ha) and gross margins (AUD $/ha) of 17% and 33% above the baseline, respectively. In 2030 and at Australian wheatbelt level, climate change impact projected to decline wheat yield by 1%. For 2030, national wheat yields were simulated to decrease yields by 1% when using existing technology and practices but increase them by 18% assuming optimal adaptation. Hence, nationally at 2030 for a fully-adapted wheat system, yield increased by 1% and gross margin by 0.3% compared to the fully adapted current climate baseline. However, there was substantial regional variation with median yields and gross margins decreasing in 55% of sites. Full adaptation of farm systems under current climate is not expected, and so this will remain an on-going challenge. However, by 2030 there will be a greater opportunity to increase the overall water use and nitrogen efficiencies of the Australian wheat belt, mostly resulting from elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

Interviews with 44 house owners in four regions exposed to climate risks in Sweden were analyzed using the narrative method. I use intersectional risk theory, in which risk is constructed in relation to different forms of power structure, to interpret the narratives. The results indicate that narrators do risk in different ways in relation to the master narratives of the climate threat and individual environmental responsibility, which dominate the official rhetoric in Sweden. Three risk narratives are revealed in the interviews: (1) the master narrative of 'the responsible house owner,' (2) the alternative narrative of 'the vulnerable house owner', and (3) the counter-narrative of 'the safe house owner.' The climate risks talked about could relate to the narrator's own house or to risks at a local or global level. The results indicate that different intersections of class, gender, age, and place shape different ways of positioning in relation to risk, by describing oneself as more or less aware of and exposed to climate risks. The analysis also reveals that different intersections of social structures lead to shifting prerequisites for house-owner preparedness towards preventing and managing climate risks. Such an understanding is important when trying to comprehend why some house owners adapt their homes to a changed climate while others do not. Aspects like these are necessary to consider while, e.g. deciding on policy and writing information and guidelines on adaptation to climate change.","[Jarnkvist, Karin] Mid Sweden Univ, Dept Social Sci, Holmgatan 10, S-85170 Sundsvall, Sweden",Mid-Sweden University,"Jarnkvist, K (corresponding author), Mid Sweden Univ, Dept Social Sci, Holmgatan 10, S-85170 Sundsvall, Sweden.",karin.jarnkvist@miun.se,,"Jarnkvist, Karin/0000-0002-6408-2952",Lansforsakringsgruppens Forsknings- och utvecklingsfond in Sweden [P3/14],Lansforsakringsgruppens Forsknings- och utvecklingsfond in Sweden,"This study received financial support from Lansforsakringsgruppens Forsknings- och utvecklingsfond in Sweden, under Grant P3/14.",,32,1,1,5,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-9877,1466-4461,,J RISK RES,J.

Under climate change, changing weather patterns including greater temperature volatility are also likely to further affect yield stability. Simulation modeling provides a powerful tool to investigate the interactive effects of abiotic factors and develop adaptive strategies; however, many of these models do not adequately account for the step change response to high temperature occurring during the crop reproductive phase. Empirical response data will support the development of robust algorithms for crop models. We present results from three experiments on the response of wheat to a range of acute high-temperature treatments. For 35, 37, and 42 degrees C and 1, 3, and 5 d of exposure (similar to 6 h d(-1)), expressed as heat sum, degrees Cxh (above 32 degrees C), high temperature applied 5 d prior to anthesis reduced grain number and yield by 0.16 and 0.15% per degrees Cxh respectively, whereas individual grain weight and grain nitrogen concentration increased by 0.03 and 0.06% per degrees Cxh, respectively. For high temperature applied after anthesis, individual grain weight decreased by 0.05% per degrees Cxh, grain nitrogen concentration increased by 0.03% per degrees Cxh, and yield was reduced by 0.07% per degrees Cxh. The often asymptotic response meant exponential functions provided a superior fit. Water availability prior to anthesis attenuated wheat response to high temperature. Such algorithms could contribute to improving our prediction of the step change response of wheat to high temperature within crop models and more broadly contribute to developing strategies for crop adaptation to climate change using a modeling approach.","[Nuttall, James G.; Delahunty, Audrey J.; O'Leary, Garry J.] Agr Victoria, Dept Econ Dev Jobs Transport & Resources, 110 Natimuk Rd, Horsham, Vic 3400, Australia; [Barlow, Kirsten M.; Christy, Brendan P.] Agr Victoria, Dept Econ Dev Jobs Transport & Resources, 124 Chiltern Valley Rd, Rutherglen, Vic 3685, Australia; [Delahunty, Audrey J.] Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3000, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Nuttall, JG (corresponding author), Agr Victoria, Dept Econ Dev Jobs Transport & Resources, 110 Natimuk Rd, Horsham, Vic 3400, Australia.",James.Nuttall@ecodev.vic.gov.au,,"barlow, kirsten/0000-0002-1352-5864","Australian Grains Research and Development Corporation; Agriculture Victoria, Dep. of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources","Australian Grains Research and Development Corporation(Grains R&D Corp); Agriculture Victoria, Dep. of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources","The authors would like to thank the Australian Grains Research and Development Corporation and Agriculture Victoria, Dep. of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources for their financial support of this research.",,52,27,27,2,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-1962,1435-0645,,AGRON J,Agron.

This study presents a novel vulnerability assessment framework for infrastructure networks against extreme rainfall-induced flash floods, with a specific application to transportation. The framework combines climate models, network science, geographical information systems (GIS), and stochastic modeling to compile a vulnerability surface (VS). Daily precipitation simulations for 2006-2100 from the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4), are used to produce a stochastic simulation of extreme flash flood events in five U.S. cities-that is, Boston, Massachusetts; Houston, Texas; Miami, Florida; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-under two different climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). To assess the impact of these events, percentage drops in static (i.e., overall properties and robustness topological indicators) and dynamic (i.e., GIS accessibility and travel demand metrics) network properties are measured before and after simulated extreme events. The results of these metrics are inputs on a radar diagram to form a VS. Overall, the results show that changes in flash flood frequency due to climate change can have a significant impact on road networks, as was demonstrated recently in Houston, Texas. The magnitude of these impacts is chiefly associated with the geographic location of the cities and the size of the networks. The proposed framework can be reproduced in any city around the world, and researchers can use the results as guidelines for infrastructure design and planning purposes. Moreover, sensitivity analysis to varying greenhouse gas concentration trajectories can help local and national authorities to prioritize strategies for adaptation to climate change in more vulnerable regions.","[Kermanshah, A.] Univ Illinois, Complex & Sustainable Urban Networks Lab, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Kermanshah, A.; Derrible, S.] Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Mat Engn, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Derrible, S.] Univ Illinois, Complex & Sustainable Urban Networks, Chicago, IL USA; [Derrible, S.] Univ Illinois, Inst Environm Sci & Policy, Chicago, IL USA; [Berkelhammer, M.] Univ Illinois, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Chicago, IL USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Kermanshah, A (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Complex & Sustainable Urban Networks Lab, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.;Kermanshah, A (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Mat Engn, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",akerma2@uic.edu,,"Derrible, Sybil/0000-0002-2939-6016","National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award [1551731]; Research Open Access Publishing (ROAAP) Fund of the University of Illinois at Chicago; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering [1551731] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Research Open Access Publishing (ROAAP) Fund of the University of Illinois at Chicago; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","This research was partly supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award 1551731.

Recently, many lakes in the region have been dry or at their lowest level in recorded history, due to a drought that broke in 2010. For this study, a modified difference water budget method was employed to estimate net groundwater flux through the difference between the level of the lake and the water table, along with the specific yield and area of the aquifer. This model successfully modelled the lake level fluctuations. In recent years, Lake Purrumbete has fallen below the outflow level; however, because of its large volume, changes in salinity to date are minor and do not affect its freshwater status. An understanding of how these systems will behave in the future and how they may be best managed in a drying climate is considered an important step to adapt to climate change. Postulated future climatic changes in the region of the lake were used to project the lake level fluctuations to 2030 using the water budget model, and showed that dry conditions would cause the lake level to remain below its outlet elevation, but wet conditions would result in a significant recovery in the lake level. If the level of Lake Purrumbete continues to fall, the main threat to its ecological status will be the potential loss of some significant areas of fringing wetland habitat. The lowering in lake level could cause a shift in the abundance of algal plankton and so influence the whole lake food web. This may reduce the invertebrate diversity of the lake.","[Yihdego, Yohannes; Webb, John A.] La Trobe Univ, Environm Geosci, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia; [Yihdego, Yohannes] SMEC, Sydney, NSW 2060, Australia; [Leahy, Paul] EPA Victoria, Appl Sci Grp, Macleod, Vic 3085, Australia",La Trobe University,"Yihdego, Y (corresponding author), SMEC, Sydney, NSW 2060, Australia.",yohannesyihdego@gmail.com,"Yihdego, Dr Yohannes/R-6903-2017; Webb, John/B-2479-2012","Yihdego, Dr Yohannes/0000-0002-4646-229X; Webb, John/0000-0002-6357-5966",Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) Victoria; Glenelg-Hopkins Catchment Management Authority,Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) Victoria; Glenelg-Hopkins Catchment Management Authority,"This study is a portion of the senior author's doctoral research conducted while at La Trobe University, Australia.

Analysis of a multi-model ensemble shows that this is not the case, with greater land warming for a transient state, increasing risks that need to be considered in adaptation planning. There has recently been interest in understanding the differences between specific levels of global warming, especially the Paris Agreement limits of 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. However, different model experiments(1-3) have been used in these analyses under varying rates of increase in global-average temperature. Here, we use climate model simulations to show that, for a given global temperature, most land is significantly warmer in a rapidly warming (transient) case than in a quasi-equilibrium climate. This results in more than 90% of the world's population experiencing a warmer local climate under transient global warming than equilibrium global warming. Relative to differences between the 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C global warming limits, the differences between transient and quasi-equilibrium states are substantial. For many land regions, the probability of very warm seasons is at least two times greater in a transient climate than in a quasi-equilibrium equivalent. In developing regions, there are sizable differences between transient and quasi-equilibrium climates that underline the importance of explicitly framing projections. Our study highlights the need to better understand differences between future climates under rapid warming and quasi-equilibrium conditions for the development of climate change adaptation policies. Yet, current multi-model experiments(1,4) are not designed for this purpose.","[King, Andrew D.; Lane, Todd P.; Henley, Benjamin J.; Brown, Josephine R.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [King, Andrew D.; Lane, Todd P.; Henley, Benjamin J.; Brown, Josephine R.] Univ Melbourne, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Henley, Benjamin J.] Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Clayton, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; Monash University,"King, AD (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia.;King, AD (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Parkville, Vic, Australia.",andrew.king@unimelb.edu.au,"Lane, Todd P/A-8804-2011; , BH/D-8684-2011; King, Andrew/AAS-4216-2021","Lane, Todd P/0000-0003-0171-6927; , BH/0000-0003-3940-1963; King, Andrew/0000-0001-9006-5745; Brown, Josephine/0000-0002-1100-7457",Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award [DE180100638]; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes [CE170100023]; Australian Research Council Linkage project [LP150100062],Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council Linkage project(Australian Research Council),"We thank R.

The value of such habitats is, however, dependent on key structural traits of the ecosystem engineer, and the intensity and duration of thermal exposure. Using an experimental mesocosm that mimicked the rocky intertidal environment, we assessed how the spatial configuration of the habitat formed by an autogenic ecosystem engineer, the oyster, influences its capacity to mitigate heat stress experienced by invertebrates during simulated emersion periods on tropical, Hong Kong rocky shores. At the average temperature experienced during summer low tides, oyster habitat ameliorated environmental and organismal temperatures, irrespective of the structural configuration of the oyster bed. As temperatures increased, however, vertically orientated oysters provided microclimates that facilitated cooler invertebrate body temperatures than horizontal beds, which no longer conferred any associational benefit as compared to bare rock surfaces. In the absence of oysters, physiological indicators of stress to associated organisms (i.e., heart rate and osmolality) increased with the intensity and duration of exposure to high temperatures. Such effects were, however, mitigated by association with vertical but not horizontal oyster configurations. In contrast, the osmolality of the oysters was not related to temperature, suggesting they remained in a state of metabolic quiescence throughout emersion. Structural traits such as the spatial configuration of ecosystem engineers are therefore critical to their effectiveness in environmental amelioration. As such, variations in the morphological traits of ecosystem engineers, which have important implications for their ecological role, need to be incorporated into conservation and restoration projects aimed at climate change adaptation.

However, the WFD does not explicitly mention risks posed by climate change to the achievement of its environmental objectives. This is despite the fact that the time scale for the implementation process and achieving particular objectives extends into the 2020s, when climate models project changes in average temperature and precipitation. This paper begins by reviewing the latest UK climate change scenarios and the wider policy and science context of the WFD. We then examine the potential risks of climate change to key phases of the River Basin Management Process that underpin the WFD (such as charactelisation of liver basins and their water bodies, risk assessments to identify pressures and impacts, programmes of measures (POMs) options appraisal, monitoring and modelling, policy and management activities). Despite these risks the WFD could link new policy and participative mechanisms (being established for the River Basin Management Plans) to the emerging framework of national and regional climate change adaptation policy. The risks are identified with a view to informing policy opportunities, objective setting, adaptation strategies and the research agenda. Key knowledge gaps have already been identified during the implementation of the WFD, such as the links between hydromorphology and ecosystem status, but the overarching importance of linking climate change to these considerations needs to be highlighted. The next generation of (probabilistic) climate change scenarios will present new opportunities and challenges for risk analysis and policy-making. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach In 2017 and 2018, the authors conducted13 semi-directed interviews with municipal staff and elected officials from three municipalities, a documentary analysis of primary and secondary sources. Interviews and documentation collected were also coded using the software NVIVO 12. The authors compared three municipal case studies: the City of Toronto (Ontario), the City of Guelph (Ontario), and the Town of Bridgewater (Nova Scotia). Findings The authors found that leadership is a prominent factor explaining the expansion of municipal climate action in Canada. Municipal climate action is initiated and championed by an individual, elected officials or municipal staff, who lead and engage in the development of policy instruments to mitigate and/or adapt to climate change. These leaders facilitate the formulation and implementation of instruments, encourage a paradigm shift within the municipality, overcome structural and behavioural barriers, and foster collaboration around a common vision. Optimal municipal climate leadership occurs when the leadership of elected officials and municipal is congruent, though networks play a significant role by amplifying municipal sustainability leadership. They support staff and elected officials leadership within municipalities, provide more information and funding to grow the capacity of municipalities to develop instruments, to the point that conditions under which municipalities are driving climate action are changing. Research limitations/implications This paper hopes to contribute to better understand under what conditions municipalities drive change. Originality/value There is an international scholarly recognition that municipalities should be further explored and considered important actors in the Canadian and international climate change governance. Gore (2010) and Robinson and Gore (2015) highlighted that we are yet to understand the extent to which municipalities are involved in climate governance in Canada. This article directly addresses this gap in the current scholarly literature and explores the expansion of climate municipal leadership with the aspects of interviews.","[Touchant, Lauren] Univ Ottawa, Ctr Governance, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Touchant, Lauren] Univ Ottawa, Ctr Environm Law & Global Sustainabil, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa,"Touchant, L (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Ctr Governance, Ottawa, ON, Canada.;Touchant, L (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Ctr Environm Law & Global Sustainabil, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",ltouchan@uottawa.ca,,,Vanier Scholarship,Vanier Scholarship,This research was made possible because of the support of the Vanier Scholarship (2016-2019).,,98,0,0,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2056-4929,2042-8642,,INT J PUBLIV LEADERS,Int.

The Greek urban policy, over the last 100 years, has not succeeded in limiting these problems and for that reason the new Law 4759/2020 is expected to promote the development of a more efficient spatial planning system reform implemented through the Local Urban Plans (LUPs) and the Special Urban Plans (SUPs) that are funded by the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). These programs will contribute to the preservation of cultural heritage and to the development of productive activities at both local and national levels, especially on the sectors of renewable energy sources, the circular economy, and the construction of green materials, digital applications and products etc. LUPs and SUPs are related to the holistic reform of the national urban policy and the relevant planning system that horizontally affects a wide range of policy areas such as: environmental protection and adaptation to climate change (for natural ecosystems and biodiversity; agriculture; forestry; fisheries; water resources; coastal zones), built environment and development, protection of historic sites and buildings, allocation of the public infrastructure, allocation of investments etc. The General Secretariat of Spatial Planning and Urban Environment Ministry of Environment and Energy has the main responsibility for the implementation procedures of all the proposed actions that will start in 2022 and will end in 2026. This paper focuses on the analysis of the current urban policy reform in Greece and the reasons that this reform is considered an immediate necessity in the current Greek urban legislative framework and the expected outcomes of LUPs and SUPs, which are examined in the literature for the first time, contributing to research on the present EU planning systems.","[Vassi, Avgi; Siountri, Konstantina; Papadaki, Kalliopi; Iliadi, Alkistis; Ypsilanti, Anna; Bakogiannis, Efthimios] Minist Environm & Energy, Gen Secretariat Spatial Planning & Urban Environm, Athens 11523, Greece; [Vassi, Avgi; Papadaki, Kalliopi; Bakogiannis, Efthimios] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Dept Geog & Reg Planning, Sch Rural & Surveying Engn, Athens 15773, Greece; [Siountri, Konstantina] Univ Aegean, Cultural Technol & Commun Dept, Mitilini 81100, Greece",National Technical University of Athens; University of Aegean,"Bakogiannis, E (corresponding author), Minist Environm & Energy, Gen Secretariat Spatial Planning & Urban Environm, Athens 11523, Greece.;Bakogiannis, E (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Dept Geog & Reg Planning, Sch Rural & Surveying Engn, Athens 15773, Greece.",a.vassi@prv.ypeka.gr; ksiountri@aegean.gr; k.papadaki@prv.ypeka.gr; a.iliadi@prv.ypeka.gr; a.ypsilanti@prv.ypeka.gr; ebako@mail.ntua.gr,,"Bakogiannis, Efthimios/0000-0001-6726-4762",National Technological University of Athens (NTUA),National Technological University of Athens (NTUA),National Technological University of Athens (NTUA).,,87,1,1,3,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,AUG,2022,11,8,,,,,,,1231,10.3390/land11081231,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11081231,,,22,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,4B1NS,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000845554100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Considering that a trend of increasing drought severity is expected in the future in Southern Europe, solutions need to be found to enhance the resilience of agroecosystems to the effects of climate change. From this perspective, proso millet re-introduction could represent an interesting tool in reducing water consumption for grain production and in providing a new resource to farmers. The aim of this study was to characterize proso millet adaptability to drought and low-input field conditions in the Mediterranean environment, especially considering water-related traits, such as water use efficiency. Limited water-demanding crops and yield stability can contribute to the resilience of agroecosystems and their adaptation to climate change. A three-year field crop experiment was conducted in northern Italy to assess proso millet's performance in terms of productivity and water status in rainfed agriculture conditions. It was compared to a conventional irrigated corn, a typical summer cereal of the area. All years of experimentation were characterized by adverse meteorological trends, in the full manifestation of the uncertainties of climate change. Despite such different conditions from an agro-meteorological point of view, proso millet showed, in non-irrigated conditions, stable yield and water use efficiency (on average 0.30 kg/m(2) and 1.83 kg /m(3), respectively), and good agronomic performance. Proso millet, therefore, seems to offer interesting traits for reintroduction on the European side of the Mediterranean Basin, representing a resource for farmers. Moreover, the shortness of the proso millet life cycle (on average 108 days) allows it to be used as a catch crop in the event of major crop failure, an event becoming more likely in the climate change scenario. Furthermore, the possibility of producing grain while saving water (and other production inputs), even in very hot and dry years, increases the sustainability of agricultural production and the resilience of agroecosystems.","[Ventura, Francesca; Poggi, Giovanni Maria; Vignudelli, Marco; Bosi, Sara; Negri, Lorenzo; Fakaros, Antonio; Dinelli, Giovanni] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr & Food Sci, DISTAL, Alma Mater Studiorum, Viale G Fanin 44, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; [Poggi, Giovanni Maria] Univ Bologna, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Alma Mater Studiorum, BiGeA, Via Irnerio 42, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Bologna,"Ventura, F (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dept Agr & Food Sci, DISTAL, Alma Mater Studiorum, Viale G Fanin 44, I-40127 Bologna, Italy.",francesca.ventura@unibo.it; giovannimaria.poggi2@unibo.it; marco.vignudelli5@unibo.it; sara.bosi@unibo.it; lorenzo.negri4@unibo.it; antonio.fakaros2@unibo.it; giovanni.dinelli@unibo.it,"ventura, francesca/I-3971-2012","ventura, francesca/0000-0003-0748-942X; Bosi, Sara/0000-0003-2722-8390; Poggi, Giovanni Maria/0000-0003-4835-5145; Negri, Lorenzo/0000-0002-8729-2442", [LIFE17 CCA/IT/000067],,"This work was financed in the frame of a Life-CCA EU project, called Growing REsilience AgricolTure-Life (GREAT LIFE), LIFE17 CCA/IT/000067.",,35,0,0,4,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,MAR,2022,12,3,,,,,,,609,10.3390/agronomy12030609,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12030609,,,18,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,0C5VZ,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000775382000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, few studies have quantified the health impact of climate change in Brazil and in the Latin America region. In this paper, we projected the impacts of temperature on cardiovascular (CVD) mortality according to two climate change scenarios and two regionalized climate model simulations in Brazilian cities. Methods: We estimated the temperature-CVD mortality relationship in 21 Brazilian cities, using distributed lag non-linear models in a two-stage time-series analysis. We combined the observed exposure-response functions with the daily temperature projected under two representative concentration pathways (RCP), RCP8.5 and RCP4.5, and two regionalized climate model simulations, Eta-HadGEM2-ES and Eta-MIROC5. Results: We observed a trend of reduction in mortality related to low temperatures and a trend of increase in mortality related to high temperatures, according to all the investigated models and scenarios. In most places, the increase in mortality related to high temperatures outweighed the reduction in mortality related to low temperatures, causing a net increase in the excess temperature-related mortality. These trends were steeper according to the higher emission scenario, RCP8.5, and to the Eta-HadGEM2-ES model. According to RCP8.5, our projections suggested that the temperature-related mortality fractions in 2090-99 compared to 2010-2019 would increase by 8.6% and 1.7%, under Eta-HadGEM2-ES and Eta-MIROC5, respectively. According to RCP4.5, these values would be 0.7% and -0.6%. Conclusions: For the same climate model, we observed a greater increase trend in temperature-CVD mortality according to RCP8.5, highlighting a greater health impact associated with the higher emission scenario. Our results may be useful to support public policies and strategies for mitigation of and adaptation to climate change, particularly in the health sector.","[Silveira, Ismael Henrique] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Collect Hlth, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Silveira, Ismael Henrique; Cortes, Taisa Rodrigues; Junger, Washington Leite] Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, Inst Social Med, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Alves de Oliveira, Beatriz Fatima] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Natl Sch Publ Hlth, Fiocruz Reg Off Piaui, Teresina, Brazil",Universidade Federal da Bahia; Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro; Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz,"Silveira, IH (corresponding author), Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Saude Colet, R Basil Gama S-N, BR-40110040 Salvador, BA, Brazil.",ismaelhsilveira@ufba.br,"Cortes, Taisa/ABC-7453-2021; Junger, Washington/GLT-9391-2022","Cortes, Taisa/0000-0002-8981-1373; Silveira, Ismael Henrique/0000-0003-4793-3492; Junger, Washington/0000-0002-6394-6587; Oliveira, Beatriz/0000-0003-0103-3309","Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel -CAPES [001]; Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Supporting Research in the State of Rio de Janeiro -FAPERJ [E-26/202.756/2018]; National Council of Technological and Scientific Development CNPq [307495/2018-3, 406292/2018-3]",Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel -CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Supporting Research in the State of Rio de Janeiro -FAPERJ; National Council of Technological and Scientific Development CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"This work was supported in part by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel -CAPES (finance code 001), Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Supporting Research in the State of Rio de Janeiro -FAPERJ (grant number E-26/202.756/2018), and the National Council of Technological and Scientific Development CNPq (grant numbers 307495/2018-3 and 406292/2018-3).",,40,2,2,3,12,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0013-9351,1096-0953,,ENVIRON RES,Environ.

Reliable measures of chilling requirement (CR) are necessary for growers in mild winter production locations to determine phenotypic suitability of cultivars for profitable production under current and future climates. This study has produced a collection of CRs for apple (Malus domestica) in chill portions (CP), chill units (CU) and chill hours (CH) for the mild climatic region of Applethorpe, Queensland, Australia. Total seasonal chill accumulation (1 March to 31 August) for 2014 and 2015 in Applethorpe was 75 and 78 CP; 1341 and 1242 CU and; 899 and 882 CH, respectively. All cultivars met their CRs by 10 September (2014) and 2 September (2015). Cultivar CR was estimated using forced bud methods over two seasons. The range of CRs measured for each of the three chill models was 57 +/- 2.9 to 77 +/- 1.5 CP, 976 +/- 40.3 to 1307 +/- 86.6 CU and 662 +/- 44,5 to 908 +/- 23.3 CH. Regardless of chill model choice, the nine cultivars were ranked the same from lowest (`Cripps Red') to the highest requirement (Pup and Hi Early'). Analysis of historical climate data showed that the CRs of 'Cripps Pink' and 'Granny Smith' have been met in 56% and 58% of years respectively. By 2030, this was projected to fall to 2-25% of years for both varieties, and 0% of years by 2050 for 'Cripps Pink', and 0-2% by 2050 for 'Granny Smith'. The results emphasise the need for better understanding of bud progression through the phases of dormancy. In particular, well-defined methods for identifying the transition from endo- to ecodormancy, and improved capacity of chill models to capture the chill accumulation process are necessary to provide valuable CR information to temperate fruit industries for adaptation to climate change.","[Parkes, Heidi] State Govt Queensland, Dept Agr & Fisheries, 3 Roessler Ave, Stanthorpe, Qld 4380, Australia; [Darbyshire, Rebecca] State Govt New South Wales, Dept Primary Ind, Queanbeyan, NSW 2620, Australia; [White, Neil] State Govt Queensland, Dept Agr & Fisheries, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [White, Neil] Univ Queensland, Ctr Plant Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",NSW Department of Primary Industries; University of Queensland,"Parkes, H (corresponding author), State Govt Queensland, Dept Agr & Fisheries, 3 Roessler Ave, Stanthorpe, Qld 4380, Australia.",heidi.parkes@daf.qld.gov.au,"Darbyshire, Rebecca/AAI-3945-2021; White, Neil/C-5782-2008","White, Neil/0000-0002-8763-975X; Darbyshire, Rebecca/0000-0003-4712-8514",State Government of Queensland through the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries; Horticulture Innovation Australia Limited from the Australian Government,State Government of Queensland through the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries; Horticulture Innovation Australia Limited from the Australian Government,"This work was supported by Horticulture Innovation Australia Limited using Apple and Pear Industry levies and funds from the Australian Government, with additional support from the State Government of Queensland through the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.",,58,14,16,1,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-4238,1879-1018,,SCI HORTIC-AMSTERDAM,Sci.

Local climate heat-wave scenarios show an increase of its mean intensity close to 2 degrees C (reaching temperatures of up to 38.8 degrees C) and an average increase of the maximum intensity of 3.6 degrees C (temperature of up to 41.5 degrees C) with respect to a historic period (1971-2000) for the RCP8.5 scenario at the end of the century. The duration of heat waves will increase by 7 days at the end of the century (total average duration of 12 days). The future intensity and duration of cold-wave episodes will remain stable. Local climate change scenarios for daily maximum temperatures show a gradual increase throughout the 21st century. The greatest increases will occur during the summer at the end of the century, reaching values of up to 7 degrees C for the RCP 8.5 scenario. The minimum temperature increases show similar behaviours to the maximum temperatures, but with less marked increases (3 degrees C and 5.6 degrees C for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios respectively in summer at the end of the century). The highest temperatures and the intensity of the heat waves will be especially intense in the Ebro Valley, the most populated area. In addition, the Pyrenees will suffer the longest heat waves, especially at the end of the century, and the greatest increases in maximum temperatures. The downscaling of the CMIP5 models, offers accurate scenarios-both spatially and temporally-of extreme temperatures and heat and cold waves, useful for decision-making for local adaptation to climate change but also as a reference for other European regions.

Farmers have developed coping mechanisms, which they deploy at times of climatic shocks. We aimed to analyze the importance of NTFPs in times of drought and to identify options that could increase the capacity to adapt to climate change. We used participatory techniques, livelihood analysis, observations, and measurements to quantify the use of NTFPs. Communities recognized NTFPs as a mechanism to cope with crop failure. We estimated that indigenous fruits contributed to approximately 20% of the energy intake of wealthier farmers and to approximately 40% of the energy intake of poor farmers in years of inadequate rainfall. Farmers needed to invest a considerable share of their time to collect wild fruits from deforested areas. They recognized that the effectiveness of NTFPs as an adaptation option had become threatened by severe deforestation and by illegal harvesting of fruits by urban traders. Farmers indicated the need to plan future land use to (1) intensify crop production, (2) cultivate trees for firewood, (3) keep orchards of indigenous fruit trees, and (4) improve the quality of grazing lands. Farmers were willing to cultivate trees and to organize communal conservation of indigenous fruits trees. Through participatory exercises, farmers elaborated maps, which were used during land use discussions. The process led to prioritization of pressing land use problems and identification of the support needed: fast-growing trees for firewood, inputs for crop production, knowledge on the cultivation of indigenous fruit trees, and clear regulations and compliance with rules for extraction of NTFPs. Important issues that remain to be addressed are best practices for regeneration and conservation, access rules and implementation, and the understanding and management of competing claims on the common lands. Well-managed communal resources can provide a strong tool to maintain and increase the rural communities' ability to cope with an increasingly variable climate.","[Woittiez, Lotte S.; Rufino, Mariana C.; Giller, Ken E.] Wageningen Univ, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Rufino, Mariana C.] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Bogor, Indonesia; [Mapfumo, Paul] CIMMYT, Soil Fertil Consortium South Africa SOFECSA, Cape Town, South Africa; [Mapfumo, Paul] Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Soil Sci & Agr Engn, Harare, Zimbabwe",Wageningen University & Research; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); University of Zimbabwe,"Woittiez, LS (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands.",,"Rufino, Mariana/D-8380-2013; Woittiez, Lotte/Q-6227-2019; Giller, Ken E/K-2799-2012; Rufino, Mariana/Y-2415-2019","Rufino, Mariana/0000-0003-4293-3290; Giller, Ken E/0000-0002-5998-4652; Rufino, Mariana/0000-0003-4293-3290; Woittiez, Lotte Suzanne/0000-0002-4882-5103","IDRC (International Development Research Centre, Canada)","IDRC (International Development Research Centre, Canada)","We thank the members of the Soil Sciences Department of the University of Zimbabwe for their support, and the farmers and the extension workers in Ushe and Dendenyore wards for their help, enthusiasm, and hospitality.

Pakistan is in crisis, and climate change, a transnational phenomenon perhaps better characterized as radical enviro-transformation, is an important reason. Its survival as a state may depend to great extent on how it responds to 2010's devastating floods. In the Arctic, the ice cap is melting faster than predicted, as temperatures there rise faster than in almost any other region. Unmanaged, a complex interplay of climate-related conditions, including large-scale ecomigration, may turn resource competition into resource conflict. Radical enviro-transformation has repeatedly overborne the resilience of societies. War is not an inevitable by-product of such transformation, but in the 21st Century climate-related instability, from resource scarcity and ecomigration, will likely create increasingly undesirable conditions of insecurity. Weak and failing states are one of today's greatest security challenges. The pace of radical enviro-transformation, unprecedented in human history, is accelerating, especially in the Arctic, where a new, open, rich, and accessible maritime environment is coming into being. The international community must work together to enhance security and stability, promote sustainability, and strengthen sovereignty. Radical enviro-transformation provides ample reason and plentiful opportunity for preventative, collaborative solutions focused broadly on adaptation to climate change, most particularly the effects of ecomigration. Nations must work together across the whole of government and with all instruments of national power to create conditions for human transformation-social, political, and economic-to occur stably and sustainably, so as to avoid or lessen the prospects for and consequences of conflict. Collaborative international solutions to environmental issues, i.e., solutions that mobilize and share technology and resources, will build nations and build peace. The military, through preventative engagement will play a more and more important role. Further research and analysis is needed to determine what changes in law and policy should be made to facilitate stable and secure ecomigration on an international scale, over a long timeline.",,,"Parsons, RJ (corresponding author), 1221 Candlewood Dr, Virginia Beach, VA 23464 USA.",rymn.parsons@cox.net,,,,,,,98,3,3,1,49,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2011,3,9,,,,,1416,1451,,10.3390/su3091416,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su3091416,,,36,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,V29QT,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000208763600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate change mitigation and co-benefits from blue carbon ecosystems are highlighted in the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate. Its diverse nature has resulted in unprecedented collaboration across disciplines, with conservationists, academics, and politicians working together to achieve common goals such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, which need proper policy regulations, funding, and multi-prong and multi-dimensional strategies to deal with. An overview of blue carbon habitats such as seagrass beds, mangrove forests, and salt marshes, the critical role of blue carbon ecosystems in mitigating plastic/micro-plastic pollution, as well as the utilization of the above-mentioned blue carbon resources for biofuel production, are critically presented in this research. It also highlights the concerns about blue carbon habitats. Identifying and addressing these issues might help preserve and enhance the ocean's ability to store carbon and combat climate change and mitigate plastic/micro-plastic pollution. Checking out their role in carbon sequestration and how they act as the major carbon sinks of the world are integral parts of this study. In light of the global frameworks for blue carbon and the inclusion of microalgae in blue carbon, blue carbon ecosystems must be protected and restored as part of carbon stock conservation efforts and the mitigation of plastic/micro-plastic pollution. When compared to the ecosystem services offered by terrestrial ecosystems, the ecosystem services provided by coastal ecosystems, such as the sequestration of carbon, the production of biofuels, and the remediation of pollution, among other things, are enormous. The primary purpose of this research is to bring awareness to the extensive range of beneficial effects that can be traced back to ecosystems found in coastal environments.","[Bandh, Suhaib A.] Govt Jammu & Kashmir, Dept Higher Educ, Srinagar 190001, Jammu And Kashm, India; [Malla, Fayaz A.] Govt Degree Coll Tral, Dept Environm Sci, Pulwama 192123, Jammu And Kashm, India; [Qayoom, Irteza; Mohi-Ud-Din, Haika; Butt, Aqsa Khursheed; Altaf, Aashia; Wani, Shahid A.] Cluster Univ Srinagar, Sri Pratap Coll Campus, Srinagar 190001, Jammu And Kashm, India; [Betts, Richard] Climate Change & Sustainabil Serv, Salford M50 3AA, England; [Truong, Thanh Hai; Pham, Nguyen Dang Khoa] Ho Chi Minh City Univ Transport, PATET Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City 717000, Vietnam; [Cao, Dao Nam] Ho Chi Minh City Univ Transport, Inst Mech Engn, Ho Chi Minh City 717000, Vietnam; [Ahmed, Shams Forruque] Asian Univ Women, Sci & Math Program, Chattogram 4000, Bangladesh",Ho Chi Minh City University of Transport; Ho Chi Minh City University of Transport; Asian University for Women,"Truong, TH; Pham, NDK (corresponding author), Ho Chi Minh City Univ Transport, PATET Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City 717000, Vietnam.;Ahmed, SF (corresponding author), Asian Univ Women, Sci & Math Program, Chattogram 4000, Bangladesh.",hai.truong@ut.edu.vn; khoapnd@ut.edu.vn; shams.ahmed@auw.edu.bd,"Ahmed, Shams Forruque/AAU-1353-2021","Ahmed, Shams Forruque/0000-0003-3360-3636; Pham, Nguyen Dang Khoa/0000-0003-1750-2077",,,,,302,0,0,11,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2023,15,3,,,,,,,2682,10.3390/su15032682,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15032682,,,29,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,8W1SU,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000931100900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on GIMMS NDVI3g data over the global coastal zone from 1982 to 2014, the spatial-temporal characteristics of vegetation coverage were analysed by plotting the spatial pattern and monthly calendar of NDVI; furthermore, historical trends and future evolutions of vegetation coverage change at the pixel scale were studied by performing the Mann-Kendall trend test and calculating the trend slope (beta) and Hurst index (H) of NDVI. The main findings are as follows: 1) Vegetation density exhibits dramatic differences in the global coastal zone. Specifically, desert belts mostly have perennial non-vegetation or low vegetation coverage, and tundra belts principally have moderate or high vegetation coverage; additionally, forest belts mainly have dense vegetation coverage. 2) In the global coastal zone, intra-annual variations in vegetation coverage show a 'boolean AND'-shaped curve with an obvious peak from June to September (maximum in July or August), while inter-annual variations show a fluctuating but generally slowly increasing trend over the entire study period; accordingly, variations in different subregions show significant differences. 3) At monthly, seasonal and annual scales, the overall vegetation coverage increases in the global coastal zone, while there are relatively few areas with decreasing vegetation coverage; furthermore, change trends of vegetation coverage in most areas will demonstrate relatively strong positive persistence in the future. 4) The increasing trend in high-latitude coastal tundra is extremely significant in the growing season because vegetation in the tundra belts is highly sensitive to climate change. 5) Areas with a decreasing trend of vegetation coverage exhibit spatial patterns of aggregation in the 'circum urban agglomeration' and 'nearby desert belt' regions, that is, the decreasing trend of vegetation coverage is relatively high in coastal urban agglomeration areas and desert belt peripheries. This paper is expected to provide knowledge to support vegetation conservation, ecosystem management, integrated coastal zone management and climate change adaptation in coastal areas.","[Hou, Wan; Hou, Xiyong] Chinese Acad Sci, Yantai Inst Coastal Zone Res, Yantai 264003, Peoples R China; [Hou, Wan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hou, Wan; Hou, Xiyong] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Coastal Environm Proc & Ecol Remediat, Yantai, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Hou, XY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Yantai Inst Coastal Zone Res, Yantai 264003, Peoples R China.",xyhou@yic.ac.cn,,,Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19060205]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31461143032],Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. XDA19060205) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31461143032).,,42,9,11,11,66,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0143-1161,1366-5901,,INT J REMOTE SENS,Int.

However, it is unclear if grassroots innovations can be successful in responding to climate change. Little evidence exists on replication, international comparisons are rare, and research tends to overlook discontinued responses in favour of successful ones. We take the Transition Movement as a case study of a rapidly spreading transnational grassroots network, and include both active and non-active local transition initiatives. We investigate the replication of grassroots innovations in different contexts with the aim to uncover general patterns of success and failure, and identify questions for future research. An online survey was carried out in 23 countries (N = 276). The data analysis entailed testing the effect of internal and contextual factors of success as drawn from the existing literature, and the identification of clusters of transition initiatives with similar internal and contextual factor configurations. Most transition initiatives consider themselves successful. Success is defined along the lines of social connectivity and empowerment, and external environmental impact. We find that less successful transition initiatives might underestimate the importance of contextual factors and material resources in influencing success. We also find that their diffusion is linked to the combination of local-global learning processes, and that there is an incubation period during which a transition initiative is consolidated. Transition initiatives seem capable of generalising organisational principles derived from unique local experiences that seem to be effective in other local contexts. However, the geographical locations matter with regard to where transition initiatives take root and the extent of their success, and 'place attachment' may have a role in the diffusion of successful initiatives. We suggest that longitudinal comparative studies can advance our understanding in this regard, as well as inform the changing nature of the definition of success at different stages of grassroots innovation development, and the dynamic nature of local and global linkages.

Between 2012 and 2016, California experienced one of the region's worst droughts, with record high temperatures and low snowpack, runoff, and precipitation. This study documents small drinking water system managers' experiences during the 2012-2016 Drought. We contribute to research on water system drought resilience by elevating small drinking water system manager perspectives and expertise. We are especially focused on small systems that are not reliant on imports from state or federal water projects. A mixed-method approach ensures each data collection period informs the next to gather statewide perspectives and experiences of managers. Based on an analysis of drinking water manager reflections, the types of impacts, responses, and barriers differed based on both system size and water source portfolio. Common disadvantages that hinder small drinking water systems' drought resilience and, similarly, climate adaptation include staff and administrative capacity; the financial burden of promoting water conservation over revenue compounded by onerous reporting and funding support programs; consumer awareness challenges; and challenges to consolidation from both local political differences and physical limitations. Systems that built technical, managerial, or financial capacity prior to the Drought were at an advantage over systems that lacked this capacity. In the long term, we found a dearth of adaptation planning among small water systems. Documentation of experiences from the 2012-2016 Drought can inform future planning for droughts and more broadly highlight needs for climate adaptation.","[Klasic, Meghan; Ekstrom, Julia A.] Univ Calif Davis, Policy Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Klasic, Meghan; Fencl, Amanda] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Environm Policy & Behav, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Fencl, Amanda] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Ekstrom, Julia A.] Calif Dept Water Resources, Sacramento, CA USA; [Ford, Amanda] Riverford Consulting, Sacramento, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Klasic, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Policy Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;Klasic, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Environm Policy & Behav, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",mrklasic@ucdavis.edu,,"Klasic, Meghan/0000-0002-4513-9124; Fencl, Amanda L/0000-0002-1914-0930",California Natural Resources Agency; USEPA [83519401]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship program,California Natural Resources Agency; USEPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency); National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship program(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported by the California Natural Resources Agency [California Fourth Climate Change Assessment].

The study used data collected from 400 farmers selected through a multistage random sampling technique from two States, Ebonyi and Enugu States, in the zone. The factors affecting the use of some climate change coping strategies were estimated using multivariate probit regression. We isolated factors that constrain farmers from coping with changes in climate using exploratory factor analysis. The findings revealed that the majority (98%) of the smallholder farmers indicated that delay in the onset of rains, too much rainfall (70%), higher temperatures (65%), and erratic rainfall patterns (43%) were the main types of climate change they experienced. The key strategies the farmers applied in coping with climate change are buying food (45%), starting the use of sustainable land management practices (43%), planting of early maturing crops (36%), planting trees (32%), starting non-farm activity (30%), and eating less food (30%). The multivariate probit regression result indicated that some variables influenced the likelihood of simultaneous adoption of the coping strategies. For example, providing climate change information to cassava and yam farmers through extension agents significantly increases the likelihood of engaging in climate-smart practices, namely, planting early-maturing crop varieties and tree planting. We also found that farmers' experiences with climate change variables and outcomes significantly influence the coping strategies they choose. For example, a decline in crop yield was positively and significantly associated with buying food, planting early-maturing varieties, starting a non-farm activity, and eating less as coping strategies. Constraints the farmers faced in coping with climate change were grouped as cultural impediments, weak knowledge/information, ineffective agricultural extension services, and weak policy and institutions. The study recommends, among others, strengthening of public agricultural extension services, provision of climate services to farmers, implementing policies to guaranty food security and enhancing the human capital of the farm households to reduce their vulnerability to climate change.","[Chukwuone, Nnaemeka Andegbe] Univ Nigeria, Resource & Environm Policy Res Ctr, Nsukka, Nigeria; Univ Nigeria, Dept Agr Econ, Nsukka, Nigeria",University of Nigeria; University of Nigeria,"Chukwuone, NA (corresponding author), Univ Nigeria, Resource & Environm Policy Res Ctr, Nsukka, Nigeria.",nnaemeka.chukwuone@unn.edu.ng; ebele.amaechina@unn.edu.ng,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Chukwuone, Nnaemeka/0000-0003-3510-4152",African Growth and Development Policy Modelling Consortium (AGRODEP); International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) [2012X033.CHU],African Growth and Development Policy Modelling Consortium (AGRODEP); International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)(CGIAR),The work was supported by the African Growth and Development Policy Modelling Consortium (AGRODEP) and International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) [contract number: 2012X033.CHU] .

The lens of chemistry is fundamentally necessary to understand the resulting flux of chemical substances in Earth system processes, the unintended consequences of those transformations, impacts on food supply security, water and energy concerns, ways to mediate and adapt to climate change, loss of biodiversity, and how best to build and maintain resilient ecosystems. Reactive nitrogen compounds (Nr) such as ammonia from the industrial fixation of atmospheric nitrogen exemplify both the central importance of chemistry in providing food and meeting basic human needs for a global population of 8 billion people and the sustainability challenges arising from the intended and unintended consequences of large-scale human production and release of Nr. The chemistry profession can use systems thinking (ST) tools and the Planetary Boundaries framework to understand and address challenges facing the entire Earth system resulting from the altered biogeochemical flows of nitrogen. This analysis has compelling priority due to the roles Nr currently plays in global food production and ammonia's potential role as an energy carrier for large-scale human activities in a future low carbon economy and as a domestic refrigerant while hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are being phased out. As this example illustrates, navigating the complex benefits and challenges large-scale human activity imposes on Earth system processes requires the convergence of chemistry research, industrial practice, and education. Since the chemical reactions and processes that transform matter are foundational to sustainability challenges, this perspective maps, through a chemistry for sustainability pyramid, 'multiple levels at which chemistry can contribute toward the emergence of sustainability of the Earth system'. We conclude with recommendations for steps the profession of chemistry can take to make education relevant and engaging and to connect chemistry research and practice to cross-disciplinary sustainability challenges, thereby transforming the science of transformation of matter toward sustainability.","[Mahaffy, Peter G.] Kings Univ Edmonton, Dept Chem, Edmonton, AB T6B 2H3, Canada; [Mahaffy, Peter G.] Kings Univ Edmonton, Kings Ctr Visualizat Sci, Edmonton, AB T6B 2H3, Canada; [Whalen, Joseph Marc] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Chem, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Matlin, Stephen A.] Imperial Coll London, Inst Global Hlth Innovat, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Matlin, Stephen A.] Int Org Chem Sci Dev, B-5000 Namur, Belgium; [Holme, Thomas A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Chem, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Stewart, Jaclyn J.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Chem, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada",Dalhousie University; Imperial College London; Iowa State University; University of British Columbia,"Mahaffy, PG (corresponding author), Kings Univ Edmonton, Dept Chem, Edmonton, AB T6B 2H3, Canada.;Mahaffy, PG (corresponding author), Kings Univ Edmonton, Kings Ctr Visualizat Sci, Edmonton, AB T6B 2H3, Canada.",peter.mahaffy@kingsu.ca,,"Holme, Thomas/0000-0003-0590-5848",IUPAC STCS [2017-010-1-050],IUPAC STCS,"This paper builds on work undertaken in the IUPAC STICE Project No. 2017-010-1-050 and has been developed in parallel with, and as a contribution to the IUPAC STCS 2030+ Project No. 2020-014-3-050.

However, little is known about how much area can be irrigated and where and when water-saving practices could be used. The objective of this study was to assess potentially irrigable lands for irrigated rice cultivation under water-saving technology in Burkina Faso. A two-step, spatially explicit approach was developed and implemented. Firstly, machine learning models, namely Random Forest (RF) and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) were deployed in ecological niche modeling (ENM) approach to assess the land suitability for irrigated rice cultivation. Spatial datasets on topography, soil characteristics, climate parameters, land use, and water were used along with the current distribution of irrigated rice locations in Burkina Faso to drive ENMs. Secondly, the climatic suitability for alternate wetting and drying (AWD), an irrigation management method for saving water in rice cultivation in irrigated systems, was assessed by using a simple water balance model for the two main growing seasons (February to June and July to November) on a dekadal time scale. The evaluation metrics of the ENMs such as the area under the curve and percentage correctly classified showed values higher than 80% for both RF and MaxEnt. The top four predictors of land suitability for irrigated rice cultivation were exchangeable sodium percentage, exchangeable potassium, depth to the groundwater table, and distance to stream networks and rivers. Potentially suitable lands for rice cultivation in Burkina Faso were estimated at 21.1 x 10(5) ha. The whole dry season was found suitable for AWD implementation against 25-100% of the wet season. Soil percolation was the main driver of the variation in irrigated land suitability for AWD in the wet season. The integrated modeling and water balance assessment approach used in this study can be applied to other West African countries to guide investment in irrigated rice area expansion while adapting to climate change.","[Akpoti, Komlavi] Univ Energy & Nat Resources, Reg Ctr Energy & Environm Sustainabil, Sunyani, Ghana; [Dossou-Yovo, Elliott R.; Kiepe, Paul] Africa Rice Ctr AfricaRice, Bouake, Cote Ivoire; [Zwart, Sander J.] Int Water Management Inst, Accra, Ghana",CGIAR; Africa Rice Center; CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI),"Akpoti, K (corresponding author), Univ Energy & Nat Resources, Reg Ctr Energy & Environm Sustainabil, Sunyani, Ghana.",komlavi.akpoti@uenr.edu.gh,"Zwart, Sander J/D-8366-2011; Akpoti, Komlavi/AAF-3251-2019; Zwart, Sander/GQA-3460-2022","Zwart, Sander J/0000-0002-5091-1801; Akpoti, Komlavi/0000-0001-6435-5116; ","project: Climate-smart rice technologies - German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) [81206679, 16.7860.6-001.00]",project: Climate-smart rice technologies - German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),This study was supported by the project: Climate-smart rice technologies to enhance resilience of smallholder rice farmers in Burkina Faso (CSA-Burkina) funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) (Contract No. 81206679; Project Processing No. 16.7860.6-001.00).

In the study, a staged optimization model considering climate change and hydrological model uncertainty (SOCU) was proposed for urban drainage system design. The SOCU model refers to the construction of drainage system by stages instead of traditional implement-once plans, which was established based on an integration of staged optimization policy, urban hydrological model, generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) method and chance-constrained programming (CCP) model. The staged optimization policy was employed to deal with the uncertainty of climate change. The GLUE method was adopted to analyze the uncertainty of urban hydrological model established by PCSWMM. Considering the uncertainty from urban hydrological simulation, the CCP model (one of the main methods of stochastic mathematical programming) was used to deal with the uncertainty of the optimization model. Subsequently, a case study of the Haidian Island of Hainan Province in China was used to demonstrate the proposed model. The result shows that the optimal investment is 183 million Yuan with a pumping capacity of 28.3 m(3)/s for the first stage and 38.4 m(3)/s for the next stage. The SOCU model is not only more flexible to adapt to climate change, but also is economically efficient (10% lower than implement-once plans). The urban drainage system design obtained from the SOCU model is more reliable and robust than traditional implement-once plans since the climate change and hydrological model uncertainty are simultaneously taken into account. Furthermore, the investment increases from 166 million Yuan to 195 million Yuan when the flood constraint satisfaction probability increases from 0.75 to 0.95. Therefore, the model could provide richer decision-making information than traditional implement-once plans and help decision makers seek a trade-off between system investment and acceptable flood damage. The study outcomes provide a reliable optimization model for urban drainage design and may have profound implications and contributions for urban flood management.","[Xu, Hongshi; Ma, Chao; Xu, Kui; Lian, Jijian] Tianjin Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul Engn Simulat & Safety, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Xu, Hongshi] Changjiang Survey Planning Design & Res Co LTD, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Ma, Chao; Xu, Kui] Tianjin Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Lian, Jijian; Long, Yan] Hebei Univ Engn, Sch Water Conservancy & Hydroelect Power, Handan, Peoples R China",Tianjin University; Tianjin University; Hebei University of Engineering,"Ma, C; Xu, K (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul Engn Simulat & Safety, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",mac_tju@126.com; kui.xu@tju.edu.cn,,"Xu, Kui/0000-0001-9371-0340","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1508005]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51679159, 51722906]; Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [51621092]; Program of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities [B14012]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project)","The research was supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFC1508005), National Natural Science Foundation of China (51679159, 51722906), the Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51621092) and the Program of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities (B14012).

However, given that climate change will influence both grain yield and water resource availability, it is not fully understood which type of farming management practice is more adaptive to climate change. This study aims to evaluate the adaptation capabilities of large-scale and individual farming by simulating rice yield changes under future climatic conditions and estimating the climate change impact on the water footprint (WF) of rice production. Rice management practices were obtained from large-scale and individual farming. Five General Circulation Models of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios under four future time periods were used as future climate projections. Simulation results show a remarkable increase in rice yield of individual and large-scale farming under RCP4.5, ranging from 1.3 to 29.8% and 2.0 to 30.8%, respectively, whereas it fluctuates from 11.7 to -29.0% and 8.3 to -20.8% under RCP8.5 for individual and large-scale farming, respectively. The projected total WF of rice production under RCP4.5 will decline, ranging from -10.0 to -43.0% and -0.5 to -67.0% for individual and large-scale farming, respectively. Conversely, the RCP8.5 shows a fluctuation in projected total WF of -26.5 to 63.3% and -51.1 to 60.0% for individual and large-scale farming, respectively. The total WF, mainly grey WF, in large-scale farming is lower than in individual farming. The increase of rice yield under RCP4.5 is due to an increment of temperature and precipitation, resulting in a decrease of the total WF and vice versa for RCP8.5. The large-scale farms are highlighted as adopting appropriate management practices for rice production in which they can maintain rice yield and reduce grey WF. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

To this end, the article uses Slovenia as a case study, assessing the extent to which Slovenian agricultural policy is responding to the challenges of climate change. All agricultural policy measures related to the 2007-2013 programming period were analysed according to a new methodological approach that is based on a qualitative (expert evaluation) and a quantitative (budgetary transfers validation) assessment. A panel of experts reached consensus on the key factors through which individual measures affect climate change, in which direction and how significantly. Data on budgetary funds for each measure were used as weights to assess their relative importance. The results show that there are not many measures in (Slovenian) agricultural policy that are directly aimed at reducing GHG emissions from agriculture or at adaptation to climate change. Nevertheless, most affect climate change, and their impact is far from negligible. Current measures have both positive and negative impacts, but overall the positive impacts prevail. Measures that involve many beneficiaries and more budgetary funds had the strongest impact on aggregate assessments. In light of climate change, agricultural policy should pay more attention to measures that are aimed at raising the efficiency of animal production, as it is the principal source of GHG emissions from agriculture.Policy relevanceAgricultural policy must respond to climate challenges and climate change impact assessment must be included in the process of forming European agricultural policy. Agricultural policy measures that contribute to the reduction of emissions and adaptation, whilst acting in synergy with other environmental, economic and social goals, should be promoted. The approach used in this study combines qualitative and quantitative data, yielding an objective assessment of the climate impact of agricultural policy measures and providing policy makers with a tool for either ex ante or ex post evaluations of climate-relevant policy measures.","[Erjavec, Emil; Rac, Ilona; Zgajnar, Jaka] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Anim Sci, Groblje 3, Domzale 1230, Slovenia; [Volk, Tina; Rednak, Miroslav; Zagorc, Barbara; Moljk, Ben] Agr Inst Slovenia, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana; Agricultural Institute Slovenia,"Rac, I (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Anim Sci, Groblje 3, Domzale 1230, Slovenia.",ilona.rac@bf.uni-lj.si,,"Rac, Ilona/0000-0003-4344-267X",Slovenian Research Agency [V4-0486],Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia),The research was supported by the Slovenian Research Agency in the framework of the Target research programme 'Slovenian Competitiveness 2006-2013' [grant number V4-0486].,,41,3,3,1,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

They provide a means for local and regional initiatives aimed at averting, mitigating, or adapting to climate change and other trans-boundary problems to join together in a system that: permits sharing of experiences, diffuses policy innovation across national borders, and spans divergent disciplinary boundaries so as to better communicate science to local decision-makers. We consider the role currently played by networks and the possibility that, over time, their soft power characteristics - a reliance on value change and policy emulation - may eventually place them in a position to globally coordinate local and regional environmental policy innovations. If successful, their efforts might supplant the need for national action to address climate change, even if they do not replace the nation-state system whose environmental management efforts will continue to rely on hard power: the use, primarily, of economic incentives to induce policy change. ICLEI provides technical consulting, training, and information services to build capacity, share knowledge, and support local government in the implementation of sustainable development at the local level. Our basic premise is that locally designed initiatives can provide an effective and cost-efficient way to achieve local, national, and global sustainability objectives. - International Council of Local Environmental Initiatives - website, 2010 When California passed its global warming law two years ago, we were out there on an island, so we started forming partnerships everywhere we could.

The most arid and least productive rangelands in the MDB region may be the most severely impacted by climate change, while the more productive eastern and northern grazing lands in the MDB may provide some opportunities for slight increases in production. In order to continue to thrive in the future, livestock industries need to anticipate these changes, prepare for uncertainty, and develop adaptation strategies now. While climate change will have direct effects on livestock, the dominant influences on grazing enterprises in the MDB will be through changes in plant growth and the timing, quantity and quality of forage availability. Climate change will involve a complex mix of responses to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, rising temperatures, changes in rainfall and other weather factors, and broader issues related to how people collectively and individually respond to these changes. Enhancing the ability of individuals to respond to a changing climate will occur through building adaptive capacity. We have, via secondary data, selected from the Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey, built a national composite index of generic adaptive capacity of rural households. This approach expresses adaptive capacity as an emergent property of the diverse forms of human, social, natural, physical and financial capital from which livelihoods are derived. Human capital was rated as 'high' across the majority of the MDB compared with the rest of Australia, while social, physical and financial capital were rated as 'moderate' to 'low'. The resultant measure of adaptive capacity, made up of the five capitals, was 'low' in the northern and central-west regions of the MDB and higher in the central and eastern parts possibly indicating a greater propensity to adapt to climate change in these regions.","[Crimp, S.

However, reported effects of CF, as applied by smallholders, on storage of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil fertility in Sub-Saharan Africa differ considerably between studies. This is partly due to differences in management practice, soil type and adoption level between individual farmers. Where CF involves planting basins, year-to-year changes in position of basins make SOC stock estimates more uncertain. Here we assess the difference in SOC build-up and soil quality between inside planting basins (receiving inputs of lime and fertilizer; basins opened each year) and outside planting basins (no soil disturbance or inputs other than residues) under hand-hoe tilled CF in an Acrisol at Mkushi, Zambia. Seven years of strict CF husbandry significantly improved soil quality inside planting basins as compared with outside basins. Significant effects were found for SOC concentration (0.74 +/- 0.06% vs. 0.57 +/- 0.08%), SOC stock (20.1 +/- 2.0 vs. 16.4 +/- 2.6 t ha(-1), 0-20 cm), soil pH (6.3 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.95 +/- 0.4) and cation exchange capacity (3.8 +/- 0.7 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.4 cmol(c) kg(-1)). As planting basins only occupy 9.3% of the field, the absolute rate of increase in SOC, compared with outside basins, was 0.05 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). This corresponds to an overall relative increase of 2.95% SOC yr(-1) in the upper 20 cm of the soil. Also, hot water extractable carbon (HWEC), a proxy for labile organic matter, and potential nitrification rates were consistently greater inside than outside basins. The significant increase in quantity and quality of SOC may be due to increased inputs of roots, due to favorable conditions for plant growth through input of fertilizer and lime, along with increased rainwater infiltration in the basins.

Climate projections predict more intense hurricanes; increased sea level rise; and more frequent and more intense natural disasters such as heat waves, heavy rainfall, and drought in the future (1; 2). The coast along the Gulf of Mexico is particularly vulnerable to many of these environmental hazards and at particular risk when several strike simultaneously-such as a hurricane disrupting electricity transmission during a heat wave. Due to its significant contribution to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the building sector already plays an important role in climate change mitigation efforts (e. g., reducing emissions). For example, voluntary programs such as the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Rating System (3), the Architecture 2030 Challenge (4), the American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment (5), and the Clinton Climate Initiative (6) focus almost exclusively on reducing energy consumption and increasing renewable energy generation. Mandatory regulations such as the International Energy Conservation Code (7), the International Green Building Code (8), and CalGreen (9) also emphasize GHG emission reduction targets. This leadership role is necessary. After all, the United States EPA estimates that the building sector accounts for 62.7% of total annual GHG emissions in the U. S., when the construction sector, facility operations, and transportation are factored in. In fact, the construction sector alone is the third largest industrial emitter of GHGs after the oil and gas and chemical industries, contributing 1.7% of total annual emissions (10; 11). As significant as these contributions appear, the built environment's true contribution to climate change is much larger than the GHG emissions attributed to building construction and operations. It is also a major determinant of which populations are vulnerable to climate change-related hazards, such as heat waves and flooding (12; 13). Architecture and land use planning can therefore be used as tools for building community resilience to the climate-related environmental changes underway (13). Climate change regulations and voluntary programs have begun to incorporate requirements targeting the built environment's ability to work in tandem with the natural environment to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect its occupants from the health consequences of a changing climate. For example, 11 states have incorporated climate change adaptation goals into their climate action plans (14). In 2010, the not-for-profit organization ICLEI: Local Governments for Sustainability launched a climate change adaptation program (15) to complement their existing mitigation program, which supports municipalities who have signed the U. S. Conference of Mayors' Climate Protection Agreement (16). New tools have been introduced to measure community vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. One of these tools, Health Impact Assessments (or HIAs), has emerged over the past decade as a powerful methodology to provide evidence-based recommendations to decision makers and community planning officials about the likely health co-benefits and co-harms associated with proposed policies and land use development proposals (17). While HIAs are becoming a more common feature of community planning efforts, this paper introduces them as an approach to designing climate change resilience into specific building projects. HIAs have been used in Europe and other parts of the world for decades to provide a science-based, balanced assessment of the risks and benefits to health associated with a proposed policy or program (18). In the U. S., they have been used over the past decade to evaluate transit-oriented developments, urban infill projects, and California's cap-and-trade legislation, among other topics (17; 19). To date, HIAs have been used mainly to inform large-scale community planning, land use, industrial, and policy decisions. However, the recommendations generated through the HIA process often bring to light previously unforeseen vulnerabilities, whether due to existing infrastructure, building technology, or socio-economic conditions. Designers can make use of the HIA process and its resulting recommendations to prioritize design/retrofit interventions that will result in the largest co-benefits to building owners, the surrounding community, and the environment. An HIA focused on the health impacts of climate change will likely generate recommendations that could enhance the longevity of a building project's useful life; protect its property value by contributing to the resilience of the surrounding community; and result in design decisions that prioritize strategies that maximize both short-term efficiencies and long-term environmental, economic, and social value.",,,,adeleh@biositu.com,,,,,,,25,8,8,6,173,COLL PUBL,GLEN ALLEN,"12309 LYNWOOD DR, GLEN ALLEN, VA 23059 USA",1552-6100,,,J GREEN BUILD,J.

These form the foundation of the community's ability to successfully respond to the challenges presented by climate change. The limited current adaptation strategies and methods not only neglect these values but also undermine and erode them.

We chose the Yiluo River Basin as the study area to investigate the response of NPP to climatic factors in the Yellow River's middle reaches. The temporal and spatial distribution of net primary productivity and the trend change of slope in the basin from 2000 to 2020 are analyzed. In addition, we analyzed the correlation between the NPP and climatic factors (precipitation and temperature) and the time-lag effect. The results show that 1) the annual average NPP in the basin is 556.4 gC/m(2)/a, the maximum value that occurred in 2019. Most of the NPP's mutation points in the basin's forest appeared in 2004, while the NPP's mutation points in arable land mostly appeared in 2008 and 2009. 2) The slope trend analysis result of NPP from 2000 to 2020 shows that the NPP in 67.88% of the basin shows a significant increasing trend, 3.8% of the basin shows a significant decrease, and the other area show no significant change. 3) The correlation analysis between NPP and climatic factors shows a positive correlation between precipitation and NPP in 62.3% of the basin and a positive correlation between air temperature and NPP in 62.5%. The response of NPP to precipitation and temperature in the basin has different degrees of a time-lag effect. The NPP has a time-lag effect on precipitation in 44.8% of the basin, and its mean lag time is 8 days. NPP has a time-lag effect on temperature in 55.7% of the basin, and its mean lag time is 1 day. This study is beneficial to understanding the influence of climatic factor change on vegetation activities in the Yiluo River Basin. Our study illustrates the significance of time lag in analyzing the relationship between NPP and climatic factors. Furthermore, it provides support for scientific vegetation regulation and allocation, as well as adaptation to climate change in areas similar to the Loess Plateau, based on the lag time distribution corresponding to different vegetation types in different regions of the Yiluo River Basin. After that, these areas' water resources will be fully utilized by vegetation, and ecological restoration could be accelerated.","[Tian, Zihao; Wang, Huiliang; Li, Yizhe; Yan, Sheng; Hou, Jun] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Hydraul Engn & Civil Engn, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China; [Tian, Zihao; Qin, Tianling; Li, Yizhe; Yan, Sheng; Hou, Jun; Li, Chenhao; Abebe, Sintayehu A.

However, evidence of TV-attributable years of life lost (YLL) is scarce. Objectives To investigate the associations between TV and YLL rates (/100,000 population), and quantify average life loss per death (LLD) caused by TV in China. Methods We calculated daily YLL rates (/100,000 population) of non-accidental causes and cardiorespiratory diseases by using death data from 364 counties of China during 2006-2017, and collected meteorological data during the same period. A distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) and multivariate meta-analysis were used to estimate the effects of TV at national or regional levels. Then, we calculated the LLD to quantify the mortality burden of TV. Results U-shaped curves were observed in the associations of YLL rates with TV in China. The minimum YLL TV (MYTV) was 2.5 degrees C nationwide. An average of 0.89 LLD was attributable to TV in total, most of which was from high TV (0.86, 95% CI: 0.56, 1.16). However, TV caused more LLD in the young (<65 years old) (1.87, 95% CI: 1.03, 2.71) than 65-74 years old (0.85, 95% CI: 0.40-1.31) and >= 75 years old (0.40, 95% CI: 0.21-0.59), cerebrovascular disease (0.74, 95% CI: 0.36, 1.11) than respiratory disease (0.54, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.87), South (1.23, 95% CI: 0.77, 1.68) than North (0.41, 95% CI: -0.7, 1.52) and Central China (0.40, 95% CI: -0.02, 0.81). TV-attributed LLD was modified by annual mean temperature, annual mean relative humidity, altitude, latitude, longitude, and education attainment. Significance Our findings indicate that high and low TVs are both associated with increases in premature death, however the majority of LLD was attributable to high TV. TV-related LLD was modified by county level characteristics. TV should be considered in planning adaptation to climate change or variability. Impact We estimated the associations of TV with YLL rates, and quantified the life loss per death (LLD) caused by TV. An average of 0.89 years of LLD were attributable to TV, most of which were from high TVs. TV caused more LLD in the young, cerebrovascular disease, and southern China. The mortality burdens were modified by county level characteristics.","[Gong, Weiwei] Zhejiang Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Hangzhou 310051, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Li, Xing; Hu, Jianxiong; Xiao, Jianpeng; Zeng, Weilin; He, Guanhao] Guangdong Prov Inst Publ Hlth, Guangdong Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Guangzhou 511430, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Maigeng] Natl Ctr Chron & Noncommunicable Dis Control & Pr, Beijing 100050, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Chunliang] Hunan Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Dept Environm & Hlth, Changsha 450001, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Yize] Yunnan Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Kunming 650022, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Huang, Biao] Jilin Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Changchun 130062, Peoples R China; [Lin, Lifeng] Guangdong Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Guangzhou 511430, Peoples R China; [Huang, Cunrui] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Guangzhou 510080, Peoples R China; [Liu, Tao; Ma, Wenjun] Jinan Univ, Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth & Prevent Med, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China; [Liu, Tao; Ma, Wenjun] Jinan Univ, Dis Control & Prevent Inst, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China; [Du, Qingfeng] Southern Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 7, Gen Practice Ctr, Foshan 528200, Peoples R China","Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention; Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control & Prevention; Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention; National Center for Chronic & Noncommunicable Disease Control & Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention; Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention; Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control & Prevention; Sun Yat Sen University; Jinan University; Jinan University; Southern Medical University - China","Liu, T (corresponding author), Jinan Univ, Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth & Prevent Med, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China.;Liu, T (corresponding author), Jinan Univ, Dis Control & Prevent Inst, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China.;Du, QF (corresponding author), Southern Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 7, Gen Practice Ctr, Foshan 528200, Peoples R China.",gztt_2002@163.com; dqf@vip.163.com,"Zhou, Maigeng/HCH-7703-2022; 马, 文军/GQQ-7852-2022; Xiao, Jianpeng/GRY-5231-2022; Du, Qing/HKN-6976-2023; Xiao, Jian/GYU-4351-2022",,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFA0606200]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42075173, 42175181]; Medical Scientific Research Foundation of Guangdong Province [A2020051]; Guangdong Health Innovation Platform; Foshan Key Technology Project [2020001000376]; Foshan Science and Technology Innovation Project [2020001005585]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Medical Scientific Research Foundation of Guangdong Province; Guangdong Health Innovation Platform; Foshan Key Technology Project; Foshan Science and Technology Innovation Project,"This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFA0606200), National Natural Science Foundation of China (42075173, 42175181), Medical Scientific Research Foundation of Guangdong Province (A2020051), the Guangdong Health Innovation Platform, the Foshan Key Technology Project for COVID-19 (2020001000376), and Foshan Science and Technology Innovation Project (2020001005585).",,46,0,0,10,17,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1559-0631,1559-064X,,J EXPO SCI ENV EPID,J.

Despite the commitment of the Paris Agreement, the integrate research on climate change risk combining risk-causing factors and risk-bearing bodies, the regional differences in climate impacts are still missing. In this paper we provide a quantitative assessment of hazards and socioeconomic risks of extreme events, risks of risk-bearing bodies in China under global warming of 1.5 and 2.0 degrees C based on future climate scenarios, and quantitative evaluation theory for climate change risk. For severe heat waves, hazards might significantly intensify. Affected population under 2.0 degrees C warming might increase by more than 60% compared to that of 1.5 degrees C. Hazards of severe droughts and floods might strengthen under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario. Economic losses might double between warming levels of 1.5 and 2.0 degrees C, and the population affected by severe floods might continuously increase. Under the integrate effects of multiple disasters, the regions with high population and economic risks would be concentrated in eastern China. The scope would gradually expand to the west with socioeconomic development and intensification of extreme events. High ecological risks might be concentrated in the southern regions of the Yangtze River Basin, while the ecological risk in northern China would expand. High agriculture yield risks might be distributed mainly in south of the North China Plain, the Sichuan Basin, south of the Yangtze River, and west of Northwest China, and the risk levels might continuously increase. Plain Language Summary. Based on the climate and socioeconomic scenario data from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Inter-comparison Project and International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, risks from climate change were identified under different warming levels, considering socioeconomic damage and ecosystem and food production losses. The relatively developed areas of eastern China exhibit high risks, and the risks show a westward and northward expansion trend. Socioeconomic damage, natural ecosystem, and food production losses would increase with socioeconomic development and intensification of global warming. We believe that a quantitative assessment of climate change risk should integrate climate-related hazards with the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems. These results can provide decision-making support for governments and a database for adapting to climate change.","[Wu, Shaohong; Liu, Lulu; Gao, Jiangbo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Shaohong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wentao] Minist Sci & Technol, Adm Ctr Chinas Agenda 21, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Wu, SH; Gao, JB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Wu, SH (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wush@igsnrr.ac.cn; gaojiangbo@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Liu, Lulu/AAV-3376-2020","Liu, Lulu/0000-0002-3086-2686","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1508801, 2018YFC1509002]; Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [41530749, 41671098]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19040304]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"This research was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant 2018YFC1509002), the Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 41530749 and 41671098), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant. 2018YFC1508801), and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant XDA19040304).

J,"Wheeler, S",,,,"Wheeler, Stephen M.",,,State and Municipal Climate Change Plans: The First Generation,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,climate change; global warming; state planning; municipal planning; sustainable development,,"Problem: Global warming has emerged as one of the new century's top planning challenges. But it is far from clear how state and local governments in the United States can best address climate change through planning. Purpose: As of 2008, 29 states had prepared some sort of climate change plan, and more than 170 local governments had joined the Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) campaign that requires that a plan be developed. This article analyzes this first generation of climate change plans and seeks to assess the goals being set, the measures included or left out, issues surrounding implementation, and the basic strengths and weaknesses of state and local climate change planning to date. Methods: I conducted this research by analyzing planning documents as well as interviewing state and local officials by telephone. I analyzed the plans of three types of governments: all states with planning documents on climate change; cities with populations of over 500,000 that are members of the CCP campaign; and selected smaller cities that are CCP members. Results and conclusions: Most plans set emissions-reduction goals, establish emission inventories, green public sector operations, and recommend a range of other measures. Many recent plans have been developed through extensive stakeholder processes and present very detailed lists of recommendations with quantified emissions benefits. But emissions-reduction goals vary widely, many proposed actions are voluntary, few resources have been allocated, and implementation of most measures has not yet taken place. Most plans do not address adaptation to a changing climate. Officials see rapidly growing public awareness of the issue and general support for climate change planning, but reluctance to change personal behavior. Takeaway for practice: Future climate change planning should (a) set goals that can adequately address the problem; (b) establish long-term planning frameworks in which progress toward these goals can be monitored on a regular basis and actions revised as needed; (c) include the full range of measures needed to reduce and adapt to climate change; (d) ensure implementation of recommended actions through commitment of resources, revised regulation, incentives for reducing emissions, and other means; and (e) develop strategies to deepen public awareness of the need for fundamental changes in behavior, for example regarding motor vehicle use.

However, due to the prolonged conflict between water availability and rice growth in spatial/temporal distribution, rice production suffers from seasonal drought at acreage of 16%-22%, which compromises food production capacity and food security. Focusing on the spatial distribution of seasonal drought with rice and the practices to adapt to it, and based on an analysis of balanced water supply for and demand by rice at a growing season scale during 1981-2030, this paper assesses the changing seasonal drought in the process of rice production under the changing climate in the future, and identifies general rice re-cultivation options for climate change adaptation. Some conclusions can be drawn as follows. (1) Rice suggests a decline in seasonal drought, with early season rice (early rice hereafter) by 12,500 km(2), middle season rice (middle rice) by 80,000 km(2), and in particular late season rice (late rice) by 25,000 km(2), which accounts for almost 20% of its cultivated acreage. It is indicated that due to climate change, seasonal drought in major rice producing areas tends to alleviate in general, late season rice in particular. (2) Future climate change brings about a significant impact on the spatial/temporal distribution of water resources in rice producing areas in China. Based on 'pre-designed' adaptation actions for rice-re-cultivation, the rice cultivation pattern undergoes a significant alteration between 1981-2000 and 2001-2030. In eastern Guizhou and western Hunan, the pattern of single early plus single dry farming is changed into double cropping. In eastern Hunan, the pattern of dry cropping is changed into single early plus single dry farming. In northern Anhui, the pattern of dry farming cropping is changed into middle rice. All this is aimed at a potential adequate availability of water for rice production in the future. (3) Rice re-cultivation patterns developed in this paper help re-balance water demand and supply for rice growth using the spatial analysis tool to adapt rice growth to the changing water availability from spatial perspective, and come up with rice producer-friendly re-cultivation options in response to climate change.","[Ma Xin; Li Yu'e; Gao Qingzhu; Wu Yang] CAAS, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wu Shaohong; Zhang Xueyan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Environment & Sustainable Development in Agriculture, CAAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Wu, SH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",max@ami.ac.cn; Wush@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,National Key Technology Research & Development Program [2012BAC19B01],National Key Technology Research & Development Program,"Foundation: National Key Technology Research & Development Program, No.2012BAC19B01",,47,12,12,11,61,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1009-637X,1861-9568,,J GEOGR SCI,J.

However, the planning method of LCET for rapidly growing cities deserves further study because it involves dynamicity and interactions of multiple factors. This paper aims to put forward a comprehensive methodology to fill that gap. First, a theoretical framework of energy system-sustainability-governance-operation of rapidly growing cities is put forward to explain the general mechanism of LCET. Second, a three step method is built for LCET planning, including energy system analysis based on low emissions analysis platform modeling, operation analysis applying multilevel perspective and stakeholder theories, and governance evaluation by policy review. To verify this method, a city in Western China, Chengdu, was selected as the case study. The results show that Chengdu's energy related CO2 emissions are expected to peak in 2025 under timely and aggressive measures. The main obstacles lie in three aspects: techno-economic insufficiencies, lack of social cognition, and problems of institution and policy. To realize this scenario, Chengdu must incorporate the target and pathway of a carbon peak as soon as possible into its policy system and enhance the coordination among governmental departments.","[Xiao, Yayu; Yang, Honghua; Zhao, Yunlong; Kong, Geng; Ma, Linwei; Li, Zheng; Ni, Weidou] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Energy & Power Engn, Tsinghua BP Clean Energy Res & Educ Ctr, State Key Lab Power Syst, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Yayu; Yang, Honghua; Zhao, Yunlong; Kong, Geng; Ma, Linwei] Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Rio Tinto Joint Res Ctr Resources, Lab Low Carbon Energy, Energy & Sustainable Dev, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University,"Ma, LW (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Energy & Power Engn, Tsinghua BP Clean Energy Res & Educ Ctr, State Key Lab Power Syst, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Ma, LW (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Rio Tinto Joint Res Ctr Resources, Lab Low Carbon Energy, Energy & Sustainable Dev, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",xyy20@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; yhh18@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; yl-zhao17@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; kg21210003@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn; malinwei@tsinghua.edu.cn; lz-dte@tsinghua.edu.cn; niwd@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Ma, Linwei/E-9140-2011; Li, Zheng/E-7840-2011","Ma, Linwei/0000-0002-9090-0488; Li, Zheng/0000-0002-1518-5605; Yang, Honghua/0000-0001-7535-3343","State Key Laboratory of Power Systems in Tsinghua University [SKLD17Z02, SKLD21M14]; Tsinghua-Rio Tinto Joint Research Centre for Resources, Energy and Sustainable Development","State Key Laboratory of Power Systems in Tsinghua University; Tsinghua-Rio Tinto Joint Research Centre for Resources, Energy and Sustainable Development","This research was supported by the State Key Laboratory of Power Systems in Tsinghua University (Project No. SKLD17Z02 and Project No. SKLD21M14).

Two approaches are commonly used to formulate adaptation measures, namely bottom-up and top-down, each with inherited limitations. A sound bridge between both approaches is low-regret adaptive measures, which result in win-win scenarios, as they provide solutions to current pressures and contribute to building CC adaptive capacity. Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is a term that includes a series of techniques that enhance groundwater storage for later use or environmental purposes. MAR is often mentioned in the literature as a CC adaptation measure. Nonetheless, few examples explicitly prove this point. We show through the Los Arenales MAR systems (Central Spain) that MAR is a low-regret CC adaptive measure. We evaluate a series of social and environmental challenges that MAR systems contribute to solving, as well as their attributes that diminish the expected impacts of CC in the study area. MAR in the Los Arenales groundwater body has resulted in an overall increase in groundwater levels; a reduction in groundwater pumping energy and costs and CO2 emissions; restoration of a surface water body; improvement in rural population indexes; and enhanced groundwater demand control and CC adaptive capacity through irrigation communities. To cope with CC, the Los Arenales MAR systems can be operated even if decreasing streamflow precludes the use of river water surpluses; they provide surface storage volume to mitigate flooding; and they decrease the impacts of droughts and water scarcity. This research proves that MAR is a water management tool capable of providing solutions to several pressures simultaneously in the present and future, an attribute particularly useful when dealing with adaptation gaps in developing countries, rural areas, or regions lacking long-term climatic data.","[Henao Casas, Jose David; Escalante, Enrique Fernandez; Gil, Rodrigo Calero] Tragsa, Dept Integrated Water Resources Management, Madrid 28006, Spain; [Henao Casas, Jose David; Ayuga, Francisco] Univ Politecn Madrid, Sch Agr Food & Biosyst Engn, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Casas, JDH (corresponding author), Tragsa, Dept Integrated Water Resources Management, Madrid 28006, Spain.;Casas, JDH; Ayuga, F (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Sch Agr Food & Biosyst Engn, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",jd.henao@alumnos.upm.es; francisco.ayuga@upm.es,"Ayuga, Francisco/A-3837-2009","Ayuga, Francisco/0000-0002-1320-4534; Henao Casas, Jose David/0000-0003-4812-1437",European Union [814066],European Union(European Commission),The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under The Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 814066 (Managed Aquifer Recharge Solutions Training Network-MARSoluT) (https://www.marsolut-itn.eu/(accessed on 10 November 2022)).,,115,0,0,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2022,14,22,,,,,,,3703,10.3390/w14223703,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14223703,,,22,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,6K7YX,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000887713600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nature Based Solutions are increasingly recognised as a natural insurance against flood risks in vulnerable areas. This requires collaboration at landscape scale between providers and beneficiaries of flood control. In particular, mechanisms to incentivise owners of land could potentially offer cost-effective ways to reduce damage to urban infrastructure. We conduct a choice experiment among farmers located in the vicinity of a river to assess their willingness to accept a contract that would allow a local Danish municipality to periodically flood farmland to reduce urban flood risks. Results indicate that farmers on average are hesitant about entering into abatement contracts, especially if they have prior experience of crop losses due to extreme weather events. If they were to agree on a contract they would prefer a separate compensation for lost crops; a collective negotiation and higher rather than lower yearly payments. Surprisingly, data did not show a significant preference for or against a requirement to grow flood resistant crops. The results suggest that a contract with a separate damage compensation and based on individual negotiation would on average require an annual payment of 290Euro/ha for farmers with no prior experience of crop losses and 469Euro/ha for farmers who have experienced crop losses. The paper discusses the potentials and limitations of landscape scale Nature Based Solutions for climate adaptation.","[Zandersen, Marianne; Pedersen, Anders Branth; Nielsen, Helle Orsted] Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Aarhus, Denmark; [Zandersen, Marianne; Pedersen, Anders Branth; Nielsen, Helle Orsted] Aarhus Univ, iClimate, Interdisciplinary Ctr Climat, Aarhus, Denmark; [Oddershede, Jakob Stoktoft] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Aarhus, Denmark; [Termansen, Mette] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark",Aarhus University; Aarhus University; Aarhus University; University of Copenhagen,"Zandersen, M (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Aarhus, Denmark.;Zandersen, M (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, iClimate, Interdisciplinary Ctr Climat, Aarhus, Denmark.",mz@envs.au.dk; jakoboddershede@gmail.com; abp@envs.au.dk; hon@envs.au.dk; mt@ifro.ku.dk,,"Pedersen, Anders Branth/0000-0002-4163-5649; Termansen, Mette/0000-0003-4875-2810; Nielsen, Helle Orsted/0000-0003-0486-9662",EU FP7-project BASE [308337]; EFFECT-project [817903]; North Sea Region Programme,EU FP7-project BASE; EFFECT-project; North Sea Region Programme,"This work was supported by EU FP7-project BASE (Grant Agreement No. 308337).

This study is designed to evaluate and enhance the watershed modeling approach currently used to characterize the impacts of climate change on hydrologic and water quality responses while considering a paddy environment. APEX-paddy, which is a newly developed and modified APEX (Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender) model for paddy ecosystems, was coupled with SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model to take advantage of the strengths of the two models. The resulting hybrid model, SWAPX, was calibrated and validated using observed data from 2008 to 2017 for two sites in the study watershed. Compared to SWAT, the accuracy of SWAPX was improved, showing statistically better results in the downstream including more paddy field areas. Ten GCMs were selected, and the characteristics of these GCMs were evaluated to assess the impacts of climate change scenarios. When applying the climate change scenarios to the SWAPX model, the results indicated that the future streamflow would increase due to increased rainfall. The results also showed that total nitrogen (T-N) loads would increase rapidly in the near future, then decrease gradually through the 2090s (2091-2100). T-N load was affected by the characteristics of rainfall patterns (e.g., daily maximum rainfall and rainfall intensity) occurring in various GCMs. This approach will be helpful for decision-makers in adapting to climate change and evaluating Best management practices (BMP) for paddy-dominant watersheds.","[Kim, Dong-Hyeon; Jang, Taeil] Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Rural Construct Engn, Jeonju Si 54896, Jeonbuk, South Korea; [Jang, Taeil] Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Inst Agr Sci & Technol, Jeonju Si 54896, Jeonbuk, South Korea; [Hwang, Syewoon] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Inst Agr & Life Sci, Dept Agr Engn, Jinju Si 52828, Gyeongnam, South Korea",Jeonbuk National University; Jeonbuk National University; Gyeongsang National University,"Jang, T (corresponding author), Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Rural Construct Engn, Jeonju Si 54896, Jeonbuk, South Korea.;Jang, T (corresponding author), Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Inst Agr Sci & Technol, Jeonju Si 54896, Jeonbuk, South Korea.",tjang@jbnu.ac.kr,,,"Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea [PJ01279901]","Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea(Rural Development Administration (RDA), Republic of Korea)","This research was supported by the research program (Grant Number: PJ01279901) funded by the Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea.",,48,10,11,7,31,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1611-2490,1611-2504,,PADDY WATER ENVIRON,Paddy Water Environ.,JUL,2020,18,3,,,,,515,529,,10.1007/s10333-020-00798-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-020-00798-4,,APR 2020,15,Agricultural Engineering; Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,LV2DJ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000528820400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei megacity region, which is characterized by significant geomorphic gradients, was chosen as the case study area. The ordinary least squares (OLS) method was used to calculate the NDVI trends and related factors from 2000 to 2015. A geographic weighted regression (GWR) model of NDVI trends was constructed using 14 elements of seven categories. Combined with the GWR calculation results, the mechanisms of the effects of explanatory variables on NDVI changes were analyzed. The findings suggest that the overall vegetation displayed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2015, with an NDVI increase of ca. 0.005/year. Additionally, the NDVI fluctuations in individual years were closely related to precipitation and temperature anomalies. The spatial pattern of the NDVI change was highly consistent with the gradients of geomorphology, climate, and human activities, which have a tendency to gradually change from northwest to southeast. The dominant climate-driven area accounted for only 5.98% of the total study area. The vegetation improvement areas were regionally concentrated and had various driving factors, and vegetation degradation exhibited strong spatial heterogeneity. The vegetation degradation was mainly caused by human activities. Natural vegetation was improved because of natural factors and reductions in human activities. Moreover, cropland vegetation as well as urban and built-up area improvements were related to increased human actions and decreased natural effects. This study can assist in ecological restoration planning and ecological engineering implementation in the study area.","[Zhao, Yinbing; Sun, Ranhao] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yinbing; Ni, Zhongyun] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Tourism & Urban Rural Planning, Chengdu 610059, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Ni, Zhongyun] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Resource Environm & Tourism, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES); Chengdu University of Technology; Capital Normal University,"Sun, RH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.",zhaoyinbing06@cdut.cn; rhsun@rcees.ac.cn; nizhongyun2012@cdut.cn,"sun, ranhao/AAM-6837-2021","sun, ranhao/0000-0003-2396-5131",National Key Research & Development Plan project [2016YFC0503001]; Beijing Postdoctoral Fund [2018-ZZ-096]; Capital Normal of University [011185404207]; Young and Middle-aged Teacher Program of Chengdu University of Technology [2019JXGG01213],National Key Research & Development Plan project; Beijing Postdoctoral Fund; Capital Normal of University; Young and Middle-aged Teacher Program of Chengdu University of Technology,"The National Key Research & Development Plan project (2016YFC0503001), the Beijing Postdoctoral Fund (No. 2018-ZZ-096), the Capital Normal of University (No. 011185404207), and the Young and Middle-aged Teacher Program of Chengdu University of Technology (2019JXGG01213) supported this work.",,77,12,13,9,60,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,MAY 2,2019,11,10,,,,,,,1224,10.3390/rs11101224,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11101224,,,21,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,IQ1QG,,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000480524800082,View Full Record in Web of Science

Integrated farming systems (IFS) comprising of many agri-innovations have the potential to meet such requirements. An association of individual and interdependent components of farming on a given piece of land, taking cognizance of available natural resources and the differential requirement of a wide range of farming community, remains the guiding principle of IFS. Research conducted across arid and semi-arid regions is reviewed here in order to understand the role of IFS in enhancing production, income and livelihood; minimizing risk associated with farming in arid and drier semi-arid regions; utilizing and conserving the resources; and in enhancing mitigation and adaptation to climate change. It has been conclusively established that IFS involving integration of different enterprises (crop, livestock, horticulture, forestry, poultry and fish) enhanced productivity, profitability, resource use efficiency, generated more employment and minimized resources degradation and risks. IFS, therefore, could be a key form of farming intensification needed for achieving future food security and environmental sustainability in arid and semi-arid regions. Promoting adoption of the location-specific IFS in future is linked directly with coherent policy, institutional commitment, infrastructure development, better coordination among different agricultural and rural development programme and agencies, and a stimulus package of incentives. The relevance of IFS in adaptation to and mitigation of climate change is also discussed.","[Rathore, V. S.; Yadav, O.

Over 50% of Ugandan families live in single-roomed overcrowded properties and over 60% of the country's urban population live in slums. Moreover, the gradual shift towards relatively modern and low thermal resistance building materials, in addition to imminent thermal discomfort due to global warming, may considerably affect the health and wellbeing of low-income people, the majority of whom live in low quality homes with very little or no access to basic amenities. This paper evaluates the effects of various construction methods as well as refurbishment strategies on thermal comfort in low-income houses in Uganda. It is aimed at helping low-income populations adapt to climate changes by developing simple, effective and affordable refurbishment strategies that could easily be applied to existing buildings. Dynamic thermal simulations are conducted in EnergyPlus. The adaptive model defined in BS EN 15251 and CIBSE TM52 is used to evaluate the risk and extent of thermal discomfort. Roofing methods/materials are found to be the key factor in reducing/increasing the risk of overheating. According to the results, roof insulation, painting the roof with low solar absorptance materials and inclusion of false ceilings are, respectively, the most effective and practical refurbishment strategies in terms of improving thermal comfort in low-income houses in Uganda. All refurbishment strategies helped to pass Criterion 3 of CIBSE TM52, as an indicator of future climate scenarios, making low-income houses/populations more climate resilient.","[Hashemi, Arman] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England; [Hashemi, Arman] Univ Brighton, Sch Environm & Technol, Brighton BN2 4GJ, E Sussex, England",University of Cambridge; University of Brighton,"Hashemi, A (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England.;Hashemi, A (corresponding author), Univ Brighton, Sch Environm & Technol, Brighton BN2 4GJ, E Sussex, England.",a.hashemi@eng.cam.ac.uk,,"Hashemi, Arman/0000-0002-6311-000X",UK aid from the UK Department for International Development (DFID); Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC); Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC); EPSRC [EP/L002604/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L002604/1] Funding Source: researchfish,UK aid from the UK Department for International Development (DFID); Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This document is an output from a research project Energy and Low-Income Tropical Housing co-funded by UK aid from the UK Department for International Development (DFID), the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) and the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC), for the benefit of developing countries.

However, emphasis on the science of climate change has overshadowed studies focusing on human interpretations of climate history, of adaptation and resilience, and of explorations of the institutions and cultural coping strategies that may have helped people adapt to climate changes in the past. Moreover, although the idea of climate change has been subject to considerable scrutiny by the physical sciences, recent climate scholarship has highlighted the need for a re-examination of the cultural and spatial dimensions of climate, with contributions from the humanities and social sciences. Establishing a multidisciplinary dialogue and approach to climate research past, present, and future has arguably never been more important. This article outlines developments in historical climatology research and considers examples of integrated multidisciplinary approaches to climate, climatic variability, and climate change research, conducted across the physical sciences, social sciences, humanities, and the arts. We highlight the international Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth (ACRE) initiative as one example of such an integrated approach. Initially, ACRE began as a response from climate science to the needs of the agricultural sector in Queensland, Australia for a longer, more spatially, and temporally-complete database of the weather. ACRE has now evolved to embrace an international group of researchers working together across disciplines to integrate their efforts into a four-dimensional (4D) dynamical global historical climate-quality reanalysis (reconstruction).

The framework builds on two common and seemingly paradoxical narratives about people in remote regions. The first is recognition that people in remote regions demonstrate significant resilience to climate and resource variability, and may therefore be among the best equipped to adapt to climate change. The second narrative is that many people in remote regions are chronically disadvantaged and therefore are among the most vulnerable to climate change impacts. These narratives, taken in isolation and in extremis, can have significant maladaptive policy and practice implications. From a systems perspective, both narratives may be valid, because they form elements of latent and dominant feedback loops that require articulation for a nuanced understanding of vulnerability-reducing and resilience-building responses in a joint framework. Through literature review and community engagement across three remote regions on different continents, we test the potential of the framework to assist dialogue about adaptation pathways in remote marginalized communities. In an adaptation pathway view, short-term responses to vulnerability can risk locking in a pathway that increases specific resilience but creates greater vulnerability in the long-term. Equally, longer-term actions towards increasing desirable forms of resilience need to take account of short-term realities to respond to acute and multiple needs of marginalized remote communities. The framework was useful in uniting vulnerability and resilience narratives, and broadening the scope for adaptation policy and action on adaptation pathways for remote regions.

High costs and limited opportunities for increasing water supplies with dams, reservoirs, and other infrastructure have curbed the traditional supply-side approach to planning in recent decades. Although new infrastructure may be an appropriate response to climate-induced shifts in hydrologic regimes and water demands, it is difficult to plan for and justify expensive new projects when the magnitude, timing, and even the direction of the changes are unknown. On the other hand, evaluating margins of safety for long-lived structures such as dams and levees should consider the prospect that a greenhouse warming could produce greater hydrologic variability and storm extremes. Integrated river basin management can provide cost-effective increases in reliable supplies in the event of greenhouse warming. With water becoming scarcer and susceptible to variations and changes in the climate, demand management is critical for balancing future demands with supplies. Although regulatory and voluntary measures belong in a comprehensive demand management strategy, greater reliance on markets and prices to allocate supplies and introduce incentives to conserve will help reduce the costs of adapting to climate change.

The study also investigated the impact of the 2009/10 floods on the livelihoods of the people of Etsha-13 Village. The Quality of Life Approach was operationalized, with specific focus on vulnerability and resilience to flood impacts. The study design chose purposive sampling method to select the 21 In-Depth Interviews and 3 Focus Group Discussions. The qualitative data analysis software was used for analysis. The results show that the majority of the respondents perceived local communities highly vulnerable to floods and recurring droughts. The processes post 2009/10 Etsha 13 Village flood-hazards coupled with the people's state of high vulnerability and less resilient impacted on their quality of life particularly the being, belonging and becoming components. The provision of relief to the flood victims was perceived as biased towards those known to officers providing relief. The effectiveness of the relief operations were considered inadequate. The extent of damage caused by floods is influenced by the socioeconomic factors and psycho-social challenges the affected people had prior to the natural hazard event. The majority of the victims reported that they did not recover from the flood impacts. The IKS are still important in the sustenance of the livelihoods of the local communities. To reduce risks and future catastrophes there is need for a thorough implementation of the risk reduction strategy.","[Dintwa, Kakanyo Fani] Stat Botswana, Environm Stat Unit, Gaborone, Botswana; [Letamo, Gobopamang; Navaneetham, Kannan] Univ Botswana, Dept Populat Studies, Gaborone, Botswana",University of Botswana,"Dintwa, KF (corresponding author), Stat Botswana, Environm Stat Unit, Gaborone, Botswana.",kfdintwa@statsbots.org.bw; Letamog@ub.ac.bw; Navaneethamk@ub.ac.bw,"Navaneetham, Kannan/K-6390-2014; Letamo, Gobopamang/HMP-0560-2023","Navaneetham, Kannan/0000-0002-5847-4669; ",Office of Research and Development of the University of Botswana,Office of Research and Development of the University of Botswana,This research received funding from the Office of Research and Development of the University of Botswana.,,81,0,0,3,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

Its value in climate change adaptation is widely accepted in developing countries because it can enable access to local knowledge and resources. Women in coastal Bangladesh are subject to exclusion from access to natural resources and are frequently unable to connect with outsiders because of socio-cultural and religious barriers leading to a lack of opportunity for interaction with linking actors. To explore changes in linking social capital for adaptation among women in the post-cyclone Aila-2009 context, a mixed method approach was employed in the villages of Gabura Union (Bangladesh). We argue that the social disruption caused by Aila allowed women to form links with nongovernment organizations (NGOs), contributing to local adaptive responses (e.g. in agricultural innovation and household handicrafts production). Our observations suggest that of the three commonly identified forms of social capital (i.e. bonding, bridging and linking), bonding relationships within the family appeared to become weaker after a major disaster, which may be attributed to the disruption of reciprocal kinship ties and greater mobility of male family members to search for new economic opportunities in cities. Over time, linking relationships with NGOs contributed to strengthening bonding and bridging among women through establishment of social networks for knowledge sharing and production. These altered relationships and enhancement of linking social capital have produced new adaptation strategies that persisted beyond the immediate post-cyclone recovery period.","[Khalil, Momtaj Bintay; Jacobs, Brent C.] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Khalil, Momtaj Bintay] Khulna Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Khulna, Bangladesh; [McKenna, Kylie] Divine Word Univ, Postgrad & Res Ctr, Ctr Social Res, Madang, Papua N Guinea",University of Technology Sydney; Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET),"Khalil, MB (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",momtaj.b.khalil@student.uts.edu.au; Brent.Jacobs@uts.edu.au; kmckenna@dwu.ac.pg,,"Khalil, Momtaj Bintay/0000-0003-4286-140X",,,,,108,7,7,2,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

We sought to understand the drivers of socioeconomic disparities in heat-related vulnerability in New York City (NYC), the perceived risk of heat exposure and climate change, and barriers to protective behaviors. A random digit dial telephone survey of 801 NYC adults aged 18 and older was conducted from 22 September-1 October, 2015. Thirteen percent of the population did not possess an air conditioner (AC), and another 15% used AC never/infrequently. In adjusted models, odds of not possessing AC were greater for non-Hispanic blacks compared with other races/ethnicities, odds ratio (OR) = 2.0 (95% CI: 1.1, 3.5), and for those with low annual household income, OR = 3.1 (95% CI: 1.8, 5.5). Only 12% reported going to a public place with AC if they could not keep cool at home. While low-income individuals were less likely to be aware of heat warnings, they were more likely to be concerned that heat could make them ill and that climate change would affect their health than participants with a higher household income, OR = 1.6 (95% CI: 1.0, 2.3). In NYC, lack of access to AC partially explains disparities in heat-related health outcomes. Our results point to opportunities for knowledge building and engagement on heat-health awareness and climate change adaptation that can be applied in NYC and other metropolitan areas to improve and target public health prevention efforts.","[Madrigano, Jaime] RAND Corp, 1200 South Hayes St, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [Lane, Kathryn; Ahmed, Munerah] New York City Dept Hlth & Mental Hyg, Bur Environm Surveillance & Policy, New York, NY 10013 USA; [Petrovic, Nada] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, 2910 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Blum, Micheline] Baruch Coll Survey Res, Marxe Sch Publ & Int Affairs, One Bernard Baruch Way, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Matte, Thomas] Vital Strategies, 61 Broadway, New York, NY 10006 USA",RAND Corporation; New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene; Columbia University,"Madrigano, J (corresponding author), RAND Corp, 1200 South Hayes St, Arlington, VA 22202 USA.",jmadriga@rand.org; klanel@health.nyc.gov; nada.petrovic@gmail.com; mahmed4@health.nyc.gov; micheline.blum@baruch.cuny.edu; tmatte@vitalstrategies.org,,,"Cross-Cutting Initiative at the Earth Institute, Columbia University; City of New York tax levy funds; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [5 NUE1EH001325-02]","Cross-Cutting Initiative at the Earth Institute, Columbia University; City of New York tax levy funds; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA)","This research was supported by a grant from The Cross-Cutting Initiative at the Earth Institute, Columbia University; by the City of New York tax levy funds; and by the Cooperative Agreement Number 5 NUE1EH001325-02, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Two types of General Circulation Models (HadCM3 and IPCM4) and three scenarios (A1B, A2 and B1) were employed. Daily climatic parameters were generated by Long Ashton Research Station-Weather Generator (LARS - WG). The SUBSTOR-Potato model was used to simulate the baseline and future potato growth and development. Results indicated that LARS-WG and SUBSTOR-Potato had an appropriate accuracy to simulate climatic and growth parameters of potato. Simulated results showed that the maximum leaf area index (LAI), days to tuber initiation (DTTI), days to harvest (DTH) and fresh tuber yield of evaluated variety will be declined as affected by future climate change. Based on the simulation results, delayed planting date (31 May) would increase tuber yield under future climatic conditions. In the contrary, early planting (30 April) would accelerate harmful effects of climate change on potato yield. The medium and early maturing varieties showed a better tuber yield under climate change conditions than commori (delayed maturing) variety. In essence, early maturing variety and delayed planting date are reported as the most efficient agronomical approaches for mitigating harmful effects of climate change and proposed to be considered in designing and managing potato ecosystems of the region for future climatic conditions. Generally, our results highlight the importance of considering early maturing variety and delayed planting date as the efficient agronomical approaches for mitigating harmful effects of climate change on potato production.","[Adavi, Zohrab; Saeidnejad, Amir Hossein] Payame Noor Univ, Dept Agr, Tehran, Iran; [Moradi, Rooholla] Shahid Bahonar Univ Kerman, Agr Fac Bardsir, Dept Plant Prod, Kerman, Iran; [Tadayon, Mahmoud Reza] Shahrekord Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agron, Shahrekord, Iran; [Mansouri, Hamed] AREEO, Hamedan Agr & Nat Resources Res & Educ Ctr, Sugar Beet Res Dept, Hamadan, Iran",Payame Noor University; Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman (SBUK); Shahrekord University,"Moradi, R (corresponding author), Shahid Bahonar Univ Kerman, Agr Fac Bardsir, Dept Plant Prod, Kerman, Iran.",r.moradi@uk.ac.ir,"Moradi, Rooholla/AAV-7727-2021; Saeidnejad, Amir Hossein/AAE-5744-2022; Adavi, Zohrab/GLR-6791-2022; Tadayon, Mahmoud Reza/AAZ-4990-2021; Mansouri, Hamed/C-6151-2017","Tadayon, Mahmoud Reza/0000-0002-7443-2207; Mansouri, Hamed/0000-0002-3089-387X; Saeidnejad, Amir Hossein/0000-0002-5130-9919; Moradi, Rooholla/0000-0001-8754-8025",,,,,60,17,18,0,66,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-4238,1879-1018,,SCI HORTIC-AMSTERDAM,Sci.

In response to these changes, studies concerning indigenous knowledge (IK) and climate change vulnerability, resiliency, and adaptation have increased dramatically in recent years. Risks to lives and livelihoods are often the focus of adaptation research; however, the cultural dimensions of climate change are equally important because cultural dimensions inform perceptions of risk. Furthermore, many Arctic and Subarctic IK climate change studies document observations of change and knowledge of the elders and older generations in a community, but few include the perspectives of the younger population. These observations by elders and older generations form a historical baseline record of weather and climate observations in these regions. However, many indigenous Arctic and Subarctic communities are composed of primarily younger residents. We focused on the differences in the cultural dimensions of climate change found between young adults and elders. We outlined the findings from interviews conducted in four indigenous communities in Subarctic Alaska. The findings revealed that (1) intergenerational observations of change were common among interview participants in all four communities, (2) older generations observed more overall change than younger generations interviewed by us, and (3) how change was perceived varied between generations. We defined observations as the specific examples of environmental and weather change that were described, whereas perceptions referred to the manner in which these observations of change were understood and contextualized by the interview participants. Understanding the differences in generational observations and perceptions of change are key issues in the development of climate change adaptation strategies.","[Herman-Mercer, Nicole M.; Schuster, Paul F.] US Geol Survey, Natl Res Program, Richmond, VA 23228 USA; [Matkin, Elli] Univ Montana, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Laituri, Melinda J.] Colorado State Univ, Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Laituri, Melinda J.] Colorado State Univ, Geospatial Centroid, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Toohey, Ryan C.] US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Richmond, VA 23228 USA; [Toohey, Ryan C.] Alaska Climate Sci Ctr, Anchorage, AK USA; [Massey, Maggie; Mutter, Edda A.] Yukon River Intertribal Watershed Council, Sci Dept, Anchorage, AK USA; [Elder, Kelly] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Washington, DC USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Montana System; University of Montana; Colorado State University; Colorado State University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Herman-Mercer, NM (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Natl Res Program, Richmond, VA 23228 USA.",,"Schuster, Paul/V-5965-2019","Schuster, Paul/0000-0002-8314-1372; Mutter, Edda/0000-0002-1681-8080; Toohey, Ryan/0000-0001-8248-5045",National Science Foundation [1118397]; USGS Water and Climate; Land Use Change Mission areas,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); USGS Water and Climate; Land Use Change Mission areas,"The authors would like to acknowledge the community members that participated in this study and thank them for taking time out of their busy lives to share their knowledge and experiences with us.

In this article, we examine the role of community opinion leaders in developing and mobilising stocks of adaptive capacity. In so doing, we reveal a largely unexplored mechanism for building on latent social capital and associated networks that have the potential to transcend local-scale efforts - an enduring question in climate change adaptation and other cross-scalar sustainability issues. Participants drawn from diverse spheres of community activity in the Sunshine Coast, Australia, were interviewed about their strategies for influencing their community objectives and the degree to which they have engaged with responding to climate change. The results show community opinion leaders to be politically engaged through rich bridging connections with other community organisations, and vertically with policy-makers at local, state, national and international levels. Despite this latent potential, the majority of community opinion leaders interviewed were not strategically engaged with responding to climate change. This finding suggests that more work is needed to connect networks knowledgeable about projected climate change impacts with local networks of community opinion leaders. Attention to the type of community-based strategies considered effective and appropriate by community opinion leaders and their organisations also suggests avenues for policy-makers to facilitate community engagement in responding to climate change across sectors likely to be affected by its impacts. Opportunities to extend understanding of adaptive capacity within the community sector through further research are also suggested.","[Keys, Noni; Thomsen, Dana C.; Smith, Timothy F.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Maroochydore, Qld, Australia",University of the Sunshine Coast,"Keys, N (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Maroochydore, Qld, Australia.",nkeys@usc.edu.au,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Smith, Timothy/0000-0002-3991-5211",,,,,83,17,17,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2016,21,4,,,,,432,450,,10.1080/13549839.2014.967758,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2014.967758,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,DP0GX,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000378168500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design: The paper brings together evidence from a 3-year, Australia-based mixed-methods research project focused on climate change adaptation, cities, food systems and health. In an integrated analysis of the three research domains encompassing the production, distribution and consumption sectors of the food chain - the paper examines the efficacy of various food subsystems (industrial, alternative commercial and civic) in achieving climate resilience and good nutrition. Setting: Greater Western Sydney, Australia. Subjects: Primary producers, retailers and consumers in Western Sydney. Results: This overarching analysis of the tripartite study found that: (i) industrial food production systems can be more environmentally sustainable than alternative systems, indicating the importance of multiple food subsystems for food security; (ii) a variety of food distributors stocking healthy and sustainable items is required to ensure that these items are accessible, affordable and available to all; and (iii) it is not enough that healthy and sustainable foods are produced or sold, consumers must also want to consume them. In summary, a resilient urban food system requires that healthy and sustainable food items are produced, that consumers can attain them and that they actually wish to purchase them. Conclusions: This capstone paper found that the interconnected nature of the different sectors in the food system means that to improve environmental sustainability, equity and population health outcomes, action should focus on the system as a whole and not just on any one sector.","[James, Sarah W.; Friel, Sharon] Australian Natl Univ, Regulatory Inst Network, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"Friel, S (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Regulatory Inst Network, Fellows Rd 8, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",Sharon.Friel@anu.edu.au,,"Friel, Sharon/0000-0002-8345-5435; james, sarah/0000-0002-6042-7001",Climate and Health Cluster; CSIRO Flagship Collaboration Fund,Climate and Health Cluster; CSIRO Flagship Collaboration Fund(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),"This research received support from the Climate and Health Cluster which is funded by the CSIRO Flagship Collaboration Fund.

Dynamical downscaling of GCM outputs better resolves regional climate and thus provides improved guidance for climate policy at regional scales. Being expensive to run, downscaling uses a subset of GCMs, necessitating careful GCM selection. This evaluation identifies a suitable subset of CMIP6 GCMs for downscaling over Australia by assessing individual GCMs against three criteria: (a) performance simulating daily climate variable distributions, climate means, extremes, and modes; (b) model independence; and (c) climate change signal diversity. Over Australia, GCMs are generally biased cold (warm) for maximum (minimum) temperature, with larger biases for minimum temperature. GCMs are generally wet biased, especially over the monsoonal north, but dry biased over eastern regions. Most GCMs show larger biases for temperature and precipitation over geographically complex, heavily populated eastern regions, relative to other regions. Evaluations identify a distinct group of 11 GCMs that perform consistently poorly across climate variables, statistics, and timescales with widespread, statistically significant biases, versus 13 GCMs that show consistent adequate-to-good performance with substantially reduced errors. Assessment of model independence highlights the lack of independence between several high-performing GCMs, particularly from allied modeling groups, demonstrating the importance of careful ensemble selection when making selective samples of climate space. Once GCM climate signal diversity is considered, 6-8 mid-to-high-performing, independent GCMs occupy the full range of the future climate space and, thus, are suitable for dynamical downscaling over CORDEX-Australasia.","[Di Virgilio, Giovanni; Ji, Fei; Tam, Eugene; Nishant, Nidhi; Riley, Matthew L.; Beyer, Kathleen] NSW Dept Planning & Environm, Climate & Atmospher Sci Branch, Climate Res, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Di Virgilio, Giovanni; Evans, Jason P.; Thomas, Chris] Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Grose, Michael R.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Narsey, Sugata; Delage, Francois] Bur Meteorol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Bureau of Meteorology - Australia,"Di Virgilio, G (corresponding author), NSW Dept Planning & Environm, Climate & Atmospher Sci Branch, Climate Res, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Di Virgilio, G (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",giovanni.divirgilio@environment.nsw.gov.au,"Riley, Matthew/K-9038-2018; Evans, Jason/F-3716-2011","Riley, Matthew/0000-0002-9181-782X; Narsey, Sugata/0000-0002-2039-5025; Nishant, Nidhi/0000-0003-1792-7366; Evans, Jason/0000-0003-1776-3429",New South Wales Department of Planning and Environment; NSW Climate Change Fund for NSW and ACT Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) Project; Australian Government; ESGF,New South Wales Department of Planning and Environment; NSW Climate Change Fund for NSW and ACT Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) Project; Australian Government(Australian Government); ESGF,"This research was supported by the New South Wales Department of Planning and Environment as part of the design undertaken for the second generation of the NSW and ACT Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM2.0) dynamical downscaling project contributing to CORDEX Australasia.

These drivers regulate the distribution of different mangrove ecotypes and their ecosystem services, so the net sediment accumulation rates in different mangrove ecotypes in Celestun Lagoon, a karstic zone in the NW Yucatan Peninsula, SE Mexico, were estimated. The measurements considering mangrove ecotypes and their spatial variability concerning the lagoon's salinity gradient (inner, middle, and outer lagoon zones) in three climate seasons (dry, rain, and nortes) were realized. We registered the structural variables of the forest, interstitial water physicochemical characteristics, and sediment variables that could influence the net sediment deposition. Fringe mangroves are exposed to low hydrodynamism and show the highest sedimentation rate (3.37 +/- 0.49 kg m(-2) year(-1)) compared to basin (1.68 +/- 0.22 kg m(-2) year(-1)), dwarf (1.27 +/- 0.27 kg m(-2) year(-1)), and peten (0.52 +/- 0.12 kg m(-2) year(-1)) mangroves. The highest sedimentation rate was recorded in the rainy season (0.24 +/- 0.08 kg m(-2) month(-1)), while spatially, the highest value was registered in the outer zone (0.44 +/- 0.09 kg m(-2) month(-1)). If the extension of each mangrove ecotype is considered, dwarf mangroves have the highest annual sediment accumulation (1,465 t year(-1) in 14,706 ha). The structural, physicochemical, and sediment variables of the sites by mangrove ecotype show that dwarf mangroves represent a distinct group from those formed by fringe, basin, and peten mangroves. However, the sedimentation is high in fringe mangroves at the front of the lagoon and diminishes inland where peten mangroves exist. The differences are given by tree density, but salinity, as a proxy variable of the freshwater influence, significantly influences the sedimentation rate. These results indicate that mangroves in karstic environments can have critical roles in confronting climate change, considering water and sediment flows are the basis of sediment accumulation. According to their hydrogeomorphological drivers, conserving, managing, and restoring the mosaic of mangrove ecotypes improves ecosystem services, including mitigation and adaptation to climate change.","[Cinco-Castro, Siuling; Herrera-Silveira, Jorge] CINVESTAV, Natl Polytech Inst, Ctr Res Adv Studies, Dept Marine Resources,Merida Unit, Yucatan, Mexico; [Herrera-Silveira, Jorge] CONACYT, Natl Coastal Resilience Lab LANRESC, Natl Labs, Sisal, Mexico; [Comin, Francisco] CSIC, Dept Biodivers Conservat & Ecol Restorat, Inst Pirena Ecol, Zaragoza, Spain",CINVESTAV - Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politecnico Nacional; Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto Pirenaico de Ecologia (IPE),"Cinco-Castro, S (corresponding author), CINVESTAV, Natl Polytech Inst, Ctr Res Adv Studies, Dept Marine Resources,Merida Unit, Yucatan, Mexico.",sgcinco@hotmail.com,,"Herrera Silveira, Jorge Alfredo/0000-0001-7742-0183",National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) [CB-2015-I0017/254175]; CONACYT [CVU: 627399],National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),"Fieldwork, materials, and laboratory analysis of this research were funded by the National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT) through project CB-2015-I0017/254175 and by Primary Production Laboratory - CINVESTAV Merida Unit.

In this study, an extreme rainfall event in summer 2020 which caused an urban flood in the city of Zagreb was analyzed from the hydro-meteorological point of view. To put this event in a broader climate context, first, a general climatology of the short-duration (from 5 to 120 min) rainfall amounts and trends in the associated extremes was analyzed for the Zagreb-Gric station in the period 1908-2020. For the flood event analysis, time series from additional two stations, a suburb and mountain one, were used covering the period 1959-2020. The generalized extreme value distribution (GEV), both stationary and non-stationary, was employed to estimate the return value curves. The results revealed more frequent short-duration wet events (rainfall amounts larger than the corresponding 10-year return values) occurring after the 1970s. Trend results showed a general increase in the amounts of precipitation with a range of duration from 30 to 120 min with the rate up to 2.9%/10 years. Combined with the analysis of occurrence of extremes during year and correlogram analysis, such results imply changes in the occurrence of corresponding weather types responsible for heavy rainfall episodes. The case study analysis showed that the 120-min extreme precipitation event in the summer 2020 over the city center was an exceptional one with the return period higher than 100 years. According to all available data, measurements and numerical weather prediction models, all ingredients for deep moist convection were present before the event, together with a deep layer shear. In addition, formation of cutoff low, the presence of an intense positive potential vorticity anomaly and the surface convergence line appear to be the main processes which further enhanced triggered deep convection, consequently also heavy precipitation. The hydrological analysis revealed that the sewerage system of Zagreb city could not drain the stormwater from the streets, pointing out the need for its redesign and adaptation to climate change.","[Nimac, Irena; Kalin, Ksenija Cindric; Renko, Tanja; Vujnovic, Tatjana; Horvath, Kristian] Croatian Meteorol & Hydrol Serv, Zagreb, Croatia; [Renko, Tanja] European Severe Storms Lab, Wessling, Germany",,"Nimac, I (corresponding author), Croatian Meteorol & Hydrol Serv, Zagreb, Croatia.",irena.nimac@cirus.dhz.hr,"Nimac, Irena/GWQ-8075-2022","Nimac, Irena/0000-0002-5088-3767; Renko, Tanja/0000-0002-6726-5404",Croatian Science Foundation [UIP217-05-6396]; Croatian-Swiss Research Program of the Croatian Science Foundation [IZHRZO-180587]; Swiss National Science Foundation; Swiss-Croatian Cooperation Programme,Croatian Science Foundation; Croatian-Swiss Research Program of the Croatian Science Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss-Croatian Cooperation Programme,"Work of IN on this paper was supported by Croatian Science Foundation under the project UIP217-05-6396 (CroClimGoGreen).

Despite the catalyst role of the traditional knowledge in reducing the risks of disasters and adapting to climate change, this knowledge has not featured prominently in any of the existing disaster policies and disaster science. The authors demonstrate how traditional knowledge and modern science can be integrated for holistic approach of disaster risk reduction and management. Design/methodology/approach Using qualitative research method complemented by thorough literature review, this article captures traditional knowledge and practices of communities in the Narayani Basin for flood disaster risks reduction and management and shows ways to integrate traditional knowledge and modern science for holistic approach of disaster risk reduction and management. Findings The authors found that traditional knowledge system and practices have worked as an alternative to modern technoengineering approaches of disaster risk reduction and management and hold immense potential to contribute against disasters; therefore, this knowledge system of the communities not only needs to be recognized, conserved and documented but also is to be incorporated into efforts to formulate effective disaster management strategies and be amalgamated with the technoengineering practices for a holistic approach so that it can ensure disaster safety and security of the communities. Research limitations/implications The authors conducted this study collecting primary data from Narayani basin only; however, the authors believe that these practices and findings of the research may still be representative. Practical implications The practical implication of this research is that traditional knowledge system needs to be integrated with technobureaucratic knowledge of disaster management, enabling to develop a more robust and holistic approach of disaster risk reduction and management. Social implications This research documents being extinct traditional knowledge system and empowers communities by supporting them to integrate and use both traditional knowledge and modern technobureaucratic knowledge for building communities flood resilient. Originality/value This research is based on both primary and secondary data and original in case of its findings and conclusion, and no similar research contextualizing the role of traditional knowledge system in flood disaster management has been conducted in Narayani Basin of Nepal in the past.","[Pandey, Chandra Lal] Kathmandu Univ Sch Arts, Dev Studies, Lalitpur, Nepal; [Basnet, Anoj] Lutheran World Federat, Kathmandu, Nepal",,"Pandey, CL (corresponding author), Kathmandu Univ Sch Arts, Dev Studies, Lalitpur, Nepal.",chandra.pandey@ku.edu.np,,,"project entitled, Transboundary Flood Resilience Project in South Asia - ELCA, Nepal; project entitled, Transboundary Flood Resilience Project in South Asia - LWF, Nepal; TROSA initiative","project entitled, Transboundary Flood Resilience Project in South Asia - ELCA, Nepal; project entitled, Transboundary Flood Resilience Project in South Asia - LWF, Nepal; TROSA initiative","This study was financially supported by the project entitled, Transboundary Flood Resilience Project in South Asia granted by the ELCA and LWF, Nepal, and TROSA initiative implemented by the ICIMOD.

Based on 31 in-depth, qualitative interviews (15 with farmers and 16 with stakeholders including advisors, consultants and industry representatives) this paper begins to address this gap by exploring experiences, attitudes and responses to extreme weather and climate change. The results point to a mixed picture of resilience to climate risks. All interviewees had experienced or witnessed negative impacts from extreme weather events in recent years but concern was expressed that too few farm businesses are taking sufficient action to increase their business resilience to extreme weather and climate change. Many farmers interviewed for this research did not perceive adaptation to be a priority and viewed the risks as either too uncertain and/or too long-term to warrant any significant investment of time or money at present when many are preoccupied with short-term profitability and business survival. We identified a range of issues and barriers that are constraining improved resilience across the industry, including some lack of awareness about the type and cost-effectiveness of potential adaptation options. Nevertheless, we also found evidence of positive actions being taken by many, whether in direct response to climate change/extreme weather or as a result of other drivers such as soil health, policy and legislation, cost reduction, productivity and changing consumer demands. Our findings reveal a number of actions that can help enable adaption at the farm level including improved industry collaboration, farmer-to-farmer learning, and the need for tools and support that take into account the specificities of different farming systems and that can be easily tailored or interpreted to help farmers understand what climate change means for their particular farm and, crucially, what they can do to increase their resilience to both extreme weather and longer term climate risks.","[Wheeler, Rebecca; Lobley, Matt] Univ Exeter, Ctr Rural Policy Res, Prince Wales Rd, Exeter EX4 4PJ, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Wheeler, R (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Ctr Rural Policy Res, Prince Wales Rd, Exeter EX4 4PJ, Devon, England.",r.wheeler3@exeter.ac.uk; m.lobley@exeter.ac.uk,,,UK Climate Resilience programme; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC);  [NE/S01702X/],UK Climate Resilience programme; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); ,"The research reported in this paper was funded by the UK Climate Resilience programme, which is jointly led by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and the Met Office with Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) taking UKRI lead on behalf of Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).

CULTIVARS; OLEA-EUROPAEA; LEAF ANATOMY; CROP YIELD; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; DEFICIT IRRIGATION; DROUGHT TOLERANCE; EMILIA-ROMAGNA; ELEVATED CO2; IMPACTS,"Adaptation to climate change is a major challenge facing the agricultural sector worldwide. Olive (Olea europaeaL.) is a global, high value crop currently cultivated in 28 countries worldwide. Global data to assess the vulnerability of the crop to climate variability are scarce, and in some notable cases, such the United Nations Food and Agricutlure Organization database (FAO, 2006), qualitative assessments rather than quantitative indicators are provided. The aim of this study is to demonstrate a new approach to help overcome these constraints toward a globally applicable method to assess the adaptability of olive cultivars. The adaptability of 11 cultivars, widely used in 11 countries worldwide, was studied using a new generic approach based on the evaluation of soil hydrological regime against cultivar-specific hydrological requirements. The approach requires local data, notably on soil hydrological properties, but it is easily transferable to other countries and regions. We applied an agrohydrological model in 60 soil units to determine hydrological indicators both in a reference (1961-1990) and a future (2021-2050) climate case. We compared indicators with cultivar-specific requirements to achieve the target yield; requirements were established using experimental yield response curves. We estimated the probability of adaptation, i.e., the probability that a given cultivar attains the target yield, and we used it to evaluate the cultivar potential distribution in the study area. At the locations where soil hydrological conditions were favorable, the probabilities of adaptation of the cultivars were high in both climate cases. The results show that the area with suitable conditions for the target yield (area of adaptability) decreased under future climate for all the cultivars, with higher reduction for Frantoio and Maiatica and smaller reduction for Itrana, Nocellara, Ascolana, and Kalamata. These cultivars are currently grown in Argentina, United States (US), Australia, France, Greece, and Italy. Our results indicate also that these cultivars require higher available soil water to attain the target yield, i.e., we may expect similar vulnerability in other parts of the world. Based on these findings, we provide some specific recommendations for enrichment of global databases and for further developments of our approach, to increase its potential for global application.","[Alfieri, S.

J,"Moench, M",,,,"Moench, Marcus",,,Responding to climate and other change processes in complex contexts: Challenges facing development of adaptive policy frameworks in the Ganga Basin,TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; Adaptation; India; Himalaya; Floods; Water management; Adaptive management,,"The Ganga Basin, one of the world's most densely populated and vulnerable regions, is also among the world's most dynamic hydrological systems. Rivers exiting the Himalaya deposit massive amounts of sediment in the plains and shift their courses regularly. The natural dynamics of this system have a direct impact on populations. On August 18th, 2008, for example, embankments on the Kosi River (a tributary to the Ganges), failed and the channel shifted by as much as 120 km (Sinha, 2008 [1]) displacing over sixty thousand people in Nepal and three and a half million in India. Transport and power systems disrupted across large areas. The embankment failure was not caused by an extreme event. Instead the breach represented a failure of interlinked physical and institutional infrastructure systems in an area characterized by complex social, political, and environmental relationships. Projected climate changes in the Ganga Basin are likely to greatly exacerbate vulnerability (Adaptation Study Team, 2008 121). While the Kosi breach had nothing to do with climate change, such events will increase if climatic variability, sediment transport, and extreme events increase. Understanding how populations can respond to the dynamic nature of rivers such as the Kosi is, as a result, essential to develop strategies for adapting to climatic change. Understanding is also essential at the policy level for building adaptive capacity. The challenge is to identify policy frameworks and their relationship to interlinked physical and institutional infrastructure combinations that create environments enabling adaptation within households, communities, and regions. This paper explores the challenges and opportunities facing the development of adaptive policy frameworks in the Ganga Basin. The characteristics of frameworks that are adaptive in themselves and enable adaptation along with their relationship to different types of interlinked institutional and infrastructure systems are explored first. Following this, the case of the Kosi embankment along with the projected impacts of climate change across the Ganga Basin is used to identify the key challenges and opportunities that are common in many regions. The paper concludes with specific observations on the development of adaptive policy frameworks for responding to climate change in complex developing country contexts. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This region strongly depends on water resources to generate electricity and food. Future projections (considering both moderate and high emission scenarios) of temperature and precipitation from an ensemble of 16 bias-corrected climate model combinations were blended with a scenario-neutral response surface approach to analyses changes in: (i) the meteorological conditions, (ii) the meteorological water balance, and (iii) selected drought characteristics such as drought intensity, drought months, and drought events, which were derived from the Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index. Changes were analyzed for a near-term (2021-2050) and far-term period (2071-2100) with reference to 1976-2005. The effect of bias-correction (i.e., empirical quantile mapping) on the ability of the climate model ensemble to reproduce observed drought characteristics as compared to raw climate projections was also investigated. Results suggest that the bias-correction improves the climate models in terms of reproducing temperature and precipitation statistics but not drought characteristics. Still, despite the differences in the internal structures and uncertainties that exist among the climate models, they all agree on an increase of meteorological droughts in the future in terms of higher drought intensity and longer events. Drought intensity is projected to increase between +25 and +50% during 2021-2050 and between +131 and +388% during 2071-2100. This translates into +3 to +5, and +7 to +8 more drought months per year during both periods, respectively. With longer lasting drought events, the number of drought events decreases. Projected droughts based on the high emission scenario are 1.7 times more severe than droughts based on the moderate scenario. That means that droughts in this region will likely become more severe in the coming decades. Despite the inherent high uncertainties of climate projections, the results provide a basis in planning and (water-)managing activities for climate change adaptation measures in Malawi.

This study aims to assess genders' vulnerability dimension to climate change and variability in REDD + (Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation+) piloted site/clusters, Cross River State, Nigeria. Data were proportionately collected from selected 200 respondents on gender disaggregated level using questionnaires. The assessment adopted the sustainable livelihood approach (livelihood vulnerability index) and compared the results with the IPCC vulnerability standard of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity weighted mean. The results revealed a significant difference in the vulnerability dimension of both women and men disaggregated levels (LVI: men 0.509, women 0.618). The women category was more vulnerable to six out of seven major components of LVI assessed: (livelihood strategies (0.646), social networks (0.364), water (0.559), health (0.379), food and nutrition (0.507), and natural hazards and climate variability (0.482), while men only vulnerable to socio-demographic major component (0.346). Vulnerability indices also showed women to be more exposed (0.482), and sensitive (0.489) with the least adaptive capacities (0.462) to the climate change and variability impacts. Overall, on the IPCC-LVI index, women are more vulnerable (0.0098) to climate change and variability impacts than men (-0.0093). The study recommends that the women's category resilience and adaptive capacity should be empowered in adaptation projects in climate change such as REDD + (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation+) to reduce their vulnerability to impacts of climate change and variability in the context of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacities. This will be instrumental in formulating policies to address the specific needs of gender categories in reducing vulnerability to climate change and variability. This pragmatic approach may be used to monitor gender vulnerability dimension, and livelihood enhancement and evaluate potential climate change adaptation programs. Additionally, the introduction of IPCC-LVI as a baseline instrument will enhance information on gender resilience and adaptive capacity for policy effectiveness in a data-scarce region particularly Africa.","[Basiru, Adeniyi Okanlawon; Oladoye, Abiodun Olusegun] Fed Univ Agr, Dept Forestry & Wildlife Management, Coll Environm Resources Management, PMB 2240, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria; [Adekoya, Olubusayo Omotola; Akomolede, Lucas Aderemi] Forestry Res Inst Nigeria, PMB 5054, Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria; [Oeba, Vincent Onguso] Kenya Forestry Res Inst, Climate Change Dept, Muguga Nairobi Nakuru Highway,POB 20412-00200, Nairobi, Nairobi County, Kenya; [Awodutire, Opeyemi Oluwaseun] Oyo State Coll Agr, Dept Forestry Technol, PMB 10, Igboora, Oyo State, Kenya; [Charity, Fredrick] Univ Port Harcourt, Dept Forestry & Wildlife Management, Fac Agr, East West Rd,PMB 5323, Choba, River State, Nigeria; [Abodunrin, Emmanuel Kolawole] Fed Coll Forestry, Dept Forestry Technol, PMB 5054, Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria","University of Agriculture, Abeokuta; University of Port Harcourt","Basiru, AO (corresponding author), Fed Univ Agr, Dept Forestry & Wildlife Management, Coll Environm Resources Management, PMB 2240, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria.",okanlawon.basiru@students.jkuat.ac.ke,"Basiru, Adeniyi/HLW-2584-2023","BASIRU, ADENIYI OKANLAWON/0000-0001-5399-8028; OLUSEGUN, OLADOYE/0000-0002-5261-0455","UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) [ES/P011306]; African Forest Forum (AFF); World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), Nairobi, Kenya","UK Research and Innovation (UKRI)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); African Forest Forum (AFF); World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), Nairobi, Kenya","This research was funded by the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) through the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) program, Grant Ref: ES/P011306/under the project Social and Environmental Trade-offs in African Agriculture (SENTINEL) led by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) in part implemented by the Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM) and African Forest Forum (AFF), World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), Nairobi, Kenya.",,67,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,AUG,2022,11,8,,,,,,,1240,10.3390/land11081240,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11081240,,,34,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,4B1IJ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000845540200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The adoption of migration instead of in situ adaptation responses, and the high degree of variability in potential migration outcomes, in part reflects the presence of thresholds or tipping points within the processes of human-environment interaction through which climate adaptation and migration take place. This article reviews and makes linkages between existing research in climate adaptation, migration system dynamics, residential preferences, and risk perception to identify and explore the functioning and importance of thresholds. Parochial examples from the author's published research on climate adaptation and migration in rural North America are used to illustrate. Six types of thresholds in response to climate hazards are identified: (1) Adaptation becomes necessary; (2) Adaptation becomes ineffective; (3) Substantive changes in land use/livelihoods become necessary; (4) In situ adaptation fails, migration ensues; (5) Migration rates become non-linear; and (6) Migration rates cease to be non-linear. Movement across thresholds is driven by context-specific characteristics of climate events, natural systems, and/or human systems. Transition from incremental to non-linear migration can be accelerated by people's perceptions, by actions of influential individuals or groups, and by changes in key infrastructure, services, or other community assets. Non-linear climate migration events already occur at local and sub-regional scales. The potential for global scale, non-linear population movements later this century depends heavily on future greenhouse gas emission trends. The ability to identify and avoid thresholds that tip climate migration into a non-linear state will be of growing concern to policy makers and planners at all levels in coming decades. This article forms part of a special issue of this journal dedicated to the late Graeme Hugo, and the author draws heavily on past research by Professor Hugo and colleagues.","[McLeman, Robert] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, 75 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University,"McLeman, R (corresponding author), Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, 75 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",rmcleman@wlu.ca,,"McLeman, Robert/0000-0001-9593-1606",,,,,90,56,56,6,57,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0199-0039,1573-7810,,POPUL ENVIRON,Popul.

Specifically, wetlands are being squeezed between sea-level rise on one side and human development on the other preventing their natural ability to adapt by moving to higher ground. State and local coastal governments have legal and policy tools available to adapt to sea-level rise and limit the impacts of coastal squeeze on migrating wetlands. This article presents legal and policy tools and considerations governments could evaluate to facilitate long-term wetland conservation and migration to maximize benefits for people, the environment, and economies. This article first provides legal background on the law and federal, state, and local actors that could impact state and local decisions. This article then identifies five primary components of a comprehensive wetland migration strategy for state and local coastal governments: (1.) data; (2.) planning; (3.) voluntary land acquisitions; (4.) legal tools; and (5.) community engagement. This article also includes case study examples. Decisionmakers could potentially integrate any of these five components into existing coastal, environmental, land-use, and climate adaptation efforts to align policy objectives to protect wetlands across different programs and projects.","[Spidalieri, Katie] Georgetown Univ, Ctr Law, Georgetown Climate Ctr, 600 New Jersey Ave NW, Washington, DC 20001 USA",Georgetown University,"Spidalieri, K (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Ctr Law, Georgetown Climate Ctr, 600 New Jersey Ave NW, Washington, DC 20001 USA.",Katie.Spidalieri@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,35,8,8,2,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0277-5212,1943-6246,,WETLANDS,Wetlands,DEC,2020,40,6,,,,,1765,1776,,10.1007/s13157-020-01280-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-020-01280-x,,MAR 2020,12,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PL8YM,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000564402000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we present a new feature of the climate-risk modelling platform CLIMADA (CLIMate ADAptation), which allows us to carry out global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. CLIMADA underpins the Economics of Climate Adaptation (ECA) methodology which provides decision-makers with a fact base to understand the impact of weather and climate on their economies, communities, and ecosystems, including the appraisal of bespoke adaptation options today and in future. We apply the new feature to an ECA analysis of risk from tropical cyclone storm surge to people in Vietnam to showcase the comprehensive treatment of uncertainty and sensitivity of the model outputs, such as the spatial distribution of risk exceedance probabilities or the benefits of different adaptation options. We argue that broader application of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis will enhance transparency and intercomparison of studies among climate-risk modellers and help focus future research. For decision-makers and other users of climate-risk modelling, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis has the potential to lead to better-informed decisions on climate adaptation. Beyond provision of uncertainty quantification, the presented approach does contextualize risk assessment and options appraisal, and might be used to inform the development of storylines and climate adaptation narratives.","[Kropf, Chahan M.; Ciullo, Alessio; Otth, Laura; Meiler, Simona; Schmid, Emanuel; McCaughey, Jamie W.; Bresch, David N.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kropf, Chahan M.; Ciullo, Alessio; Meiler, Simona; McCaughey, Jamie W.; Bresch, David N.] Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, Operat Ctr 1, POB 257, CH-8058 Zurich, Switzerland; [Rana, Arun] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management Gemeinniitzige, Adickesallee 32-34, D-60322 Frankfurt, Germany",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss),"Kropf, CM (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",chahan.kropf@usys.ethz.ch,"; Bresch, David N./D-5298-2018","Meiler, Simona/0000-0002-4475-087X; Bresch, David N./0000-0002-8431-4263","Horizon 2020 (CASCADES) [821010, (820712)]",Horizon 2020 (CASCADES),This research has been supported by Horizon 2020 (CASCADES (grant no. 821010) and RECEIPT (grant no. 820712)).,,88,1,1,3,3,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

In this photothermotropic system, the near-infrared (NIR)-absorbing ATO acts as nanoheater to induce the optical switching of the hydrogel. Such a new passive smart window is characterized by excellent NIR shielding, a photothermally activated switching mechanism, enhanced response speed, and solar modulation ability. Systems with 0, 5, 10, and 15 atom % Sb-doped ATO in PNIPAM were investigated, and it was found that a PNIPAM/ATO nanocomposite is able to be photothermally activated. The 10 atom % Sb-doped PNIPAM/ATO exhibits the best response speed and solar modulation ability. Different film thicknesses and ATO contents will affect the response rate and solar modulation ability. Structural stability tests at 15 cycles under continuous exposure to solar irradiation at 1 sun intensity demonstrated the performance stability of such a photothermotropic system.

Institutional neglect or incompetence result in a loss of trust in public institutions, consequently discouraging the public from taking added responsibility for risk management. This has been explained in terms of social contract, but evidence suggests that a politics of distrust can reinforce alternative social drivers of action, rather than displacing action. This is empirically confirmed by the present study, which examines the tendencies for adopting private protective measures across a gradient of institutional trust. Surveys were conducted in four jurisdictions within China that operate under two different political-economic systems, namely, Hong Kong and Macao (liberal market economy), and Zhuhai and Sanya (socialist market economy). Structured interviews were conducted with 569 business operators to explore how their stated adaptation practice is related to institutional trust and social capital. We found that trust predicted action only in Sanya, which is characterized by a high level of public confidence in authorities. In places of lower institutional trust, social capital became a salient and powerful driver of action. The weakening of the social contracts in Hong Kong and Macao turned their people to alternative social mechanisms. We explain the results in terms of the development trajectories, socio-political norms and institutional settings of these jurisdictions. This study provides insights into how adaptation practice can be mediated by the consequences of a change in political leadership, policy, or governance arrangements that alters the relationship of trust.","[Lo, Alex Y.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, New Zealand Climate Change Res Inst, Wellington 6012, New Zealand; [Liu, Shuwen] Open Univ Hong Kong, Publ & Social Policy Res Ctr, Sch Arts & Social Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chow, Alice S.

Climate change in particular will demand adaptation strategies that may be cognitively difficult to accept. We conducted a survey online (n = 312) to examine preferences and perceived risks associated with a set of proposed adaptation strategies in a sample of the public. Preferences for proposed adaptation policies were significantly and negatively correlated with perceived risk in every case. Preferences also exhibited widespread conservatism with the greatest acceptance for measures most similar to the status quo, while environmental worldview and emotions of fear and anger appeared to influence perceived risk and acceptability. These results suggest that conservation planning should include considerations for risk perceptions, and greater support for certain conservation measures may be generated by deemphasizing their perceived novelty and emphasizing their contemporary usage.

Considering this need, this study aims to synthesize the body of knowledge on WP focusing on the MBR. The study is based on two test cases: (1) wheat, because it is a basic staple food in high dietary demand in the region and (2) barley, because it is a climate-resilient alternative that is extensively cultivated in severe water- and salinity-stress conditions. These staple crops are strategically important for regional food security in the MBR, which covers southern Europe, North Africa and western Asia. The study tries to investigate the plausible reasons for yield and WP gaps in the region. Our meta-analysis revealed that wheat and barley are very different in their spatial distributions, productions and stress resiliencies in the MBR. Under the large gamut of biophysical and socio-economic constraints that affect crop production, it is observed that the northern and southern parts of the MBR have large capacity differences (institutional, infrastructural and technical) in cereal production. It is noted that the role of soil-water management in improving WP is vital and plays a critical role in closing yield gaps across the MBR. Moreover, the scaling of stress-tolerant varieties along with a package of agronomic practices can enhance WP, and thereby we can make the region adaptive to climate change, especially in terms of water stress. The literature revealed that the MBR, especially the southern parts encompassing North Africa and western Asia, critically lacks comprehensive experimental/observational evidence on the dynamics of field water balance. This knowledge is key to enhancing WP assessments using modelling approaches. The paper concludes that the MBR does have water-saving potential; it simply needs planned adaptation measures to enhance WP at the local and regional scales with effective benchmark studies in future.","[UnNisa, Zaib] Univ Tuscia, Dept Innovat Biol Agri Food & Forest Syst DIBAF, Viterbo, Italy; [UnNisa, Zaib; Govind, Ajit] Int Ctr Agr Res Dry Areas ICARDA, Cairo, Egypt; [UnNisa, Zaib; Marchetti, Marco; Lasserre, Bruno] Univ Molise, Dept Biosci & Terr, Pesche, IS, Italy",Tuscia University; CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA); University of Molise,"UnNisa, Z (corresponding author), Univ Molise, DiBT Forestry Lab, I-86090 Pesche, IS, Italy.",zaib.unnisa@unimol.it,,"Nisa, Zaibun/0000-0002-3781-4900","Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) of the CGIAR","Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) of the CGIAR","We wish to thank the FAO agricultural data portal (FAOSTAT) and Global Agroecological Zone (GAEZ) and Climatology Lab for free data access.

Therefore, in 2015, to better monitor the level of adaptation to flooding of Quebec residents living in or near a flood-prone area, the Quebec Observatory of Adaptation to Climate Change developed five indices of adaptation to flooding, according to the chronology of events. The present study was conducted 4 years later and is a follow-up to the 2015 one. Two independent samples of 1951 (2015) and 974 (2019) individuals completed a questionnaire on their adoption (or non-adoption) of flood adaptation behaviors, their perception of the mental and physical impacts of flooding, and their knowledge of the fact that they lived in a flood-prone area.The results of the study demonstrated the measurement invariance of the five indices across two different samples of people over time, ensuring that the differences (or absence of differences) observed in flood-related adaptive behaviors between 2015 and 2019 were real and not due to measurement errors. They also showed that, overall, Quebeckers' flood-related adaptive behaviors have not changed considerably since 2015, with adaptation scores being similar in 2019 for four of the five flood indices. Moreover, the results indicated an increase in self-reported physical and mental health issues related to past flooding events, as well as a larger proportion of people having consulted a health professional because of these problems. Thus, this study provides a better understanding of flood adaptation in Quebec over the past 4 years and confirms that the five adaptive behavior indices developed in 2015 are appropriate tools for monitoring changes in flood adaptation in the province. Finally, our results showed that little has changed in Quebeckers' adoption of adaptive behaviors, highlighting the need for awareness raising in order to limit the impacts that climate change will have on the population.","[Valois, Pierre; Tessier, Maxime; Bouchard, David] Univ Laval, Fac Educ, 2320 Rue Bibliotheques, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Talbot, Denis] Univ Laval, Fac Med, 1050 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Morin, Alexandre J.

This impedes the long-term assessment of the drivers of climate change, in addition to their impacts and feedback loops at the continental scale, but also limits our understanding of the contribution of the African continent to the global carbon (C) cycle. Given the current and projected transformation of socio-economic conditions in Africa (i.e. the increasing trend of urbanisation and population growth) and the adverse impacts of climate change, the development of a GHG research infrastructure (RI) is needed to support the design of suitable mitigation and adaptation strategies required to assure food, fuel, nutrition and economic security for the African population. This paper presents the initial results of the EU-African SEACRIFOG project, which aims to design a GHG observation RI for Africa. The first stages of this project included the identification and engagement of key stakeholders, the definition of the conceptual monitoring framework and an assessment of existing infrastructural capacity. Feedback from stakeholder sectors was obtained through three Stakeholder Consultation Workshops held in Kenya, Ghana and Zambia. Main concerns identified were data quality and accessibility, the need for capacity building and networking among the scientific community, and adaptation to climate change, which was confirmed to be a priority for Africa. This feedback in addition to input from experts in the atmospheric, terrestrial and oceanic thematic areas, facilitated the selection of a set of 'essential variables' that need to be measured in the future environmental RI. An inventory of 47 existing and planned networks across the continent allowed for an assessment of the current RIs needs and gaps in Africa. Overall, the development of a harmonised and standardised pan-African RI will serve to address the continent's primary societal and scientific challenges through a potential cross-domain synergy among existing and planned networks at regional, continental and global scales.","[Lopez-Ballesteros, Ana; Jones, Michael; Saunders, Matthew] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Bot, Dublin, Ireland; [Beck, Johannes; Helmschrot, Jorg] Southern African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Ad, Windhoek, Namibia; [Bombelli, Antonio; Grieco, Elisa] Fdn Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change CMCC, Impacts Agr Forests & Ecosyst Serv Div, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [Lorencova, Eliska Krkoska; Vackar, David; Acosta, Manuel; Pavelka, Marian] Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, Belidla 986-4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Merbold, Lutz; Jorch, Veronika] ILRI, Mazingira Ctr, POB 30709, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Brummer, Christian] Thunen Inst Climate Smart Agr, Braunschweig, Germany; [Hugo, Wim] South African Environm Observat Network, Pretoria, South Africa; [Scholes, Robert] Univ Witwatersrand, Global Change Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Vermeulen, Alex] ICOS ERIC, Carbon Portal, Solvegatan 12, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Meteorol & Climate Res, Atmospher Environm Res, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Helmschrot, Jorg] Stellenbosch Univ, Fac AgriSci, Dept Soil Sci, Private Bag X1, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Kim, Dong-Gill] Hawassa Univ, Wondo Genet Coll Forestry & Nat Resources, POB 128, Shashemene, Ethiopia; [Skjelvan, Ingunn] Uni Res, Jahnebakken 5, NO-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Skjelvan, Ingunn] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Jahnebakken 5, NO-5007 Bergen, Norway",Trinity College Dublin; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; National Research Foundation - South Africa; South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON); University of Witwatersrand; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Stellenbosch University; Hawassa University; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research,"Lopez-Ballesteros, A (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Bot, Dublin, Ireland.",alpzballesteros@gmail.com,"Hugo, Wim/AAH-5019-2021; Helmschrot, Jörg/C-1105-2014; Saunders, Matthew J/J-2552-2015; Vackarova, Davina/G-2128-2014; Merbold, Lutz/K-6103-2012; Brümmer, Christian/J-1183-2016; Acosta, Manuel/A-6783-2011; Pavelka, Marian/I-8754-2012; López-Ballesteros, Ana/AAA-3119-2021; Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus/A-8081-2013; Grieco, Elisa/O-1407-2019; Vermeulen, Alex/A-2867-2015","Helmschrot, Jörg/0000-0002-4756-7640; Saunders, Matthew J/0000-0002-1965-8932; Vackarova, Davina/0000-0002-6185-200X; Merbold, Lutz/0000-0003-4974-170X; Brümmer, Christian/0000-0001-6621-5010; Acosta, Manuel/0000-0002-0850-5703; Pavelka, Marian/0000-0002-7339-3410; López-Ballesteros, Ana/0000-0003-0609-360X; Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus/0000-0001-9499-6598; Grieco, Elisa/0000-0002-7448-6125; Hugo, Wim/0000-0002-0255-5101; Kim, Dong-Gill/0000-0003-3084-2658; Skjelvan, Ingunn/0000-0001-6761-5016; BOMBELLI, Antonio/0000-0003-0132-3090; Beck, Johannes/0000-0002-6692-6688; Vermeulen, Alex/0000-0002-8158-8787","European Commission through the project 'Supporting EU-African Cooperation on Research Infrastructures for Food Security and Greenhouse Gas Observations' (SEACRIFOG) [730995]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Program I (NPU I) [LO1415]; project 'Completion of the research infrastructure CzeCOS to increase international quality of research of the global climate change impacts on ecosystem processes' [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_013/0001609]; CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); Research Program on Livestock; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)","European Commission through the project 'Supporting EU-African Cooperation on Research Infrastructures for Food Security and Greenhouse Gas Observations' (SEACRIFOG); Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Program I (NPU I); project 'Completion of the research infrastructure CzeCOS to increase international quality of research of the global climate change impacts on ecosystem processes'; CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); Research Program on Livestock; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","This work was entirely funded by the European Commission through the project 'Supporting EU-African Cooperation on Research Infrastructures for Food Security and Greenhouse Gas Observations' (SEACRIFOG; project ID 730995).

Thus, irrigation with the goal of increasing water use efficiency and the productivity of rainfed agriculture is vital to address climate effects, water scarcity, and food security. This study is aimed at assessing the sustainability of winter wheat production under climate change, and irrigation as an adaptation measure to improve yield, crop water productivity (CWP), and irrigation water productivity (IWP) in the CRV of Ethiopia. AquaCrop is applied to evaluate the effects of climate change and simulate irrigation as an adaptation measure. The analysis covers the baseline (1981-2020) and future (2026-2095) periods with each period categorized into three rainfall years (wet, normal, and dry). The future period is described using two representatives' concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and PCP8.5) scenarios. The results under rainfed and future climate conditions show that the winter wheat yield and CWP are projected to be lowered as compared to the baseline period. Most importantly, a significant reduction in wheat yield and CWP is noticed during the dry years (-60% and -80%) compared to the wet years (-30% and -51%) and normal years (-18% and -30%), respectively. As compared to rainfed agriculture, irrigation significantly reduces the risk of wheat yield decline and improves the CWP. Irrigation is also able to improve the CWP of rainfed wheat production ranging from 0.98-1.4 kg/m(3) to 1.48-1.56 kg/m(3). A projected CWP improvement of 1.1-1.32 kg/m(3) under irrigation is possible from 0.87-1.1 kg/m(3) under rainfed conditions.

Nevertheless, their mainstreaming is still limited by several barriers, which are often related to socio-institutional (e.g. limited cooperation and stakeholders' involvement, limited awareness about NBSs impacts) rather than to technical aspects. In this context, innovative tools for NBSs planning, design, implementation and assessment are required, along with effective processes capable of supporting stakeholders' participation. The present research aims to propose a shift in the approach to NBSs design, based on the early stakeholders' involvement in the identification, modelling and performance assessment in terms of benefits and, particularly, co-benefits production. A multi-step methodology was implemented for the purpose, combining both individual and participatory activities. Reference is made to one of the case studies of the NAIAD project, namely the Balta Potelu Pond Area (Lower Danube, Romania). Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs) were used to describe the system in terms of causal connections and mutual influences, incorporating stakeholders' views and ideas. Inputs from both institutional (e.g. ministries and municipalities) and non-institutional stakeholders (e.g. NGOs and members of the local communities) were integrated. This allowed a comparative assessment of multiple NBSs, based on the analysis of benefits and co-benefits produced, as well as the identification of trade-offs among different stakeholders (e.g. the increase of agricultural production versus biodiversity conservation) and potential side effects. CLDs were then coupled with a Performance Matrix (a basic feature of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis) and fuzzy logic to help decision-makers identify the most suitable NBSs for the area. The whole process was aimed at facilitating the process of NBSs selection and analysis, while considering the multiple impacts associated with their implementation.","[Coletta, Virginia Rosa; Fratino, Umberto] Politecn Bari, DICATECh, Bari, Italy; [Coletta, Virginia Rosa; Pagano, Alessandro; Giordano, Raffaele] Natl Res Council IRSA CNR, Water Res Inst, Bari, Italy; [Pluchinotta, Irene] UCL, Bartlett Fac Built Environm, Inst Environm Design & Engn, London, England; [Scrieciu, Albert] Natl Inst Marine Geol & Geoecol GeoEcoMar, Bucharest, Romania; [Nanu, Florentina] Business Dev Grp BDG, Bucharest, Romania",Politecnico di Bari; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Ricerca sulle Acque (IRSA-CNR); University of London; University College London; National Institute of Marine Geology & Geoecology of Romania (GeoEcoMar),"Coletta, VR (corresponding author), Politecn Bari, DICATECh, Bari, Italy.",virginiarosa.coletta@poliba.it,"Coletta, Virginia Rosa/AAM-8887-2021; Albert, Scrieciu/AAD-8193-2021; Fratino, Umberto/AGK-7763-2022; Pagano, Alessandro/P-1544-2018","Coletta, Virginia Rosa/0000-0002-3724-9139; Albert, Scrieciu/0000-0001-6297-8635; Pagano, Alessandro/0000-0002-2511-9396",H2020 NAIAD project [730497],H2020 NAIAD project,"The research activities described in this work were supported by the H2020 NAIAD project (Grant Agreement No 730497).

Understanding the long-term impacts of grazing on rangeland vegetation dynamics in a complex terrain in mountainous regions is important for quantifying dry land ecosystem services for integrated watershed management and climate change adaptation. However, data on the detailed long-term spatial distribution of grazing activities are rare, which prevents trend detection and environmental impact assessments of grazing. This study quantified the impacts of grazing on vegetation dynamics for the period of 1983-2010 in the Upper Heihe River basin, a complex multiple-use watershed in northwestern China. We also examined the relative contributions of grazing and climate to vegetation change using a dynamic grazing pressure method. Spatial grazing patterns and temporal dynamics were mapped at a 1 km x 1 km pixel scale using satellite-derived leaf area index (LAI) data. We found that overgrazing was a dominant driver for LAI reduction in alpine grasslands and shrubs, especially for the periods of 1985-1991 and 1997-2004. Although the recent decade-long active grazing management contributed to the improvement of LAI and partially offset the negative effects of increased livestock, overgrazing has posed significant challenges to shrub-grassland ecosystem recovery in the eastern part of the study basin. We conclude that the positive effects of a warming and wetting climate on vegetation could be underestimated if the negative long-term grazing effects are not considered. Findings from the present case study show that assessing long-term climate change impacts on watersheds must include the influences of human activities. Our study provides important guidance for ecological restoration efforts in locating vulnerable areas and designing effective management practices in the study watershed. Such information is essential for natural management that aims at meeting multiple demands of watershed ecosystem services in arid and semiarid rangelands. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A key component of DAPP is to monitor indicators of change such as flooding and storm events, which can trigger timely adaptive actions (change pathway/behavior) ahead of thresholds. Signals and triggers are needed to support DAPP-the signal provides early warning of the emergence of the trigger (decision-point), and the trigger initiates the process to change pathway before a harmful adaptation-threshold is reached. We demonstrate a new approach to designing signals and triggers using the case of increased flooding as sea level continues to rise. The flooding frequency is framed in terms of probable timing of several events reaching a specific height threshold within a set monitoring period. This framing is well suited to adaptive planning for different hazards, because it allows the period over which threshold exceedances are monitored to be specified, and thus allows action before adaptation-thresholds are reached, while accounting for the potential range of timing and providing a probability of premature warning, or of triggering adaptation too late. For our New Zealand sea level case study, we expect early signals to be observed in 10 year monitoring periods beginning 2021. Some urgency is therefore required to begin the assessment, planning and community engagement required to develop adaptive plans and associated signals and triggers for monitoring. Worldwide, greater urgency is required at tide-dominated sites than those adapted to large storm-surges. Triggers can be designed with confidence that a change in behavior pathway (e.g. relocating communities) will be triggered before an adaptation-threshold occurs. However, it is difficult to avoid the potential for premature adaptation. Therefore, political, social, economic, or cultural signals are also needed to complement the signals and triggers based on coastal-hazard considerations alone.","[Stephens, Scott A.; Bell, Robert G.] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, POB 11115, Hamilton 3251, New Zealand; [Lawrence, Judy] Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Climate Change Res Inst, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Cotton Bldg,Rooms 125-133,POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand",National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand; Victoria University Wellington,"Stephens, SA (corresponding author), Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, POB 11115, Hamilton 3251, New Zealand.",scott.stephens@niwa.co.nz,"Lawrence, Judy/W-9823-2019","Lawrence, Judy/0000-0001-6798-3636; Bell, Robert/0000-0002-8490-8942; Stephens, Scott/0000-0002-6573-8757","Supporting Decision Making in a Changing Climate: Tools and measures project within the NZ Deep South National Science Challenge; NZ Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment under Strategic Science Investment Fund-National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research [CAVA1804]; Resilience Science Challenge Living at the Edge project","Supporting Decision Making in a Changing Climate: Tools and measures project within the NZ Deep South National Science Challenge; NZ Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment under Strategic Science Investment Fund-National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research; Resilience Science Challenge Living at the Edge project","The authors were funded primarily by the Supporting Decision Making in a Changing Climate: Tools and measures project within the NZ Deep South National Science Challenge.

Yet, a limited number of studies also suggest that several adaptation measures may mitigate the effects of climate change induced yield loss. In this paper, we used AquaCrop, a process-based model developed by the FAO (The Food and Agriculture Organization, Rome, Italy), to quantify the risk of climate change on several key cereal crops in the Niger Basin. The crops analyzed include maize, millet, and sorghum under rain fed cultivation systems in various agro-ecological zones within the Niger Basin. We also investigated several adaptation strategies, including changes in the sowing dates, soil nutrient status, and cultivar. Future climate change is estimated using nine ensemble bias-corrected climate model projection results under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (RCP-Representative Concentration Pathway) emissions scenario at mid future time period, 2021/25-2050. The results show that on average, temperature had a larger effect on crop yields so that the increase in precipitation could still be a net loss of crop yield. Our simulated results showed that climate change effects on maize and sorghum yield would be mostly positive (2% to 6% increase) in the Southern Guinea savanna zone while at the Northern Guinea savanna zone it is mostly negative (2% to 20% decrease). The results show that at the Sahelian zone the projected changes in temperature and precipitation have little to no impact on millet yield for the future time period, 2021/25-2050. In all agro-ecological zones, increasing soil fertility from poor fertility to moderate, near optimal and optimal level significantly reversed the negative yield change respectively by over 20%, 70% and 180% for moderate fertility, near optimal fertility, and optimal fertility. Thus, management or adaptation factors, such as soil fertility, had a much larger effect on crop yield than the climatic change factors. These results provide actionable guidance on effective climate change adaptation strategies for rain fed agriculture in the region.","[Akumaga, Uvirkaa] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Geog & Environm Sustainabil, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Tarhule, Aondover] SUNY Binghamton, Grad Sch, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Piani, Claudio] Amer Univ Paris, Dept Comp Math & Environm Sci, F-75007 Paris, France; [Traore, Bouba] ICRISAT Mali, BP 320, Bamako, Mali; [Yusuf, Ado A.] Ahmadu Bello Univ, Inst Agr Res, Fac Agr, Dept Soil Sci, Zaria 1044, Pmb, Nigeria","University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; The American University of Paris; Ahmadu Bello University; Institute for Agricultural Research, Samaru, Zaria","Akumaga, U (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Geog & Environm Sustainabil, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",uvirkaa.akumaga-1@ou.edu; atarhule@binghamton.edu; cpiani@aup.edu; bouabasiditraore@yahoo.fr; adamu_99@yahoo.co.uk,"Akumaga, Uvirkaa/U-7812-2019","Yusuf, Ado/0000-0003-2869-4625",,,,,45,11,12,4,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4395,,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,FEB,2018,8,2,,,,,,,1 1,10.3390/agronomy8020011,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy8020011,,,19,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,FZ3QV,,"gold, Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000427505900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This research employed latent class analysis (LCA) to analyze data from a survey of 4,778 farmers from 11 US Corn Belt states. The research focused on two related research questions: (1) to what degree do farmers differ on key measures of beliefs about climate change, experience with extreme weather, perceived risks to agriculture, efficacy, and level of support for public and private adaptive and mitigative action; and (2) are there potential areas of common ground among farmers? Results indicate that farmers have highly heterogeneous perspectives, and six distinct classes of farmers are identified. We label these as the following: the concerned (14%), the uneasy (25%), the uncertain (25%), the unconcerned (13%), the confident (18%), and the detached (5%). These groups of farmers differ primarily in terms of beliefs about climate change, the degree to which they had experienced extreme weather, and risk perceptions. Despite substantial differences on these variables, areas of similarity were discerned on variables measuring farmers' (1) confidence that they will be able to deal with increases in weather variability and (2) support for public and private efforts to help farmers adapt to increased weather variability. These results can inform segmented approaches to outreach that target subpopulations of farmers as well as broader engagement strategies that would reach wider populations. Further, findings suggest that strategies with specific reference to climate change might be most effective in engaging the subpopulations of farmers who believe that climate change is occurring and a threat, but that use of less charged terms such as weather variability would likely be more effective with a broader range of farmers. Outreach efforts that (1) appeal to farmers' problem solving capacity and (2) employ terms such as weather variability instead of more charged terms such as climate change are more likely to be effective with a wider farmer audience.","[Arbuckle, J.

The research reported in this paper shows what happens with scientific information during such a process. In 2001 the Dutch Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management commissioned their regional office in Limburg to assess how flood management objectives could be achieved in future in the Dutch Meuse valley, assuming climate change will increase peak discharges. To ensure political support, regional discussion rounds were to help assess the measures previously identified. This paper discusses the ways in which hydrological and hydraulic expertise was input, understood and used in this assessment process. Project participants as a group had no trouble contesting assumptions and outcomes. Nevertheless, water expertise was generally accepted as providing facts, once basic choices such as starting situation had been discussed and agreed. The technical constraints determined that politically unacceptable measures would have to be selected to achieve the legally binding flood management objective. As a result, no additional space will be set aside for future flood management beyond the already reserved floodplain. In this case, political arguments clearly prevail over policy objectives, with hydraulic expertise providing decisive arbitration between the two.","[Wesselink, Anna] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [de Vriend, Huib] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Delft, Netherlands; [Barneveld, Hermjan] HKV Consultants, Lelystad, Netherlands; [Wesselink, Anna; Krol, Maarten] Univ Twente, Fac Engn, Dept Water Engn & Management, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Bijker, Wiebe] Maastricht Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Dept Technol & Soc Studies, Maastricht, Netherlands",University of Leeds; Delft University of Technology; University of Twente; Maastricht University,"Wesselink, A (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",a.wesselink@see.leeds.ac.uk,"Wesselink, Anna J/L-1791-2013; Krol, Maarten S./M-5997-2013","Wesselink, Anna J/0000-0003-1120-3359; ",,,,,34,18,18,1,13,I W A PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",0273-1223,,,WATER SCI TECHNOL,Water Sci.

In order for food production systems to remain viable and resilient under a changing climate, novel approaches, which integrate risk management (i.e. adaptation) and risk transfer strategies, such as insurance, are required. We argue that the coordinated integration of risk management and risk transfer approaches will support greater resilience of food production systems under climate change. Conversely, if risk management and risk transfer strategies are not carefully integrated, there is potential to undermine adaptive capacity (e.g. insurance subsidies may dissuade farmers from investing in climate adaptation) and ultimately reduce the capacity of food production systems to cope with and recover from the adverse impacts of climate change. Here we propose a resilience-based conceptual framework for integrating risk management and risk transfer strategies along with four key principles, which we believe could underlie their successful integration and thus enhance food production system resilience under climate change. These are as follows: (1) pro-active investments in farmer climate adaptation rather than re-active disaster relief, (2) structuring of government subsidies around insurance and climate disaster relief to incentivise farmer climate adaptation, (3) rewarding farmer efforts towards climate adaptation with cheaper insurance premiums for those farmers that invest resources into climate adaptation and (4) recognising investments in the integration of farm climate adaptation and risk transfer schemes within the broader context of future climate disaster risk management and global food security. Such an integrated investment approach could substantially reduce future economic losses for farmers while also enhancing food security under climate change.","[Mushtaq, Shahbaz; Kath, Jarrod; Stone, Roger; Reardon-Smith, Kathryn; Cobon, David; Marcussen, Torben] Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Appl Climate Sci, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Henry, Ross] Queensland Rural & Ind Dev Author, Turbot St, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Laderach, Peter] Int Ctr Trop Agr, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Cliffe, Neil] Dept Agr & Fisheries, Rural Econ Dev, Mackay, Qld, Australia; [Kristiansen, Paul] Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW, Australia; [Pischke, Frederik] GWP, Geneva, Switzerland; [Pischke, Frederik] WHO, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Southern Queensland; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; University of New England; World Health Organization,"Mushtaq, S (corresponding author), Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Appl Climate Sci, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia.",Shahbaz.Mushtaq@usq.edu.au; Jarrod.Kath@usq.edu.au; Roger.Stone@usq.edu.au; Ross.Henry@qrida.qld.gov.au; p.laderach@cgiar.org; Kathryn.Reardon-Smith@usq.edu.au; David.Cobon@usq.edu.au; Torben.Marcussen@usq.edu.au; Neil.Cliffe@daf.qld.gov.au; pkristi2@une.edu.au; frederik.pischke@gwp.org,,"Stone, Roger/0000-0003-3931-2661; Kristiansen, Paul/0000-0003-2116-0663","Queensland Government's Drought and Climate Adaptation Program (DCAP); German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) through the International Climate Initiative (IKI); CGIAR; Northern Australia Climate Program - Meat and Livestock Australia Donor Company; University of Southern Queensland; DCAP","Queensland Government's Drought and Climate Adaptation Program (DCAP); German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) through the International Climate Initiative (IKI); CGIAR(CGIAR); Northern Australia Climate Program - Meat and Livestock Australia Donor Company; University of Southern Queensland; DCAP","This research is funded through the Queensland Government's Drought and Climate Adaptation Program (DCAP) and the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) through the International Climate Initiative (IKI).

Cities call for innovative approaches integrating climate protection with urban attractiveness and waterfront endeavors. There is a lack of studies targeting policy processes for coastal protection, including the choice of adaptation strategies and impediments for implementation. Sweden is an interesting case due to the decentralized character of coastal adaptation. Consequently, this paper aims to analyze the status of and conditions for large-scale multifunctional coastal protection by means of qualitative analyses of policy documents and interviews with frontline practitioners in four Swedish coastal cities: Malmo center dot, Gothenburg, Helsingborg and Landskrona. The analysis documents a predominant focus on envisioning/planning for coastal protection rather than implementation of adaptation measures. While waterfront development functions as a window of opportunity in the more populous cities it also risks creating fragmentation and social imbalances in coastal protection between cities and their various coastal areas. Key implementation determinants emphasize formal institutional aspects, where politics and political decision-making need to set the necessary terms ensuring implementation. Current public-private and nationallocal distribution of responsibilities, stepwise planning and limited funding-mechanisms create uncertainties in system robustness and coherency. The consequences of a system for coastal protection heavily reliant on decentralized action needs to be properly considered by adaptation policy-makers.","[Storbjork, Sofie; Hjerpe, Mattias] Linkoping Univ, Dept Environm Change, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, S Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University,"Storbjork, S (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Environm Change, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, S Linkoping, Sweden.",sofie.storbjork@liu.se,,"Storbjork, Sofie/0000-0003-0109-2288; Hjerpe, Mattias/0000-0002-5500-3300",Swedish research council FORMAS [9422015356],Swedish research council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),"We wish to extend our gratitude to the Swedish research council FORMAS for funding the research project The role of urban experiments in triggering climate transitions, EXPECT (grant number 9422015356) , to our interviewees for generously sharing their views, perspectives and experiences, and to the two anonymous reviewers for suggestions that substantially improved the paper.",,68,4,4,3,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,SEP 1,2021,210,,,,,,,,105732,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105732,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105732,,JUN 2021,10,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Oceanography; Water Resources,TN9JZ,,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000676543400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While these goals are widely discussed, less is known about the activities and strategies that knowledge systems undertake to achieve these goals. We analyze the Global Framework of Climate Services (GFCS) as a knowledge system organized around the translation of weather and climate information for decision-making. The GFCS brings together the World Meteorological Organization, national meteorological and hydrological services, and some of the world's largest multilateral scientific, humanitarian, and development organizations. Our analysis draws on key informant interviews, focus groups conducted in African countries, and an online survey of GFCS participants. We describe the main activities pursued by the GFCS that shaped the vision of climate services, built capacity in national climate adaptation, and created connections among diverse actors and organizations worldwide. We show how these activities generated tensions about the purpose of the GFCS and how influence among the knowledge system was distributed. Based on our results, we illustrate new ways to conceptualize the strategies of knowledge systems, which we describe as (1) theorizing the norms of practice and mechanisms of change, (2) legitimizing actors, and (3) managing knowledge. These strategies identify pathways for, and pitfalls to, a knowledge system's pursuit of its goals, providing guidance to managers of knowledge systems and an analytical framework to evaluate their impacts.","[Guido, Zack] Univ Arizona, Arizona Inst Resilience Environm & Soc, 1064 E Lowell St, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Knudson, Chris] Univ Hawaii, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, 200 W Kawili St, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Gerlak, Andrea K.] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog Dev & Environm, 1064 E Lowell St, Tucson, AZ USA; [Gerlak, Andrea K.] Univ Arizona, Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, 1064 E Lowell St, Tucson, AZ USA; [Mason, Simon] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Earth Inst, 61 Route 9W, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Hewitt, Chris D.] Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Appl Climate Sci, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Hewitt, Chris D.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Muth, Meredith] US Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm NOAA, Climate Program Off, 1315 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA",University of Arizona; University of Hawaii System; University Hawaii Hilo; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; Columbia University; University of Southern Queensland; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Guido, Z (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Arizona Inst Resilience Environm & Soc, 1064 E Lowell St, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA.",zguido@email.arizona.edu,,"Hewitt, Chris/0000-0002-4718-4009",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA18OAR4310338],National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),We thank Filipe Lucio and Erica Allis of the WMO for thoughtful contributions.

This article examines the adaptation actions by 50 Cambodian coastal hotels by distinguishing between five adaptation categories. Subsequently, the analysis is deepened through a comparative analysis of key hotel characteristics. Although adaptation measures varied considerably between hotels they were more comprehensive and numerous than expected.

Arecanut registered similar kernel yields in both sole and intercropped systems in all years. The sole Napier Bajra Hybrid (NBH) recorded significantly higher green fodder yield than intercropped NBH. There was 5-47% yield reduction in intercropped NBH in different plantations over sole NBH on unit area basis. The total standing carbon stocks were significantly higher in arecanut + fodder system (210-228 t ha(-1)) than arecanut sole and fodder sole. Total water use was 47 to 50% higher in arecanut sole (2340-3280 m(3)) compared to ABMS (1178-1546 m(3)) per unit area. The contribution of livestock to total outflows was high (82 to 87%) from 2008 to 2014 except in establishment year of dairy unit (54%). On an average, organic waste recycling potential of arecanut + dairy unit was 13.7 t ha(-1) and dairy unit alone contributed to 87% of the manure production. Total nutrient supply from ABMS after recycling to the system was estimated at 218 kg N, 51.8 kg P and 33 kg K that can meet N and P demand of 1.7 and 2.2 ha of arecanut, respectively. The farm gate nutrient surplus was five times higher than utilization in ABMS that enables farmers to earn higher profits. The use of hard laterite soil for livestock enterprises like dairy, fishery and fodder cultivation resulted in improved resource use efficiency and profits per unit area per unit time. Dairy was economical under all scenarios due to on-farm fodder availability throughout the year. Our main recommendations are to include livestock components in arecanut ecosystem to adapt to climate change scenario, to provide ecosystem services and to reduce ecological imbalances arising due to continuous cultivation of perennial crop.

Drawing upon prior research on social-ecological systems, knowledge-action connections, and organizational innovation, we developed an integrated conceptual framework for strengthening the capacity of universities to help society understand and respond to a wide range of sustainability challenges. Based on experiences gained in creating the Senator George J. Mitchell Center for Sustainability Solutions (Mitchell Center), we tested this framework by evaluating the experiences of interdisciplinary research teams involved in place-based, solutions-oriented research projects at the scale of a single region (i.e., the state of Maine, USA). We employed a multiple-case-study approach examining the experiences of three interdisciplinary research teams working on tidal energy development, adaptation to climate change, and forest vulnerability to an invasive insect. Drawing upon documents, observations, interviews, and other data sources, three common patterns emerged across these cases that were associated with more effective problem-solving strategies. First, an emphasis on local places and short-term dynamics in social-ecological systems research provides more frequent opportunities for learning while doing. Second, iterative stakeholder engagement and inclusive forms of knowledge co-production can generate substantial returns on investment, especially when researchers are dedicated to a shared process of problem identification and they avoid framing solutions too narrowly. Although these practices are time consuming, they can be accelerated by leveraging existing stakeholder relationships. Third, efforts to mobilize interdisciplinary expertise and link knowledge with action are facilitated by an organizational culture that emphasizes mutual respect, adaptability, and solutions. Participation of faculty associated with interdisciplinary academic programs, solutions-oriented fields, and units with partnership-oriented missions hastens collaboration within teams and between teams and stakeholders. The Mitchell Center also created a risk-tolerant culture that encouraged organizational learning. Solutions-focused programs at other universities can potentially benefit from the lessons we learned.","[Hart, David D.; Ranco, Darren; McGill, Brian] Univ Maine, Mitchell Ctr Sustainabil Solut, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Hart, David D.; McGill, Brian] Univ Maine, Sch Biol & Ecol, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Bell, Kathleen P.] Univ Maine, Sch Econ, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Lindenfeld, Laura A.] Univ Maine, Dept Commun & Journalism, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Lindenfeld, Laura A.] Univ Maine, Margaret Chase Smith Policy Ctr, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Jain, Shaleen] Univ Maine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Jain, Shaleen] Univ Maine, Climate Change Inst, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Johnson, Teresa R.] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Ranco, Darren] Univ Maine, Native Amer Programs, Orono, ME 04469 USA",University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Hart, DD (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Mitchell Ctr Sustainabil Solut, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",,"Jain, Shaleen/B-2923-2011; McGill, Brian J/A-3476-2008","Jain, Shaleen/0000-0003-1792-4421; McGill, Brian J/0000-0002-0850-1913; Bell, Kathleen/0000-0001-6224-181X; Ranco, Darren/0000-0001-8214-8233",National Science Foundation award [EPS-0904155],National Science Foundation award(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We are deeply grateful to the extraordinary team of faculty, students, staff, partners, and advisory board members who joined us on the road to solutions.

Climates in A1b, A2, B1 and B2 emission scenarios as per a global climate model (MIROC3.2.HI) and a regional climate model (PRECIS) were considered for the study. On an aggregated scale, the mean of all emission scenarios indicate that climate change is likely to reduce irrigated rice yields by similar to 4 % in 2020 (2010-2039), similar to 7 % in 2050 (2040-2069), and by similar to 10 % in 2080 (2070-2099) climate scenarios. On the other hand, rainfed rice yields in India are likely to be reduced by similar to 6 % in the 2020 scenario, but in the 2050 and 2080 scenarios they are projected to decrease only marginally (< 2.5 %). However, spatial variations exist for the magnitude of the impact, with some regions likely to be affected more than others. Adaptation strategies comprising agronomical management can offset negative impacts in the near future-particularly in rainfed conditions-but in the longer run, developing suitable varieties coupled with improved and efficient crop husbandry will become essential. For irrigated rice crop, genotypic and agronomic improvements will become crucial; while for rainfed conditions, improved management and additional fertilizers will be needed. Basically climate change is likely to exhibit three types of impacts on rice crop: i) regions that are adversely affected by climate change can gain in net productivity with adaptation; ii) regions that are adversely affected will still remain vulnerable despite adaptation gains; and iii) rainfed regions (with currently low rainfall) that are likely to gain due to increase in rainfall can further benefit by adaptation. Regions falling in the vulnerable category even after suggested adaptation to climate change will require more intensive, specific and innovative adaptation options. The present analysis indicates the possibility of substantial improvement in yields with efficient utilization of inputs and adoption of improved varieties.","[Soora, Naresh Kumar; Aggarwal, P.

Based on this growth, it became necessary to consider climatic-meteorological conditions as determinants for boosting tourism in some geographical areas. The main objective of this paper is to characterize the perception of bioclimatic comfort of tourists who visited the city of Porto in the summer seasons of 2019 and 2020 (in the on-going pandemic). Primary data were obtained from a questionnaire on perceptions of bioclimatic comfort and microclimatic measurements applied to 207 tourists in the summer of 2019, 146 in the winter of 2019-2020 and 210 in the summer of 2020. It took place in one of the main places of passage for tourists visiting the city of Porto. Based on statistical analysis, responses were parameterized according to the environmental and sociodemographic characteristics of the tourists. In addition, summary indicators (Physiological Equivalent Temperature - PET, Thermal Sensation Vote - TSV, Thermal Preference Vote - TPV) were used to characterize the profile of visiting tourists. The influence of microclimate conditions on the thermal comfort of tourists was evident, showing, however, that they still felt comfortable regardless of the situation. The results demonstrated a good effort to reduce thermal discomfort through adapted behavior. Air temperature and relative humidity seem to be more directly related to mean thermal sensation votes in the summer of 2019 (r(2) = 0.86 and r(2) = 0.68, respectively). In the winters of 2019-2020 and summer of 2020, these indicators do not show such a strong correlation. Anyway, it is verified that there is a greater tolerance for higher and lower temperatures than those that are verified for the residents, when compared to previous studies. The consideration of average thresholds for thermal comfort in tourism is crucial. In future studies and planning proposals, it will be necessary to consider the optimal climatic conditions of local climate change adaptation and mitigation policies.","[Silva Lopes, Helder; Remoaldo, Paula C.; Martin-Vide, Javier] Univ Minho, Lab2PT Landscape Heritage & Terr Lab, Dept Geog, ICS, Guimaraes, Portugal; [Silva Lopes, Helder; Remoaldo, Paula C.] Univ Barcelona, IdRA Climatol Grp, Dept Geog, FGH, Barcelona, Spain; [Ribeiro, Vitor] Univ Minho, Lab2PT Landscape Heritage & Terr Lab, Dept Geog, CIPAF,ICS, Guimaraes, Portugal; [Ribeiro, Vitor] ESE Paula Frassinetti, Porto, Portugal",Universidade do Minho; University of Barcelona; Universidade do Minho,"Lopes, HS (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Lab2PT Landscape Heritage & Terr Lab, Dept Geog, ICS, Guimaraes, Portugal.;Lopes, HS (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, IdRA Climatol Grp, Dept Geog, FGH, Barcelona, Spain.",htsltiago@hotmail.com; premoaldo@geografia.uminho.pt; vitor.geografia@gmail.com; jmartinvide@ub.edu,"Lopes, Hélder/ADP-8422-2022; Ribeiro, Vitor/AAC-5667-2022; Remoaldo, Paula/M-2800-2017; RIBEIRO, Vitor/M-7663-2013","Lopes, Hélder/0000-0002-2931-5175; Remoaldo, Paula/0000-0002-9445-5465; RIBEIRO, Vitor/0000-0002-5993-3492","FCT Portugal [SFRH/BD/129153/2017]; Lab2PT - Landscapes, Heritage and Territory Laboratory [AUR/04509]; FCT [POCI 01 0145 FEDER 007528]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/129153/2017] Funding Source: FCT","FCT Portugal(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Lab2PT - Landscapes, Heritage and Territory Laboratory; FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","This research was funded by FCT Portugal, grant number SFRH/BD/129153/2017 and Lab2PT - Landscapes, Heritage and Territory Laboratory - AUR/04509 and FCT through national funds and when appli-cable of the FEDER cofinancing, in the aim/under the scope of the new-partnership agreement PT2020 and COMPETE2020- POCI 01 0145 FEDER 007528.",,99,15,15,8,17,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

Floods in general and flash floods in particular are very common in the area, and the phenomenon has intensified in the wake of observed climatic changes in the region. Anticipating an increase in the multiplicity of causes and a rise in the human, livelihood, and property losses attributed to flash floods calls for a detailed study of affected communities in the region. Within the study area of District Dir Upper-within the band of 200 m on both sides of Panjkora River, three most affected communities, namely Barikot, Kalkot, and Sharingal, were picked on random basis to have detailed analysis of underlying causes and the quantification of damage assessment in the area. Questionnaire-based household survey and structured interviews were conducted to investigate physical and economic damages in the sample sites. Global positioning system (GPS) survey is also conducted to acquire absolute location of damages, and geographic information system is used to visualize land use, land cover, physical features, and GPS data. Monsoon winds interacted with the westerlies abnormally caused unprecedented high intensity rainfall in the valley. The steep topography of the area caused rainwater to accumulate rapidly in the Panjkora River channel, overpowering the withholding capacity of the river. The flash flood inflected heavy losses to life and properties of the local population. The infrastructure such as houses, roads, retaining walls, bridges, water supply schemes, and irrigation channels were destroyed severely in the whole area particularly in Kalkot. Three explored underlying causes of flash floods and the degree of damage due to 2010 flash floods in the region call for an enhanced realization for climatic change adaptability, flood risk management, and mitigation measures, better flood response through early warning systems, and improved rehabilitation and recovery efforts within flood prone areas such as district Dir Upper, KP, Pakistan.","[Mahmood, Shakeel] Govt Coll Univ, Dept Geog, Lahore, Pakistan; [Khan, Amin-ul-Haq] Govt Coll Univ, Sustainable Dev Study Ctr, Lahore, Pakistan; [Mayo, Shaker Mahmood] UET, Dept City & Reg Planning, Lahore, Pakistan",Government College University Lahore; Government College University Lahore,"Mahmood, S (corresponding author), Govt Coll Univ, Dept Geog, Lahore, Pakistan.",shakeelmahmood@gcu.edu.pk,"Mahmood, Shakeel/GQH-3340-2022","Mahmood, Shakeel/0000-0001-6909-0735",,,,,37,24,24,2,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

Knowledge of private engagement in mitigating climate change and in more advanced economies is growing, but the evidence base for private-sector engagement in climate change adaptation in developing countries remains weak. Starting from the premise that the private sector's role in adaptation is often inevitable and potentially significant, this article first analyses the potential of private-sector engagement in adaptation and adaptation financing in developing countries by conceptualizing the private sector's roles and motivation therein. For further inquiry, and for a discussion based on a developing-country context, interviews were conducted with key stakeholders for adaptation of Zambia's agricultural sector, including on ways in which the government can incentivize private-sector engagement in adaptation.How much private-sector adaptation and adaptation finance can be identified depends on the interpretation of the concept of adaptation. Under a broad interpretation, the domestic private sector in particular can contribute substantially to adaptation, both directly and indirectly, through its investments and activities. However, the international private sector's role in financing adaptation should be analysed under a strict interpretation of adaptation and appears limited.Policy relevanceInternational political debates increasingly stress the importance of private climate finance, yet are constrained by vagueness around the private sector's role in adaptation finance. This article conceptualizes and scrutinizes private-sector engagement in adaptation and adaptation finance in developing countries. It concludes that the domestic private sector in particular can contribute substantially to adaptation in direct and indirect ways, and that domestic policies incentivize such contributions. However, international private financing of adaptation is more limited and its analysis requires a stricter interpretation of adaptation. Private-sector engagement in adaptation and adaptation finance can supplement, but not substitute for, public investments in adaptation. These limitations are particularly important when discussing private adaptation finance as part of the developed countries' pledge to mobilize US$100 billion of climate finance per annum from 2020 onwards.","[Pauw, W.

At the individual level however, adaptation and mitigation activities are undertaken together as part of the management of risk and resources. We propose that a useful starting point to develop a national climate policy is to understand what societal response might mean in practice. First we frame the set of responses at the national policy level as a trade off between investment in the development and diffusion of new technology, and investment in encouraging and enabling society to change its behaviour and or adopt the new technology. We argue that these are the pertinent trade-offs, rather than those usually posited between climate change mitigation and adaptation. The preference for a policy response that focuses more on technological innovation rather than one that focuses on changing social behaviour will be influenced by the capacity of different societies to change their greenhouse gas emissions; by perceived vulnerability to climate impacts; and by capacity to modify social behaviour and physical environment. Starting with this complete vision of response options should enable policy makers to re-evaluate the risk environment and the set of response options available to them. From here, policy makers should consider who is responsible for making climate response decisions and when actions should be taken. Institutional arrangements dictate social and political acceptability of different policies, they structure worldviews, and they determine the provision of resources for investment in technological innovation and social change. The importance of focussing on the timing of the response is emphasised to maximise the potential for adjustments through social learning and institutional change at different policy scales. We argue that the ability to respond to climate change is both enabled and constrained by social and technological conditions. The ability of society to respond to climate change and the need for technological change for both decarbonisation and for dealing with surprise in general, are central to concepts of sustainable development.

This research focuses on the Punjab province of Pakistan and evaluates the impacts and consequences of climate change on general public at local and divisional level. In order to cope with the impacts of climatic changes at all levels, especially divisional level, raising reliable awareness and dispersing actionable knowledge regarding mitigating and adapting measures is significantly important. Therefore, recognition of information gaps, improvements in the level of alertness, and development of preventive measures in each sector is imperative. The impacts of climate change are observed across the country through gradual increase in temperature, human health issues, pest diseases, droughts, floods, and irregular weather patterns leading to changes in lifestyles, and these issues are likely to continue in the future. The main cause of climate change in Punjab, Pakistan, can be attributed to excessive release of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere due to human activities involving inefficient energy usage, rapid urban expansion, improper waste management, industrial development, increasing transportation, agricultural activities, and livestock mismanagement. The findings of this study revealed that transportation sector is the major source of GHG emissions in the country, followed by industrialization and waste, at national, as well as divisional, level. The extent of impacts of climate change at divisional level is distinguishable and displayed a direct relationship with climate, geography, variation of effects, and modes of production in various regions of Punjab. The study strategically investigated all nine divisions of the province for comprehensive understanding of climate change phenomenon, and the results indicated that nearly three-fourths of the respondents have never indulged in taking steps towards climate change mitigation and adaptation. The study adopted a mixed (qualitative and quantitative) approach where the findings can act as set of guidelines for governmental authorities in formulating, assisting in preparation, instructing, and guiding policies for climate change mitigation and adaptation at national, local, and divisional levels.","[Hussain, Mudassar] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hussain, Mudassar; Butt, Abdul Rahman] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Publ Affairs, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Hussain, Mudassar] Univ Lahore, Dept Environm Sci, Res Grp Climate Change Adaptat, Lahore 54000, Punjab, Pakistan; [Uzma, Faiza] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei Natl Lab Phys Sci Microscale, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Uzma, Faiza] Univ Sci & Technol China, Synerget Innovat Ctr Quantum Informat & Quantum P, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Ahmed, Rafay; Rehman, Abdul; Ali, Muhammad Ubaid; Ullah, Habib; Yousaf, Balal] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Earth & Space Sci, CAS Key Lab Crust Mantle Mat & Environm, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China","Nanjing University of Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; University of Lahore; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Yousaf, B (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Earth & Space Sci, CAS Key Lab Crust Mantle Mat & Environm, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China.",balal@ustc.edu.cn,"Butt, Abdul Rahman/ABE-2704-2021; Yousaf, Balal/M-7567-2015; Rehman, Abdul/HIZ-6275-2022; Rehman, Abdul/HKO-1472-2023; Ali, Muhammad Ubaid/J-9776-2019","Yousaf, Balal/0000-0003-2732-2176; Ali, Muhammad Ubaid/0000-0002-3564-213X",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41672144]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [WK2080000103]; Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) [2018FYB0002],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Chinese Academy of Science (CAS)(Chinese Academy of Sciences),This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41672144) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (WK2080000103).

Climate Ser-vices (CS) are largely acknowledged as effective tools for tackling climate risks in agriculture, particularly in semi-arid developing countries but evidences of their effectiveness are still jeopardized. In Niger a climate service (CS) has been set up in the regions of Dosso and Tillabe acute accent ri by the National Meteorological Service (NMS) to provide salient information for smallholder farmers. The CS was built on a robust collaboration among NMS, local extension services and authorities and farmers in 8 municipalities. The case study shows that a large share of farmers receives throughout the cropping season climatic information and advice via roving seminars and various media, including instant messaging services and radio broadcasts. Nevertheless, the results indicate that access to CS alone doesn't imply relevant positive impacts on crop yields while the training of farmers in the use of the information results to be a significant factor. Indeed, in 2020, yields of trained farmers are significantly higher by around 17% compared to those of non-trained ones. Training and iterative interaction between farmers and NMS could also have indirect effects on information uptake, contributing to building reciprocal trust and therefore stronger action by trained farmers. The study confirms the importance of the social learning process in CS co-development. Since the study is limited by the small sample and the dataset covering only one cropping season, further research is needed to deepen cost-benefit analysis and disentangle the relative contribution of the CS components to yield increase. Indeed, evidences of the positive impact of CS could represent a leverage for local governments and international funders to support CS co-development and related capacity building activities. Practical implication: Climate variability and a strong increase in extreme hydro meteorological events are affecting agriculture production and exacerbating food insecurity in West Africa. In Niger, the vulnerability of agricultural production systems is coupled to ecosystem fragility and soil degradation. In this area, the rural population is the most vulnerable to climate threats because they have a reduced capability to implement effective risk reduction and climate change adaptation strategies and national government has limited resources to invest in climate policies. The CS implemented for the regions of Dosso and Tillabe acute accent ri in Niger demonstrates that it is possible to set up an effective network for disseminating agrometeorological information for smallholder farmers at the municipal level with the aim of reducing the impact of climate threats on agriculture production. The information produced by the National Meteorological Service (NMS) is spread through extension services and rural radios to reach farmers. At the same time the agrometeorological field data are collected by local farmers and sent to the national service, ensuring the continuous monitoring of the cropping season. Subse-quently, the agrometeorological information is coupled with setting up roving seminars in each municipality to spread tailored advice for farmers concerning seasonal climate forecasts and to build capacities in the use of agrometeorological advices during the season. During these seminars, rain gauges are also distributed to farmers and their use explained. In this way, farmers become able to autonomously take some tactical decisions, such as better timing the sowing of crops or performing farming activities, basing these choices on direct observations. The present case study demonstrates that the mere receipt of the climate information is not clearly related to an increase in yields; contrariwise, farmers who received training on how to properly use the information, have significantly higher yields. Repeated capacity building and information distribution over the years represent an element of trust building for end users who are more prone to use these CS in their agricultural choices, integrating their traditional knowledge. The next challenge is to guarantee the sustainability of these networks over time, because, even if technology advances could reduce the costs of the production and distribution of climate services, the training activities and maintaining the rural observation network are challenging. A possible way to make it sustainable is to reinforce institutional collaboration. Moreover, the use of a participatory approach in co-designing the CS could be a key element in pursuing the active involvement of the local population and administrations and could increase their motivation in the data exchange process. Basing on obtained results, the authors recommend to pursue the development of tailored CS for smallholder farmers in similar rural contexts, since these services constitute a real contribution to climate change adaptation at the local level in rural areas and future experiences could ensure the fine tuning of the climate information products, reducing delivery costs and increasing benefits for stakeholders. Finally, it is also recommended to further assess the cost/benefit ratio of CS in order to leverage funds and ensure scaling up and sustainability.","[Bacci, M.; Zini, C.; Burrone, S.; Tarchiani, V.] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Bioecon CNR IBE, Via G Caproni 8, Florence, Italy; [Idrissa, O.

Current strategies involving protected areas are predominantly fixed in space, and may on their own be inadequate under climate change. Here, we propose a novel approach to climate adaptation that combines permanent protected areas with temporary conservation areas to create flexible networks. Previous work has tended to consider permanent and dynamic protection as separate actions, but their integration could draw on the strengths of both approaches to improve biodiversity conservation and help manage for ecological uncertainty in the coming decades. As there are often time lags in the establishment of new permanent protected areas, the inclusion of dynamic conservation areas within permanent networks could provide critical transient protection to mitigate land-use changes and biodiversity redistributions. This integrated approach may be particularly useful in highly human-modified and fragmented landscapes where areas of conservation value are limited and long-term place-based protection is unfeasible. To determine when such an approach may be feasible, we propose the use of a decision framework. Under certain scenarios, these coupled networks have the potential to increase spatio-temporal network connectivity and help maintain biodiversity and ecological processes under climate change. Implementing these networks would require multidisciplinary scientific evidence, new policies, creative funding solutions, and broader acceptance of a dynamic approach to biodiversity conservation.","[D'Aloia, Cassidy C.] Univ New Brunswick, Dept Biol Sci, St John, NB, Canada; [D'Aloia, Cassidy C.; Blackford, Christopher; Darling, Emily; Xuereb, Amanda; Fortin, Marie-Josee] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Naujokaitis-Lewis, Ilona] Carleton Univ, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Chu, Cindy] Ontario Minist Nat Resources & Forestry, Aquat Res & Monitoring Sect, Peterborough, ON, Canada; [Curtis, Janelle M.

Adapting to climate change impacts and flood mitigation has become a life critical factor as well as a severe challenge. Green infrastructure and low impact development methods are common approaches that are increasingly used to address stormwater management in developed environments. The analysis and results of this study show that AMC/IC does impact flood response even in urban developed catchments and that it can significantly impact flood responses during storm events. We show that considering AMC/ICs coupled with changes in seasonal rainfall patterns that are projected for warmer climates in the future can modulate some of the increases in flood risk due to climate change. The prevailing thought is that Antecedent Moisture Conditions (AMCs) have little to no relevance in urban hydrology, particularly in relation to climate change. However, current trends in use of stormwater management methods that depend on local storage and infiltration is increasingly making AMC or Initial Conditions (IC) a factor in urban flooding. Despite this trend there is little available literature that discuss the aspect of AMC/IC that can have an implication on urban flood management. Here, we move towards filling this gap in current literature related to impacts of AMCs in flooding of developed areas by focusing on how possible changes in seasonal rainfall patterns in a warming climate might impact AMC and starting conditions in stormwater Best Management Practices (SWBMPs), and how those changed initial conditions impact flood risk in developed areas. Using a comprehensive hydrologic/hydraulic model of an urban/developed catchment and continuous simulation, we demonstrate the importance of accurately accounting for initial conditions in flood assessments. We consider average summer temperatures based on approximately 70 years of historic data to select warm and cold years. We compare the model results between the warm and cold years as a proxy to look at trends related to a future warming climate.","[Hettiarachchi, Suresh; Sharma, Ashish] Univ New South Wales, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wasko, Conrad] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Melbourne,"Sharma, A (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",a.sharma@unsw.edu.au,"Wasko, Conrad/Y-6067-2019","Sharma, Ashish/0000-0002-6758-0519",University of Melbourne McKenzie Postdoctoral Fellowship scheme; Australian Research Council; South Washington Watershed District in Minnesota,University of Melbourne McKenzie Postdoctoral Fellowship scheme; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); South Washington Watershed District in Minnesota,Conrad Wasko acknowledges support from the University of Melbourne McKenzie Postdoctoral Fellowship scheme.

Limiting warming to 2 degrees C (or less), as envisaged in the Paris Agreement, will require a major diversion of scheduled investments in the fossil-fuel industry and other high-carbon capital infrastructure towards renewables, energy efficiency, and other low or negative carbon technologies. The article explores the scale of climate finance and investment needs embodied in the Paris Agreement. It reveals that there is little clarity in the numbers from the plethora of sources (official and otherwise) on climate finance and investment. The article compares the US$100 billion target in the Paris Agreement with a range of other financial metrics, such as investment, incremental investment, energy expenditure, energy subsidies, and welfare losses. While the relatively narrowly defined climate finance included in the US$100 billion figure is a fraction of the broader finance and investment needs of climate-change mitigation and adaptation, it is significant when compared to some estimates of the net incremental costs of decarbonization that take into account capital and operating cost savings. However, even if the annual US$100 billion materializes, achieving the much larger implied shifts in investment will require the enactment of long-term internationally coordinated policies, far more stringent than have yet been introduced.Policy relevanceMaintaining momentum towards fulfilling Article 2 of the UNFCCC - avoiding dangerous climate-change - means keeping a sense of perspective on how key financial and investment indicators of progress relate to the underlying macroeconomic reality of the task that lies ahead. There is a wide gap between the level of rhetorical commitment to mitigating and adapting to climate change evident at the Paris COP 21 Climate Summit, and countries' actual on the ground commitments to emission reduction and investment in climate resilience, and the policies to bring them about. In particular, major shifts in financial flows towards low-carbon energy (renewables and energy efficiency) will be required if this gap is to be reduced.","[Peake, Stephen] Open Univ, Fac Sci Technol Engn & Math, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England; [Ekins, Paul] UCL, UCL Inst Sustainable Resources, London, England",Open University - UK; University of London; University College London,"Peake, S (corresponding author), Open Univ, Fac Sci Technol Engn & Math, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England.",stephen.peake@open.ac.uk,,"Peake, Stephen/0000-0002-7092-006X","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/I02929X/1, EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/I02929X/1, EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),,,59,21,21,5,38,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

In urban areas, proper pruning practices can help enhance ES provided by trees, but in areas with issues of typhoons or storms, routinely intensive pruning may reduce ES. Therefore, it is critical to determine proper pruning intensity in balancing the ES provision and life/property protection. With the aim of promoting sustainable urban forestry management, we applied the i-Tree Eco to quantify ES and ES values of air pollution removal and runoff avoidance provided by a total of 87,014 Taipei street trees and developed an analytical method to estimate the potential loss caused by different pruning intensities. Based on the i-Tree Eco estimates, the Taipei street trees on average provide ES values of air pollution removal and runoff avoidance at $2.31 and $1.87 USD/tree/y, respectively. By changing the ratio of crown missing as a surrogate for different pruning intensities, we found that with a less than 25% pruning intensity, the decline ratio of ES values was relatively constant, and the potential loss was estimated at $0.47 USD/tree/y at the 25% pruning intensity. As such, in general maintenance situations, we recommend a less than 25% pruning intensity. However, during typhoon or monsoon seasons, a less than 45% pruning intensity is suggested to balance the ES provision and public safety with an estimated loss at $0.96 USD/tree/y. We also suggest creating visualization maps incorporating the potential ES and the local in situ environmental and tree conditions at a community level to support decision making for a more comprehensive management plan. Based on the framework and method developed in this study, the science-based information can be used to assist maintenance practices and highlight the potential ES values to be enhanced by choosing proper pruning intensity for a more sustainable future.","[Wei, Shuo; Cheng, Su-Ting] Natl Taiwan Univ, Sch Forestry & Resource Conservat, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Cheng, ST (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Sch Forestry & Resource Conservat, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",b04605019@ntu.edu.tw; chengsuting@ntu.edu.tw,,"Wei, Shuo/0000-0002-9840-8949; CHENG, SU-TING/0000-0003-1786-6049","Belmont Forum, Urban Europe [730254]; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C.

Using an integrated modeling approach, General Circulation Model (GCM) datasets; the Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques Climate Model 5 (CNRM-CM5), the Community Earth System Model, version 1-Biogeochemistry (CESM1- BGC.1), and the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 2 (HADGEM2-AO.1), under medium Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5, and based on World Climate Research Program (WCRP)'s Couple Model Intercomparison Phase 5 (CMIP5), were assimilated into calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Mann-Kendall and Theil Sen's slope were used to assess the trends and magnitude of variability of the historical climate data used for setting up the model. The model calibration showed goodness of fit with minimum Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficient values of 0.83 and Coefficient of Determination (R-2) of 0.88 for the three gages within the ARB. Next, the research assessed changes in streamflow for the years 2045 and 2075 against that of the reference baseline year of 1980. The results indicate situations of likely increase and decrease in mean monthly streamflow discharge and increase in the frequency and variability in peak flows during the periods from the mid to end of the 21st century. Seasonally, monthly streamflow increases between 50% and 250% were found for spring and autumn months with decreases in summer months for 2045. Spring and summer months for 2075 resulted in increased monthly streamflow between 50% and 300%, while autumn and spring months experienced decreased streamflow. While the results are prone to inherent uncertainties in the downscaled GCM data used, the simulated dynamics in streamflow and water availability provide critical information for stakeholders to develop sustainable water management and climate change adaptation options for the ARB.","[Quansah, Joseph E.; Fall, Souleymane; Ankumah, Ramble; Afandi, Gamal El] Tuskegee Univ, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, Tuskegee, AL 36088 USA; [Naliaka, Amina B.] Southern Illinois Univ, Sch Earth Syst & Sustainabil, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA",Tuskegee University; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Quansah, JE (corresponding author), Tuskegee Univ, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, Tuskegee, AL 36088 USA.",jquansah@tuskegee.edu; amina.naliaka@siu.edu; sfall@tuskegee.edu; rankumah@tuskegee.edu; gelafandi@tuskegee.edu,"El Afandi, Gamal/AAZ-4973-2021","El Afandi, Gamal/0000-0002-5235-026X","USDA-NIFA [1001194]; NIFA [689305, 1001194] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",USDA-NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"This research supported by USDA-NIFA, grant number 1001194.",,61,7,7,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,APR,2021,9,4,,,,,,,55,10.3390/cli9040055,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli9040055,,,19,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,RR2GI,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000642923100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The '4 per 1000' (4p1000) initiative launched at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris aims at increasing global SOC stocks in 0-40 cm depth by annually 4 parts per thousand in order to compensate the increase of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. In this study we analysed the feasibility of this target for agricultural soils in Bavaria, Southeast Germany. Assuming a total organic carbon (OC) amount of 276 Tg currently stored in the upper 40 cm of agricultural soils in Bavaria (cropland and grassland), the 4p1000 goal corresponds to an annual carbon (C) sequestration of 1.1 Tg. Based on a site-specific analysis of present soil management, we developed spatially explicit C sequestration scenarios including five promising management practices (cover cropping, improved crop rotation, organic farming, agroforestry and conversion of arable land to grassland). The results revealed that the 4p1000 target is not feasible for Bavaria. The total potential of the five practices to sequester C resulted in increases in 0.3 to 0.4 Tg OC per year corresponding to around l parts per thousand of the present SOC stocks. Expansion of cover crops and agroforestry were identified as most promising options to increase SOC in agricultural soils. Although only around 1.5% of Bavaria's yearly GHG emissions would be compensated, this represents an essential contribution to climate change mitigation. Besides the need to develop new incentive systems (particularly for agroforestry), implementation of networks including farms and/or field trials that demonstrate improved soil management practices would be required to inform farmers and other stakeholders about the benefits of such practices. To maintain a resilient agriculture that withstands more extreme weather conditions in the future, healthy soils are needed. We therefore conclude that expected positive effects of a SOC stock increase on nutrient and water storage, soil erosion, biodiversity and food security are crucial for climate change adaptation.","[Wiesmeier, Martin; Burmeister, Johannes] Bavarian State Res Ctr Agr, Inst Organ Farming Soil & Resource Management, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Wiesmeier, Martin; Mayer, Stefanie; Koegel-Knabner, Ingrid] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Chair Soil Sci, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Huebner, Rico] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Chair Strateg Landscape Planning & Management, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Koegel-Knabner, Ingrid] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Adv Study, Garching, Germany",Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich,"Wiesmeier, M (corresponding author), Bavarian State Res Ctr Agr, Inst Organ Farming Soil & Resource Management, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",martin.wiesmeier@lfl.bayern.de,"Hübner, Rico/P-5931-2014; Kögel-Knabner, Ingrid/A-7905-2008; Wiesmeier, Martin/N-3066-2014; Burmeister, Johannes/AAT-7835-2020","Hübner, Rico/0000-0002-4046-2512; Kögel-Knabner, Ingrid/0000-0002-7216-8326; Wiesmeier, Martin/0000-0003-3981-5461; Mayer, Stefanie/0000-0002-3541-8744",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [031B0511C],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"We would like to thank Haruki Sakamoto for GIS analyses and Robert Brandhuber and Annette Freibauer for helpful discussions.

In recent decades, residential buildings have become the focus of energy efficiency and cost savings programs and initiatives. Residential buildings can also mitigate high indoor temperatures and heat-related health impacts, but these heat adaptation interventions have not been fully evaluated for their potential energy, climate, and health benefits. We aimed to quantify the health and climate benefits of energy and indoor temperature reductions that result from heat adaptation strategies applied to residential (specifically single-family detached built between 1990 and 2010) buildings in 10 U.S. cities. Building energy models were used to simulate energy reduction retrofits, including changing roof reflectivity, adding window overhangs, improving window properties, and roof/wall insulation, as well as the addition of shade trees and indoor phase change materials. We used the building simulation results to estimate attendant reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) and criteria air pollution (AP) emissions from the electrical grid, and used the damage estimates to evaluate the resulting climate and health benefits. Under light and deep retrofit scenarios, respectively, we estimate that the simulated heat adaptation retrofits in this subset of relatively new buildings have the potential to yield $1.10 or $1.57 billion in direct utilities savings. There is an additional $462.9 million ($301.3-$909.9 million) or $692.8 million ($442.6 million-$1.385 billion) in climate and health benefits, due to avoided GHG and AP emissions. Put simply, the climate and health benefits may account for an additional 42-44% of the direct utility savings, on average. Climate and health benefits were generally highest for adaptations simulated in hot climates (Dallas, TX and Houston, TX) or in areas with dirtier fuel mixes (Chicago, IL and Philadelphia, PA). When climate and health savings are included, the payback periods of these interventions can decrease by nearly half. We also discuss the potential additional health benefits of reducing indoor temperatures during extreme heat. These significant savings from avoided climate and public health damages should be factored into climate change adaptation decision making by stakeholders and policymakers.","[Williams, Augusta A.; Cedeno-Laurent, Jose G.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Williams, Augusta A.; Buonocore, Jonathan J.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Climate Hlth & Global Environm, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Baniassadi, Amir; Gonzalez, Pablo Izaga; Samuelson, Holly W.] Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Design, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,"Williams, AA (corresponding author), Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Williams, AA (corresponding author), Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Climate Hlth & Global Environm, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",auw882@mail.harvard.edu,,"Williams, Augusta/0000-0002-1496-8931",Harvard University Climate Change Solutions Fund,Harvard University Climate Change Solutions Fund,This research was funded by the Harvard University Climate Change Solutions Fund.,,74,1,1,2,3,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9634,,FRONT SUSTAIN CITIES,Front.

This analysis of the literature, using a new methodological framework, highlights priority focus areas for a sub-national government response to health and climate change, using the Western Cape (WC) province of South Africa as a case study. Methods: A methodological framework was created to conduct a review of priority focus areas relevant for subnational governments. The framework encompassed the establishment of a Project Steering Group consisting of relevant, sub-national stakeholders (e. g. provincial officials, public and environmental health specialists and academics); an analysis of local climatic projections as well as an analysis of global, national and sub-national health risk factors and impacts. Results: Globally, the discussion of health and climate change adaptation strategies in sub-national, or provincial government is often limited. For the case study presented, multiple health risk factors were identified. WC climatic projections include a warmer and potentially drier future with an increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. WC government priority focus areas requiring further research on health risk factors include: population migration and environmental refugees, land use change, violence and human conflict and vulnerable groups. WC government priority focus areas for further research on health impacts include: mental ill-health, non-communicable diseases, injuries, poisonings (e. g. pesticides), food and nutrition insecurity-related diseases, water-and food-borne diseases and reproductive health. These areas are currently under-addressed, or not addressed at all, in the current provincial climate change strategy. Conclusions: Sub-national government adaptation strategies often display limited discussion on the health and climate change intersect. The methodological framework presented in this case study can be globally utilized by other sub-national governments for decision-making and development of climate change and health adaptation strategies. Additionally, due to the broad range of sectoral issues identified, a primary recommendation from this study is that sub-national governments internationally should consider a  health and climate change in all policies approach when developing adaptation and mitigation strategies to address climate change.","[Godsmark, Christie Nicole; Irlam, James; Rother, Hanna-Andrea] Univ Cape Town, Sch Publ Hlth & Family Med, Div Environm Hlth, Cape Town, South Africa; [Irlam, James] Univ Cape Town, Primary Hlth Care Directorate, Cape Town, South Africa; [van der Merwe, Frances] Western Cape Govt, Dept Environm Affairs & Dev Planning, Cape Town, South Africa; [New, Mark] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa; [New, Mark] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich, Norfolk, England",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town; University of East Anglia,"Rother, HA (corresponding author), Div Environm Hlth, Entrance 5 Falmouth Bldg,Anzio Rd, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa.",andrea.rother@uct.ac.za,"Godsmark, Christie/AAN-1283-2020; New, Mark/A-7684-2008; Rother, Hanna-Andrea/ABB-1037-2020","Godsmark, Christie/0000-0003-1636-2842; New, Mark/0000-0001-6082-8879; Rother, Hanna-Andrea/0000-0001-5292-8909",Cape Higher Education Consortium; Western Cape Government,Cape Higher Education Consortium; Western Cape Government,The Cape Higher Education Consortium and the Western Cape Government provided funding for this research.

Their vulnerability to climate change arises in part from their contexts of living in many of the harshest and isolated environments. Their resilience originates from their accumulated knowledge of specific environments over millennia, mediated through sui generis cultural institutions. Our results illustrate that indigenous groups primarily perceive uncertainties related to volition of actors and institutions. When they are involved in climate adaptation planning in ways that mobilise their cultural institutions and knowledge, they can safely manage these uncertainties through their agency to determine and control key risks. We demonstrate that climate justice approaches can be strengthened for indigenous peoples by applying a linked vulnerability-resilience analytical framework. This enables stronger consideration of how unique cultural institutions and knowledge, which are not available to all vulnerable groups, affect indigenous perceptions of uncertainty in climate adaptation planning. We use this analytical approach in a case study with Yuibera and Koinmerburra Traditional Owner groups within the Great Barrier Reef Catchment. We conclude that a specific focus on sui generis indigenous knowledge and cultural institutions as a source of resilience can strengthen climate justice approaches and work more effectively with indigenous peoples in climate change contexts.","[Lyons, Ilisapeci; Hill, Rosemary] CSIRO, Land & Water, POB 12139, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia; [Hill, Rosemary] James Cook Univ, Div Trop Environm & Soc, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Deshong, Samaria] Koinmerburra Aboriginal Corp, Manunda, Qld, Australia; [Mooney, Gary] Yuibera Aboriginal Corp, Mackay, Qld, Australia; [Turpin, Gerry] Dept Sci Informat Technol Innovat & Arts, Cairns, Qld, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); James Cook University,"Lyons, I (corresponding author), CSIRO, Land & Water, POB 12139, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia.",Ilisapeci.Lyons@csiro.au,"Hill, Rosemary/A-6954-2011; Lyons, Ilisapeci L/I-3085-2013","Hill, Rosemary/0000-0002-7426-3132; Turpin, GERALD/0000-0002-5663-2133",CSIRO Indigenous Futures; NESP Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub; CSIRO Great Barrier Reef Intiatives,CSIRO Indigenous Futures; NESP Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub; CSIRO Great Barrier Reef Intiatives,I would like to acknowledge the programs that funded open access of our paper.

Academics and practitioners, however, confront limits and barriers to the adaptation both in theory and practice. Despite the extensive efforts in understanding limits and barriers, little is still known about political and institutional barriers, more specifically political challenges in Indigenous communities that typically nullify the effect of adaptation strategies. This study investigates the experience of the Mohawk community of Kanesatake, a First Nations community in Canada, during and after the 2017 and the 2019 floods in Quebec. Results reveal the links between the proximate set of barriers and historical, political pressures in Indigenous communities. Findings explain that unhealed wounds in relationships among nations generate political and institutional hurdles, which eventually orchestrate the co-occurrence of multiple barriers: the lack of land ownership rights, insurance, and social institutions such as police force and firefighters, to name a few. Findings have implications both for theory and practice. In theory, the findings reveal the fact that barriers are not mutually exclusive; in fact, they are often interdependent. In practice, findings support the fact that policies fail if they disregard underlying interdependencies.","[Fayazi, Mahmood] Sichuan Univ, Inst Disaster Management & Reconstruct, 122 Huanghe Middle Rd Sect 1, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Fayazi, Mahmood] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, 122 Huanghe Middle Rd Sect 1, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Bisson, Isabelle-Anne] TerraHumana Solut, Baie Durfe, PQ, Canada; [Nicholas, Eugene] Mohawk Council Kanesatake, Oka, PQ, Canada",Sichuan University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Fayazi, M (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Inst Disaster Management & Reconstruct, 122 Huanghe Middle Rd Sect 1, Chengdu, Peoples R China.;Fayazi, M (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, 122 Huanghe Middle Rd Sect 1, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",mahmood.fayazi@umontreal.ca; ibisson@terrahumanasolutions.com; eugenenicholas@hotmail.com,,,"Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities in Sichuan, China","Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities in Sichuan, China","This work was partially supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities in Sichuan, China.",,77,9,9,4,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

Compounding these problems are the stressors associated with economic development in the region. The U.S. Virgin Islands are particularly threatened by the complex problems these two issues present as the pressures of increasing tourism threaten vital natural resources, making sustainable economic diversification necessary. As the U.S. Virgin Islands creates economic development and climate adaptation plans, it is also important to understand how local stakeholders are included in the planning process. Research on community engagement can help reveal whether planning is being done equitably. To analyze these problems, this study examined news discourse around the issues of climate change, economic development, and community engagement. By understanding discourse in local media, this study aims to evaluate the construction of knowledge regarding these issues and demonstrate areas of deficiency that should be addressed. This study took quantitative and qualitative approaches to analyze how these issues were discussed in relation to one another and examined these trends in the context of existing policies and challenges being faced by the territory. This study concludes by providing valuable insights for decision-makers to craft strategies informed by the media presentation and associated public perceptions of these issues.","[Rudge, Kieren] Yale Sch Environm, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",,"Rudge, K (corresponding author), Yale Sch Environm, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",Kieren.rudge@yale.edu,"Rudge, Kieren/GYA-2936-2022","Rudge, Kieren/0000-0003-1501-1696",,,,,31,0,0,2,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

We also reviewed Nordic national tourism strategies from the perspective of climate change, particularly the extent to which they address climate adaptation. We found out that the national climate strategies do not pay enough attention to tourism adaptation needs, nor do the national tourism strategies present adaptation actions that tourism actors could consider. To connect these national-level strategies, there is a need to review adaptation actions for tourism within the national adaptation framework supported by research based evidence. Next, by means of Nordic cooperation, guidance for both public and private tourism actors within and across Nordic countries can be provided.

There are three main challenges when evaluating a CABE for energy performance that are not overcome by the currently accepted process: (1) representing complex three-dimensional dynamic geometry; (2) generating various candidate CABE control scenarios by integrating environmental factors and their thresholds; and (3) representing a CABE's time-varying behavior within a single building energy model (BEM). To overcome these challenges, the PBM method was developed. This method makes two key contributions to the field of performance-driven building design. First, it is capable of generating hourly CABE operation scenarios to evaluate CABE performance using a single BEM, regardless of dynamic operation and any geometric complexity. Second, the PBM method is superior at handling the effects of thermal energy storage with dynamic operations than is the currently accepted process. The reliability of the PBM method was validated by comparing indoor temperature profiles obtained from a PBM and the existing method. The new method enables designers to integrate the energy performance of a CABE system with multiple control scenarios, ultimately improving the building design process. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, the information on the future spatial-temporal patterns of land desertification under climate change has been rarely explored, which restricts the proposal of reasonable desertification control coun-termeasures to adapt to climate change. The agro-pastoral ecotone in northern China (APENC) is the most critical eco-environmental barrier in China and is also a climate change-sensitive area prone to aeolian desertification. We quan-titatively assessed the risk of aeolian desertification in the APENC to climate change and social-economic development in the near-term (2010-2039), mid-term (2040-2069) and long-term (2070-2099) by integrating the representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios and the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios using a data-mining approach. The C5.0 decision tree algorithm demonstrated acceptable reliability in aeolian desertification classifica-tion. Aeolian desertification in the APENC shows a significant persistent decreasing trend in 2010-2099 under RCP2.6-SSP1 and RCP8.5-SSP3 scenarios, whereas first increased in mid-term then decreased under RCP6.0-SSP2 sce-narios. Aeolian desertification risk is lowest under the RCP2.6-SSP1 scenarios, while it is highest under the RCP6.0-SSP2 scenarios. With climate change and socioeconomic development, the risk of aeolian desertification in APENC was generally dominated by a slight grade, i.e., >70 %.

While everyone is vulnerable to these impacts, the health and wellbeing of children are disproportionately affected. We carried out a study composed of two major components. The first component is an environmental epidemiology study comprised of three sub-studies: (i) a global climate model (GCM) simulating specific health-sector climate indices; (ii) a time-series study to estimate the risk of childhood respiratory disease attributable to ambient air pollution; and (iii) a case-crossover study to identify the association between haze and under-five mortality in Malaysia. The GCM found that Malaysia has been experiencing increasing rainfall intensity over the years, leading to increased incidences of other weather-related events. The time-series study revealed that air quality has worsened, while air pollution and haze have been linked to an increased risk of hospitalization for respiratory diseases among children. Although no clear association between haze and under-five mortality was found in the case-crossover study, the lag patterns suggested that health effects could be more acute if haze occurred over a longer duration and at a higher intensity. The second component consists of three community surveys on marginalized children conducted (i) among the island community of Pulau Gaya, Sabah; (ii) among the indigenous Temiar tribe in Pos Kuala Mu, Perak; and (iii) among an urban poor community (B40) in PPR Sg. Bonus, Kuala Lumpur. The community surveys are cross-sectional studies employing a socio-ecological approach using a standardized questionnaire. The community surveys revealed how children adapt to climate change and environmental degradation. An integrated model was established that consolidates our overall research processes and demonstrates the crucial interconnections between environmental challenges exacerbated by climate change. It is recommended that Malaysian schools adopt a climate-smart approach to education to instill awareness of the impending climate change and its cascading impact on children's health from early school age.","[Sahani, Mazrura; Othman, Hidayatulfathi; Kwan, Soo Chen; Mamood, Siti Nur Hanis; Karim, Norhafizah; Wahab, Muhammad Ikram A.; Zulfakar, Siti Shahara; Rosli, Yanti] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Hlth Sci, Ctr Toxicol & Hlth Risk Studies CORE, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Juneng, Liew] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Sci & Technol, Ctr Earth Sci & Environm, Bangi, Malaysia; [Ibrahim, Mohd Faiz; Hod, Rozita] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Med, Dept Community Hlth, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Zaini, Zul'Izzat Ikhwan] Univ Teknol Mara, Fac Hlth Sci, Penang Branch, George Town, Malaysia; [Mustafa, Maizatun] Int Islamic Univ, Legal Practice Dept, Ahmad Ibrahim Kulliyyah Laws, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Nnafie, Issmail] UNICEF Malaysia, Climate & Environm, Putrajaya, Malaysia; [Ching, Lai Che; Dambul, Ramzah] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Fac Humanities Arts & Heritage, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia; [Varkkey, Helena] Univ Malaya, Dept Int & Strateg Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Phung, Vera Ling Hui] Natl Inst Environm Studies NIES, Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, Tsukuba, Japan; [Abu Bakar, Nur Faizah] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Hlth Sci, Ctr Diagnost Therapeaut & Invest Studies CODTIS, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi MARA; International Islamic University Malaysia; Universiti Malaysia Sabah; Universiti Malaya; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Rosli, Y (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Hlth Sci, Ctr Toxicol & Hlth Risk Studies CORE, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",yanti_rosli@ukm.edu.my,"Zaini, Zul Izzat Ikhwan/AGR-0696-2022; IBRAHIM, MOHD FAIZ/S-1011-2018; Varkkey, Helena/K-7934-2012","Varkkey, Helena/0000-0002-4622-0450; Phung, Vera Phung Ling Hui/0000-0003-2669-4891; Othman, Hidayatulfathi/0000-0002-1430-3438",UNICEF Malaysia [(UKM-NN-2020-041]; Universiti Kebangsaaan Malaysia;  [MLY/PCA202027/PD202021],UNICEF Malaysia; Universiti Kebangsaaan Malaysia; ,This research was funded by UNICEF Malaysia (Award No: MLY/PCA202027/PD202021) and co-funded by Universiti Kebangsaaan Malaysia (UKM-NN-2020-041) for the project Analysis of Impacts of Climate Change and Environmental Degradation on Children in Malaysia and Assessment of Child Sensitivity of Current Adaptation and Mitigation Policies.,,65,0,0,5,5,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-2565,,FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH,Front.

In order to achieve high-stable yield, it is crucial to acknowledge the impacts of mean climate and extreme climate indices on soybean yield and yield components. In this study, based on the weather data from 61 counties from 1981 to 2017 in Northeast China, we assessed the impacts ofmean climate and extreme climate indices on soybean observed yield and simulated yield. Mean climate include effective growing degree days (GDD(10)), precipitation (Pre), and solar radiation (SR); extreme climate indices include the number of cool days during seed-filling period (C-15), the number of cool days during 15 days before anthesis (C-17), the number of hot days (H-30), maximum amount of 5 Day accumulated precipitation (P-5), and consecutive dry days (CDD)). We used the DSSAT-CROPGRO-Soybean model to identify the main yield components for soybean. The results showed that observed soybean yield reduced by 3.57% due to the collective changes in the eight study climate indices. Increases in GDD(10), decreases in Pre, and decreases in SR caused a 3.96%, -3.89%, and - 0.48% change in soybean yield, respectively. Decreases in C-15 and C-17 led to a 5.36% increase in soybean yield; increases in H-30, P-5, and CDD caused a 5.75%, 0.30%, and 1.14% reduction in soybean yield, respectively. By comparing the response of observed and simulated soybean yield to climate indices (excluding P-5) in the DSSAT-CROPGRO-Soybean model, we identified the key yield components for soybean as the number of pods and seed weight. The negative impacts on the number of pods and seed weight were mainly attributed to changes in Pre and H-30 from anthesis to podding and during seed-filling period. Our results could be used to assist the local soybean community adapt to climate change.","[Guo, Shibo; Guo, Erjing; Zhang, Zhentao; Dong, Meiqi; Wang, Xi; Fu, Zhenzhen; Guan, Kaixin; Zhang, Wenmeng; Zhang, Wenjing; Zhao, Jin; Liu, Zhijuan; Zhao, Chuang; Yang, Xiaoguang] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Yang, XG (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",gsb@cau.edu.cn; guoej@cau.edu.cn; zhangzhentao@cau.edu.cn; dongmeiqi@cau.edu.cn; xiwang@cau.edu.cn; fuzhenzhen@cau.edu.cn; gkx0119@cau.edu.cn; zhangwm@cau.edu.cn; 1945181423@qq.com; jinzhao@cau.edu.cn; zhijuanliu@cau.edu.cn; zhaochuang@cau.edu.cn; yangxg@cau.edu.cn,"yang, xiao/HJI-7815-2023",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [31471408]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFA0607402],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China,"This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 31471408), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2019YFA0607402) and the 2115 Talent Development Program of China Agricultural University.",,51,3,3,31,46,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

The geographic coverage of the literature is global but with specific examples from India. The information presented in this paper is derived from diverse sources including journal articles and thematic books, and indicates severe adverse impacts not only on women's livelihood opportunities but also on exacerbating the workload and fatigue while decreasing their self esteem and forcing them to undertake some high risks and hazardous activities. The literature indicates that poverty, gender inequality, insecure land rights, heavy reliance on agriculture, less access to education and information are among the principal reasons for their vulnerability to climate change. The vulnerability is also confounded by the meager asset base, social marginalization, lack of mobility and exclusion from the decision-making processes in response to a disaster. However, the literature also shows that women are not only the passive victims of climate change but are also pro-active and agents of hope for adaptation to and mitigation of abrupt climate change. They utilize their experience and expertise to reduce the adverse impacts by adopting prudent strategies. They are also concerned about environmental issues, and are highly supportive of policies regarding environmental restoration. Large knowledge gaps exist regarding the vulnerability of women to changing and uncertain climate especially in arid regions. Authors of this article suggest some action plans and strategies to minimize vulnerability to climate change such as empowering women economically and educationally, organizing training and outreach programmes, and involving them in formal climate change mitigation and adaptation policies and programmes. Authors also outline research needed in order to identify and implement strategies regarding climate change. Collective and continuous efforts are critical to finding the sustainable solutions for this global phenomenon which is adversely impacting the most vulnerable but critically important members of the society.

To this end, climate projections based on a five -member transient climate change simulation ensemble, performed using a state-of-the art regional climate model, spanning the 1991-2050 period, corresponding to the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 emis-sion scenario are used. A reanalysis-driven simulation for the 1991-2010 period compared against available observations confirm suitability of the model for application in climate change simulations. Assessment of projected changes to mine-relevant climate variables that are important from structural integrity and operation perspectives reveal potential vulnerabilities and opportunities. Active layer thickness increases in the 0.3-2 m range in permafrost regions, coupled with increases in flood probability, as reflected in snow-melt rate increases in the 0.14-6.77% range and increases in the 100-year return levels of daily maximum rainfall in the 5-50% range, suggest potential impacts on the structural integrity of mine infrastructure, such as slope instability and foundation settlement of tailings dams, and supporting infrastructure such as ice/all-season roads. Increases in soil moisture, projected in the 0-11% range, at a few mines, suggest potential impacts on material handling systems, such as increases in the traction factor of the muck-haul and tire rolling resistance, that can lead to low productivity. Projected increases to wind speeds in the 5-10% range for the northernmost regions suggest po-tential impacts on the tailings management facility in terms of increases in tailings resuspension. Overall, this study identified northernmost and northeastern mines to be more vulnerable, with air/soil temperature, pre-cipitation and wind speed being the most influential climate variables. This systematic study, for the first time, has identified potential vulnerabilities of northern Canadian mines, which can inform future high-resolution climate modelling and detailed at-site climate-mine interaction studies that is required for climate-change adaptation related decision-making.","[Hashem, Khalil; Sushama, Laxmi] McGill Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Hashem, Khalil; Sushama, Laxmi; Sasmito, Agus P.; Hassani, Ferri; Kumral, Mustafa] McGill Univ, Trottier Inst Sustainabil Engn & Design, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Sasmito, Agus P.; Hassani, Ferri; Kumral, Mustafa] McGill Univ, Dept Min & Mat Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University; McGill University; McGill University,"Hashem, K (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",khalil.hashem@mail.mcgill.ca,,,FRQNT Development Durable du Secteur Minier-II [2020-MN-284402]; ArcelorMittal Canada,FRQNT Development Durable du Secteur Minier-II; ArcelorMittal Canada,The GEM simulations used in this study were performed on supercomputers managed by Calcul Quebec and Compute Canada.

A projected 1-3.5 degrees C rise in average global temperatures by 2100 could exacerbate the epidemics by modifying disease transmission thresholds. Future malaria scenarios for the Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) are quantified for projected climate scenarios spanning 2006-2100. Methods Regression relationships are established between historical (1995-2010) clinical malaria and anaemia cases and rainfall and temperature for four East African malaria hotspots. The vector autoregressive moving average processes model, VARMAX (p,q,s), is then used to forecast malaria and anaemia responses to rainfall and temperatures projected with an ensemble of eight General Circulation Models (GCMs) for climate change scenarios defined by three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5). Results Maximum temperatures in the long rainy (March-May) and dry (June-September) seasons will likely increase by over 2.0 degrees C by 2070, relative to 1971-2000, under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5. Minimum temperatures (June-September) will likely increase by over 1.5-3.0 degrees C under RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5. The short rains (OND) will likely increase more than the long rains (MAM) by the 2050s and 2070s under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5. Historical malaria cases are positively and linearly related to the 3-6-month running means of monthly rainfall and maximum temperature. Marked variation characterizes the patterns projected for each of the three scenarios across the eight General Circulation Models, reaffirming the importance of using an ensemble of models for projections. Conclusions The short rains (OND), wet season (MAM) temperatures and clinical malaria cases will likely increase in the Lake Victoria Basin. Climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, including malaria control interventions could reduce the projected epidemics and cases. Interventions should reduce emerging risks, human vulnerability and environmental suitability for malaria transmission.","[Ototo, Ednah N.; Kamau, Lucy] Kenyatta Univ, POB 43844, Nairobi, Kenya; [Ototo, Ednah N.; Githeko, Andrew] Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Ctr Global Hlth Res, Climate & Human Hlth Res Unit, POB 1578, Kisumu, Kenya; [Ogutu, Joseph O.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci 340, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Said, Mohammed Y.; Simiyu, Stella; Mutimba, Stephen] C&E Advisory Kenya, POB 76406-00508, Nairobi, Kenya; [Namanya, Didacus] Uganda Minist Hlth, POB 7272, Kampala, Uganda; [Said, Mohammed Y.] Univ Nairobi, Inst Climate Change & Adaptat, POB 30197, Nairobi 00100, Kenya",Kenyatta University; Kenya Medical Research Institute; University Hohenheim; University of Nairobi,"Ogutu, JO (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci 340, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",ednaototo@gmail.com; jogutu2007@gmail.com; githeko@yahoo.com; msaid362@gmail.com; kamau.lucym@ku.ac.ke; namanyabd2@gmail.com; stella.wattimah@eclimateadvisory.com; stephen.mutimba@eclimateadvisory.com,,"Ogutu, Joseph O/0000-0002-7379-0387","Projekt DEAL; International Development Research Center/Department for International Development IDRC/DFID (CCAA) [104707-001]; German Research Foundation (DFG Grant) [257734638]; USAID/Kenya and East Africa Planning for Resilience in East Africa through Policy, Adaptation, Research and Economic Development (PREPARED); European Union [641918]","Projekt DEAL; International Development Research Center/Department for International Development IDRC/DFID (CCAA); German Research Foundation (DFG Grant)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); USAID/Kenya and East Africa Planning for Resilience in East Africa through Policy, Adaptation, Research and Economic Development (PREPARED); European Union(European Commission)","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

This paper investigates the atmospheric circulation processes associated with climate model biases in CB rainfall, and explores drivers of projected rainfall changes. Here we use an ensemble of simulations from the Swedish Regional Climate Model ( RCM) RCA4, driven by eight General Circulation Models ( GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 ( CMIP5), for the 1.5. C and 2. C global warming levels ( GWLs), and under the representative concentration pathways ( RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. RCA4 captures reasonably well the observed patterns of CB rainfall seasonality, but shows dry biases independent of seasons and large scale driving atmospheric conditions. While simulations mimic observed peaks in transition seasons ( March- May and September- November), the rain- belt is misplaced southward ( northward) in December- February ( June- August), reducing the latitudinal extent of rainfall. Moreover, ERA- Interim reanalysis driven RCM simulation and RCM- GCM combinations show similar results, indicating the dominance of systematic biases. Modelled dry biases are associated with dry upper- tropospheric layers, resulting from a western outflow stronger than the eastern inflow and related to the northern component of African Easterly Jet. From the analysis of the climate change signal, we found that regional scale responses to anthropogenic forcings vary across GWLs and seasons. Changes of rainfall and moisture divergence are correlated, with values higher in March- May than in September- November, and larger for global warming of 2.0. C than at 1.5. C. There is an increase of zonal moisture divergence fluxes in upper atmospheric layers ( > 700 hPa) under RCP8.5 compared to RCP4.5. Moreover, it is found that additional warming of 0.5. C will change the hydrological cycle and water availability in the CB, with potential to cause challenges to water resource management, agriculture, hydro- power generation, sanitation and ecosystems.","[Tamoffo, Alain T.; Pokam, Wilfried M.; Vondou, Derbetini A.; Fotso-Nguemo, Thierry C.; Guenang, Guy Merlin; Kamsu-Tamo, Pierre H.; Tchotchou, Lucie A.

To avoid production losses and make use of emerging potentials, adaptations in agricultural management will inevitably be required. Adaptation responses can broadly be distinguished into (1) short-term incremental responses that farmers often choose autonomously in response to observed changes and based on local knowledge and experiences, and (2) long-term transformative responses that require strategic planning, and which are usually implemented at a larger spatial scale. Models can be used to support decision making at both response levels; thereby, different features of models prove more or less valuable depending on the type of adaptation response. This paper presents a systematic literature review on the state-of-the-art in modelling for adaptation planning in agricultural production systems, investigating the question of which model types can be distinguished and how these types differ in the way they support decision making in agricultural adaptation planning. Five types of models are distinguished: (1) empirical crop models; (2) regional suitability models; (3) biophysical models; (4) meta-models; and (5) decision models. The potential and limitations of these model types for providing decision-support to short-and long-term adaptation planning are discussed. The risk of maladaptation-adaptation that implies negative consequences either in the long term or in a wider context-is identified as a key challenge of adaptation planning that needs more attention. Maladaptation is not only a risk of decision making in the face of incomplete knowledge of future climate impacts on the agricultural production system; but it can also be a threat if the connectedness of the agroecosystem is not sufficiently acknowledged when management adaptations are implemented. Future research supporting climate change adaptation efforts should thus be based on integrated assessments of risk and vulnerabilities (considering climate variability and uncertainty). To secure adaptation success in the long term, frameworks for monitoring management adaptations and their consequences should be institutionalised.","[Holzkamper, Annelie] Agroscope, Climate & Air Pollut Grp, Agroecol & Environm Dept, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Holzkamper, Annelie] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; University of Bern,"Holzkamper, A (corresponding author), Agroscope, Climate & Air Pollut Grp, Agroecol & Environm Dept, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.;Holzkamper, A (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",annelie.holzkaemper@agroscope.admin.ch,,,,,,,76,22,22,1,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,OCT,2017,7,10,,,,,,,86,10.3390/agriculture7100086,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture7100086,,,15,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,FT9SW,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000423492800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using a calibrated rainfall-runoff(R-R) model, the baseline runoff scenario was first simulated. The R-R inputs (rainfall and temperature) were then perturbed using plausible delta-changes to produce simulated climate change runoff scenarios. Stochastic models of the runoff were developed and used to generate ensembles of both the current and climate-change-perturbed future runoff scenarios. The resulting runoff ensembles were used to force simulation models of the behaviour of the reservoir to produce 'populations' of required reservoir storage capacity to meet demands, and the performance. Comparing these parameters between the current and the perturbed provided the population of climate change effects which was then analysed to determine the variability in the impacts. The methodology was applied to the Pong reservoir on the Beas River in northern India. The reservoir serves irrigation and hydropower needs and the hydrology of the catchment is highly influenced by Himalayan seasonal snow and glaciers, and Monsoon rainfall, both of which are predicted to change due to climate change. The results show that required reservoir capacity is highly variable with a coefficient of variation (CV) as high as 0.3 as the future climate becomes drier. Of the performance indices, the vulnerability recorded the highest variability (CV up to 0.5) while the volume-based reliability was the least variable. Such variabilities or uncertainties will, no doubt, complicate the development of climate change adaptation measures; however, knowledge of their sheer magnitudes as obtained in this study will help in the formulation of appropriate policy and technical interventions for sustaining and possibly enhancing water security for irrigation and other uses served by Pong reservoir.

This represents a change from traditional planning approaches centred on motorized road traffic/infrastructure provision and a shift towards more sustainable transport options. SUMPs require a long-term and sustainable vision for cities and these are to pay special attention to the participation of citizens and stakeholders and to coordination of policies across sectors (transport, land use, health, energy, and so on). The EC guidelines on developing and implementing SUMPs (EC, 2013) establish the following primary objectives of this new way of planning urban mobility: accessibility and quality of life, as well as sustainability, economic viability, social equity, health and environment quality. Since urban areas in Europe account for 23%-25% of CO2 emissions from transport (EC, 2013b; EEA, 2014), SUMPs are expected to contribute to meet longterm climate change policy goals. However, it is less clear how SUMPs can contribute to address key societal challenges such as equity issues in accessibility. According to the EC guidelines SUMPs are still non-existing concepts in most European member states. However, several cities in Europe and beyond have already formulated and adopted SUMPs. This paper is built on a review of former voluntary SUMPs developed in Portugal. A sample of forty case studies is considered in the analysis. It aims: a) to understand how climate change goals and equity issues in accessibility have been addressed through the first generation of SUMPs; b) to reflect on the role of SUMPs as tools to answer climate change goals without putting at risk social equity issues, and c) to outline further research needs in the SUMP approach. The research results are expected to give insights into social equity needs in urban transport and climate change adaptation policies in Europe. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is a knowledge gap about the risks, barriers, and opportunities associated with greater private investment. This paper analyses some important barriers that commonly inhibit private sector investment in climate adaptation action. The analysis draws on case studies of small and medium-sized business (SMEs), multinational companies (MNCs), B corporations and impact investors. Our analysis confirms that private sector actors are willing to invest in climate adaptation, but their investment decisions are constrained by risk profiles associated with climate adaptation projects, the lack of financially viable and bankable projects, and complete knowledge of climate risk that guide adaptation decision. A tailored approach is required to leverage private sector finance, and conducive public policy interventions will facilitate to mobilize different types of private sector actors.","[Adhikari, Bhim; Safaee Chalkasra, Lolita Shaila] Int Dev Res Ctr IDRC, 150 Kent St, Ottawa, ON K1G3H9, Canada",,"Adhikari, B (corresponding author), Int Dev Res Ctr IDRC, 150 Kent St, Ottawa, ON K1G3H9, Canada.",badhikari@idrc.ca,,,"International Development Research Centre [107351, 108074, 108270]",International Development Research Centre,"This work was supported by International Development Research Centre [grant number 107351, 108074, 108270].",,43,4,4,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2043-0795,2043-0809,,J SUSTAIN FINANC INV,J.

In response, the federal government is funding the purchase and demolition of housing in areas of greatest jeopardy, tacitly promoting residential resettlement as a strategy of climate adaptation, especially in cities. Despite these developments little is known about where people move when they engage in such resettlement or how answers to that question vary by the racial and economic status of their flood-prone neighborhoods. The present study begins to fill that gap. We introduce a new typology for classifying environmental resettlement along two socio-spatial dimensions of community attachment: (a) distance moved from one's flood-prone home; and (b) average distance resettled from similarly relocated neighbors. Next, we analyze data from 1,572 homeowners who accepted government-funded buyouts across 39 neighborhood areas in Harris County, Texas - Houston's urban core. Results indicate that homeowners from more privileged neighborhoods resettle closer to their flood-prone homes and to one another, thus helping to preserve the social and economic value of their homes; homeowners from less privileged areas end up farther away from both.

However, although the role of learning in shaping public policy is well understood, and experiments are expected to facilitate learning, little is known about how experiments produce learning, what types of learning, and how they can be designed to enhance learning effects. Using quantitative research methods, we explore how design choices influence the learning experiences of 173 participants in 18 policy experiments conducted in the Netherlands between 1997 and 2016. The experiments are divided into three ideal types that are expected to produce different levels and types of learning. The findings show that policy experiments produce cognitive and relational learning effects, but less normative learning, and experiment design influenced three of six measured dimensions of learning, especially the cognitive learning dimensions. This reveals a trade-off between designing for knowledge development and designing for normative or relational changes; choices that experiment designers should make in the context of their adaptation problem.

While NbS do not necessarily represent new technology or methods, the intentional incorporation of these approaches into climate adaptation and mitigation efforts is often considered novel, particularly within the climate services sector where interventions have historically prioritized structural infrastructure approaches. NbS can offer an effective replacement for or complement to such traditional infrastructure approaches. Additionally, natural and nature-based systems can respond to climate change in a manner that engineered solutions often cannot, providing long-term holistic adaptation and mitigation success with additional benefits to ecosystem services such as improved air and water quality, carbon sequestration, outdoor recreation, and biodiversity protection. The incorporation of NbS as a core component of climate services increases the likelihood of adoption and effective implementation, ensuring greater long-term effectiveness for both communities and the natural systems on which they depend. This article supports the adoption and effective implementation of NbS by climate service providers through presenting a set of seven key considerations for their use in community-based adaptation. These key considerations are based on a review of work in the field to date, both within the United States and globally. Although these key considerations were developed in support of US adaptation planning applications (specifically, the US Climate Resilience Toolkit), they have global relevance.","[Pathak, Arsum] Natl Wildlife Federat, Austin, TX 78752 USA; [Hilberg, Laura E.; Hansen, Lara J.] EcoAdapt, Bainbridge Isl, WA 98110 USA; [Stein, Bruce A.] Natl Wildlife Federat, Washington, DC 20006 USA",,"Pathak, A (corresponding author), Natl Wildlife Federat, Austin, TX 78752 USA.;Hansen, LJ (corresponding author), EcoAdapt, Bainbridge Isl, WA 98110 USA.",pathaka@nwf.org; lara@ecoadapt.org,,,,,,,51,1,1,11,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2022,14,24,,,,,,,16817,10.3390/su142416817,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142416817,,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,7H2TP,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000903059900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We tested four rootstocks, 'IAC 766 Campinas', 'IAC 572 Jales', 'IAC 571-6 Jundiai' and 'IAC 313 Tropical', planted in two climatic regions, Cfa and Aw, in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil in the cultivation years 2014 and 2015. Cycle duration, production, cluster weight, number of berries per bunch, content of soluble solids, titratable acidity, a maturation index and the weight, length and width of berries were evaluated. A principal component analysis characterized the cultivar for both climatic regions and years. The rootstock did not influence the cycle, production or physicochemical characteristics of the 'SR 501-17' hybrid. The soluble-solid content in the must was higher and the production cycle in 2014 was longer for the Cfa climate. The production cycle was shorter and the weight and width of the berries were lower, mainly in 2015, for the Aw climate. The cycle was thus longer, production was higher and the chemical characteristics were better for the 'SR 501-17' hybrid under Cfa conditions, regardless of the rootstock.","[Mattar, Gabriel Stefanini; Hernandes, Jose Luiz; Moura, Mara Fernandes] Inst Agron, Ctr Frutas, Jundiai, SP, Brazil; [Modesto, Lenon Romano] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Nucleo Estudos Uva & Vinho, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Tecchio, Marco Antonio] Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Hort, Botucatu, SP, Brazil",Instituto Agronomico de Campinas (IAC); Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade Estadual Paulista,"Mattar, GS (corresponding author), Inst Agron, Ctr Frutas, Jundiai, SP, Brazil.",gabriel.mattar@uol.com.br,"Moura, Mara Fernandes/AAJ-2253-2020; Hernandes, José Luiz JLH/E-1962-2013; Moura, Mara/AGY-9987-2022","Hernandes, José Luiz JLH/0000-0003-1788-9988; Moura, Mara/0000-0002-1327-5527; Mattar, Gabriel/0000-0002-7175-9597; Modesto, Lenon/0000-0001-8439-1288; Tecchio, Marco Antonio/0000-0001-7868-2265",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (Capes); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo [2012/00292-9],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (Capes)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),We are grateful to the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (Capes) for scholarship grants and to the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo for financial support (FAPESP grant no. 2012/00292-9).,,44,1,1,0,2,INST AGRONOMICO,CAMPINAS,"CAIXA POSTAL 28, CAMPINAS, SP 00000, BRAZIL",0006-8705,1678-4499,,BRAGANTIA,Bragantia,JUL-SEP,2019,78,3,,,,,470,478,,10.1590/1678-4499.20190010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1678-4499.20190010,,,9,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Geology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Geology,JD4OL,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000489958400015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Taking the north slope of Tianshan Mountains, located in the arid area of northwestern China and extremely sensitive to climate change, as the research area, this study retrieves the surface temperature of the mountain based on MODIS data, while characterizing the intensity of human activities thereby data on the night light, population distribution and land use. The evolution characteristics of human activity intensity and surface temperature in the study area from 2000 to 2018 were analyzed, and the spatio-temporal correlation between them was further explored. It is found that: (1) The average human activity intensity (0.11) in the research area has kept relatively low since this century, and the overall trend has been slowly rising in a stepwise manner (0.0024 center dot a(-1)); in addition, the increase in human activity intensity has lagged behind that in construction land and population by 1-2 years. (2) The annual average surface temperature in the area is 7.18 degrees C with a pronounced growth. The rate of change (0.02 degrees C center dot a(-1)) is about 2.33 times that of the world. The striking boost in spring (0.068 degrees C center dot a(-1)) contributes the most to the overall warming trend. Spatially, the surface temperature is low in the south and high in the north, due to the prominent influence of the underlying surface characteristics, such as elevation and vegetation coverage. (3) The intensity of human activity and the surface temperature are remarkably positively correlated in the human activity areas there, showing a strong distribution in the east section and a weak one in the west section. The expression of its spatial differentiation and correlation is comprehensively affected by such factors as scopes of human activities, manifestations, and land-use changes. Vegetation-related human interventions, such as agriculture and forestry planting, urban greening, and afforestation, can effectively reduce the surface warming caused by human activities. This study not only puts forward new ideas to finely portray the intensity of human activities but also offers a scientific reference for regional human-land coordination and overall development.","[Chen Hongjin; Liu Lin; Zhang Zhengyong; Liu Ya; Tian Hao; Kang Ziwei; Wang Tongxia; Zhang Xueying] Shihezi Univ, Sch Sci, Shihezi 832000, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Chen Hongjin; Liu Lin; Zhang Zhengyong; Liu Ya; Tian Hao; Kang Ziwei; Wang Tongxia; Zhang Xueying] Key Lab Oasis Town & Mt Basin Syst Ecol Xinjiang, Shihezi 832003, Xinjiang, Peoples R China",Shihezi University,"Liu, L (corresponding author), Shihezi Univ, Sch Sci, Shihezi 832000, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.;Liu, L (corresponding author), Key Lab Oasis Town & Mt Basin Syst Ecol Xinjiang, Shihezi 832003, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.",ZLYZXLX@163.com; liulin779@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41461086, 41761108]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"National Natural Science Foundation of China, No.41461086, No.41761108",,63,0,0,13,13,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1009-637X,1861-9568,,J GEOGR SCI,J.

In Northeast China (NEC), it is critically important for the agricultural community (e.g. farmers, advisors) to understand the potential shift in suitable cropping zones for spring maize in order to adapt to climate change. The potential climatic suitability can be defined as how actual temperature and solar radiation conditions match the requirements of crop growth under non-limited situations. Here, we used yield potential to reflect the potential climatic suitability, which is determined by the characteristics of crop, solar radiation, temperature, and photoperiod, given the assumption that water, nutrients, pests, and diseases are not limiting the crop growth. We assessed the annual yield potential of spring maize during 1961-2010 in NEC with APSIM-Maize. And then we analyzed the variations in potential climatic suitability zones and the possible effects of these variations on maize production potential. The results show that growing degree-days (GDD) during the growing season for spring maize universally increased in all the locations of this study during the period of 1981-2010 (period II) as compared to the period of 1961-1980 (period I). A total of 66 % of the locations show a decrease in accumulated sunshine duration (ASD) during the growing season during period II as compared to period I. Both coefficient of variation (CV) of GDD and CV of ASD showed an increase during period II as compared to period I. Under the background of climate change, the potential climatic suitability for spring maize was worsened during the most recent five decades: the yield potential declined and the yield stability decreased. In particular, most of the very suitable zone in Jilin and Liaoning during period I turned into suitable or moderately suitable zone during period II. Meanwhile, the total area of marginally suitable zone and no suitable zone increased by 16 % during period II as compared to period I. We detected a close correlation between the decrease in ASD and the decrease in potential climatic suitability, R = 0.56, p < 0.01. We also found a close correlation between the increase in GDD and the decrease in potential climatic suitability, R = -0.25, p < 0.05. Given the same crop varieties and farming management, the total production potential for spring maize in the entire NEC reduced by 4.3 % during period II as compared to period I.","[Zhao, Jin; Yang, Xiaoguang; Liu, Zhijuan; Lv, Shuo] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jing] Ningxia Inst Meteorol Sci, Yinchuan 750002, Peoples R China; [Dai, Shuwei] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA",China Agricultural University; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Yang, XG (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",yangxg@cau.edu.cn,"yang, xiao/HJI-7815-2023; Liu, Zhijuan/AEA-8412-2022; lv, shuo/AAC-7018-2019","Liu, Zhijuan/0000-0001-7082-6439",National Natural Science Foundation of China [31471408]; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China [2012BAD20B04],"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China)",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31471408) and the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (Grant No. 2012BAD20B04).,,52,23,24,2,102,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

With respect to agriculture, changes in solar radiation, temperature, and precipitation will produce changes in crop yields, crop mix, cropping systems, scheduling of field operations, grain moisture content at harvest, and hence, on the economics of agriculture including changes in farm profitability. Such issues are addressed for 10 representative agricultural areas across the midwestern Great Lakes region, a five-state area including Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. This region is one of the most productive and important agricultural regions in the world, with over 61% of the land use devoted to agriculture. Individual crop growth processes are affected differently by climate change. A seasonal rise in temperature will increase the developmental rate of the crop, resulting in an earlier harvest. Heat stress may result in negative effects on crop production. Conversely, increased rainfall in drier areas may allow the photosynthetic rate of the crop to increase, resulting in higher yields. Properly validated crop simulation models can be used to combine the environmental effects on crop physiological processes and to evaluate the consequences of such influences. With existing hybrids, an overall pattern of decreasing crop production under scenarios of climate change was found, due primarily to intense heat during the main growth period. However, the results changed with the hybrid of maize (Zen Inngs L.) being grown and the specific location in the study region. In general, crops grown in sites in northern states had increased yields under climate change, with those grown in sites in the southern states of the region having decreased yields under climate change. Yields from long-season maize increased significantly in the northern part of the study region under future climate change. Across the study region, long-season maize performed most successfully under future climate scenarios compared to current yields, followed by medium-season and then short-season varieties. This analysis highlights the spatial variability of crop responses to changed environmental conditions. In addition, scenarios of increased climate variability produced diverse yields on a year-to-year basis and had increased risk of a low yield. Results indicate that potential future adaptations to climate change for maize yields would require either increased tolerance of maximum summer temperatures in existing maize varieties or a change in the maize varieties grown.

However, these areas are commonly exposed to floods, and the increasing population together with the changes in storminess as a result of global warming mean that the risks from flooding are expected to rise. Most studies investigating the impact that climatic change has on flood risk are based on a cascade of global climate model simulations coupled with regional climate models, hydrologic models, inundation models, and flood impact models. However, this approach is subject to uncertainties. Model results are found to be sensitive to climate forcing, the structure of the underlying models, the choice of methods used for downscaling and bias correction, and the use of extreme value analysis for both current and future climate conditions. Moreover, uncertainties are expected to propagate through the model cascade. To overcome these problems, we propose a method for analyzing and mapping the sensitivity of population exposure in floodplains to changes in flood magnitude. The method is based on downward counterfactuals, namely perturbations of a selected flood scenario by increasing its magnitude, interpreted in this case as the worsening of a today's design flood event as a result of climatic changes. The increase in the impact of a current design flood compared to its counterfactual illustrates the sensitivity to changes in hazard. We calculate the normalized gradients of the flood exposure curves, that is, the increase in the exposure and magnitude of the perturbed event relative to the exposure and magnitude of the current scenario. We test the applicability of the method on local, national, and global scale by using existing data sets, including flood hazard maps, flood protection standards, floodplain delineation, river network definition, and spatial population distribution. The gradients were found to vary remarkably across the globe and are overall smaller in the upper range of flood magnitudes that in the lower range. Based on these results, we compare the drivers of the sensitivity in different parts of the world and identify river reaches with the highest relative gradients. These river reaches might be the most affected by climate change and thus deserve an in-depth investigation of the underlying characteristics of the floodplains and the need for climate change adaptation.","[Zischg, Andreas Paul] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Mobiliar Lab Nat Risks, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Bermudez, Maria] Univ Granada, Andalusian Inst Earth Syst Res, Environm Fluid Dynam Grp, Granada, Spain",University of Bern; Universidad de Cordoba; Universidad de Jaen; University of Granada; Instituto Interuniversitario de Investigacion del Sistema Tierra en Andalucia,"Zischg, AP (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Mobiliar Lab Nat Risks, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland.",andreas.zischg@giub.unibe.ch,"Bermúdez, María/F-2421-2016; Zischg, Andreas Paul/G-3382-2014","Bermúdez, María/0000-0003-3189-4791; Zischg, Andreas Paul/0000-0002-4749-7670","Mobiliar Lab for Natural Risks, Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Bern; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant Agreement [754446]; UGR Research and Knowledge Transfer Fund-Athenea3i; University of Granada","Mobiliar Lab for Natural Risks, Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Bern; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant Agreement; UGR Research and Knowledge Transfer Fund-Athenea3i; University of Granada","AZ was funded by the Mobiliar Lab for Natural Risks, Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Bern.

J,"Morgan, T",,,,"Morgan, Trish",,,The techno-finance fix: A critical analysis of international and regional environmental policy documents and their implications for planning,PROGRESS IN PLANNING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; Economy; Crisis; Policy; Planning; Techno-finance fix,CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBAN; NEOLIBERALISM; POLITICS; WORLD; CITIZENSHIP; TRANSITIONS; IRELAND; CRISIS; CITIES,"This article is concerned with the interaction of international, regional and national policy on climate change and sustainability, and the implications of these policy dimensions for planning. With the scientific consensus pointing to unequivocal human influence on the ecosystem, the issue of how best to manage climate change and ecological sustainability is arguably now a matter for economic, political, policy and planning domains. However, despite the warnings of scientists that 'business as usual' economic accumulation is no longer an option, this analysis of international and regional policy suggests that in the main, solutions are proffered that merely shift forms of capital accumulation and enforce 'business as usual', rather than providing transformative trajectories to plan for climate change adaptation and mitigation. This article traces key documents from an international level including United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, to EU regional policy, and sectoral policy at a sample national level. This is with a view to providing a theoretical backdrop, and a summary of selected relevant documentation that planners may be required to consider with respect to climate change issues. This article may therefore be considered in part, as a 'map' of the policy landscape for planners, highlighting the policy tensions and the conflicts that exist between international, regional and national levels of policymaking. These tensions largely lie between the areas of economic and ecological stability, and usually fail to reconcile contradictions between economic growth and protection of the ecosystem. The article introduces the concept of the 'techno-finance fix' to analyse and critique the dominant solutions to climate change. These solutions involve a dovetailing of a hope in emergent, new and not yet-existing technologies, with a hope that the markets will fund the correct types of technological innovation deemed necessary to mitigate climate change. Therefore, the implications for planning involve an imperative to respond to climate change, and knowledge in the key aspects of climate change policy. However, the response at a planning level depends on which dominant narratives are being forwarded from the top down at a multi-layered policy level. This work therefore suggests that the 'techno-finance fix' is a dominant approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation, and that planning for climate change is thus informed by this dominant narrative, to the marginalising of alternative solutions, including those outside the market or technology.

This study uncovers the potential of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) from the perspective of indigenous communities in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, and explores how TEK helps them to observe and respond to local climate change. Data were collected through interviews and field work observations and analysed using thematic analysis based on the TEK framework. The results indicated that these communities have observed a significant increase in temperature, with uncertain weather and seasons. Consequently, drought and wildfires have had a substantial impact on their livelihoods. However, they have responded to this by managing their customary land and resources to ensure food and resource security, which provides a respectable example of the sustainable management of terrestrial and inland ecosystems. The social networks and institutions of indigenous communities enable collective action which strengthens the reciprocal relationships that they rely on when calamity strikes. Accordingly, the communities maintain their TEK through cultural festivals and oral traditions passed from one generation to another. TEK is a practical tool that helps indigenous communities adapt to climate risks and promotes socio-ecological resilience, which upholds social empowerment and sustainable resource management.","[Hosen, Nadzirah] Shibaura Inst Technol, Grad Sch Engn & Sci, Saitama, Saitama 3378570, Japan; [Nakamura, Hitoshi] Shibaura Inst Technol, Dept Planning Architecture & Environm Syst, Saitama, Saitama 3378570, Japan; [Hamzah, Amran] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Fac Built Environm & Surveying, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia",Shibaura Institute of Technology; Shibaura Institute of Technology; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Hosen, N (corresponding author), Shibaura Inst Technol, Grad Sch Engn & Sci, Saitama, Saitama 3378570, Japan.",na17506@shibaura-it.ac.jp; nakamu-h@shibaura-it.ac.jp; merang@utm.my,"Hosen, Nadzirah/AAG-6667-2021; Hosen, Nadzirah/GYV-4904-2022","Hosen, Nadzirah/0000-0001-6147-9316; Hamzah, Amran/0000-0002-5562-9071",,,,,91,41,42,14,52,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN 2,2020,12,2,,,,,,,676,10.3390/su12020676,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12020676,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KQ3KE,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000516824600234,View Full Record in Web of Science

Broader development and climate adaptation can potentially enhance each other, and their positive synergies are essential to improve human well-being in less developed rural areas. Such synergies are, however, commonly lacking across developing countries. This paper examines the relationship between climate adaptation and broader development and finds a positive synergy in the Poyang Lake Region (PLR) - an important rice producing area in China that is vulnerable to flood hazards. We further examine household decision-making and link household decisions to rice cropping patterns interpreted from satellite images to explain the micro- to macro- mechanisms that lead to this synergy. The analysis shows that both the broader development context (national economic development and agricultural policy) and specific risk management (levees) are important for creating the positive synergy. Moreover, it is the right interactions of the social, natural, and technological subsystems that enable rural households to make different land-use and livelihood choices in a way that improves rural livelihoods and reduces flood impacts on rural livelihoods. The diverse household choices then collectively lead to preservation of rice production, despite the negative influence from increasing nonfarm work, and decreased flood impacts on agriculture.","[Tian, Qing] George Mason Univ, Coll Sci, Computat Social Sci Program, 4400 Univ Dr,MS 6B2, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Jiang, Luguang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lemos, Maria] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Qi, Shuhua] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Key Lab Poyang Lake Wetland & Watershed Res, Minist Educ, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","George Mason University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Jiangxi Normal University","Tian, Q (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Coll Sci, Computat Social Sci Program, 4400 Univ Dr,MS 6B2, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",qtian2@gmu.edu,,"Lemos, Maria Carmen/0000-0001-6686-730X",,,,,53,2,2,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1947-5683,1947-5691,,ANN GIS,Ann.

At the same time, coastal cities are the most prone to climate-related vulnerability, including impacts of sea-level rise and climate-related coastal hazards under the present and projected future climate. Decision making about coastal urban climate adaptation can be informed by coastal climate services based on modeling tools. We develop a two-period coastal urban adaptation model in which two periods-the present and the future-are distinguished. In the model, a city agent anticipates sea-level rise and related coastal flood hazards with adverse impacts in the future period that, through damages, will reduce the urban income. However, the magnitude of future sea-level rise and induced damages are characterized by uncertainty. The urban planning agent has to make an investment decision under uncertainty: whether to invest in climate adaptation (in the form of construction of coastal protection) or not, and if so, how much. The decision making of the urban agent is derived from intertemporal maximization of expected time-discounted consumption. An exact solution in the closed form is derived for an analytically tractable particular case, for which it is shown that investment decisions depend discontinuously on the value of a single non-dimensional model indicator. When this indicator exceeds a certain threshold value, the urban agent discontinuously switches from the 'business-as-usual' (BaU) strategy when no adaptation investment is taken to a proactive adaptation. The role of coastal climate services in informing the decision making on adaptation strategies is discussed.","[Kovalevsky, Dmitry V.] Helmholtz Zent Hereon, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GER, Fischertwiete 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany; [Scheffran, Juergen] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, Res Grp Climate Change & Secur CLISEC, Grindelberg 5-7, D-20144 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Kovalevsky, DV (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zent Hereon, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GER, Fischertwiete 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany.",dmitrii.kovalevskii@hereon.de,"Scheffran, Jürgen/M-6876-2019","Scheffran, Jürgen/0000-0002-7171-3062","Helmholtz Institute for Climate Service Science (HICSS); Climate Service Center Germany (GERICS); Universitat Hamburg, Germany","Helmholtz Institute for Climate Service Science (HICSS); Climate Service Center Germany (GERICS); Universitat Hamburg, Germany","This work was conducted and financed within the framework of the Helmholtz Institute for Climate Service Science (HICSS), a cooperation between Climate Service Center Germany (GERICS) and Universitat Hamburg, Germany [Project 'Modeling Urban dynamics affected by Climate Change for Coastal Spatial planning and management' (MUCCCS)].",,58,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2413-8851,,URBAN SCI,Urban Sci.,DEC,2022,6,4,,,,,,,65,10.3390/urbansci6040065,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/urbansci6040065,,,13,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,7J2PJ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000904426000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this context, regional readings are needed to generate a multiscale and multisectoral analysis of the responses of Andean countries in public policy and at the grass roots. This paper examines institutional challenges and local perceptions regarding the implementation of CC adaptation policies in the Andean countries. We analyze the regulatory, institutional, and policy framework related to CC policies in Andean countries over the last 5 years. Further, we analyze synergies and opportunities, as well as possible tensions and resistance, that the implementation of CC adaptation policies may generate among diverse actors (civil society organizations, peasant/indigenous communities, and local/regional authorities, among others). For this, we analyze 7 case studies at the subnational level across the Andes. These were chosen to reflect the diversity of local governance contexts across the region and the progress and challenges faced in implementing CC adaptation policies on the ground. This analysis reveals how the implementation of CC adaptation policies in diverse territorial contexts often lacks articulation and coherence with the governance tools and platforms typically used by local actors. In response to this overall limitation, various representative strategies derived from the case studies are highlighted, illustrating different modes of multiactor and multiscale cooperation. Finally, based on our sociopolitical analysis, we propose some key recommendations for the different stakeholders, which could inform the development of an agenda for multiscale and multiactor CC adaptation governance in the region.","[Dupuits, Emilie] Univ San Francisco Quito, Carrera Relac Int, Ave Diego de Robles & Via Interocean, Quito, Ecuador; [Daniel Llambi, Luis; Peralvo, Manuel] Consorcio Desarrollo Sostenible Ecorreg Andina CO, German Aleman E12-123, Quito, Ecuador",,"Dupuits, E (corresponding author), Univ San Francisco Quito, Carrera Relac Int, Ave Diego de Robles & Via Interocean, Quito, Ecuador.",edupuits@usfq.edu.ec,,,Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC),Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC),"The authors would like to thank the Andean Forests Program and Adaptation at Altitude Program, financed by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), for their financial support.

A conceptual framework of long-term adaptation planning for climate change in road systems is proposed to ensure the resilience and sustainability of road transport systems under various climate risks such as flooding and increased temperature. To do so, an advanced Fuzzy Bayesian Reasoning (FBR) model is first employed to evaluate the climate risks in the UK road transport networks. This modelling approach can tackle the high uncertainty in risk data and thus facilitate the development of the climate adaptation framework and its application in the UK road sector. To examine the feasibility of this model, a nationwide survey is conducted among the stakeholders to analyse the climate risks, in terms of the timeframe of climate threats, the likelihood of occurrence, the severity of consequences, and infrastructure resilience. From the modelling perspective, this work brings novelty by expanding the risk attribute the severity of consequence into three sub-attributes including economic loss, damage to the environment, and injuries and/or loss of life. It advances the-state-of-the-art technique in the current relevant literature from a single to multiple tier climate risk modelling structure. Secondly, an Evidential Reasoning (ER) approach is used to prioritise the best adaptation measure(s) by considering both the risk analysis results from the FBR and the implementation costs simultaneously. The main new contributions of this part lie in the rich raw data collected from the real world to provide useful practical insights for achieving road resilience when facing increasing climate risk challenges. During this process, a qualitative analysis of several national reports regarding the impacts posed by climate change, risk assessment and adaptation measures in the UK road sector is conducted for the relevant decision data (i.e. risk and cost). It is also supplemented by an in-depth interview with a senior planner from Highways England. The findings provide road planners and decision makers with useful insights on identification and prioritisation of climate threats as well as selection of cost-effective climate adaptation measures to rationalise adaptation planning.","[Wang, Tianni; Qu, Zhuohua; Nichol, Timothy] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Business Sch, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Wang, Tianni; Yang, Zaili] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Logist Offshore & Marine Res Inst, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Wang, Tianni; Clarke, Geoff; Bowden, Daniel] AECOM UK Ltd, Logist Dept, London, England; [Dimitriu, Delia] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Res Ctr Ecol & Environm, Manchester, Lancs, England",Liverpool John Moores University; University of Liverpool; Liverpool John Moores University; Manchester Metropolitan University,"Yang, ZL (corresponding author), Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Logist Offshore & Marine Res Inst, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",z.yang@ljmu.ac.uk,"zhao, yang/GXF-4424-2022; yang, zaili/A-6493-2013","yang, zaili/0000-0003-1385-493X; Nichol, Timothy/0000-0001-7130-0789",Liverpool John Moores University; AECOM UK; EU H2020 MC RISE programme [GOLF-777742],Liverpool John Moores University; AECOM UK; EU H2020 MC RISE programme,"This research is financially supported by Liverpool John Moores University, AECOM UK and EU H2020 MC RISE programme (Grant No. GOLF-777742).",,98,15,15,3,44,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1361-9209,,,TRANSPORT RES D-TR E,Transport.

Its effects are already being felt in multiple ways. In the future, we will also have to adapt to its effects because of our farming and our daily lives. In our research, we assessed the climate sensitivity of the lowland areas of Hungary through the changes in landscapes and the changes in groundwater resources that have the greatest impact on agriculture, using data from more than half of a century. We have quantified that at the mid-territory level (5-10 thousand km(2)) the groundwater resources show up to 3-5 km(3)/year changes in both positive and negative directions due to climatic effects. This significantly exceeds the anthropogenic water uses (the total water use of Hungary is about 5 km(3) per year), so the effect of climate is the determining factor in the changes of regional water resources. Future changes in water circulation were modelled using the MIKE-SHE model in two micro-regions in Hungary. We have found that already at the level of the small catchments presented in our study, the water shortage increases by hundreds of millions of m(3) per year due to the expected increase in temperature (mainly due to the increase in evapotranspiration), which cannot be compensated by current water supply solutions. Model simulations have confirmed previous results showing that groundwater movements play a very important role even in lowland landscapes. Based on our research, we would like to draw the attention of decision-makers and agricultural experts to the fact that current methods (irrigation, regional water transfers) are not sufficient for successful adaptation to climate change. So, it is not the limited precipitation but the inappropriate agricultural practices that cause a real threat in a changing climate.

To understand how maize yield loss is affected by global warming, daily precipitation and temperatures, together with provincial agricultural data sets, were analyzed. The results showed that the accumulated temperature, an important factor in agricultural productivity, increased by 5% in 1991-2017, compared to 1961-1990, and that the frequency of low temperatures decreased by 14.8% over the same time period. An increase in drought by 21.6% was observed from 1961-1990 to 1991-2017, caused by decreased growing-season precipitation by -4 mm/decade. In addition, days with heavy rain in August and September increased slightly in Northeast China. In general, maize growth responded positively to the increased thermal conditions; in 1961-1990, 22.7% of observed maize yield-loss cases were due to low temperatures, but only 10% in 1991-2017. However, during the same time, the number of drought-induced yield loss cases increased from 27.3% to 46.7%. Moreover, yield loss cases caused by heavy rainstorms increased from 4.5% to 13.3%, indicating that heavy rainstorms have become an increasing threat to agriculture in Northeast China over the last three decades. In total, at least 70% of cases of provincial yield losses in Northeast China over the last three decades could be attributed to climatic factors. The frequency of climate hazards has changed under global warming, resulting in new challenges for agriculture. While drought and low temperatures were the primary causes for climate-induced yield losses before the 1990s, negative impacts from extreme events, mainly drought but also heavy precipitation, have increased in the last three decades, associated with global change. Farmers, agricultural scientists, and government policy makers could use these results when planning for adaptation to climate change.","[Song, Yanling; Zhou, Guangsheng] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Song, Yanling; Zhou, Guangsheng] Zhengzhou Univ, Fac Geosci & Technol, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Linderholm, Hans W.] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Linderholm, Hans W.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Luo, Yi] Beijing Agr Univ, Dept Rural Reg Dev, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jinxia] China Meteorol Adm, Climate Ctr Sichuan Prov, Chengdu 610072, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Zhengzhou University; University of Gothenburg; University of Cambridge; Beijing University of Agriculture; China Meteorological Administration,"Zhou, GS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Zhou, GS (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, Fac Geosci & Technol, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China.",songyl@cma.gov.cn; hansl@gvc.gu.se; zhonghl@cma.gov.cn; caiwy@cma.gov.cn; zhougs@cma.gov.cn,"Linderholm, Hans W/N-1020-2013","Linderholm, Hans W/0000-0002-1522-8919; zhou, guang sheng/0000-0001-6303-1275","National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC1505605, 2018YFA0606103]",National Key R&D Program of China,"This work is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFC1505605, 2018YFA0606103).",,58,5,5,5,29,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2020,12,18,,,,,,,7829,10.3390/su12187829,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12187829,,,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OR8HP,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000589708600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In contrast, this study examines whether increasing carbon emissions accelerate eco-innovation using data from China. The mediating role of environmental regulation is also considered as regulations are the most prominent factors discussed in the eco-innovation literature, and they may be mainly caused by environmental changes. Therefore, based on 532,808 Y02 patents for technologies that mitigate or adapt to climate change-used as a proxy for eco-innovation-and panel data from 30 Chinese provinces for 2004-2016, a regression method is used to estimate a new theoretical framework for determining the carbon emissions, environmental regulation, and eco-innovation link. The results show that increasing carbon emissions lead to accelerated eco-innovation, implying climate change creates opportunities for Chinese innovators. Moreover, carbon emissions are found to have a positive impact on environmental regulation-an issue never empirically studied before. Furthermore, the impact of carbon emissions on eco-innovation is partially mediated by environmental regulation. Specifically, command-and-control and market-based regulation initiated by the Chinese government play mediating roles between carbon emissions and eco-innovation, but voluntary regulation from the public does not play the same role. These direct and mediating roles are further confirmed by the estimation of different categories of environmental technology. Among these technological areas, carbon treatment technologies, Y02C, are the most indirectly impacted from carbon emissions through environmental regulation, but the least directly impacted. By contrast, opposite results are obtained for Y02T technologies, associated with transport. Based on these findings, we suggest that command-and-control and market-based regulation, rather than voluntary regulation, be strengthened to transfer environmental pressure for innovators in China. Moreover, these environmental regulations should be applied more to immature and promising low-carbon technologies such as Y02C. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A statistical downscaling model was used to generate future local scenarios of meteorological variables such as temperature and precipitation. Then, the downscaled meteorological variables were used as input to the SWAT hydrological model calibrated and validated with observations, and the corresponding changes of future streamflow and non-point source pollutant loads in Shitoukoumen reservoir catchment were simulated and analyzed. Results show that daily temperature increases in three future periods (2010-2039, 2040-2069, and 2070-2099) relative to a baseline of 1961-1990, and the rate of increase is 0.63A degrees C per decade. Annual precipitation also shows an apparent increase of 11 mm per decade. The calibration and validation results showed that the SWAT model was able to simulate well the streamflow and non-point source pollutant loads, with a coefficient of determination of 0.7 and a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of about 0.7 for both the calibration and validation periods. The future climate change has a significant impact on streamflow and non-point source pollutant loads. The annual streamflow shows a fluctuating upward trend from 2010 to 2099, with an increase rate of 1.1 m(3) s(-1) per decade, and a significant upward trend in summer, with an increase rate of 1.32 m(3) s(-1) per decade. The increase in summer contributes the most to the increase of annual load compared with other seasons. The annual NH (4) (+) -N load into Shitoukoumen reservoir shows a significant downward trend with a decrease rate of 40.6 t per decade. The annual TP load shows an insignificant increasing trend, and its change rate is 3.77 t per decade. The results of this analysis provide a scientific basis for effective support of decision makers and strategies of adaptation to climate change.","[Zhang, Lei; Lu, Wenxi; An, Yonglei; Li, Di; Gong, Lei] Jilin Univ, Coll Environm & Resources, Minist Educ, Key Lab Groundwater Resources & Environm, Changchun 130021, Peoples R China",Jilin University,"Lu, WX (corresponding author), Jilin Univ, Coll Environm & Resources, Minist Educ, Key Lab Groundwater Resources & Environm, Changchun 130021, Peoples R China.",luwenxi@jlu.edu.cn,,,Jilin University [20101060];  [2009ZX07526-006-04-01],Jilin University(Jilin University); ,This research was supported by major projects on control and rectification of water body pollution (no. 2009ZX07526-006-04-01).

This qualitative study explores the impact of severe and prolonged droughts on gendered livelihood transitions, women's social and financial wellbeing, and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes in two Zambian provinces.MethodsIn September 2020, in-depth interviews (n=20) and focus group discussions (n=16) with 165 adult women and men in five drought-affected districts, as well as key informant interviews (n=16) with civic leaders and healthcare providers, were conducted. A team-based thematic analysis approach, guided by the Framework Method, was used to code transcript text segments, facilitating identification and interpretation of salient thematic patterns.ResultsAcross districts, participants emphasized the toll drought had taken on their livelihoods and communities, leaving farming households with reduced income and food, with many turning to alternative income sources. Female-headed households were perceived as particularly vulnerable to drought, as women's breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities increased, especially in households where women's partners out-migrated in search of employment prospects. As household incomes declined, women and girls' vulnerabilities increased: young children increasingly entered the workforce, and young girls were married when families could not afford school fees and struggled to support them financially. With less income due to drought, many participants could not afford travel to health facilities or would resort to purchasing health commodities, including family planning, from private retail pharmacies when unavailable from government facilities. Most participants described changes in fertility intentions motivated by drought: women, in particular, expressed desires for smaller families, fearing drought would constrain their capacity to support larger families. While participants cited some ongoing activities in their communities to support climate change adaptation, most acknowledged current interventions were insufficient.ConclusionsDrought highlighted persistent and unaddressed vulnerabilities in women, increasing demand for health services while shrinking household resources to access those services. Policy solutions are proposed to mitigate drought-induced challenges meaningfully and sustainably, and foster climate resilience.","[Rosen, Joseph G.; Mulenga, Drosin; Phiri, Lyson; Okpara, Natasha; Brander, Caila; Chelwa, Nachela; Mbizvo, Michael T.] Populat Council, Lusaka, Zambia",,"Mbizvo, MT (corresponding author), Populat Council, Lusaka, Zambia.",mmbizvo@popcouncil.org,,,Population Council Interagency Council,Population Council Interagency Council,"This study was supported by an internal award from the Population Council Interagency Council to the Population, Environmental Risks, and Climate Change (PERCC) research initiative.",,61,1,1,4,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2458,,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,BMC Public Health,AUG 3,2021,21,1,,,,,,,1501,10.1186/s12889-021-11560-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11560-8,,,14,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",TY3YW,34344335,"Green Accepted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000683721700008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The magnitude of error in the BC affect climate change adaptation decisions. The existing BC methods vary in their complexity, and exhibit limitations on data length, degrees of freedom etc. This study proposes a new method, L-moments Scaling (L-mS), which is both parsimonious and efficient in bias-correcting extreme rainfall events. The L-mS method applies corrections to the first three L-moments of the data to bias correct the entire distribution. The proposed method's efficiency was demonstrated at two stations in India, Chennai and Hyderabad, for 1-day Annual Maximum (AM) precipitation simulations from EC-EARTH and MIROC5 models. A comparison was performed with five widely used BC methods using two validation procedures: Strict Split-Sample (SSS) and Bootstrapped Split-Sample (BSS). The results revealed that the L-mS method could outperform all the five BC Methods with increased accuracy (0%-18% in SSS and 3%-21% in BSS), and with minimal variability among the bootstrapped samples in terms of Normalized-Root-Mean-Square-Error (NRMSE). The method was also applied on 1 degrees gridded data over India for 1-day, 2-day, 3-day, 7-day AM, and Annual Totals, and the future (2021-2050) projections were bias-corrected using L-mS method. The L-mS method produced at least 2.5 and 3 times lesser error in mean and standard deviation, respectively, compared to observed extremes, across all the grids. The L-mS method was able to utilize the inherent nature of frequency domain analysis to outperform similar advanced methods by correcting the entire AM data with few key statistics and could serve as an efficient tool in the BC of extreme climate variables. Also, the bias-corrected future projections indicated the magnitudes of extreme rainfall events are expected to decrease in 35%-40% and increase in 60%-65% of the grids.","[Anthanahalli Nanjegowda, Rohith; Kulamulla Parambath, Sudheer] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Civil Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; [Kulamulla Parambath, Sudheer] Kerala State Council Sci Technol & Environm, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India; [Kulamulla Parambath, Sudheer] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Parambath, SK (corresponding author), Off Execut Vice President, 4th Floor, Thiruvananthapuram 695004, Kerala, India.",sudheer@iitm.ac.in,"KP, Sudheer/C-7123-2013","KP, Sudheer/0000-0002-0947-1197; A N, Rohith/0000-0001-6522-7861",Indian Institute of Technology Madras,Indian Institute of Technology Madras,Indian Institute of Technology Madras,,31,1,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

In this study, daily precipitation and mean temperature datasets under four representative concentrative pathway (RCP) scenarios in the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory Earth system model with modular ocean model (GFDL-ESM2M) version 4 were used to calculate the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) at different time scales. Using a multi-analytical approach including the Mann-Kendall trend test and run theory, the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of drought in the TP from 2016 to 2099 were studied. The results show that the overall future climate of the TP will develop towards warm and humid, and that the monthly-scale wet-dry changes will develop non-uniformly. As the concentration of carbon dioxide emissions increases in the future, the proportion of extremely significant aridification and humidification areas in the TP will significantly increase, and the possibility of extreme disasters will also increase. Moreover, influenced by the increase of annual TP precipitation, the annual scale of future drought in the region will tend to decrease slightly, and the spatial distributions of the frequency and intensity of droughts at all levels will develop uniformly. Under all four RCP scenarios, the drought duration of the TP was mainly less than 3 months, and the drought cycle in the southern region was longer than that in the northern region. The results of this study provide a new basis for the development of adaptive measures for the TP to cope with climate change.","[Liu, Yu; Ma, Xiaoyi; Wang, Yongqiang; Guan, Ronghao; Gu, Yuhui] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Water Resources & Architectural Engn, Xianyang 712100, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yu; Ma, Xiaoyi; Wang, Yongqiang; Guan, Ronghao; Gu, Yuhui] Northwest A&F Univ, Key Lab Agr Soil & Water Engn Arid & Semiarid Are, Minist Educ, Xianyang 712100, Peoples R China; [Jia, Zhifeng; Guan, Zilong] Changan Univ, Sch Water & Environm, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Jia, Zhifeng] Changan Univ, Key Lab Subsurface Hydrol & Ecol Effects Arid Reg, Minist Educ, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Guan, Zilong] Northwest Engn Corp Ltd, Power China, Xian 710065, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Wei] Environm Engn Evaluat Ctr Tibet Autonomous Reg, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; Northwest A&F University - China; Chang'an University; Chang'an University,"Jia, ZF (corresponding author), Changan Univ, Sch Water & Environm, Xian 710054, Peoples R China.;Jia, ZF (corresponding author), Changan Univ, Key Lab Subsurface Hydrol & Ecol Effects Arid Reg, Minist Educ, Xian 710054, Peoples R China.",409538088@chd.edu.cn,"Ma, Xiaoyi/HJH-6205-2023; Guan, Ronghao/AAJ-4465-2021","Guan, Ronghao/0000-0002-1407-5842; JIA, Zhifeng/0000-0003-0800-9352","National Natural Science Foundation of China [52179048, 42001033]; National Key R&D Program of China [2021YFD1900600]; Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China [2021JQ-237]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52179048, 42001033), the National Key R&D Program of China (2021YFD1900600), and the Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China (2021JQ-237).",,87,1,1,12,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,OCT,2022,14,20,,,,,,,5084,10.3390/rs14205084,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14205084,,,22,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,5S4OZ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000875172600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These include a perceived lack of evidence of their functioning in comparison to conventional solutions and an inability for existing design, policy, and assessment processes to capture the multiple benefits of these solutions. Positing this as a challenge of operationalizing and measuring resilience, we argue that the concept of resilience needs to be given concrete meaning in applied management contexts. Starting with shoreline vulnerability as a policy problem and natural and nature-based shoreline features as a promising solution, we present a case study of a co-creative process to produce an interdisciplinary and locally relevant approach to understanding and capturing the benefits of natural and nature-based solutions. We develop the notion of resilience service to enable a concreteness to resilience that simultaneously takes into account ecological, technical, and social dimensions. Through the co-creative process, our researcher-practitioner network developed a monitoring framework for shoreline features in New York State to facilitate the comparison of natural and nature-based features with conventional shoreline approaches. We describe the process and assess the advantages and drawbacks of integrating scientific input and local knowledge. We present the monitoring framework, showing how the co-creative character of the process is consequential in the formulation of the final framework through the selection of parameters, indicators, and protocols. We argue that interdisciplinarity, co-creation, pragmatism, multi-scalar applicability, and policy relevance are critical principles to understand the functioning and facilitate the implementation of naturebased solutions, while recognizing that this work necessitates compromise and as such will lead to continued deliberation. We posit this is a strength of the process for it acknowledges the creation of resilience as a social process in which values are central and subject to change.","[Wijsman, Katinka] Urban Syst Lab, New Sch, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Auyeung, D.

However, farmers have rarely fully implemented all its components, resulting in different combinations of no-tillage, crop rotation, and permanent soil cover being practiced, thus resulting in variable yield responses depending on climatic and soil conditions. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the effect of conservation agriculture components on yield stability. We hypothesized that the use of all three conservation agriculture components would perform the best, resulting in more stable production in all environments. We evaluated at, eight trial locations across southern Africa, how partial and full implementation of these components affected crop yield and yield stability compared with conventional tillage alone or combined with mulching and/or crop rotation. Grain yield and shoot biomass of maize and cowpea were recorded along with precipitation for 2 to 5 years. Across different environments, the addition of crop rotation and mulch to no-tillage increased maize grain by 6%, and the same practices added to conventional tillage led to 13% yield increase. Conversely, adding only mulch or crop rotation to no-tillage or conventional tillage led to lower or equal maize yield. Stability analyses based on Shukla's index showed for the first time that the most stable systems are those in which mulch is added without crop rotation. Moreover, the highest yielding systems were the least stable. Finally, additive main effects and multiplicative interaction analysis allowed clarifying that mulch added to no-tillage gives stable yields on sandy soil with high rainfall. Similarly, mulch added to conventional tillage gives stable yield on sandy soil, but under low rainfall. This is the first study that highlighted the crucial role of mulch to enhance the stability and resilience of cropping systems in southern Africa, supporting their adaptability to climate change.","[Mhlanga, Blessing; Ercoli, Laura; Pellegrino, Elisa] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Life Sci, BioLabs, Pisa, Italy; [Onofri, Andrea] Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Sci Agr Alimentari & Ambientali, Perugia, Italy; [Thierfelder, Christian] Southern Africa Reg Off SARO, Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Harare, Zimbabwe",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; University of Perugia,"Mhlanga, B (corresponding author), Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Life Sci, BioLabs, Pisa, Italy.",b.mhlanga@santannapisa.it,"Pellegrino, Elisa/B-5091-2011","Pellegrino, Elisa/0000-0002-2482-1327; Mhlanga, Blessing/0000-0003-4587-795X","Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna within the CRUI-CAREAgreement; USAID [EEMG-00-04-00013, AID-BFS-G-11-00002]; Bundesministerium fur wirtschaftliche Zumsammenarbeit (BMZ/GIZ) [13.22.44.5-002.00, 13.9767.8-002.00]; International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) [1309]",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna within the CRUI-CAREAgreement; USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Bundesministerium fur wirtschaftliche Zumsammenarbeit (BMZ/GIZ); International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD),"Open access funding provided by Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna within the CRUI-CAREAgreement.

Based on the synthesis of wastewater data, this study provides insights into the global and regional potential of wastewater as water, nutrient and energy sources while acknowledging the limitations of current resource recovery opportunities and promoting efforts to fast-track high-efficiency returns. The study estimates suggest that, currently, 380 billion m(3) (m(3) = 1,000 L) of wastewater are produced annually across the world which is a volume five-fold the volume of water passing through Niagara Falls annually. Wastewater production globally is expected to increase by 24% by 2030 and 51% by 2050 over the current level. Among major nutrients, 16.6 Tg (Tg = million metric ton) of nitrogen are embedded in wastewater produced worldwide annually; phosphorus stands at 3.0 Tg and potassium at 6.3 Tg. The full nutrient recovery from wastewater would offset 13.4% of the global demand for these nutrients in agriculture. Beyond nutrient recovery and economic gains, there are critical environmental benefits, such as minimizing eutrophication. At the energy front, the energy embedded in wastewater would be enough to provide electricity to 158 million households. These estimates and projections are based on the maximum theoretical amounts of water, nutrients and energy that exist in the reported municipal wastewater produced worldwide annually. Supporting resource recovery from wastewater will need a step-wise approach to address a range of constraints to deliver a high rate of return in direct support of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 6, 7 and 12, but also other Goals, including adaptation to climate change and efforts in advancing net-zero energy processes towards a green economy.","[Qadir, Manzoor] UNU, Inst Water Environm & Hlth, INWEH, 175 Longwood Rd South,Suite 204, Hamilton, ON L8P 0A1, Canada; [Drechsel, Pay] IWMI, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Cisneros, Blanca Jimenez] UNESCO, Int Hydrol Programme, Div Water Sci, Paris, France; [Cisneros, Blanca Jimenez] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, UNAM, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Kim, Younggy] McMaster Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Pramanik, Amit] Water Res Fdn, Alexandria, VA USA; [Mehta, Praem] UNU, INWEH, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Olaniyan, Oluwabusola] Winnipeg Water & Waste Dept, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI); Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; McMaster University,"Qadir, M (corresponding author), UNU, Inst Water Environm & Hlth, INWEH, 175 Longwood Rd South,Suite 204, Hamilton, ON L8P 0A1, Canada.",manzoor.qadir@unu.edu,"Qadir, Manzoor/HGC-7825-2022","Qadir, Manzoor/0000-0003-0904-2568; Jimenez Cisneros, Blanca/0000-0002-8596-3871",Global Affairs Canada,Global Affairs Canada(CGIAR),Global Affairs Canada,,47,89,90,22,72,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0165-0203,1477-8947,,NAT RESOUR FORUM,Nat.

We modelled the impacts and tested the effects of potential adaptations to climate change for two New Zealand sheep and beef grazing enterprises located in regions that have contrasting climate change projections. For both enterprises we examined six management systems varying in farming intensity and the tactics used to respond to changes in feed supply and demand. The effects of the impacts and adaptations were determined by examining the economic viability of the systems. We modelled pasture growth over two 20-year periods centred on 1990 and 2040 using downscaled climate projections and a pasture simulation model; the resultant pasture growth curves were used in a farm system model to both determine impacts and test the benefits of adaptation. For both regions there were only slight increases in total annual pasture growth but marked changes in seasonality that required changes in the management system. For one region there were clear benefits of climate change which were accentuated by adaptation while in the other climate change had no positive impacts and adaptation was not effective. Two caveats are noteworthy: first, although adaptations used for the 2040 management systems were not outside the biologically feasible options achievable today, they did involve changes in reproductive efficiency and animal growth rates that are only currently achieved on the highest performing farms. Secondly, some of the adaptations assumed and depended on stock and feed movement between farms and regions, however we were not able to assess the possibility of synchronous, widespread droughts in multiple regions; should these increase then our adaptations would be challenging and could also put pressure on current agricultural infrastructure.

Forest management adaptation to climate change requires identifying the previously most vulnerable stands and the possible climate impacts on forests. This study evaluates whether site index, as an indicator of forest productivity, is related to climate-growth responses and assesses the way in which local site factors modulate climate-tree growth relationships. Tree-ring width series and soil characteristics were obtained from six Pinus halepensis stands with different site indices and similar climate. Dendrochronological methods were used to compare tree climate-growth responses among sites and to study temporal trends in inter-annual growth variability and climate-growth relationships (before and after 1970). The influence of topographic and soil features on tree growth was assessed by means of partial least squares. Stands with low site indices tended to present higher mean sensitivities and greater percentages of missing rings, this relation being modulated mainly by clay percentage and nutrient status in soil. Climate is the major Aleppo pine radial growth driver in the study area with similar growth-climate relationship among sites. Radial growth was mainly influenced by spring temperature and precipitation and previous autumn-winter precipitation. This relationship was stronger after 1970 than before this year, showing also a 2-month advancement of the most influential climate variables after 1970, from May to March. These results and the increasing temporal trend found in mean sensitivity after 1970 highlight the vulnerability of these stands to climate change. Site index was not found to be directly related to stand vulnerability, although local site factors modulate in part the tree-growth response.","[del Rio, Miren; Rodriguez-Alonso, Javier; Bravo-Oviedo, Andres; Ruiz-Peinado, Ricardo; Canellas, Isabel] INIA Forest Res Ctr, Dept Silviculture & Forest Management, Madrid 28040, Spain; [del Rio, Miren; Bravo-Oviedo, Andres; Ruiz-Peinado, Ricardo; Canellas, Isabel] Sustainable Forest Management Res Inst UVa INIA, Madrid, Spain; [Gutierrez, Emilia] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain",Instituto Nacional Investigacion Tecnologia Agraria Alimentaria (INIA); Universidad de Valladolid; University of Barcelona,"del Rio, M (corresponding author), INIA Forest Res Ctr, Dept Silviculture & Forest Management, Ctra A Coruna,Km 7-5, Madrid 28040, Spain.",delrio@inia.es,"Bravo-Oviedo, Andrés/D-1512-2009; Canellas, Isabel/B-7658-2008; Bravo-Oviedo, Andrés/T-3878-2019; Ruiz-Peinado, Ricardo/G-6751-2012; del Río, Miren/F-2196-2013; Gutierrez, Emilia/O-7568-2014","Bravo-Oviedo, Andrés/0000-0001-7036-7041; Canellas, Isabel/0000-0002-9716-7776; Bravo-Oviedo, Andrés/0000-0001-7036-7041; Ruiz-Peinado, Ricardo/0000-0003-0126-1651; del Río, Miren/0000-0001-7496-3713; Gutierrez, Emilia/0000-0002-6085-5700","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [SUM2008-00002-00-00, AGL2011-29701-C02.01, AGL2010.21153.C02.01]; Spanish National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA) [AT10-007]","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); Spanish National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA)(Instituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA))","The study was partially supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through projects SUM2008-00002-00-00, AGL2011-29701-C02.01 and AGL2010.21153.C02.01 and by the Spanish National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA) with Project AT10-007.

By using a process-based ecosystem model [dynamic land ecosystem model (DLEM)], we examined effects of climate change, land use/cover change, and land management practices (i.e. irrigation and nitrogen fertilization) on WUE in terrestrial ecosystems of monsoon Asia during 1948-2000. Our simulations indicated that due to climate variability/change, WUE in the entire area decreased by 3.6% during the study period, with the largest decrease of 6.8% in the 1990s. Grassland was the most sensitive biome to a drying climate, with a decrease of 16.2% in WUE in the 1990s. Land conversion from natural vegetation to croplands, accounting for 79% of the total converted land areas, led to a decrease in WUE, with the largest decrease of 42% while forest was converted to cropland. In contrast, WUE increased by more than 50% while cropland was converted to natural vegetation. Simulated results also showed that intensive land management practices could alleviate the decrease in WUE induced by climate change and land conversion. Changes in WUE showed substantial spatial variation, varying from the largest decrease of over 50% in northwestern China and some areas of Mongolia to the largest increase of over 30% in western, southern China, and large areas of India. To adapt to climate change and sustain terrestrial ecosystem production, more attention ought to be paid to enhance water use efficiency through land use and management practices, especially in the drying areas.

S. agriculture have focused on major world food crops such as wheat and maize. While useful from a national and global perspective, these results are not particularly relevant to the Northeastern U. S. agriculture economy, which is dominated by dairy milk production, and high-value horticultural crops such as apples (Malus domestica), grapes (Vitis vinifera), sweet corn (Zea mays var. rugosa), cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata), and maple syrup (sugar maple, Acer saccharum). We used statistically downscaled climate projections generated by the HadCM3 atmosphere-ocean general circulation model, run with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change future emissions scenarios A1fi (higher) and B1 (lower), to evaluate several climate thresholds of direct relevance to agriculture in the region. A longer (frost-free) growing season could create new opportunities for farmers with enough capital to take risks on new crops (assuming a market for new crops can be developed). However, our results indicate that many crops will have yield losses associated with increased frequency of high temperature stress, inadequate winter chill period for optimum fruiting in spring, increased pressure from marginally over-wintering and/or invasive weeds, insects, or disease, or other factors. Weeds are likely to benefit more than cash crops from increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Projections of thermal heat index values for dairy cows indicate a substantial potential negative impact on milk production. At the higher compared to lower emissions scenario, negative climate change effects will occur sooner, and impact a larger geographic area within the region. Farmer adaptations to climate change will not be cost- or risk-free, and the impact on individual farm families and rural communities will depend on commodity produced, available capital, and timely, accurate climate projections.","[Wolfe, David W.] Cornell Univ, Dept Hort, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Ziska, Lewis] ARS, USDA, Crop Syst & Global Change Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; [Petzoldt, Curt; Seaman, Abby] Cornell Univ, Integrated Pest Management Program, Geneva, NY 14456 USA; [Chase, Larry] Cornell Univ, Dept Anim Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Hayhoe, Katharine] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Geosci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Cornell University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Cornell University; Cornell University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Wolfe, DW (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Hort, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",dww5@cornell.edu,,,United States Department of Agriculture [ENE05-091],United States Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),This work was funded in part by a Northeast Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education grant (ENE05-091) from the United States Department of Agriculture.

An intensive and complex multi-cropping irrigated agricultural system has developed here to optimize the use of these mountain water resources in conjunction with monsoonal rainfall. Snow and glacier melt thereby modulate the seasonal pattern of river flows and, together with groundwater, provide water when rainfall is scarce. Climate change is expected to weaken this modulating effect, with potentially strong effects on food production in one of the world's breadbaskets. Here we quantify the space-, time-and crop-specific dependence of agriculture in the Indo-Gangetic Plains on mountain water resources, using a coupled state-of-the-art, high-resolution, cryosphere-hydrology-crop model. We show that dependence varies strongly in space and time and is highest in the Indus basin, where in the pre-monsoon season up to 60% of the total irrigation withdrawals originate from mountain snow and glacier melt, and that it contributes an additional 11% to total crop production. Although dependence in the floodplains of the Ganges is comparatively lower, meltwater is still essential during the dry season, in particular for crops such as sugar cane. The dependency on meltwater in the Brahmaputra is negligible. In total, 129 million farmers in the Indus and Ganges substantially depend on snow and glacier melt for their livelihoods. Snow and glacier melt provides enough water to grow food crops to sustain a balanced diet for 38 million people. These findings provide important information for agricultural and climate change adaptation policies in a climate change hot spot where shifts in water availability and demand are projected as a result of climate change and socio-economic growth.","[Biemans, H.; Siderius, C.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Biemans, H.; Nepal, S.; Wester, P.; Shrestha, A.

Methods: The research was conducted through a comprehensive review of available secondary data and interviewing key informants in various national organizations involved in climate change adaptation and mitigation activities. Results: Climate change-related health problems, such as mortality and morbidity due to floods and heat waves, vector-borne diseases, water-borne diseases, meningitis, and air pollution-related respiratory diseases are increasing in Ethiopia. Sensitive systems such as agriculture, health, and water have been affected, and the effects of climate change will continue to magnify without the right adaptation and mitigation measures. Currently, research on climate change and health is not adequately developed in Ethiopia. Research and other activities appear to be fragmented and uncoordinated. As a result, very few spatially detailed and methodologically consistent studies have been made to assess the impact of climate in the country. There has often been a lack of sufficient collaboration among organizations on the planning and execution of climate change and health activities, and the lack of trained professionals who can perform climate change and health-related research activities at various levels. Conclusion: Firstly, there is a lack of organized structure in the various organizations. Secondly, there is inadequate level of inter-sectoral collaboration and poor coordination and communication among different stakeholders. Thirdly, there are no reliable policy guidelines and programs among organizations, agencies and offices that target climate change and health. Fourth, the existing policies fail to consider the gender and community-related dimensions of climate change. Fifth, the monitoring and evaluation efforts exerted on climate change and health activities are not strong enough to address the climate change and health issues in the country.","[Simane, Belay] Univ Addis Ababa, Coll Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Beyene, Hunachew; Deressa, Wakgari; Kumie, Abera] Univ Addis Ababa, Coll Hlth Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Berhane, Kiros; Samet, Jonathan] Univ Southern Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Prevent Med, Los Angeles, CA USA",Addis Ababa University; Addis Ababa University; University of Southern California,"Simane, B (corresponding author), Univ Addis Ababa, Coll Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",simaneb@yahoo.com,"Kumie, Abera/AAC-8537-2022",,"Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health [5R24 TW009552, 5R24 TW009548]","Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC))","This work was supported by the Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, through the linked planning grants 5R24 TW009552 [AAU] and 5R24 TW009548 [USC].",,83,34,35,0,17,"ADDIS ABABA UNIV, DEPT COMMUNITY HEALTH",ADDIS ABABA,"TIKUR ANBESSA HOSP, PO BOX 32812, ADDIS ABABA, 00000, ETHIOPIA",1021-6790,,,ETHIOP J HEALTH DEV,Ethiop.

Over these regions, temperatures have been rising at more than twice the global rate of temperature increase. An ensemble of high-resolution downscalings, obtained using a single regional climate model forced with the sea-surface temperatures and sea-ice fields of an ensemble of global circulation model (GCM) simulations, is shown to realistically represent the relatively strong temperature increases observed in subtropical southern and northern Africa. The amplitudes of warming are generally underestimated, however. Further warming is projected to occur during the 21st century, with plausible increases of 4-6 degrees Cover the subtropics and 3-5 degrees Cover the tropics by the end of the century relative to present-day climate under the A2 (a low mitigation) scenario of the Special Report on Emission Scenarios. High impact climate events such as heat-wave days and high fire-danger days are consistently projected to increase drastically in their frequency of occurrence. General decreases in soil-moisture availability are projected, even for regions where increases in rainfall are plausible, due to enhanced levels of evaporation. The regional dowscalings presented here, and recent GCM projections obtained for Africa, indicate that African annual-averaged temperatures may plausibly rise at about 1.5 times the global rate of temperature increase in the subtropics, and at a somewhat lower rate in the tropics. These projected increases although drastic, may be conservative given the model underestimations of observed temperature trends. The relatively strong rate of warming over Africa, in combination with the associated increases in extreme temperature events, may be key factors to consider when interpreting the suitability of global mitigation targets in terms of African climate change and climate change adaptation in Africa.","[Engelbrecht, Francois; Bopape, Mary-Jane; Naidoo, Mogesh; Garland, Rebecca] Council Sci & Ind Res Nat Resources & Environm, Climate Studies Modelling & Environm Hlth, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Engelbrecht, Francois] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, ZA-2000 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Adegoke, Jimmy] Univ Missouri, Dept Geosci, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Garland, Rebecca] North West Univ, Unit Environm Sci & Management, Climatol Res Grp, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Thatcher, Marcus; McGregor, John; Katzfey, Jack] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Oceans & Atmosphere Flagship, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Werner, Micha] UNESCO IHE Inst Water Educ, Dept Water Engn, Delft, Netherlands; [Werner, Micha] Operat Water Management, Deltares, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Ichoku, Charles; Gatebe, Charles] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Gatebe, Charles] Univ Space Res Assoc, Columbia, MD USA",University of Witwatersrand; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City; North West University - South Africa; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; Deltares; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Universities Space Research Association (USRA),"Engelbrecht, F (corresponding author), Council Sci & Ind Res Nat Resources & Environm, Climate Studies Modelling & Environm Hlth, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",fengelbrecht@csir.co.za,"Katzfey, Jack/AAQ-9845-2020; Gatebe, CK/HJG-4677-2022; Ichoku, Charles/E-1857-2012; Garland, Rebecca/GMX-3400-2022; Garland, Rebecca/O-1808-2015; Katzfey, Jack J/K-1231-2012; Bopape, Mary-Jane/HNT-0344-2023; Thatcher, Marcus J/G-4010-2011; Gatebe, Charles/G-7094-2011; McGregor, John L/C-6646-2012","Ichoku, Charles/0000-0003-3244-4549; Garland, Rebecca/0000-0002-1855-8622; Garland, Rebecca/0000-0002-1855-8622; Katzfey, Jack J/0000-0002-0604-8860; Bopape, Mary-Jane/0000-0003-2111-4595; Thatcher, Marcus J/0000-0003-4139-5515; McGregor, John/0000-0003-2529-9849","European Commission Seventh Framework Programme 'FP7' through the report of EU-FP7 project DEWFORA-Improved Drought Early Warning and FORecasting to strengthen preparedness and adaptation to droughts in Africa [265454]; CSIR Parliamentary Grant [EECM066]; Thematic Area 2 of the Applied Centre for Climate and Earth System Studies (ACCESS) in South Africa; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) under its Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) Interdisciplinary Studies (IDS) Programme; Office of Science, US Department of Energy","European Commission Seventh Framework Programme 'FP7' through the report of EU-FP7 project DEWFORA-Improved Drought Early Warning and FORecasting to strengthen preparedness and adaptation to droughts in Africa; CSIR Parliamentary Grant(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); Thematic Area 2 of the Applied Centre for Climate and Earth System Studies (ACCESS) in South Africa; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) under its Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) Interdisciplinary Studies (IDS) Programme; Office of Science, US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","The research received funding support from the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme 'FP7' through the report of EU-FP7 project DEWFORA-Improved Drought Early Warning and FORecasting to strengthen preparedness and adaptation to droughts in Africa, Grant No. 265454, a CSIR Parliamentary Grant EECM066, Thematic Area 2 of the Applied Centre for Climate and Earth System Studies (ACCESS) in South Africa and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) under its Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES)-2009 Interdisciplinary Studies (IDS) Programme.

We use bias-corrected and downscaled projections for 3 IPCC scenarios (B1, A1B, and A2) to assess projected climate impacts on ecosystem function and services for different regions of the conterminous USA utilizing the Terrestrial Ecosystems Model version Hydro. Significance of model trends is analyzed for each of the 6 US National Climate Assessment megaregions for several climatological, hydrological, and ecological variables based on projections and consistency among the multimodel ensemble from phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3). Our regional analysis reveals that there are some robust and significant trends that can be useful to decision-makers, and that these trends are specific to each region, as each region responds to climate forcing differently in ways that reflect emergent behavior from the interaction of climate, ecosystem, and surface processes. Generally, runoff is simulated to increase in winter and decrease in summer throughout the northern USA, snowpack is reduced everywhere, and net primary productivity and maize yield increase except where limited by moisture. Model reconstructions of magnitudes and directions of some historical regional trends are incorrect, so predicted reversals may be spurious. Some model variables such as precipitation show no significant projected trends, yet in concert, they control the responses of other variables such as soil moisture, in which the trends are projected to be significant. As such, variables whose trends are less observable may be revealed by other variables controlled by them, and can thus be used as proxies to enhance predictive capacity.","[Felzer, Benjamin; Sahagian, Dork] Lehigh Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA",Lehigh University,"Felzer, B (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 1 West Packer Ave, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",bsf208@lehigh.edu,"Felzer, Benjamin S/AAB-3456-2021","Felzer, Benjamin S/0000-0002-3990-3739",US Department of Energy subaward from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Westwind Foundation,US Department of Energy subaward from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Westwind Foundation,"This study was funded by the US Department of Energy subaward from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for An Integrated Framework for Climate Change Assessment and by the Westwind Foundation.

As a contribution to this debate, a constructivist discourse research approach is chosen to analyse and interpret how stakeholders handle uncertainty related to climate change knowledge. Four diverse conceptualisations of how uncertainty is handled serve as the discourse analysis framework: rational discourse, no-regret discourse, blissful discourse, and formative discourse. This framework is applied to analyse and interpret interviews of diverse stakeholder groups from a local governance adaptation network. In this network, conflicts between irrigation farmers, water authorities and nature conservation are negotiated. For most interviewees, uncertainty about climate change knowledge is not judged as problematic. This paper elaborates on why this is so and provides tentative assessments for each discourse type.","Univ Hamburg, FSP BIOGUM, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Gottschick, M (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, FSP BIOGUM, Hamburg, Germany.",manuel.gottschick@uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,,35,9,9,3,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

These interactions shape the decision context that can enable or constrain effective adaptation. To illustrate the operationalisation of this 'values-rules-knowledge' (VRK) framework we developed biophysical adaptation pathways for agricultural landscapes of south-eastern Australia, which are expected to become warmer and drier under climate change. We used the VRK framework to identify potential constraints to implementing the pathways. Drawing on expert knowledge, published literature, biodiversity modelling and stakeholder workshops we identified potential adaptation pathways for (1) the production matrix, (2) high conservation value remnant eucalypt woodlands, and (3) woodland trees. Adaptation options included shifts from mixed cropping grazing to rangeland grazing or biomass enterprises; promoting re-assembly of native ecological communities; and maintaining ecosystem services and habitat that trees provide. Across all pathways, applying the VRK framework elucidated fifteen key implementation constraints, including limits to farm viability, decreasing effectiveness of environmental legislation and conflicting values about exotic plants. Most of the constraints involved interactions among VRK; 13 involved rules, eight involved values, and seven involved knowledge. Value constraints appeared most difficult to address, whereas those based on rules or knowledge were more tangible. The lower number of knowledge constraints may reflect the scale of our analysis (which focused on decision points in pre-defined pathways); new knowledge and participatory approaches would likely yield a richer set of scenarios. We conclude that the VRK framework helps connect the biophysical knowledge-based view of adaptation with a perspective on the need for changes in social systems, enabling targeting of constraints to adaptation. Our focus on pathways and decision points in different sectors of the multi-use landscape highlighted the importance of group and higher level planning and policy for balancing the collective outcomes of multiple decisions by many land managers.

In order to understand the impact of climate variability on cultural changes in the Indian subcontinent, high resolution centennial to millennial scale middle Holocene Indian summer monsoon (ISM) variability was reconstructed from Bednikund lake, located in an alpine meadow of the Pindar basin, Chamoli, Central Himalaya. Increased ISM precipitations were found during similar to 5930-3950 (mid-Holocene climate optimum), similar to 3380-2830 (Minoan Warm Period), similar to 2610-1860 (Roman Warm Period), similar to 1050-760 (Medieval Climate Anomaly), and similar to 320 cal yr BP to Present (Current Warm Period). The decreased ISM strengths were found during similar to 3950-3380, similar to 2830 -2610, similar to 1860-1050 (Dark Ages Cold Period), similar to 760-580, and similar to 500-320 cal yr BP (Little Ice Age). The covariance between our records of precipitation change and total solar irradiance for the middle to late Holocene and with Northern hemisphere (NH) temperature for the past two millennia suggested solar insolation as a primary forcing mechanism of ISM variability. The reconstructed paleoclimate combined with archaeology and historical records indicated that ancient Indian civilizations e.g., the Indus Valley (similar to 5200-3300 cal yr BP) and Vedic (similar to 3400-2400 cal yr BP) had established and thrived during periods of strengthened ISM precipitation, whereas their collapse closely corresponded to the decreased strength in ISM. From similar to 2400 to 200 cal yr BP, the Indian subcontinent witnessed the rise and fall of various Kingdoms/dynasties. This period saw an exponential expansion/growth in agriculture, economy, population, languages, architecture, and religions in the Indian subcontinent. The agrarian-based economy showed little or no impact of monsoon weakening after similar to 2400 cal yr BP possibly due to development and reforms in administrative policies, construction of irrigation systems such as dams, lakes and canals, use of technology for irrigation such as waterwheel, knowledge of double cropping, production of cash crops.

This paper empirically examines the technology transfer process for smallholder farmers in Honduras from an adaptation perspective. It addresses two questions: (1) How does technology transfer contribute to pathways to resilience for smallholder farmers? (2) What challenges do these efforts face in meeting diverse farmer needs and overcoming barriers to technology adoption by the most vulnerable to climate change? These questions are analysed in the context of United States government's Feed the Future initiative. Interviews with smallholder farmers were conducted regarding experiences with technology transfer, adoption choices, and perceptions of climate change. The study found that while adoption rates were high overall, the pace of adoption was still slow, demonstrating a tension between the urgency of climate change and the pace of smallholder adoption. The study found that many technologies increase resilience but may not always be adaptive in the long-term, and that significant resources are needed to successfully transfer technologies to smallholder farmers. This study provides evidence of ways agricultural technology projects contribute to pathways to resilience and demonstrates barriers to their success.","[Kuhl, Laura] Northeastern Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Urban Affairs, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kuhl, Laura] Northeastern Univ, Int Affairs Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Northeastern University; Northeastern University,"Kuhl, L (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Urban Affairs, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Kuhl, L (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Int Affairs Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",l.kuhl@northeastern.edu,,"Kuhl, Laura/0000-0002-1379-9435",NSF IGERT Water Diplomacy program [0966093]; BP; Fletcher School; Hitachi Center for Technology and International Affairs; Tufts Institute for the Environment,NSF IGERT Water Diplomacy program; BP; Fletcher School; Hitachi Center for Technology and International Affairs; Tufts Institute for the Environment,Funding support was provided by the NSF IGERT Water Diplomacy program (grant #0966093); a research grant from BP to the Center for International Environment and Resource Policy; the Fletcher School; the Hitachi Center for Technology and International Affairs; and Tufts Institute for the Environment.,,105,11,12,8,35,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Energy poverty limits their ability to take autonomous actions to improve air circulation and the cooling of their homes. It is therefore important that electricity access planners explicitly evaluate the current and future air circulation and cooling needs of energy-poor households, in addition to other basic energy needs. To address this issue, we combine climate, socio-economic, demographic and satellite data with scenario analysis to model spatially explicit estimates of potential cooling demand from households that currently lack access to electricity. We link these demand factors into a bottom-up electrification model for sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the world's highest concentration of energy poverty. Accounting for cooling needs on top of baseline household demand implies that the average electrification investment requirements grow robustly (a scenario mean of 65.5% more than when considering baseline household demand only), mostly due to the larger generation capacity needed. Future climate change could increase the investment requirements by an additional scenario mean of 4%. Moreover, the share of decentralised systems as the lowest-cost electrification option falls by a scenario mean 4.5 percentage points of all new connections. The crucial determinants for efficient investment pathways are the adoption and use of cooling appliances, the extent of climate change, and the baseline electricity demand. Our results call for a more explicit consideration of climate-adaptative energy needs by infrastructure planners in developing countries . (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The approach translates individual terms of the energy balance (radiation, evapotranspiration, heat storage, and convection) into temperature increments. This is exemplified using micrometeorological simulations (ENVI-met) for the quarter Bayerischer Bahnhof in Leipzig, Germany, under different wind conditions. In result heat storage and convection provide the principal contributions to UHI. The mapping of Delta T-contributions in a neighbourhood is a new tool facilitating the development of tailored measures for reduction of and adaptation to urban heat. For example, the Delta T-contributions (-6.8, -2.6, -9.2, and 15.7 K, respectively) calculated for a courtyard compensate each other. Applying this decomposition at each individual location, suitable adaptation measures can be developed. Considering the superposition of all local Delta T-contributions can support a cost-benefit analysis creating optimal recommendations for city planners.","[Hertel, Daniel; Schlink, Uwe] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Urban & Environm Sociol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Hertel, D (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Urban & Environm Sociol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",daniel.hertel@ufz.de,"Schlink, Uwe/D-5357-2015","Schlink, Uwe/0000-0002-3109-9459","Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt DBU (German Federal Environmental Foundation), Osnabruck","Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt DBU (German Federal Environmental Foundation), Osnabruck","D.

However, small-scale farmers are vulnerable to climate change and climate variability. Their high susceptibility to climate change emanates from their inadequate ability to adapt to climate change. As a result, small-scale farmers are generally adversely impacted by climate change due to over-reliance on rainfed agriculture and natural resources. This exposure and susceptibility, however, differ across the regions due to the heterogeneity in topography, climate, access to resources, farmer resilience and adaptation capacity. Therefore, site-specific studies are encouraged to increase the awareness, resilience and adaptation capacity at the local level. The study intends to analyse historical climate (air temperature and rainfall) data from a weather station that has not been employed for climate change studies and project possible future changes in the same climate parameters due to global warming for a localised agricultural community within the sugarbelt region of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The study focuses mainly on air temperature and rainfall changes to inform local farmers about potential climate changes and possible impacts of the projected climate changes on the local agricultural productivity. This study was conducted in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands of South Africa, and the Representative Climate Pathways (RCP8.5 and RCP4.5) climate projection of the CanESM2 model were used for the projection of future air temperature and rainfall trends for the 2020s, the 2040s and the 2080s. According to the results, both minimum and maximum air temperatures will continue to increase for the entire study period. The RCP8.5 results indicate that maximum and minimum air temperatures will reach a maximum range of 1.72 to 3.14 degrees C and 1.54 to 3.48 degrees C, respectively. For the rainfall, the model projects a positive trend, although all the scenarios predict a declining trend for the near future (2020s) and an increase in the 2050s. These results indicate that, in the absence of adaptation the risk of small-scale farmers, particularly for sugarcane, which is largely planted in the area, the production losses will heighten and hence increase the likelihood of increased poverty, food insecurity and unemployment.","[Ncoyini-Manciya, Zoleka; Savage, Michael J.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Agrometeorol Discipline, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Ncoyini-Manciya, Z (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Agrometeorol Discipline, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa.",ncoyiniz@ukzn.ac.za,,,,,,,64,0,0,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2022,14,17,,,,,,,10682,10.3390/su141710682,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141710682,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,4K5BX,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000851966100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the extent to which these activities capture CO2 with associated climate mitigation impacts are poorly known, especially in geographies where data on biomass growth of restored forests are limited or do not exist. To fill this gap, we developed biomass accumulation rates for a set of FLR activities (natural regeneration, planted forests and woodlots, agroforestry, and mangrove restoration) across the globe and global CO2 removal rates with corresponding confidence intervals, grouped by FLR activity and region/climate. Results: Planted forests and woodlots were found to have the highest CO2 removal rates, ranging from 4.5 to 40.7 t CO2 h(-1) year(-1) during the first 20 years of growth. Mangrove tree restoration was the second most efficient FLR at removing CO2, with growth rates up to 23.1 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) the first 20 years post restoration. Natural regeneration removal rates were 9.1-18.8 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) during the first 20 years of forest regeneration, followed by agroforestry, the FLR category with the lowest and regionally broad removal rates (10.8-15.6 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1)). Biomass growth data was most abundant and widely distributed across the world for planted forests and natural regeneration, representing 45% and 32% of all the data points assessed, respectively. Agroforestry studies, were only found in Africa, Asia, and the Latin America and Caribbean regions. Conclusion: This study represents the most comprehensive review of published literature on tree growth and CO2 removals to date, which we operationalized by constructing removal rates for specific FLR activities across the globe. These rates can easily be applied by practitioners and decision-makers seeking to better understand the positive climate mitigation impacts of existing or planned FLR actions, or by countries making restoration pledges under the Bonn Challenge Commitments or fulfil ling Nationally Determined Contributions to the UNFCCC, thereby helping boost FLR efforts world-wide.","[Bernal, Blanca; Murray, Lara T.; Pearson, Timothy R.

Changing runoff regimes and thus changing seasonal patterns of water availability strongly influence various economic sectors such as agriculture, energy production, and fishery and also affect river ecology. In this study, we use new transient hydrological scenarios driven by the most up-to-date local climate projections for Switzerland, the Swiss Climate Change Scenarios. These provide detailed information on changes in runoff regimes and their time of emergence for 93 rivers in Switzerland under three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. These transient scenarios also allow changes to be framed as a function of global mean temperature. The new projections for seasonal runoff changes largely confirm the sign of changes in runoff from previous hydrological scenarios with increasing winter runoff and decreasing summer and autumn runoff. Spring runoff is projected to increase in high-elevation catchments and to decrease in lower-lying catchments. Despite the increases in winter and some increases in spring, the annual mean runoff is projected to decrease in most catchments. Compared to lowerlying catchments, runoff changes in high-elevation catchments (above 1500ma.s.l.) are larger in winter, spring, and summer due to the large influence of reduced snow accumulation and earlier snowmelt and glacier melt. The changes in runoff and the agreement between climate models on the sign of change both increase with increasing global mean temperatures and higher-emission scenarios. This amplification highlights the importance of climate change mitigation. The time of emergence is the time when the climate signal emerges significantly from natural variability. Under RCP8.5, times of emergence were found early, before the period 2036-2065, in winter and summer for catchments with mean altitudes above 1500ma.s.l. Significant changes in catchments below 1500ma.s.l. emerge later in the century. Not all catchments show significant changes in the distribution of seasonal means; thus, no time of emergence could be determined in these catchments. Furthermore, the significant changes of seasonal mean runoff are not persistent over time in some catchments due to nonlinear changes in runoff.","[Muelchi, Regula; Roessler, Ole; Schwanbeck, Jan; Weingartner, Rolf; Martius, Olivia] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Bern, Switzerland; [Muelchi, Regula; Roessler, Ole; Schwanbeck, Jan; Weingartner, Rolf; Martius, Olivia] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Weingartner, Rolf; Martius, Olivia] Univ Bern, Mobiliar Lab Nat Risks, Bern, Switzerland; [Roessler, Ole] German Fed Inst Hydrol BfG, Koblenz, Germany",University of Bern; University of Bern; University of Bern,"Muelchi, R (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Bern, Switzerland.;Muelchi, R (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland.",regula.muelchi@giub.unibe.ch,"Rossler, Ole/C-7488-2009","Rossler, Ole/0000-0003-2308-0907; Muelchi, Regula/0000-0002-7291-9775",Bundesamt fur Umwelt,Bundesamt fur Umwelt,This research has been supported by the Bundesamt fur Umwelt.,,51,13,13,6,29,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

Although some ski areas are still profitable under current climate and socioeconomic conditions, they will become difficult to operate in the face of rising winter temperatures, which will result in further economic losses, resource waste and environmental damage. This study projects variability in the suitability of ski area development across China in the coming decades. Natural suitability under three representative concentration pathway emission scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), socioeconomic suitability under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP1, SSP2, SSP3, and SSP5) and integrated suitability under four climatic-socioeconomic scenarios (RCP2.6-SSP1, RCP4.5-SSP2, RCP8.5-SSP3, and RCP8.5-SSP5) are reported. Furthermore, the suitability of 731 existing ski areas in China is assessed. The results show a substantial decline in integrated suitability for most regions of China except for some very cold areas, where higher air temperatures will make visitors feel more comfortable and the relatively poor socioeconomic conditions will improve in the 2030s, 2050s and 2090s. The average higher integrated suitability area (integrated suitability values greater than 0.5) under four climatic-socioeconomic scenarios decreases from the current 29.9%-14.4%, 5.0% and 4.5% by the 2030s, 2050s and 2090s, respectively. Under RCP2.6-SSP1, the higher integrated suitability area is projected to decrease from the current 28.0%-5.2% by the 2050s and then increase to 5.3% by the 2090s. Under RCP4.5-SSP2, RCP8.5-SSP3, and RCP8.5-SSP5, the higher integrated suitability area is projected to continuously decrease from 30.3%, 30.6% and 30.6% in the 2010s to 4.1%, 4.4% and 4.4% in the 2090s, respectively. By the 2090s, 41, 138 and 277 existing ski areas are projected to be closed under RCP2.6-SSP1, RCP4.5-SSP2, and RCP8.5-SSP3/RCP8.5-SSP5, respectively.

A city's vulnerability to these heatwaves must be determined to develop proper adaptation measures. This article addresses the vulnerability of a medium-sized city in Central Europe, Graz, to heatwaves. Based on secondary data and primary data gathered from expert interviews, we identified certain determinants of vulnerability for the city: temperature, proportion of open and green spaces to developed areas, construction period of buildings, distribution of age and poverty risk, adaptation strategies used, and risk perception levels assessed for decision makers in the city administration. Certain city districts can be classified as particularly vulnerable. A high level of risk perception was detected among all decision makers and some adaptation measures have already been enacted. In particular, inter-organizational collaboration in adaptation networks works effectively. A deficit in efficient communication between researchers, policy makers, and members of the public was perceived to be the main barrier. This case study exemplifies the assessment of a city's vulnerability to heatwaves on the basis of particular determinants and can be applied to many other cities. Policy relevance The method applied revealed potential improvements and opportunities on the policy level. Strong networks for climate change adaptation are most effective if regular meetings take place, allowing trust and friendship to grow between decision makers. More target-group-oriented information is needed. Emergency organizations, in particular, need more information, because the perception of heatwave risks has only been based thus far on personal experiences. By establishing a central authority, more information could be provided on heatwaves in cities. The need to raise the perception of members of the population and motivate them to take personal responsibility during disasters was emphasized by interviewed decision makers. This can be supported by providing advice during heatwaves through newspapers, TV, and radio. People in risk groups and their relatives could be trained in workshops. City areas that are at high risk should be marked on maps to make relevant information more tangible for decision makers.","[Reischl, Christiane; Rauter, Romana; Posch, Alfred] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Syst Sci Innovat & Sustainabil Res, Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Reischl, C (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci, CAMPUS 02, Graz, Austria.",christiane.reischl@campus02.at,,"Rauter, Romana/0000-0001-5742-2886",,,,,80,13,14,6,67,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

High-resolution remote sensing imageries have emerged as an innovative solution to investigate the spatial variation in agricultural soils with machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, the predic-tive power of the individual and combined effects of Sentinel-1 (S1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral images for mapping soil properties, especially STN, STP, and STK, have rarely been investigated. Moreover, single ML model may achieve unstable performance for predicting multiple soil properties due to strong spatial heterogeneity. This study explored the combine use of S1, S2, and DEM derivatives to map SOM, STN, STP, and STK content of a sloped cropland of northeastern China. A two-step method with a weighted sum of four ML models was proposed to improve the accuracy and robustness in predicting multiple soil properties. Our results showed that single ML model has various performance in predicting the four soil properties. The optimal ML models could explain approximately 56 %, 53 %, 56 % and 37 % of the variability of SOM, STN, STP, and STK, respectively. Using the weights estimated through a 10-fold cross-validation procedure, the two-step ensemble learning model was retrained and showed more robust performance than the four ML models, in which the prediction accuracy was im-proved by 2.38 %, 1.40 %, 3.52 %, and 3.29 % for SOM, STN, STP, and STK, respectively. Our results also showed that the optical S2 derived features, especially the two S2 short-wave infrared bands, enhanced vegetation index, and soil adjusted vegetation index, were more important for soil property prediction than S1 data and DEM derivatives. Compared with individual sensor, a combination of S1 and S2 data yielded more accurate predictions of STN and STP but not for SOM and STK. The results of this study highlight the potential of high-resolution S1 and S2 data and the two-step method for soil property prediction at farmland scale.","[Li, Zhenwang] Yangzhou Univ, Agr Coll, Jiangsu Key Lab Crop Genet & Physiol, Jiangsu Key Lab Crop Cultivat & Physiol, Yangzhou 225009, Peoples R China; [Liu, Feng; Song, Xiaodong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Peng, Xiuyuan] Informat Res Inst, Liaoning Acad Agr Sci, Shenyang 110161, Peoples R China; [Hu, Bangguo] Beijing Deep Blue Space Remote Sensing Technol Co, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Yangzhou University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil Science, CAS","Song, XD (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.",xdsong@issas.ac.cn,,,Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20220093]; National Natural Science Founda- tion of China [42271058]; International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [131323KYSB20210004]; Liaoning Pro- vincial People's Livelihood Science and Technology Program Joint Project [2021030337-JH2/102],Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); National Natural Science Founda- tion of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Liaoning Pro- vincial People's Livelihood Science and Technology Program Joint Project,"Acknowledgements This study was jointly supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20220093) , the National Natural Science Founda- tion of China (No. 42271058) , the International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (131323KYSB20210004) , and Liaoning Pro- vincial People's Livelihood Science and Technology Program Joint Project (2021030337-JH2/102) .",,81,0,0,15,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

We measured evapotranspiration (ET) and surface energy fluxes over the riparian shrub Myricaria squamosa Desv., which is widely distributed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau but has not been studied until now. The results indicated that annual ET was 390 mm and 503 mm for the period of 2010 to 2011 and 2011 to 2012, respectively, which was higher than the amount of precipitation during the same period. Cumulative ET was lower than the cumulative reference evapotranspiration during the entire experimental period, whereas ET in August was higher than reference evapotranspiration. ET in the growing season occupied over 80% of annual ET with a maximum daily ET of 7.2 mm d(-1), and the ET in the non-growing season was quite low because of the frozen soil. In general, temperature and net radiation were the key variables controlling daily ET rates for M. squamosa. Annual sensible heat flux (H) consumed 60% of net radiation (R-n) and latent heat flux (LE) 40% during the three years of the study. LE occupied the main part of R-n from July to September. H was the highest in May and June, then sunk in the mid-growing season, and rebounded the other peak at late September and early October. Daily ground heat flux was positive from April to mid-September, and it was an important heat source of land surface in the winter and spring. This study highlighted that as an alpine riparian ecosystem in a semiarid region, ET and surface energy partitioning of the M. squamosa community are strongly affected by the freeze-thaw cycle, groundwater fluctuation, precipitation pulses and soil water content. We speculate that climate warming has a significant impact on ET process and surface energy partitioning of the M. squamosa community by influencing the freeze-thaw cycle and soil water content.

Scientific evidence increasingly reveals that wetlands play critical hydrologic roles in landscapes, helping to mitigate flood, drought, and, in some cases, fire risks. However, wetland protective services have not received sufficient policy action. We propose national wetland commissions, modeled after the concept of lake and river commissions, as one way to strategically link wetland protection to other societal objectives, including human disaster risk planning, infrastructure investments, and climate adaptation strategies. We offer an example applicable to the United States, describing an institutional design for a National Interagency Wetland Commission. We suggest it could be patterned after existing federal commissions statutorily created by Congress with delegated administrative and regulatory authority and designated independent agency status within the executive branch.

Our novel approach includes the creation of a preliminary model based on individual interviews and a triangulation of information after the workshop. We conclude that stakeholders are aware of climate change, but insufficient attention is given to adaptive solutions mainly because they require high initial investments.

Understanding the factors causing this phenomenon could help urban areas adapt to climate change and improve living conditions of inhabitants. In this study, land surface temperatures (LST) of Aarhus, a city in the high latitudes, are estimated from the reflectance of a thermal band (TIRS1; Band 10; 10.60-11.19 mu m) of Landsat 8 on five dates in the summer months (one in 2015, and four in 2018). Spectral indices, modelled on the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), using all combinations of the first seven bands of Landsat 8 are calculated and their relationships with LST, analysed. Land cover characteristics, in terms of the percentages of tree cover, building cover and overall vegetation cover are estimated from airborne LiDAR data, building footprints and 4-band aerial imagery, respectively. The correlations between LST, the spectral indices and land cover are estimated. The difference in mean temperature between the rural and urban parts of Aarhus is up to 3.96 degrees C, while the difference between the warmer and colder zones (based on the mean and SD of LST) is up to 13.26 degrees C. The spectral index using the near infrared band (NIR; Band 5; 0.85-0.88 mu m) and a short-wave infrared band (SWIR2; Band 7; 2.11-2.29 mu m) has the strongest correlations (r: 0.62 to 0.89) with LST for the whole study area. This index is the inverse of normalised burn ratio (NBR), which has been used for mapping burnt areas. Spectral indices using different combinations of the infrared bands have stronger correlations with LST than the more widely used vegetation indices such as NDVI. The percentage of tree cover has a higher negative correlation (Pearson's r: -0.68 to -0.75) with IST than overall vegetation cover (r: -0.45 to -0.63). Tree cover and building cover (r: -0.53 to 0.71) together explain up to 68 % of the variation in LST. Modification of tree and building cover may therefore have the potential to regulate urban LST.","[Alexander, Cici] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Inst Adv Studies AIAS, Hegh Guldbergs Gade 6B, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Alexander, Cici] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Inst Adv Studies, Hoegh Guldbergs Gade 6B, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Aarhus University; Aarhus University,"Alexander, C (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Inst Adv Studies AIAS, Hegh Guldbergs Gade 6B, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark.;Alexander, C (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Inst Adv Studies, Hoegh Guldbergs Gade 6B, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",,"Alexander, Cici/B-3823-2008","Alexander, Cici/0000-0002-1671-6770","AIAS-COFUND Fellowship at the Aarhus Institute of Advanced Studies, Aarhus University under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological development and Demonstration [609033]","AIAS-COFUND Fellowship at the Aarhus Institute of Advanced Studies, Aarhus University under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological development and Demonstration","This research was funded by an AIAS-COFUND Fellowship at the Aarhus Institute of Advanced Studies, Aarhus University, under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological development and Demonstration under grant agreement no [609033].

Effective large-scale monitoring of these woodlands has a critical role to play in mitigating for, and adapting to, climate change. Mediterranean woodlands have low carbon densities, but represent important global carbon stocks due to their extensiveness and are particularly vulnerable because the region is predicted to become much hotter and drier over the coming century. Airborne lidar is already recognized as an excellent approach for high-fidelity carbon mapping, but few studies have used multi-temporal lidar surveys to measure carbon fluxes in forests and none have worked with Mediterranean woodlands. We use a multi-temporal (5-year interval) airborne lidar data set for a region of central Spain to estimate above-ground biomass (AGB) and carbon dynamics in typical mixed broadleaved and/or coniferous Mediterranean woodlands. Field calibration of the lidar data enabled the generation of grid-based maps of AGB for 2006 and 2011, and the resulting AGB change was estimated. There was a close agreement between the lidar-based AGB growth estimate (1.22 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and those derived from two independent sources: the Spanish National Forest Inventory, and a tree-ring based analysis (1.19 and 1.13 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), respectively). We parameterised a simple simulator of forest dynamics using the lidar carbon flux measurements, and used it to explore four scenarios of fire occurrence. Under undisturbed conditions (no fire) an accelerating accumulation of biomass and carbon is evident over the next 100 years with an average carbon sequestration rate of 1.95 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1). This rate reduces by almost a third when fire probability is increased to 0.01 (fire return rate of 100 years), as has been predicted under climate change. Our work shows the power of multi-temporal lidar surveying to map woodland carbon fluxes and provide parameters for carbon dynamics models. Space deployment of lidar instruments in the near future could open the way for rolling out wide-scale forest carbon stock monitoring to inform management and governance responses to future environmental change.","[Simonson, W.; Coomes, D.] Univ Cambridge, Forest Ecol & Conservat Grp, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England; [Ruiz-Benito, P.] Univ Stirling, Sch Nat Sci, Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Ruiz-Benito, P.] Univ Alcala, Dept Life Sci, Forest Ecol & Restorat Grp, Sci Bldg,Campus Univ, Madrid 28871, Spain; [Valladares, F.] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Serrano 115 Dpdo, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Valladares, F.] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Ciencias, Madrid, Spain; [Simonson, W.] World Conservat Monitoring Ctr, United Nations Environm Programme, 219 Huntingdon Rd, Cambridge CB3 0DL, England",University of Cambridge; University of Stirling; Universidad de Alcala; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales (MNCN); Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Simonson, W (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Forest Ecol & Conservat Grp, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England.;Simonson, W (corresponding author), World Conservat Monitoring Ctr, United Nations Environm Programme, 219 Huntingdon Rd, Cambridge CB3 0DL, England.",wds10@cam.ac.uk,"Ruiz-Benito, Paloma/E-5833-2012","Ruiz-Benito, Paloma/0000-0002-2781-5870; Simonson, Will/0000-0001-5795-6802; Coomes, David/0000-0002-8261-2582",FunDivEurope; Isaac Newton Trust; International Post doc Fellowship Programme in Plant Sciences (PLANT FELLOWS),FunDivEurope; Isaac Newton Trust; International Post doc Fellowship Programme in Plant Sciences (PLANT FELLOWS),"Field data were collected by T.

The Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP) is the main potato growing region accounting for almost 85% of the 1.8 Mha under the crop in India where it is grown as an irrigated crop during the winter season. Since IGP is in sub-tropical plains, duration of the thermally suitable window is the main determinant limiting yields. Hence the impact of climate change on potato in the IGP was assessed using MIROC HI. 3.2 A1b and B1, PRECIS A1b, A2, B2 scenarios and estimated the potential adaptation gains. The potato crop duration in the IGP is projected to decrease due to climate change. The evapotranspiration (ET) is projected to increase while the water use efficiency (WUE) for potato yield is projected to decline in future climates as a consequence of low threshold temperatures for decline in WUE and yield than the ET. Results indicate that the upper threshold for ET decrease is similar to 23 degrees C while that for WUE is 15 degrees C. The optimal temperatures for tuber yield is similar to 17 degrees C and thus the reduction in WUE in future climates is discernable. Climate change is projected to reduce potato yields by similar to 2.5, similar to 6 and similar to 11% in the IGP region in 2020 (2010-2039), 2050 (2040-2069) and 2080 (2070-2099) time periods. Change in planting time is the single most important adaptation option which may lead to yield gains by similar to 6% in 2020 and its combination with improved variety or additional nitrogen may be required to adapt to climate change leading to positive gains by similar to 8% in 2020 and by similar to 5% even in 2050. However, in 2080 adoption of all the three adaptation strategies may be needed for positive gains. Intra-regional differences in the impact of climate change and adaptation gains are projected; positive impact in north-western IGP, gains in Central IGP with adaptation and yield loss in eastern IGP even with adaptation.","[Kumar, S.

Part I: An integrated modeling approach for hazard scenario construction,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; Groundwater; Hydrogeologic model; Aquifer recharge,,"Climate change impacts on water resources, particularly groundwater, is a highly debated topic worldwide, triggering international attention and interest from both researchers and policy makers due to its relevant link with European water policy directives (e.g. 2000/60/EC and 2007/118/EC) and related environmental objectives. The understanding of long-term impacts of climate variability and change is therefore a key challenge in order to address effective protection measures and to implement sustainable management of water resources. This paper presents the modeling approach adopted within the Life + project TRUST (Tool for Regional-scale assessment of groUndwater Storage improvement in adaptation to climaTe change) in order to provide climate change hazard scenarios for the shallow groundwater of high Veneto and Friuli Plain, Northern Italy. Given the aim to evaluate potential impacts on water quantity and quality (e.g. groundwater level variation, decrease of water availability for irrigation, variations of nitrate infiltration processes), the modeling approach integrated an ensemble of climate, hydrologic and hydrogeologic models running from the global to the regional scale. Global and regional climate models and downscaling techniques were used to make climate simulations for the reference period 1961-1990 and the projection period 2010-2100. The simulation of the recent climate was performed using observed radiative forcings, whereas the projections have been done prescribing the radiative forcings according to the IPCC A1B emission scenario. The climate simulations and the downscaling, then, provided the precipitation, temperatures and evapo-transpiration fields used for the impact analysis. Based on down-scaled climate projections, 3 reference scenarios for the period 2071-2100 (i.e. the driest, the wettest and the mild year) were selected and used to run a regional geomorphoclimatic and hydrogeological model. The final output of the model ensemble produced information about the potential variations of the water balance components (e.g. river discharge, groundwater level and volume) due to climate change. Such projections were used to develop potential hazard scenarios for the case study area, to be further applied within climate change risk assessment studies for groundwater resources and associated ecosystems.","[Pasini, S.; Critto, A.; Marcomini, A.] Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, I-30123 Venice, Italy; [Baruffi, F.; Cisotto, A.; Cimolino, A.; Ferri, M.; Monego, M.; Norbiato, D.; Cappelletto, M.; Bisaglia, M.] Autorita Bacino Fiumi Alto Adriat, I-30121 Venice, Italy; [Pretner, A.; Galli, A.; Scarinci, A.; Marsala, V.; Panelli, C.] SGI Studio Galli Ingn, I-35030 Sarmeola Di Rubano, PD, Italy; [Gualdi, S.; Bucchignani, E.; Torresan, S.; Pasini, S.; Critto, A.; Marcomini, A.] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, I-73100 Lecce, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC),"Marcomini, A (corresponding author), Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Calle Larga S Marta 2137, I-30123 Venice, Italy.",segreteria@adbve.it; andrea.scarinci@sgi-spa.it; silvio.gualdi@bo.ingv.it; e.bucchignani@cira.it; torresan@cmcc.it; sara.pasini@stud.unive.it; critto@unive.it; marcom@unive.it,"Gualdi, Silvio/F-3061-2015; Bucchignani, Edoardo/AAL-4170-2020","Gualdi, Silvio/0000-0001-7777-8935; TORRESAN, Silvia/0000-0002-9758-7084; Monego, Martina/0000-0001-6147-6043; Critto, Andrea/0000-0001-8868-9057","European Commission; Italian Ministry for the Environment, the Land and the Sea [LIFE07ENV/IT/000475]","European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Italian Ministry for the Environment, the Land and the Sea","The authors gratefully acknowledge the European Commission and the Italian Ministry for the Environment, the Land and the Sea, for funding the TRUST project under the Life+ programme (contract number LIFE07ENV/IT/000475).",,36,25,25,0,56,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

The dynamical datasets consist of 19 multi-model simulations datasets from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX), whereas the statistical downscaled datasets comprise 19 multi-model simulations from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Exchange (NEX) Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP, hereafter NEX). The capacity of the CORDEX and NEX datasets to represent past characteristics of extreme precipitation over the DMR was evaluated against eight observation datasets. The precipitation characteristics were represented by eight precipitation indices. Both CORDEX and NEX realistically capture the characteristics of extreme precipitation over the Drakensberg and, in most cases, their biases lie within the observation uncertainty. However, NEX performs better than CORDEX in reproducing most of the precipitation characteristics, except in simulating the threshold of extreme rainfall. The ensemble means of CORDEX and NEX agree on a future increase in the intensity of normal precipitation, in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation, as well as an increase in widespread extreme events, with a decrease in the number of precipitation days and continuous wet days. However, they disagree on the projected changes of annual precipitation, for which CORDEX projects an increase over most parts of the DMR, whereas NEX indicates a decrease. The self-organizing-map analysis, which reveals diversity in the projection patterns hidden in the ensemble means, shows the most probable combinations of projected changes in the annual precipitation and extreme precipitation events (in terms of intensity and frequency): (a) increase in both annual precipitation and extreme precipitation events; (b) decrease in both annual precipitation and extreme precipitation events; (c) decrease in annual precipitation but increase in extreme precipitation events. The results of this study can thus provide a basis for developing climate change adaptation and mitigating strategies over the DMR.","[Takong, Ridick Roland; Abiodun, Babatunde J.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Climate Syst Anal Grp, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Takong, RR (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Climate Syst Anal Grp, Cape Town, South Africa.",takong@aims.ac.za,"Abiodun, Babatunde Joseph/ABG-6340-2021","Abiodun, Babatunde Joseph/0000-0002-3878-0116",University of Cape Town (UCT); Water Research Commission (WRC),University of Cape Town (UCT); Water Research Commission (WRC),University of Cape Town (UCT); Water Research Commission (WRC),,91,0,0,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

In a field trial on a sandy loam soil in eastern Germany, reduced tillage was carried out to 6 cm soil depth by means of a ring cutter and compared to mouldboard ploughing with 25 cm tillage depth. In the present study, the influence of ring cutter tillage on soil properties was investigated for the first time. The effects of shallow ring cutter tillage on soil physical parameters, soil organic matter distribution, soil mineral nitrogen content, total nitrogen uptake by the crop, root content, and grain yield of organically grown winter rye (Secale cereale L.) were analysed in the uppermost 20 cm of a sandy loam soil and compared to those of mouldboard ploughing. Under ring cutter tillage, soil bulk density was in 8-20 cm soil depth by up to 15% higher than under mouldboard ploughing. In 9-15 cm soil depth, ring cutter tillage resulted in smaller contents of coarse macropores and mesopores, more micropores, and an 11% smaller available water capacity compared to mouldboard ploughing. The total nitrogen uptake by winter rye was in the ring cutter treatment by up to 44% smaller than in the mouldboard plough treatment. Root content was up to 209% higher in 1-6 cm soil depth and up to 71% smaller in 8-20 cm soil depth after ring cutter tillage than after mouldboard ploughing. Winter rye yield declined by 22-43% in the ring cutter treatment relative to the mouldboard plough treatment. Shallow ring cutter tillage resulted in a root growth-restricting soil compaction in the non-tilled soil layers below 6 cm depth and led to a limitation of nitrogen mineralisation until spring. Both effects likely caused the considerable reduction of crop yield. The results suggest that shallow ring cutter tillage in organic farming seems to be not suitable for sandy loam soils as long as the risk of a soil compaction-induced limitation of root growth and nitrogen supply cannot be minimised.","[Hofbauer, Michael] Res Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Dept Pedol & Soil Conservat, Zabovreska 250, Prague 15627 5, Zbraslav, Czech Republic; [Hofbauer, Michael; Bloch, Ralf; Bachinger, Johann] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Res Area Land Use & Governance 2, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Bloch, Ralf] Eberswalde Univ Sustainable Dev, Fac Landscape Management & Nat Conservat, Schicklerstr 5, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany; [Gerke, Horst H.] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Working Grp Hydropedol, Res Area Landscape Functioning 1, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany",Research Institute for Soil & Water Conservation - Czech Republic; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF),"Hofbauer, M (corresponding author), Res Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Dept Pedol & Soil Conservat, Zabovreska 250, Prague 15627 5, Zbraslav, Czech Republic.",hofbauer.michael@vumop.cz; ralf.bloch@hnee.de; jbachinger@zalf.de; gerke@zalf.de,"Hofbauer, Michael/GMW-5537-2022","Hofbauer, Michael/0000-0002-3174-4390; Kincl, David/0000-0001-9248-3828","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL); Brandenburgian Ministry of Science, Research and Culture (MWFK); Czech Ministry of Agriculture (MZe) [QK21010161, QK1910334, MZe RO0218]","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL); Brandenburgian Ministry of Science, Research and Culture (MWFK); Czech Ministry of Agriculture (MZe)","This study was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL), the Brandenburgian Ministry of Science, Research and Culture (MWFK), and the Czech Ministry of Agriculture (MZe; projects QK21010161, QK1910334 and MZe RO0218).

The Mediterranean basin is considered a hot spot in terms of climate vulnerability and risk. The expected impacts of those events are exacerbated by land-use change and, in particular, by urban growth which increases soil sealing and, hence, water runoff. The ultimate consequence would be an increase of fatalities and injuries, but also of economic losses in urban areas, commercial and productive sites, infrastructures and agriculture. Flood damages have different magnitudes depending on the economic value of the exposed assets and on level of physical contact with the hazard. This work aims at proposing a methodology, easily customizable by experts' elicitation, able to quantify and map the social component of vulnerability through the integration of earth observation (EO) and census data with the aim of allowing for a multi-temporal spatial assessment. Firstly, data on employment, properties and education are used for assessing the adaptive capacity of the society to increase resilience to adverse events, whereas, secondly, coping capacity, i.e. the capacities to deal with events during their manifestation, is mapped by aggregating demographic and socio-economic data, urban growth analysis and memory on past events. Thirdly, the physical dimension of exposed assets (susceptibility) is assessed by combining building properties acquired by census data and land-surface characteristics derived from EO data. Finally, the three components (i.e. adaptive and coping capacity and susceptibility) are aggregated for calculating the dynamic flood vulnerability index (FVI). The approach has been applied to Northeast Italy, a region frequently hit by floods, which has experienced a significant urban and economic development in the past decades, thus making the dynamic study of FVI particularly relevant. The analysis has been carried out from 1991 to 2016 at a 5-year steps, showing how the integration of different data sources allows to produce a dynamic assessment of vulnerability, which can be very relevant for planning in support of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction.","[Cian, Fabio; Giupponi, Carlo] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Fondamenta San Giobbe 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy; [Marconcini, Mattia] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Muenchener Str 20, D-82234 Wessling, Germany",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Cian, F (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Fondamenta San Giobbe 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy.",fabio.cian@unive.it; cgiupponi@unive.it; mattia.marconcini@dlr.de,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,Universita Ca' Foscari Venezia,Universita Ca' Foscari Venezia,Open Access funding provided by Universita Ca' Foscari Venezia.,,72,2,2,1,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

We employed the static chamber method to collect gas samples from the experimental plots which were subsequently analysed using gas chromatograph. Significant CH4 emissions were detected only in the CT rice system during the initial phase of continuous flooding, irrespective of N management strategies. N fertilization management affected the pattern of N2O emission with higher emission rates during crop establishment phase under 80% RDN as basal followed by GS guided N application than conventional RDN. In case of wheat, 80% RDN as basal followed by GS guided N application also induced higher cumulative N2O emissions than applying RDN at three regular splits. In rice, ZT-based RW system emitted more N2O than CT-based system. Overall ZT-based RW system reduced CH4 emission but this benefit is counterbalanced by higher N2O production compared to CT-based RW system.","[Sapkota, Tek B.; Jat, M.

A field experiment was conducted in humid-tropical Hong Kong to address the research question under typical summer-weather scenarios: sunny, cloudy and rainy. On a large circular concrete tank, climber-greenwall experimental plots were established with duplication in four cardinal compass directions. Air and infrared-radiometer surface temperature sensors monitored at different greenwall positions: ambient-air (control), bare-concrete-surface (control), vegetation-surface, behind-mesh-airgap, and behind-mesh-concrete surface. Pyranometers were installed vertically at four orientations and horizontally at tank-top (control) to monitor solar-energy input. Habitat verticality induces notable variations in solar-energy capture at four orientations by daily total, peak level, intensity, duration and timing. On sunny day, solar fraction reaching east side was only 37.1% of tank-top. Early morning sunshine striking east side nearly perpendicularly brings maximum intensity. South side facing the sun but at tangential incident angle has only 23.3% reception. Strong irradiance drives high control-surface temperature, but also induces notable vegetation-surface and adjacent ambient-air cooling by transpiration. A threshold solar intensity of about 300 Wm(-2) is necessary to impart notable cooling-effect. Summer-sunny day and rainy-day sunshine-burst episodes could satisfy this condition; cloudy day and rainfall periods with attenuated-diffused sunlight could not. Cloudy day and rainfall periods suppress cooling differences by orientation. Behind-mesh concrete surface is consistently cooler than control concrete surface in the three summer-weather scenarios. Behind-mesh-air remains warmer than ambient-air but cooler than two adjoining surfaces (vegetation and behind-mesh-concrete), indicating air-barrier effect and restricted air exchange between ambience and airgap. It implies that greenwall can bring bidirectional cooling, but transpiration cooling of anterior (ambient) air is more effective than shading and thermal-insulation cooling of posterior (airgap) air and concrete-surface. The findings could inform greenwall design to enhance ecosystem services for climate-change adaption and urban heat island amelioration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, given the time-variant meteorological parameters with high-level uncertainties, climate-adaptive design on aerogel materials in building glazing systems can resist heat flux and reduce heat gain, so as to reduce the cooling energy consumption in subtropical climates. In this study, uncertainty optimisation was conducted in a subtropical climate region with sensitivity analysis, using a two-stage learning approach. Results indicate that, with the increase of stochastic sampling size from 18 to 72, the training epoch required to learn accurate optimisation function increases from 5000 to 20,000. Compared to the deterministic scenario, a gradual decrease in total heat gain can be noticed for uncertainty-based optimal scenarios. Furthermore, dynamic thermal performance is highly dependent on uncertainty magnitudes, but insensitive to stochastic sampling size. This study quantifies the impact of sample size and uncertainty magnitude on dynamic thermal performance with frontier guidelines, providing climate-adaptive aerogel glazings under stochastic scenario uncertainties.","[Zhou, Yuekuan] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol Guangzhou, Sustainable Energy & Environm Thrust, Funct Hub, Guangzhou 511400, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yuekuan] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yuekuan] HKUST Shenzhen Hong Kong Collaborat Innovat Res In, Shenzhen, Futian, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology (Guangzhou); Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Zhou, YK (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol Guangzhou, Sustainable Energy & Environm Thrust, Funct Hub, Guangzhou 511400, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Zhou, YK (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Zhou, YK (corresponding author), HKUST Shenzhen Hong Kong Collaborat Innovat Res In, Shenzhen, Futian, Peoples R China.",yuekuanzhou@ust.hk,,,Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) [G0101000059]; Project of Hetao Shenzhen Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone [HZQB-KCZYB- 2020083],Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou); Project of Hetao Shenzhen Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone,This work was supported by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) startup grant (G0101000059) .

To maximize its potential for future large-scale applications, the geometries of the MMARS were optimized for the first time to obtain the lowest system cost under various weather conditions and cooling demands in different climate zones of China. After optimization, Kunming (mild region) has the highest levelized cooling demand cost of 0.2710 $/kWh because of its high initial cost, while Beijing (cold region) has the lowest cost of 0.1508 $/kWh due to its rich solar energy to reduce the operating cost and sufficient cooling demand to levelize the initial cost. It is worth noting that if only natural gas is counted in energy consumption, Kunming, with rich solar energy, achieves the highest seasonal COP of 2.654, but Hong Kong (hot summer and warm winter region) with insufficient solar energy only gets 1.318 because of the low proportion (48.84%) of solar energy in its heat sources.

This explorative study was executed to create design guidelines for climate-responsive UGI that stem from scientific knowledge and are useful to design practice. A participatory 'Research through Design' (RTD) approach was applied in two design studios to have landscape architects test evidence-based preliminary guidelines. The researchers made observations, plan analyses, and executed questionnaires in the studios to assess the usefulness of the preliminary guidelines and, subsequently, to refine them. This paper presents the revised guidelines for the city, park, and street scale levels and elaborates the knowledge on the microclimate and operational principles needed for implementation.

Mitigation faces collective action issues because its costs are focused on specific locations/actors but benefits are global and nonexcludable. Adaptation, in contrast, creates local benefits, and therefore should face fewer collective action issues. However, governance units vary in the types of adaptation policies they adopt. To explain this variation, we suggest conceptualizing adaptation- aspolitics because adaptation speaks to the issues of power, conflicting policy preferences, resource allocation, and administrative tensions. In examining who develops and implements adaptation, we explore whether adaptation is the old wine of disaster management in the new bottle of climate policy, and the tensions between national and local policy making. In exploring what adaptation policies are adopted, we discuss maladaptation and the distinction between hard and soft infrastructure. Finally, we examine why politicians favor visible, hard adaptation over soft adaptation, and how international influences shape local policy.","[Dolsak, Nives] Univ Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Prakash, Aseem] Univ Washington, Dept Polit Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Prakash, Aseem] Univ Washington, Ctr Environm Polit, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Dolsak, N (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",nives@uw.edu; aseem@uw.edu,,"Dolsak, Nives/0000-0002-8325-3155",,,,,142,43,43,2,30,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1543-5938,,978-0-8243-2343-1,ANNU REV ENV RESOUR,Annu.

Moreover, it explicates which factors constitute this context and how these factors vary across the case municipalities. National climate adaptation policy in Norway can currently be characterized as top down, providing standardized requirements and advice to municipalities. However, Norwegian municipalities vary greatly with respect to physical conditions, organizational resources, and societal needs. They are autonomous to a great extent and are almost solely responsible for developing climate policy and planning within their own territories. Therefore, municipalities adapt national policies to their own context, reflecting local physiographic, organizational, and resource challenges, but these local translations are not fully recognized by national and sectoral actors. This paper underscores that the significant variation in contextual factors between municipalities is not sufficiently addressed and understood by national and sectoral governmental authorities. With the identified variation of the contextual factors across the case municipalities, an adaptive comanagement strategy within a multilevel governance system is suggested as a suitable framework to ensure a proactive approach to local adaptation, that is, mutual understanding and better cooperation between the national and local levels.","[Westskog, Hege; Hovelsrud, Grete K.] Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo, Oslo, Norway; [Hovelsrud, Grete K.] Nord Univ, Fac Social Sci, Bodo, Norway; [Sundqvist, Goran] Univ Oslo, TIK Ctr Technol Innovat & Culture, Oslo, Norway",Nord University; University of Oslo,"Westskog, H (corresponding author), Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo, Oslo, Norway.",hege.westskog@cicero.oslo.no,,"Westskog, Hege/0000-0003-4943-8874",Research Council of Norway [207622],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"We wish to thank Christian Bjornaes, communication director at Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research (CICERO) Oslo, for facilitating the process with the county governor of Vestfold and contributing with his skills to the interviews with the municipalities in Vestfold.

The implementation of some practices need to be readjusted due to steadily increasing temperature and lowering precipitation. For farmers, the best practice found, should have the potential to achieve maximum sustainable levels of soil productivity in the context of climate change. A study was conducted in South-West Niger to investigate the use of the suitable practice, through (i) a meta-analysis of case studies, (ii) using field survey and (iii) by using AquaCrop model. Results showed that the effects of the association zai + mulch on crop yield was up to 2 times higher than control plots depending on climate projections scenario RCP 8.5 under which carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations are projected to reach 936 ppm by 2100. The practice appeared to be an interesting option for enhancing crop productivity in a context of climate change. Concerning its ability, it offers the best prospects to reverse soil degradation in the study area. In addition, the simulation showed that this strategy was suitable for timely sowing and therefore confirmed scholars and farmers views. Furthermore, this practice is relatively more effective compared to the others practices. These results show that association zai + mulch could be considered as the best practice that can participate to a successful adaptation to reduce risk from climate change at the same time by reducing the vulnerability of farmers in Southwest of Niger for now and even for the future.","[Issoufou, Abdourhimou Amadou; Konate, Souleymane] Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, WASCAL Grad Res Program Climate Change & Biodiver, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Soumana, Idrissa; Maman, Garba] Inst Natl Rech Agronom Niger, Niamey, Niger; [Konate, Souleymane] Univ Nangui Abrogoua, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Mahamane, Ali] Univ Diffa, BP78, Diffa, Niger",,"Issoufou, AA (corresponding author), Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, WASCAL Grad Res Program Climate Change & Biodiver, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire.",amadou_issoufou@ymail.com,,"Abdourhimou, AMADOU/0000-0002-8444-3962; Garba, Maman/0000-0002-3377-3064",WASCAL-West African Science Service Center on Climate change and Adapted Land use [02CCBI16],WASCAL-West African Science Service Center on Climate change and Adapted Land use,This work was supported by WASCAL-West African Science Service Center on Climate change and Adapted Land use-02CCBI16.,,79,2,3,1,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,JAN,2020,6,1,,,,,,,e03265,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03265,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03265,,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,KH1BC,,"Green Accepted, gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000510380200216,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two communication patterns with fathers, mothers, and friends were identified: one solution oriented and supportive, and one dismissive and doom-and-gloom oriented. The positive patterns correlated positively with problem-focused and meaning-focused coping, whereas the negative patterns correlated positively with deemphasizing. Communication with fathers was particularly important in explaining deemphasizing and problem-focused coping. A structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis showed that coping mediates the effects of communication patterns on behavior, whereas problem-focused coping mediates the influence of other coping strategies on behavior.

New agricultural systems are needed that can meet this challenge. Innovations in water management engineering and cropping system diversification may provide a way forward, enabling transformation to highly multifunctional agricultural watersheds that expand both agricultural production and water-related services to society, and which provide scalable units of climate adaptation in agriculture and water systems. Implementation and refinement of such watersheds require corresponding social innovation to create supportive social systems, in economic, political and cultural terms. A range of emerging social innovations can drive the emergence of highly multifunctional agricultural watersheds, by enabling robust cooperation, resource exchange and coordinated innovation across multiple societal sectors and scales. We highlight relevant innovations and opportunities for their exploratory implementation and refinement in the Midwest.","[Jordan, Nicholas R.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Agron & Plant Genet, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Mulla, David J.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Soil Water & Climate, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Slotterback, Carissa] Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, Urban & Reg Planning, 301 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Runck, Bryan] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Geog Environm & Soc, 269-19th Ave South, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Hays, Carol] Prairie Rivers Network, 1902 Fox Dr,Suite G, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Jordan, NR (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Agron & Plant Genet, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",jorda020@umn.edu,,"Slotterback, Carissa/0000-0003-4799-8616",,,,,29,8,8,3,31,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1742-1705,1742-1713,,RENEW AGR FOOD SYST,Renew.

Zhangye is an oasis city located in the Heihe River Basin in northwestern China. It is populated with an agriculture-dominated economy and faces more and more serious water crises. Virtual water is an indicator that can measure the embodied water in the traded products, which has been widely applied for making rational policies for water resources management. In addition, clarifying water requirements in agricultural sectors under future climate change scenarios is essential to develop more appropriate adaptation strategies. From this perspective, this study aims to evaluate and compare virtual water flows among various sectors in Zhangye for the years 2012 and 2017 with a single regional input-output model and to further clarify the future water requirement tendency in agriculture during 2020-2050 under different shared socioeconomic pathways and representative concentration pathways (SSP-RCP) scenarios. The results showed that the planting sector directly contributed most of the total water consumption with the highest direct coefficient of 3307.5 m(3)/yuan in 2012, whereas the manufacture of food products and tobacco processing sector had the largest proportion of indirect water consumption (99%) mainly from intermediate inputs of agricultural products. Water consumption intensity of all sectors on average decreased by 22% during 2012-2017, indicating an increasing water utilization efficiency in economic industries. Household consumption also can improve water utilization efficiency as the major pathway for final consumption (86.4% in 2017). Water scarcity in Zhangye was becoming increasingly prominent since virtual water net exports were higher than local consumption, especially in the agriculture, manufacturing, and energy supply industries. Moreover, under climate change scenarios, we found the highest level of water requirement per unit area occurred in 2000, but it still had an incremental potential by 2050, especially in SSP585. The high requirement intensity and large-scale maize planting caused a rising tendency of total crop water requirement with an annual increasing rate of 8.4% from 1980 to 2050. This makes it possible to adapt to climate change through scientific management measures and technical means. We further made policy implications for adaptive management of water resources in Zhangye.","[Wang, Yifei; Li, Zhihui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yifei; Li, Zhihui] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yifei; Li, Zhihui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Haowei] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Beijing Forestry University","Li, ZH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Li, ZH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Li, ZH (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lizhihui@igsnrr.ac.cn,,"Wu, Haowei/0000-0002-3235-6437",Young Scientists Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [71804175]; NSFC-Yunnan Joint Fund Key Support Project [U2102208]; Major Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41890824],Young Scientists Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NSFC-Yunnan Joint Fund Key Support Project; Major Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Funding This research was financially supported by the Young Scientists Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71804175), the NSFC-Yunnan Joint Fund Key Support Project (Grant No. U2102208), and the Major Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41890824).",,48,1,1,18,29,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

J,"Wu, R",,,,"Wu, Rui",,,The carbon footprint of the Chinese health-care system: an environmentally extended input-output and structural path analysis study,LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ENERGY; EMISSIONS; IMPACTS,"Background The health sector plays an important part in adapting to climate change; however, the sector is also responsible for significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In high-income countries, the carbon footprints of health-care systems have been estimated to be 3-10% of the total national GHG emissions, but no in-depth investigation has been done for China. This study aims to examine the carbon footprint of the Chinese health-care system and identify emission hotspots. Methods Environmentally extended input-output analysis and structural path analysis were used to assess the lifecycle GHG emissions of the Chinese health-care system. A satellite account of GHG emissions was constructed for 46 economic sectors in China using energy data from the National Bureau of Statistics based on the numbers reported by a large number of enterprises. Data on health expenditure for medical institutions, pharmaceuticals, construction, administration, and research were obtained from multiple Chinese official statistics yearbooks and the national input-output table. Findings In 2012, China spent CNY 2539 billion on health care, leading to emissions of 315 (68% CI 267-363) megatonnes CO2 equivalent. Health care accounted for 2.7% (68% CI 2.3-3.1) of China's total GHG emissions. The major contributors of GHG emissions in the health-care system were public hospitals (148 megatonnes [47%]), nonhospital purchased pharmaceuticals (56 megatonnes [18%]), and construction (46 megatonnes [15%]). In medical institutions, energy use for buildings and transport accounted for only 16% of the total carbon footprint, whereas 84% was embodied in the purchased goods and services. Interpretation China has a much smaller health-care carbon footprint per capita than developed countries, such as the USA and Australia. However, its carbon emissions per unit of health expenditure are relatively high because of the expenditure structure and the carbon intensity of the country's entire economy. The results suggest the need for a nationwide carbon-efficient target for health care and use of low-carbon alternatives in making supply chain choices to achieve reductions in the carbon footprint.

However, effect of cropland management changes on SOC dynamics has not been recently assessed in the tropics. Studies were compiled in the tropics where SOC stocks were measured in the topsoil (0-20 or 0-30 cm depth) after the adoption of management practices that are expected to enhance SOC stocks, including tillage reduction, crop rotation, exogenous organic amendments, restitution of crop residues, mineral amendments, and combinations of these practices. Random forest regression was used to identify the determinants of SOC accumulation rates (ASOC) depending on the climate, soil characteristics and changes in management practices. 214 cases were identified in 48 studies in 13 different countries. The average ASOC was 0.41 +/- 0.03 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (significantly greater than zero), for an average experiment duration of 13.6 +/- 0.6 years. Although a large part of the variability remained unexplained due to methodological bias in the studies or a lack of relevant predictors. The strongest predictors of ASOC were C inputs, duration of the experiments, and the management practices, whereas neither soil characteristics (soil type, clay content, and initial SOC stock) nor climate variables (mean annual temperature and rainfall, aridity index) affected ASOC. The SOC accumulation rates increased linearly with C inputs, and the conversion rate of C inputs to SOC was 8.2 +/- 0.8%. Given the competing uses of organic matter on many tropical farms, the benefits of using changes in management practices for climate change mitigation might be overrated. As ASOC decreased with the duration of the experiments, ASOC would probably be smaller if a period of 20 years were considered, as recommended by the IPCC guidelines. The management practice with the greatest ASOC was diversified crop rotation. Cropping systems where diverse practices were combined resulted in higher ASOC than individual practices such as reduced tillage and mineral fertilization on their own. The adoption of improved management practices that increase C inputs is still relevant for meeting the challenges of food security and adaptation to climate change.","[Fujisaki, Kenji; Chevallier, Tiphaine; Chapuis-Lardy, Lydie; Masse, Dominique; Chotte, Jean-Luc] Univ Montpellier, Eco & Sols, CIRAD, INRA,IRD,Montpellier SupAgro, Montpellier, France; [Chapuis-Lardy, Lydie] Ctr IRD ISRA Bel Air, LMI IESOL, BP1386 Route Hydrocarbures, Dakar 18524, Senegal; [Albrecht, Alain] Univ Montpellier, Eco & Sols, CIRAD, INRA,IRD,Montpellier SupAgro,Stn Ligne Paradis, 7 Chemin IRAT, F-97410 St Pierre, La Reunion, France; [Razafimbelo, Tantely] Univ Antananarivo, Lab Radioisotopes, BP 3383 Route Andraisoro, Antananarivo 101, Madagascar; [Ndour, Yacine Badiane] Inst Senegalais Rech Agr, Lab Natl Rech Prod Vegetales, Campus IRD ISRA Bel Air BP 1386, Dakar 18524, Senegal",CIRAD; INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD; INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; University Antananarivo,"Fujisaki, K (corresponding author), Campus SupAgro, UMR Eco & Sols, Batiment 12,2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier 2, France.",kenji.fujisaki@ird.fr,"LARDY, Lydie/B-5324-2009; Masse, Dominique/A-7603-2011; LARDY, Lydie/AAS-6313-2021; Chevallier, Tiphaine/F-9151-2011; CHOTTE, Jean-Luc/A-5813-2009","LARDY, Lydie/0000-0003-0393-3239; Masse, Dominique/0000-0002-3165-1469; LARDY, Lydie/0000-0003-0393-3239; Chevallier, Tiphaine/0000-0001-8285-3856; Razafimbelo, Tantely M./0000-0003-2101-9715; Fujisaki, Kenji/0000-0001-5067-2567",ECOBIO department of IRD,ECOBIO department of IRD,K.F. was supported by the ECOBIO department of IRD.,,123,70,71,9,107,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-8809,1873-2305,,AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON,Agric.

Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to achieve this integration in a meaningful way. The pilot study reported here was a necessary step toward developing improved methods for communicating local and Indigenous knowledge to decision-makers, with a focus on public sector practitioners as audience and visual content as medium. The proposed methodology extends previous research on climate change adaptation in the Alaskan Arctic, and it examines the effect of a reporting approach that introduces two components outside of general conventions in public sector information dissemination; (1) the application of context-rich images to help convey the social and cultural nuances of place-based information, and (2) multiple evidence base (MEB) reporting which engages information from both Western science and local/Indigenous knowledge systems. Context-rich images-defined here as detailed visuals that address the particularities of specific environments and cultures-are explored given their potential merits in expressing place-based concepts, such as social life and lived experience quickly and concisely when presented in tandem with text. With a focus on practical application, public sector conventions for reporting place-based information to decision-makers are investigated, including the benefits, and limitations associated with these conventions. Insights from both theory and practice informed the research methodology, and the design of a sample report and online questionnaire tested with upper-level public sector practitioners who have influence on environmental decision-making. Pilot study results indicated significant benefits of using context-rich images in addition to quotes about lived experience for reporting information about the local context and experience of Northern environmental changes. When presented alongside research from Western science, neither local observations in the form of quotes, nor context-rich images posed negative impacts on the perceived credibility of the report. The pilot study revealed the proposed methodology to be particularly beneficial for a target audience of practitioners who may lack expertise in the local context or field of research being reported. Additionally, several potential improvements to the content and design of research materials were identified for the benefit of future studies.","[Curry, Tracie] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Lopez, Ellen D.

Four subbasins are evaluated: Beaufort Sea, Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Baffin Bay/Davis Strait, and Hudson Bay Complex. Limited observations, especially for ecosystem variables, compromise the trend analyses. Future projections are predominately from global models with few contributions from available marine basin scale models. The assessment indicates a significant increase in air temperature, slight increases in precipitation and snow depth, and appreciable changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. Projections suggest an increase in storm strength and size, leading to enhanced storm surges and coastal erosion, a slight increase in wave heights, increases in gustiness, and small changes in mean wind speed. An Arctic-wide decrease in the extent of multiyear ice and a spatial and temporal increase in ice-free waters in summer have been observed and are projected to continue into the future. Limited observations of ocean properties show local freshening (Beaufort Sea) and summer warming (Baffin Bay). These trends are projected to continue along with localized strengthening in stratification. Increased ocean acidification has been observed and is projected to continue throughout the Canadian Arctic, leading to severely decreased saturation states of calcium carbonate (aragonite and calcite). Qualitative analysis of biological observations indicate large regional differences. Increased primary production and double bloom development is seen in areas of sea ice retreat where nutrient supply is sufficient, and unchanged or reduced production is seen where nutrients are low or suppressed in response to enhanced stratification. Future primary production projections show inconsistent results, with light-dependent increase or nutrient-limited decrease dominating, dependent on the model. For the next decade, natural intradecadal variability is expected to be of similar importance as longer-term trends. To improve our capacity to assess and project climate change adaptation in marine ecosystems, more consistent observations are needed, especially over marine areas and for biogeochemical variables. Higher resolution basin-scale models are also required to provide locally applicable projections relevant for Arctic communities and management units.","[Steiner, Nadja; Sou, Tessa] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Ocean Sci, Sidney, BC V8L 4B2, Canada; [Azetsu-Scott, Kumiko; Hamilton, Jim; Loder, John; Perrie, William; Peterson, Ingrid] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Bedford Inst Oceanog, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 4A2, Canada; [Hedges, Kevin; Janjua, Muhammad Y.; Tallmann, Ross] 501 Univ Crescent, Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Freshwater, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N6, Canada; [Hu, Xianmin] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada; [Lavoie, Diane; Melling, Humfrey; Merzouk, Anissa; Scarratt, Michael] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Maurice Lamontagne, St Flavie, PQ G0J 2L0, Canada",Fisheries & Oceans Canada; Bedford Institute of Oceanography; Fisheries & Oceans Canada; Fisheries & Oceans Canada; University of Alberta; Fisheries & Oceans Canada,"Steiner, N (corresponding author), Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Ocean Sci, 9860 West Saanich Rd,POB 6000, Sidney, BC V8L 4B2, Canada.",nadja.steiner@dfo-mpo.gc.ca,"Hu, Xianmin/I-7069-2018; /AAL-3738-2021; Hedges, Kevin J/A-6378-2014; Hu, Xianmin/P-5673-2019","Hu, Xianmin/0000-0001-5925-7634; Hedges, Kevin J/0000-0002-2219-2360; Hu, Xianmin/0000-0001-5925-7634; Steiner, Nadja/0000-0001-7456-3437",,,,,313,36,40,2,179,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",1208-6053,1181-8700,,ENVIRON REV,Environ.

Government policies seek to facilitate and spatially contain growth, while balancing public and private interests. The need for climate adaptation strategies in the urban context is recognised but arguably poorly institutionalised in growth management policies or in urban governance more broadly. This paper considers how debates around urban adaptation and growth management are structured in the discourses of local government, private developers and other actors. A discourse analysis of written submissions and media releases from four urban policy debates in Queensland, Australia, is presented. The analysis highlights the discursive strategies employed by different actors and the way their arguments have been consolidated in the practices of urban policy-making. The analysis suggests a divergence of growth and adaptation storylines, contributing to maintaining the gap between these policy agendas.

The provision of weather and climate information will depend on the availability of climate data and its presentation in formats that are useful for decision making at different levels. However, in many places around the world, including most African countries, the collection of climate data has been seriously inadequate, and even when available, poorly accessible. On the other hand, the availability of climate data by itself may not lead to the uptake and use of such data. These data must be presented in user-friendly formats addressing specific climate information needs in order to be used for decision-making by governments, as well as the public and private sectors. The generated information should also be easily accessible. The Enhancing National Climate Services (ENACTS) initiative, led by Columbia University's International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI), has been making efforts to overcome these challenges by supporting countries to improve the available climate data, as well as access to and use of climate information products at relevant spatial and temporal scales. Challenges to the availability of climate data are alleviated by combining data from the national weather observation network with remote sensing and other global proxies to generate spatially and temporally complete climate datasets. Access to climate information products is enhanced by developing an online mapping service that provides a user-friendly interface for analyzing and visualizing climate information products such as maps and graphs.","[Nsengiyumva, Gloriose; Dinku, Tufa; Cousin, Remi; Khomyakov, Igor; Vadillo, Audrey; Faniriantsoa, Rija; Grossi, Amanda] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc IRI, Earth Inst, Lamont Campus,61 Route 9W,Monell Bldg, New York, NY 10964 USA",Columbia University,"Dinku, T (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc IRI, Earth Inst, Lamont Campus,61 Route 9W,Monell Bldg, New York, NY 10964 USA.",tufa@iri.columbia.edu,,"Grossi, Amanda/0000-0001-9861-8551; Nsengiyumva, Gloriose/0000-0003-3005-7721; Dinku, Tufa/0000-0003-1720-2816; COUSIN, Remi/0000-0001-5425-7387","Columbia World Project, ACToday, Columbia University in the City of New York; ENACTS","Columbia World Project, ACToday, Columbia University in the City of New York; ENACTS","This work is undertaken as part of the Columbia World Project, ACToday, Columbia University in the City of New York.

This study provides an empirical test of hypotheses within social-ecological systems resilience theory that have suggested metacognitive learning strategies could increase resilience thinking skills such as scenarios thinking, systems thinking, and the ability to interpret and apply ecological data in complex problem solving. During a 6-week long ecology unit with 108 seventh-grade students, we taught half the students using standard inquiry teaching methods and the other half using the same method, with the addition of a daily metacognitive learning intervention. We investigated the short-term (after six weeks of intervention) and long-term (1 yr after the intervention ended) effects of the intervention on student's metacognitive ability and resilience thinking skills. Over the long term, we found a modest increase in the metacognitive ability of students who received the daily metacognitive journaling exercise. Interview data suggest that the structured metacognitive practice did most to improve the resilience thinking level of students who had low resilience thinking ability prior to the intervention period. However, the interaction between pre-treatment ability level and the treatment group was not detected in the written assessment data. These data suggest that the metacognitive learning intervention we used can benefit metacognitive ability over the long term, but has limited transferability to resilience thinking skills for most students. We suggest additional instructional practices for implementing metacognitive teaching approaches that could enhance the generalizability of their benefits across resilience thinking skills and student's ability levels.","[Spellman, Katie V.; Mulder, Christa P.

All case studies, which originated from the SLIM (Social Learning for the Integrated Management and Sustainable Use of Water at Catchment Scale) Project, funded within the EU Fifth Framework Program (2001-2004), constitute inquiry pathways that are explored using a critical incident approach. The initial starting conditions for each inquiry pathway are compared; significant pathway dependencies are identified which foster the development of social learning processes locally, but constrain their uptake and embedding across the wider system of interest. In the first case study, in England & Wales, promising developments in the application of social learning approaches to river basin planning over an initial 3-year period were subsequently marginalised, only to resurface towards the end of the 10-year period of study. In the second, South African case study, significant spaces for social learning and innovation in integrated water resources management were opened up over a five year period but closed down again, primarily as the result of lack of policy support by national government. The third, Italian, case study was designed to assess options for adapting to climate change by opening up new learning spaces between researchers, stakeholders and policy makers. A case for investing in local level systemic innovation through social-learning praxis design approaches and in learning processes around well contextualised case-studies is supported. However, concomitant investment by policy makers in social learning as an alternative, but complementary, governance mechanism for systemic innovation for SD is needed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

With projected climate change, these policies are short of mechanisms that promote farmers' adaptation. As a result, smallholders are confronted with a variety of challenges including climate change, which hinders their agricultural production. Local knowledge can be instrumental in assisting smallholders to cope with climate change and variability. In this paper, we present empirical evidence that demonstrates local knowledge, perceptions and adaptations to climate change and variability amongst smallholders of Laikipia district of Kenya. A Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) calculated for one station is compared with smallholders' perceptions. Data was collected using qualitative and quantitative methods in Umande and Muhonia sub-locations. Qualitative data included 46 transcripts from focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Quantitative data is derived from 206 interviewees. We analyzed qualitative and quantitative data using Atlas-ti and SPSS respectively. According to smallholders' perceptions, climatic variability is increasingly changing. Local perceptions include decreasing rainfalls, increasing temperatures, increasing frosts and increasing hunger. The PDSI shows a trend towards severe droughts in the last four decades, which is in accordance with farmers' perceptions. Smallholders use a combination of coping and adaptation strategies to respond to variability, including, among others, diversification of crop varieties, migration and sale of livestock. Significant relationships exist between drought perceptions and some adaptations such as migration and sale of livestock. Farmers have an in-depth knowledge of climatic variability, which they use to inform their coping and adaptation strategies. Knowledge of climatic perceptions and adaptations are vital entry points for decision makers and policy makers to learn how and where to enhance the adaptive capacity of smallholders in rainy and drought periods.","[Ogalleh, Sarah Ayeri; Hauser, Michael] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Res Dev Ctr, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Ogalleh, Sarah Ayeri; Vogl, Christian R.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Organ Farming, Dept Sustainable Agr Syst, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Eitzinger, Josef] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Water Atmosphere & Environm, A-1180 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Ogalleh, SA (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Res Dev Ctr, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",sarahogalleh@gmail.com; vogl@groupwise.boku.ac.at; josef.eitzinger@boku.ac.at; michael.hauser@boku.ac.at,"Eitzinger, Josef/E-2150-2015; Vogl, Christian Reinhard/AAI-6379-2020","Vogl, Christian Reinhard/0000-0002-7899-2682",Austrian Partnership Programme in Higher Education & Research for Development (APPEAR); Volkswagen Foundation,Austrian Partnership Programme in Higher Education & Research for Development (APPEAR); Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen),"The authors gratefully acknowledge communities from Umande and Muhonia for their time, kindness and cooperation throughout data collection.

Moreover, this is a largely under-researched topic, especially within the climate change adaptation discourse, but is increasingly coming to the attention of scientists and policymakers for sustainable adaptation planning. So far, there exists hardly any conceptual and methodical guidelines to study environmental non-migration. Considering this research gap, this paper explores environmental non-migration based on the notion that factors of livelihood resilience can partly explain the decision to non-migration. Here, livelihood resilience is seen as an outcome of the interactions between societal and environmental conditions of an individual household. These conditions inform the decisions (to stay or to migrate) taken in case of a hazard or creeping environmental change. Their influence generalises the spectrum of migration decision-making (to stay or to migrate), which is conceptualised by four broad outcomes categorised into voluntary and involuntary, and non-migrants and migrants. This analytical concept is operationalised through an empirical example in southwest coastal Bangladesh. The results suggest that the Livelihood Resilience Index (LRI) relates to the voluntary nature of migration decisions once they are made. Still, only a household's resilience cannot predict the decisions the household makes to stay or migrate. The paper concludes that the proposed analytical concept, with its exemplary factors, maybe an initial means to holistically explore migration decisions in the context of natural hazards and climate and environmental change. However, environmental non-migration remains complex and multi-faceted, and its assessment requires deeper examination at various scales.","[Mallick, Bishawjit] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Human Geog & Spatial Planning, Princetonlaan 8A,Vening Meinesz Bldg A,Room 6-36, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands; [Mallick, Bishawjit; Schanze, Jochen] Tech Univ Dresden TUD, Fac Environm Sci, Chair Environm Dev & Risk Management, D-01217 Dresden, Germany; [Mallick, Bishawjit] Univ Colorado, Inst Behav Sci, Boulder Campus, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Priovashini, Chup] Int Ctr Climate Change & Dev ICCCAD, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Schanze, Jochen] Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev, Dresden, Germany",Utrecht University; Technische Universitat Dresden; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Leibniz Institut fur okologische Raumentwicklung,"Mallick, B (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Human Geog & Spatial Planning, Princetonlaan 8A,Vening Meinesz Bldg A,Room 6-36, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands.;Mallick, B (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden TUD, Fac Environm Sci, Chair Environm Dev & Risk Management, D-01217 Dresden, Germany.;Mallick, B (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Inst Behav Sci, Boulder Campus, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",b.mallick@uu.nl,"Mallick, Bishawjit/V-2236-2018","Mallick, Bishawjit/0000-0002-9492-1059",Technische Universitaet Dresden [F-003661-553-UE1G-1212042]; European Union [846129],Technische Universitaet Dresden; European Union(European Commission),"The authors extend their sincere gratitude to the respondents for their valuable time.

We consider the annual maxima of the logarithm of 1-day (Rx1day) and 5-day (Rx5day) precipitation amounts for 1950-2014 over the global land area, four continents, and several regions, and compare observed changes with expected responses to external forcings as simulated by CanESM2 in a large-ensemble experiment and by multiple models from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). We use a novel detection and attribution analysis method that is applied directly to station data in the areas considered without prior processing such as gridding, spatial or temporal dimension reduction, or transformation to unitless indices and uses climate models only to obtain estimates of the space-time pattern of extreme precipitation response to external forcing. The influence of anthropogenic forcings on extreme precipitation is detected over the global land area, three continental regions (the western Northern Hemisphere, western Eurasia, and eastern Eurasia), and many smaller IPCC regions, including central North America, East Asia, east-central Asia, eastern Europe, eastern North America, northern Europe, and western Siberia for Rx1day, and central North America, eastern Europe, eastern North America, northern Europe, the Russian Arctic region, and western Siberia for Rx5day. Consistent results are obtained using forcing response estimates from either CanESM2 or CMIP6. Anthropogenic influence is estimated to have substantially decreased the approximate waiting time between extreme annual maximum events in regions where anthropogenic influence has been detected, which has important implications for infrastructure design and climate change adaptation policy.","[Sun, Qiaohong; Zwiers, Francis] Univ Victoria, Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Zwiers, Francis] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xuebin] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Climate Res Div, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Yan, Jun] Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Storrs, CT USA",University of Victoria; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Environment & Climate Change Canada; University of Connecticut,"Sun, QH (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium, Victoria, BC, Canada.",sunqh@uvic.ca,,,,,,,46,5,5,8,12,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

However, transnationally governed adaptation initiatives are emerging and increasing in scale. This paper analyses the effectiveness of transnational adaptation initiatives as a particular knowledge gap in this changing evolving governance landscape. Based on a new dataset of 40 initiatives that are governing adaptation across borders and that include non-state actors, it offers an overview assessment. It asks: do transnational adaptation initiatives achieve their stated goals and objectives, and which factors explain their ability to contribute to effective climate change adaptation? Drawing on transnational climate and sustainable development governance literature, an analytical framework is developed to assess to what extent actors', process', institutional design' and context' can explain effective outcomes. The assessment found that while almost two-thirds of the initiatives were highly effective in achieving goals and objectives by producing outputs, only one-third were highly effective in achieving outcomes, in the sense of leading to substantial change in behaviour of target groups. Where initiatives are effective, the main factors determining success are strong leadership and orchestration, good process management and staff resources, a focus on standard-setting and service provision rather than knowledge transfer, a high level of institutionalisation through binding rules for partners, and good coordination with international regimes. Perhaps less expected in view of the voluntary involvement of actors in transnational adaptation initiatives, initiatives based on hard' functions (i.e. standard-setting and service provision as opposed to knowledge transfer) and binding rules for partners were found to be more effective.","[Dzebo, Adis] Stockholm Environm Inst, Linnegatan 87D, S-11523 Stockholm, Sweden; [Dzebo, Adis] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands",Stockholm Environment Institute; Utrecht University,"Dzebo, A (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Linnegatan 87D, S-11523 Stockholm, Sweden.;Dzebo, A (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands.",adis.dzebo@sei.org,,,Swedish Research Council Formas [2015-344],Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),"This research has been funded by the Swedish Research Council Formas (Grant No. 2015-344).

A large part of the Inuit population continues to depend on an untreated water supply, however. This traditional activity poses certain risks in a region with an abundant presence of migratory animals. Nunavik has also experienced significant climate warming since the beginning of the last decade. The main goal of this study, which took place in 2003 and 2004, was to evaluate drinking habits that may place Nunavik residents at an increased risk of gastroenteric diseases in the context of climate change. During the Amundsen cruise in fall 2004, we observed that raw water from the collection sites most frequently visited (brooks, takes, rivers) was of good quality in most of the villages. Regular monitoring of these sites is necessary, however, and the public should be warned when the sites become contaminated. Of particular concern was the water from the individual storage containers, which was much more contaminated than the water at the collection sites. To develop or improve the climate change adaptation strategies in this area, we propose 1) establishing an appropriate environmental monitoring system, 2) improving wastewater disposal and municipal water systems, 3) involving nursing staff in microbiological testing of the water at community sites, 4) raising public awareness of the risks related to raw water consumption, and 5) gathering strategic health information during the periods of the year when cases of gastroenteric diseases are most frequent, in order to establish whether there is a link between these disorders and water quality.","CHUQ, CHUL, Ctr Rech, Unite Rech Sante Publ, Quebec City, PQ G1V 2M2, Canada; Minist Environm Quebec, Direct Reg Nord Quebec, Rouyn Noranda, PQ J9X 1N9, Canada; Trent Univ, Dept Indigenous Studies, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada; Trent Univ, Dept Environm & Resource Studies Sci, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada; Regie Reg Sante & Serv Sociaux Nunav, Kuujjuaq, PQ J0M 1C0, Canada",Laval University; Trent University; Trent University,"Martin, D (corresponding author), CHUQ, CHUL, Ctr Rech, Unite Rech Sante Publ, 2875 Blvd Laurier,6e Etage,Edifice Delta,Bur 600, Quebec City, PQ G1V 2M2, Canada.",daniel.martin@crchul.ulaval.ca,,,,,,,11,82,82,0,36,ARCTIC INST N AMER,CALGARY,"UNIV OF CALGARY 2500 UNIVERSITY DRIVE NW 11TH FLOOR LIBRARY TOWER, CALGARY, ALBERTA T2N 1N4, CANADA",0004-0843,1923-1245,,ARCTIC,Arctic,JUN,2007,60,2,,,,,195,202,,,,,,8,"Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,184RP,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000247659800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, the following were used to evaluate the multidecadal changes in moisture condition during climatic growth period of crops in Northeast China from 1961 to 2010: (1) the daily climate variables gathered from 101 meteorological stations in Northeast China for 1961-2010; (2) FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) Penman-Monteith equation; (3) 80% guaranteed probability for agro-climatic indicators; and (4) the daily average temperature stably passing 0 degrees C, which is the threshold temperature of climatic growth period for crops. Reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) and relative moisture index were further calculated. The results showed that Northeast China's climate in the main agricultural areas over the past 50 years was warmer and drier in general, with a growing range and intensity of drought. From 1961 to 2010, when the daily average temperature stably passed 0 degrees C, the average annual total precipitation (P) and ET with 80% guaranteed probability in Northeast China both emerged as decreasing trends with averages of 555.0 mm and 993.7 mm, respectively. However, the decline in P was greater than that of annual total ET0. As a result, the annual relative moisture indices sharply decreased with an average of -0.44, mostly fluctuating from -0.59 to -0.25. As far as spatial distributions were concerned, the inter-regional reductions in P and relative moisture index over the past 50 years were conspicuous, especially in some agricultural areas of central Heilong,jiang Province, northeastern Jilin Province and northeastern Liaoning Province. On the contrary, ET obviously increased in some agricultural areas of central and northwestern Heilongjiang Province (eg. Qiqiha'er, Shuangyashan, Hegang, Suihua, etc.), and northeastern Jilin Province (eg. Baicheng). This indicated that drought existed and was unfavorable for crop growth and development, especially during the period of 2001-2010. This finding revealed that drought was still one of the most important agricultural meteorological disasters in Northeast China. Some countermeasures should be formulated to adapt to climate change. Our findings have important implications for improving climate change impact studies, for breeding scientists to breed higher yielding cultivars, and for agricultural production to cope with ongoing climate change.

For example, Take SDG 13 climate action or implement various strategies for low -carbon transformation. In addition to responding to climate change commitments, these major changes have also boosted the rating scores of their ESG performance indicators, which inevitably have a certain degree of impact on their financial performance. Using the ESG performance indicators and financial data of 100 manufacturing firms worldwide from 2005 to 2020, this study constructs a multilevel quadratic growth model to analyze and investigate the effects of different types of ownership structure as well as disclosure of climate change-related risks and opportunities (CCR risks) on ESG and financial performance indicators among manufacturing industry firms. The findings of this study showed that different ownership structures, the degree of disclosure of climate change-related risks and opportunities (CCR risks), and the number of environmental performance indicators had no multiplicative effect on the financial performance of manufacturing companies. Instead, there was a positive, but negatively moderating, effect on financial performance. When the investigated enterprises attached higher importance to climate change issues and thus strengthened investments in, and implementation of, corresponding environmental performance indicators, the positive impact of environmental performance on financial performance gradually diminished to the point of negative impact, thereby affecting companies' operating profits. This was especially the case for private enterprises. However, disclosure of climate change-related risks and opportunities has a significant positive effect on financial performance among such firms. In addition, private firms and social performance indicators had a negative, but positively moderating, effect on financial performance. This meant that, upon investigation, the private enterprises made more effort to invest in and implement social performance indicators, and the impact on financial performance gradually increased and eventually shifted from negative to positive. Environmental performance indicators and financial performance were generally found to exhibit a distinctly positive effect.In summary, the results of this study can be used as a reference for firm managers to enhance their decision -making related to actions, strategies, and planning in response to climate change-related risks and opportunities under the framework of ESG performance indicators.","[Chen, Hsiao-Min] Chihlee Univ Technol, Dept Mkt & Logist Management, Taipei 22050, Taiwan; [Kuo, Tsai-Chi] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Management, MA007,43,Sec 4,Keelung Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Kuo, Tsai-Chi] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Artificial Intelligence Operat Management Res Ctr, Taipei 10607, Taiwan; [Chen, Ju-Long] Chihlee Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm, Serv Ind Management, Taipei 22050, Taiwan",National Taiwan University of Science & Technology; National Taiwan University of Science & Technology,"Chen, HM (corresponding author), Chihlee Univ Technol, Dept Mkt & Logist Management, Taipei 22050, Taiwan.",brooksmin@mail.chihlee.edu.tw,,,"National Science and Technology Council of the Republic of China, Taiwan;  [110-2222-E-263-001-MY2]","National Science and Technology Council of the Republic of China, Taiwan; ","Funding This research was funded by National Science and Technology Council of the Republic of China, Taiwan, grant number 110-2222-E-263-001-MY2.",,131,1,1,15,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

There is a need to ensure that water and energy use is closely considered in future industry planning and development to provide practical options for adaptation and to build resilience at the farm level. There is currently limited data available regarding the uncertainty and sensitivity associated with water application and energy consumption in irrigated crop production in Australia. This paper examines water application and energy consumption relationships for different irrigation systems, and the ways in which the uncertainty of different parameters impacts on these relationships and associated emissions for actual farms. This analysis was undertaken by examining the current water and energy patterns of crop production at actual farms in two irrigated areas of Australia (one using surface water and the other groundwater), and then modelling the risk/uncertainty and sensitivity associated with the link between water and energy consumption at the farm scale. Results showed that conversions from gravity to pressurised irrigation methods reduced water application, but there was a simultaneous increase in energy consumption in surface irrigation areas. In groundwater irrigated areas, the opposite is true; the use of pressurised irrigation methods can reduce water application and energy consumption by enhancing water use efficiency. Risk and uncertainty analysis quantified the range of water and energy use that might be expected for a given irrigation method for each farm. Sensitivity analysis revealed the contribution of climatic (evapotranspiration and rainfall) and technical factors (irrigation system efficiency, pump efficiency, suction and discharge head) impacting the uncertainty and the model output and water-energy system performance in general. Flood irrigation systems were generally associated with greater uncertainty than pressurised systems. To enhance resilience at the farm level, the optimum situation envisaged an irrigation system that minimises water and energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Where surface water is used, well designed and managed flood irrigation systems will minimise the operating energy and carbon equivalent emissions. Where groundwater is the dominant use, the optimum system is a well designed and managed pressurised system operating at the lowest discharge pressure possible that will still allow for efficient irrigation. The findings might be useful for farm level risk mitigation strategies in surface and groundwater systems, and for aiding adaptation to climate change. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Arg) plantations have expanded into regions with sub-optimal growth conditions: distinct dry seasons and temperatures cooler than in humid tropics. The impact of these new marginal environments and future climate change on rubber tree development and latex yield is largely unknown. This hampers reliable prediction of farmers' revenues and extent of carbon sequestration at landscape level. To improve our understanding of rubber trees response to planting at high altitudes and associated increase in planting densities, we applied the process-based Land Use Change Impact Assessment tool (LUCIA). It was calibrated with detailed ground survey data from Xishuangbanna, southwest China to model tree biomass development and latex yield in rubber plantations at the tree, plot and landscape level. Plantations were analyzed at < 900 m above sea level (a.s.l., lowland rubber) and >= 900 m a.s.l. (highland rubber) in order to characterize the effect of elevation on rubber trees. Three planting densities: low (< 495 trees ha(-1)), medium (495-600 trees ha(-1)) and high (> 600 trees ha(-1)) were tested. Four greenhouse gas emission scenarios, with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) ranging from the lowest RCP 2.6 to the highest emission scenario RCP 8.5, were used to test rubber tree response to climate change. During a 40-year rotation under current climate, lowland rubber plantations grew faster and had larger latex yields than highland rubber. The average biomass of lowland rubber was 9% and 18% higher than those of highland rubber for aboveground and belowground biomass, respectively. High planting density rubber plantations showed 5% and 4% higher above ground biomass than those at low- and medium-planting density, but simulations suggest that the cumulative latex production decreased strongly by 26% and 14% respectively. The results of the RCP 8.5 climate change scenario suggested that during 40 years simulation mean total biomass and cumulative latex yield of highland rubber (per tree) increased by 28% and 48%, while lowland rubber increased by 8% and 10% respectively when compared to the baseline. Other rubber cultivation regions could also benefit from this modelling approach that helps in optimization of carbon stock and latex production in rubber-based system. The results could help in development of future climate change adaption and mitigation strategies.","[Yang, Xueqing; Blagodatsky, Sergey; Marohn, Carsten; Liu, Hongxi; Golbon, Reza; Cadisch, Georg] Univ Hohenheim, Hans Ruthenberg Inst, Inst Agr Sci Trop, Stuttgart, Germany; [Yang, Xueqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Key Lab Econ Plants & Biotechnol, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xueqing; Xu, Jianchu] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xueqing; Xu, Jianchu] Kunming Inst Bot, East Asia Off, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China","University Hohenheim; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS","Blagodatsky, S (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Hans Ruthenberg Inst, Inst Agr Sci Trop, Stuttgart, Germany.",,"Yang, Xueqing/AAL-1071-2020; Blagodatsky, Sergey/F-2734-2010; Xu, Jianchu/Y-2890-2019","Blagodatsky, Sergey/0000-0003-1428-6014; Yang, Xueqing/0000-0002-5816-8477; Golbon, Reza/0000-0001-8703-7778",German-Chinese joint project SURUMER (Sustainable Rubber Cultivation in the Mekong Region) - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [FKZ 01LL0919]; German BMZ/GIZ [13.1432.7-001.00],German-Chinese joint project SURUMER (Sustainable Rubber Cultivation in the Mekong Region) - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German BMZ/GIZ,"The study was supported by the German-Chinese joint project SURUMER (Sustainable Rubber Cultivation in the Mekong Region), funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under Grant number FKZ 01LL0919 and by the German BMZ/GIZ funded Green Rubber project with project number #13.1432.7-001.00.

Therefore, the industrialized standard building is investigated concerning the consequences of elevated summer temperatures due to climate change.

Despite the significant roles of national policy for adaptation, barriers to national adaptation policy have been overlooked and our understanding of the barriers is not sufficient as we expect. Also, the barriers are pointed out a reason of the current adaptation gaps. To address this situation, we use a systematic literature review to examine the barriers to adaptation policy specifically at the national level, as well as their origin, impact, and solutions to overcome them, considering the importance of national-level adaptation for the overall adaptation. Scrutinising a sample of eighteen articles, we identify eight categories of barriers to national adaptation policy. Lack of resources, fragmentation, and lack of awareness and communication are the most commonly identified barriers to national adaptation policy. We also find that the literature does not provide sufficient detail on the underlying causes of the barriers, the relationships between them and their consequences. The literature also gives limited attention to solutions for overcoming barriers, and the suggestions made are too general and normative to be helpful in practice. But the existing literature helps to interrogate and visualise the interlinkages between the origins, barriers and impacts, as well as between different barriers. This highlights that barriers should be addressed simultaneously and provides preliminary insights into a deeper understanding of the barriers. We conclude by outlining the key knowledge gaps and future research priorities to help support national adaptation policy processes.","[Lee, Seunghan] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst SRI, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Paavola, Jouni; Dessai, Suraje] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst SRI, Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy CCCEP, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Paavola, Jouni] Univ Leeds, Res & Innovat, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Lee, S (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst SRI, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",eeslee@leeds.ac.uk; J.Paavola@leeds.ac.uk; S.Dessai@leeds.ac.uk,"Paavola, Jouni/A-5413-2010","Paavola, Jouni/0000-0001-5720-466X","UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/LK006576/1, ES/R009708/1]",UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Paavola and Dessai acknowledge the financial support of the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) to the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP), Grant/Award Numbers ES/LK006576/1 and ES/R009708/1.",,55,5,5,0,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

Using three-year household-level pooled cross-sectional data and addressing selection biases from both observable and unobservable heterogeneity were managed by applying a multinomial endogenous switching regression framework. Our findings indicate that adopting both adaptive and mitigatory CSAPs increases rice yield and rice net income by 15.879% and 19.288%, respectively. Besides, the strong complementarities exist between adaptive and mitigatory CSAPs to address climate change in improving productivity and income when experiencing extreme weather events (e.g., EI Nino event). These findings highlight the positive role of integrating adaptive and mitigatory CSAPs in coping with climate change challenges, and increasing household farmers' economic welfare in China, and potentially elsewhere.","[Liang, Zhihui; Zhang, Lu; Li, Wenjing; Zhang, Junbiao] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Liang, Zhihui; Li, Wenjing; Frewer, Lynn J.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Li, Wenjing] FERA Sci Ltd, Inst Agrifood Res & Innovat, Natl Agrifood Innovat Campus, York YO41 1LZ, N Yorkshire, England",Huazhong Agricultural University; Newcastle University - UK; Food & Environment Research Agency,"Zhang, L (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",zhihuiliang@webmail.hzau.edu.cn; luzhanghzau@163.com; liwenjing081@163.com; JunbiaoZhang522@163.com; lynn.frewer@ncl.ac.uk,,"Zhang, Junbiao/0000-0002-7571-1099",National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [71333006]; National Social Sciences Foundation of China [19BGL192],National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Sciences Foundation of China,The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (Grant No. 71333006) ; the National Social Sciences Foundation of China (Grant No. 19BGL192) .,,46,3,3,4,24,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

In the wake of such a challenge, the prominence of biochemical studies is increasing by way of exploring selective enzymes and investigating their structural and functional properties through biochemical kinetic parameter Km for the application of IC50 using designed drugs. Recently, discovered Adenine Aminohydrolase (EC 3.5.4.2) in Leishmania has been found to be absent in mammalian purine salvage pathway and thus considered as a promising drug target against infectious agents. Objectives: The objective of this study is to isolate and characterize AAH by learning its kinetic mode of action using preferred substrate Adenine and additives estimated through expected product formation Hypoxanthine. Bioassays designed to measure exact Enzyme kinetic parameter Km value through establishing hyperbolic curve of an enzyme reaction with the use of exact values of cellular quantities for IC50 application under experimental conditions devised by presteady state approach for SSA validity. Methods: Following saturation kinetic, the plot of hyperbolic equilibrium curve developed using initial rates of product formation as a function of (Si) through forward shift under circumstance dG0 the system allows product and reactant favored reactions in relation to (Ef) approximate to [E0 = KM] until complete saturation and estimates Km and Vmax of enzyme system under applied conditions.

The curve assessed by Michaelis Menten equation provides Km value=14.99 mu mol and non-linear least square coefficient correlation R2 value equal to 0.9895, along with that optimized lysis buffer formulation. In the docked complexes, the interactive amino acids identified were MSE441, ALA 364, GLN363, MSE518, VAL362, GLY517, ASP538, ALA445, TYR521, and TYR444. 2D interactions revealed hydrophobic and alkyl interactions at the noncompetitive binding site of the enzyme and therefore recommended as potential inhibitors against 3ICS protein. Conclusion: This study encourages biochemical analysis of the novel enzymes with the use of presteady state rationale in association with the computational tools as an effective way of designing drugs in a short time against selective enzymes to meet the current challenge efficiently.","[Butt, Firdous] Quaid I Azam Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Yasinzai, Masoom] Int Islamic Univ, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Malik, Shaukat Iqbal; Munir, Anum] Capital Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Bioinformat & Biosci, Islamabad, Pakistan","Quaid I Azam University; International Islamic University, Pakistan; Capital University of Science & Technology","Munir, A (corresponding author), Capital Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Bioinformat & Biosci, Islamabad, Pakistan.",anummunir786@yahoo.com,,"Malik, shaukat/0000-0002-9537-558X",,,,,25,0,0,1,2,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD,SHARJAH,"EXECUTIVE STE Y-2, PO BOX 7917, SAIF ZONE, 1200 BR SHARJAH, U ARAB EMIRATES",1573-4099,1875-6697,,CURR COMPUT-AID DRUG,Curr.

However, how PM2.5 pollution affects the UHI intensity (UHII) has not been fully understood. The impacts of PM2.5 on the wintertime UHII in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei megalopolis of China are explored during 2013-2017. The results show that the UHII at the time of daily maximum/minimum temperature (UHIImax/UHIImin) exhibits a decreasing/increasing tendency as PM2.5 concentration increases, causing a continuous decrease in the diurnal temperature range. These effects are mediated via aerosol-radiation interaction (aerosol-cloud interaction) under clear-sky (cloudy) condition. The changes in PM2.5 concentration further cause different relative trends of UHII(ma)x/UHIImin/diurnal temperature range across different cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, which are likely related to the differences in both the PM2.5 composition and city size. This study provides insights on how air pollution affects urban climate and would help to design effective mitigation strategies. Plain Language Summary A detailed understanding of the relationship between PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 2.5 mu m) and the urban heat island (UHI) effect is significant for climate change adaption, planning, and sustainable development in urban regions. While the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) megalopolis of China is among the areas with the highest population densities and fastest urbanization rates in the world, the impacts of PM2.5 pollution on UHI, along with their regional differences in the BTH megalopolis, remain unclear. This study demonstrates that different PM2.5 concentrations in the BTH region pose various influences on the UHI intensities and their change rates in different cities of varying sizes. The UHI intensities during daytime and nighttime, respectively, exhibit weakening and strengthening tendency as PM2.5 concentration increases. These effects are mediated via aerosol-radiation interaction under clear-sky condition and aerosol-cloud interaction in cloudy weather. The relative changes in the UHI magnitudes were mainly determined by PM2.5 composition and city size. The asymmetrical influences of PM2.5 on the daytime and nighttime UHI intensities caused continuous decreases in the diurnal temperature ranges in the urban areas as the pollution level increased. Our study improves the understanding of urban climate affected by air pollution and provides a scientific basis for the mitigation of UHI impacts.","[Yang, Yuanjian; Gao, Zhiqiu; Li, Yubin] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Phys, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Zuofang] China Meteorol Adm, Inst Urban Meteorol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yuanjian; Yim, Steve Y.

To reduce potential negative effects on vegetation, policymakers may implement hydrological climate adaptation measures, which may -in turn- require land use changes to be successful. Policy driven land use changes should therefore be taken into account when evaluating climate change and adaptation effects on the water-vegetation system, but this is rarely done. To support such policy interventions, we applied a coupled land use - hydrology - vegetation model to simulate effects of (i) climate change, (ii) socio-economic change, (iii) hydrological measures and (iv) policy driven land use change, alone and in interaction, on vegetation communities in the Netherlands. We simulated two climate scenarios for 2050 that differed in predicted temperature (+ 0.9 degrees C and + 2.8 degrees C) and precipitation changes (groundwater recharge + 4% or - 14%). The associated socio-economic scenarios differed in the increase of gross margins per agricultural class. The land use changes concerned agricultural changes and development of new nature areas from agricultural land. Individually, land use changes had the biggest effect on vegetation distribution and composition, followed by the hydrological measures and climate change itself. Our results also indicate that the combination of all four factors triggered the biggest response in the extent of newly created nature areas ( + 6.5%) and the highest diversity in vegetation types, compared to other combinations (max. + 5.4%) and separate factors. This study shows that an interdisciplinary, coupled modelling approach is essential when evaluating climate adaptation measures.","[van der Knaap, Yasmijn A.

The weather extremes are often projected to have a larger impact on agricultural production than the average increase in temperature or average change in precipitation. To cope with the impacts of future climate change, farmers will have to apply adaptation measures at crop and farm level. The choice of the adaptation measures is determined by farm resources, current layout and performance of the farm and farmers' objectives. Here we present a method to assess the importance of crop and farm level measures to adapt to climate change and extreme events considering farmers' different objectives. We used a multi-objective optimization model to generate alternative farm plans and assess the impacts of crop and farm level adaptation measures in terms of farm performance on the objectives of maximizing farm economic result (gross margin) and soil quality (soil organic matter balance); these objectives were previously identified as most important to farmers. Two local scenarios were investigated: one based on a 2 degrees C increase in global temperature in 2050, including changes in air circulation resulting in drier summers, and one based on a 1 degrees C increase in global temperature, without changes in air circulation. Our results for six surveyed arable farms in the province of Flevoland (the Netherlands) suggest that average climate change improves farm performance in terms of farm economic result. The degree of improvement varies per scenario and per farm, depending on the cropping pattern. At the same time, extreme events may reverse positive impacts of average climate change, and can pose large risks. A combination of crop and farm level adaptation is needed for the surveyed farms in terms of improving both farm economic result and organic matter balance. A shift to (more) winter wheat, in systems dominated by root crops, is an estimated effective strategy to improve the organic matter balance and maintain farm economic result under climate change and extreme events.

Based on the economy-climate (C-D-C) model, this paper introduces a yield impact of climate change (YICC) model that can quantitatively project the climate change impact. The model is based on the YICC as its core concept and uses the impact ratio of climate change (IRCC) indicator to assess the response of the economic system to climate change over a long period of time. The YICC is defined as the difference between the economic output under changing climate condition and that under assumed invariant climate condition. The IRCC not only reflects the sensitivity of economic output to climate change but also reveals the mechanism of the nonlinear interaction between climate change and non-climatic factors on the socio-economic system. Using the main grain-producing areas in China as a case study, we use the data of the ensemble average of 5 GCMs in CMIP6 to project the possible impact of climate change on grain production in the next 15-30 years under three future scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5). The results indicate that the long-term climate change in the future will have a restraining effect on production in North region and enhance production in South region. From 2021 to 2035, climate change will reduce production by 0.60-2.09% in North region, and increase production by 1.80-9.01% in South region under three future scenarios. From 2021 to 2050, compared with the climate change impact in 2021-2035, the negative impact of climate change on production in North region will weaken, and the positive impact on production in South region will enhance with the increase in emission concentration. Among them, climate change will reduce grain output in North region by 0.52-1.99%, and increase output in South region by 1.35-9.56% under the three future scenarios. The combination of economic results and climate change research is expected to provide scientific support for further revealing the economic mechanism of climate change impacts.","[Chou, Jieming; Xu, Yuan; Zhao, Weixing; Li, Jiangnan; Li, Yuanmeng] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chou, Jieming; Dong, Wenjie] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Dong, Wenjie] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; Sun Yat Sen University,"Xu, Y (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xuyuan01@mail.bnu.edu.cn,,"Xu, Yuan/0000-0002-3539-4068",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1509003]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42075167],National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Funding This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China, grant number 2018YFC1509003; the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 42075167.",,43,2,2,9,47,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-424X,,,FRONT PHYS-LAUSANNE,Front.

Our focus in this study is to emphasize that geoheritage can serve as a gateway to developing a broader conservation ethic by developing educational programs that have a broader aim of interpretation, education, and enjoyment. Ultimately, these enjoyable educational experiences in areas of geoheritage value lead to a deeply felt conservation ethic. The US National Park Service recognizes the progression as through interpretation, understanding; through understanding, appreciation; through appreciation, protection as discussed by Tilden (1957). We have been working towards this goal through the expansion of a high school environmental education program in the USA, the National Conservation Foundation Envirothon, to China. The Envirothon is an environmental education program that culminates in the annual NCF-Envirothon Competition in which winning teams from participating states and Canadian provinces compete for recognition and scholarships by demonstrating their knowledge of environmental science and natural resource management. Much of the field education and field competitions are held in areas protected for their geoheritage and biodiversity values, and this use of geoheritage as a gateway to the broader educational goals is central to the program. We have been seeking to broaden the influence of the Envirothon program and underlying conservation goals in China. With educational curriculum reform since 2000 in China, students are encouraged to have more project-based learning opportunities and field-based experiences.

Here we explore the relevance of climate data, drivers and predictions for vector-borne disease control efforts in Africa. Methods: Using data from a number of sources we explore rainfall and temperature across the African continent, from seasonality to variability at annual, multi-decadal and timescales consistent with climate change. We give particular attention to three regions defined as WHO-TDR study zones in Western, Eastern and Southern Africa. Our analyses include 1) time scale decomposition to establish the relative importance of year-to-year, decadal and long term trends in rainfall and temperature; 2) the impact of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on rainfall and temperature at the Pan African scale; 3) the impact of ENSO on the climate of Tanzania using high resolution climate products and 4) the potential predictability of the climate in different regions and seasons using Generalized Relative Operating Characteristics. We use these analyses to review the relevance of climate forecasts for applications in vector borne disease control across the continent. Results: Timescale decomposition revealed long term warming in all three regions of Africa - at the level of 0.1-0.3 degrees C per decade. Decadal variations in rainfall were apparent in all regions and particularly pronounced in the Sahel and during the East African long rains (March-May). Year-to-year variability in both rainfall and temperature, in part associated with ENSO, were the dominant signal for climate variations on any timescale. Observed climate data and seasonal climate forecasts were identified as the most relevant sources of climate information for use in early warning systems for vector-borne diseases but the latter varied in skill by region and season. Conclusions: Adaptation to the vector-borne disease risks of climate variability and change is a priority for government and civil society in African countries. Understanding rainfall and temperature variations and trends at multiple timescales and their potential predictability is a necessary first step in the incorporation of relevant climate information into vector-borne disease control decision-making.","[Thomson, Madeleine C.; Munoz, Angel G.; Cousin, Remi] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc IRI, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Thomson, Madeleine C.] Columbia Univ, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Thomson, Madeleine C.] IRI World Hlth Org WHO, Collaborating Ctr US Early Warning Syst Malaria &, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Munoz, Angel G.] Princeton Univ, Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Shumake-Guillemot, Joy] WHO, World Hlth Org World Meteorol Org Joint Climate &, Geneva, Switzerland; [Thomson, Madeleine C.] LDEO, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Palisades, NY 10964 USA",Columbia University; Columbia University; Princeton University; World Health Organization,"Thomson, MC (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc IRI, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Thomson, MC (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Thomson, MC (corresponding author), IRI World Hlth Org WHO, Collaborating Ctr US Early Warning Syst Malaria &, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.;Thomson, MC (corresponding author), LDEO, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",mthomson@iri.columbia.edu,,"COUSIN, Remi/0000-0001-5425-7387","WHO-TDR IDRC [WHO PO 21353027, WHO PO 201487225]; Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) Program at Princeton University",WHO-TDR IDRC; Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) Program at Princeton University,Funding for the work came from WHO PO 21353027 (PI MCT) in support of WHO-TDR IDRC-funded project: Population health vulnerabilities to vector-borne diseases: increasing resilience under climate change conditions in Africa and WHO PO 201487225 (PI MCT) as a technical contribution to the Global Framework for Climate Services.

However, predictions on the impact of climate change on soil erosion are rare for most West African countries including Burkina Faso. This study assesses the impact of climate change on water resources and soil erosion in a small catchment (126 km(2)) in southwestern Burkina Faso. Climate data from an ensemble of six regional (RCM) and global (GCM) climate models were used to run the physically based spatially distributed hydrological and soil erosion model SHETRAN. The Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 were selected as future climate scenarios. Bias corrected precipitation and temperature required for the calculation of potential evapotranspiration were used as input for the SHETRAN model to simulate total discharge and specific suspended sediment yield (SSY). Discharge and SSY from simulations run with climate data were able to reproduce discharge and SSY from a simulation that used observed precipitation and temperature from the historical period (1971-2000). The impact of climate change on hydrology and soil erosion was assPssi-d by comparing the historical period with the future climate scenarios (2021-2050). Most of the used climate models predict an increase of temperature between 0.9 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C. The bias correction did not alter the climate change signal of temperature. Large uncertainties among the RCMs-GCMs exist regarding the climate change signal of future precipitation. Some climate models predict an increased (5.9%-36.5%) others a decreased (6.4%-10.9%) or mixed signal. The applied bias correction did not reverse the climate change signal in most cases but it influenced magnitude and timing of precipitation. The ensemble mean suggests an increased discharge between 19.5% (RCP 8.5) and 36.5% (RCP4.5) and an increased SSY of the same order. In general, the climate change signal and the corresponding discharge and SSY predictions are afflicted with large uncertainties. These uncertainties impede direct conclusions regarding future development of discharge and erosion. As a consequence of the mixed signals, potential increase and decrease of future discharge and soil erosion have to be incorporated in climate change adaption strategies.","[Op de Hipt, Felix; Diekkrueger, Bernd; Steup, Gero; Yira, Yacouba] Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, Meckenheimer Allee 166, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Hoffmann, Thomas] German Fed Inst Hydrol, Am Mainzer Tor 1, D-56068 Koblenz, Germany; [Rode, Michael] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Bruckstr 3a, D-39114 Magdeburg, Germany",University of Bonn; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Op de Hipt, F (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, Meckenheimer Allee 166, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",felixodh@uni-bonn.de,"Rode, Michael/ABA-4786-2021; Diekkrüger, Bernd/D-9410-2013; Rode, Michael/AAD-1014-2022","Rode, Michael/0000-0003-0086-2033; Diekkrüger, Bernd/0000-0001-9234-7850; Rode, Michael/0000-0003-0086-2033",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the West Afr can Science Service Centre for Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL) project [01LG1202E],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the West Afr can Science Service Centre for Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL) project(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The authors are grateful for the financial support provided by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) (Grant No. 01LG1202E) under the auspices of the West Afr can Science Service Centre for Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL) project.

The development of intermittent renewable energy resources has received significant support from governments, and its production will considerably increase. The introduction of this high electrical production presents some challenges, in particular, the allocation of high production in low consumption periods. One of the most promoted solutions to cope with this challenge is the integration of power-to-gas technologies (P2G). In this area, the European Union and some of its members have presented plans supporting the production and consumption of hydrogen. At the same time, it should be noted that the development strategies for these technologies are largely deployed at the local level. To allow local territories to contribute to the decarbonization of the energy system, national governments are extending the application of their energy policy to local areas. This is the case in France, which over the last decades has adopted laws to extend the application of its energy policy at local level, with the objective of ensuring better, faster deployment of its energy transition and reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. As a result, the French regions have targeted objectives for the development of their local energy resources. The SUD Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur Region (PACA) in southern France, in response to these air, energy, environment, and climate change adaptation responsibilities, has set a target to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. This will involve the massive development of solar photovoltaic production as the region has considerable access to solar resources. The region has also presented a hydrogen plan to support the development of this energy in the region and contribute to national efforts. This study, conducted with TIMESPACA a bottom-up optimization model representing the energy system of the PACA region, analyzes how P2G technologies contribute to the development of solar resources. Results show that P2G technologies are essential for the decarbonization of the regional energy system and the deployment of renewables, that they are required to reach national and global decarbonization objectives, and that they are expected to structure the whole hydrogen chain.","[Andrade, Carlos; Selosse, Sandrine; Maizi, Nadia] PSL Res Univ, Ctr Appl Math, MINES ParisTech, Sophia Antipolis, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech,"Andrade, C (corresponding author), PSL Res Univ, Ctr Appl Math, MINES ParisTech, Sophia Antipolis, France.",carlos.andrade@minesparis.psl.eu,,"Andrade Sandoval, Carlos Eduardo/0000-0002-3707-8026",ADEME; Region SUD PACA; SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC; Chair Modeling for sustainable development; EDF; GRTgaz; RTE; TOTAL; General Directorate for Energy ad Climate of Ministry of Ecological and Solidarity Transition,ADEME; Region SUD PACA; SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC; Chair Modeling for sustainable development; EDF(Electricite de France (EDF)); GRTgaz; RTE; TOTAL(Total SA); General Directorate for Energy ad Climate of Ministry of Ecological and Solidarity Transition,"This research was primarily funded by ADEME and the Region SUD PACA and supported by SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC as part of a doctoral program.

This paper examines a case study where this localism presumption has been applied to estuary flood defence and considers the appropriateness of localor community-based initiatives in dealing with sea level rise. We examine the Alde and Ore Estuary, Suffolk, England, UK, where the state has retreated as the main decision-maker for climate change adaptation and consider the impacts of this change in governance approach. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with local actors focusing on: a) perceptions of the governance of flood defence plans, b) the legitimacy of decisions reached, and c) social equity linked with localism. We find that there is a limit to what can be devolved down to local communities in the absence of structure, guidelines, funding or supervision provided by state actors. It is unrealistic that responsibility for problems such as flood defence, involving complex trade-offs; issues of public safety and public expenditure; and protection of natural assets be devolved so comprehensively to local communities without substantial co-leadership. State actors still need to co-lead and provide a link between the local scale and the national and international policy scales and to facilitate a broader sense of vision for future landscapes. Without transparent co-led processes involving a broad range of actors in the local community and state bodies, decisions made regarding flood defence initiatives may be perceived by local people to lack legitimacy. Without an independent arbiter involved in project planning and decision-making, disagreements may dissolve into intractable disputes that damage project credibility and hamper or even paralyze practical progress. Without compensation schemes that acknowledge that any flood defence plan will mean some local people lose out, some are likely to vigorously resist change, hampering progress. It will also be necessary to ensure a focus on inter-generational equity so that current generations do not deflect costs onto later generations, for whom costs may be higher and decisions more difficult.","[McGinlay, James; Jones, Nikoleta] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 16-21 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Clark, Julian] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Maguire-Rajpaul, Victoria A.] Anglia Ruskin Univ, Global Sustainabil Inst, 183 East Rd, Cambridge CB1 1PT, England; [Maguire-Rajpaul, Victoria A.] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, 3 South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of Cambridge; University of Birmingham; Anglia Ruskin University; University of Oxford,"McGinlay, J (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 16-21 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",jm2365@cam.ac.uk,,"McGinlay, James/0000-0003-3694-193X","ESRC Impact Acceleration Account; Faculty of Science and Engineering, Anglia Ruskin University","ESRC Impact Acceleration Account(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Faculty of Science and Engineering, Anglia Ruskin University","This work was funded by a) an ESRC Impact Acceleration Account (led by University of Birmingham) - ESCALATION; and b) internal (QR) funding provided by Faculty of Science and Engineering, Anglia Ruskin University.",,69,6,6,2,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,APR 15,2021,204,,,,,,,,105458,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105458,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105458,,MAR 2021,10,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Oceanography; Water Resources,RB5WZ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000632183000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

But there is less understanding of how subnational policy and local projects are able to incorporate attention to adaptation; therefore, we use a case study in Vietnam to discuss how REDD+ projects and policies address both concerns of mitigation and adaptation together at subnational levels. Through stakeholder interviews, focus groups, and household surveys in three provinces of Vietnam with REDD+ activities, our research sought to understand if REDD+ policies and projects on the ground acknowledge that climate change is likely to impact forests and forest users; if this knowledge is built into REDD+ policy and activities; how households in forested areas subject to REDD+ policy are vulnerable to climate change; and how REDD+ activities can help or hinder needed adaptations. Our findings indicate that there continues to be a lack of coordination between mitigation and adaptation policies in Vietnam, particularly with regard to REDD+. Policies for forest-based climate mitigation at the national and subnational level, as well as site-based projects, have paid little attention to the adaptation needs of local communities, many of whom are already suffering from noticeable weather changes in their localities, and there is insufficient discussion of how REDD+ activities could facilitate increased resilience. While there were some implicit and coincidental adaptation benefits of some REDD+ activities, most studied projects and policies did not explicitly target their activities to focus on adaptation or resilience, and in at least one case, negative livelihood impacts that have increased household vulnerability to climate change were documented. Key barriers to integration were identified, such as sectoral specialization; a lack of attention in REDD+ projects to livelihoods; and inadequate support for ecosystem-based adaptation.","[McElwee, Pamela] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Environm & Biol Sci, Dept Human Ecol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Van Hai Thi Nguyen; Dung Viet Nguyen] People & Nat Reconciliat PanNat, Hanoi 10000, Vietnam; [Nghi Huu Tran] Tropenbos Int Vietnam TBI, Hue 530000, Vietnam; [Hue Van Thi Le; Tuyen Phuong Nghiem; Huong Dieu Thi Vu] Vietnam Natl Univ, Ctr Nat Resources & Environm Studies CRES, Hanoi 10000, Vietnam",Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Vietnam National University Hanoi,"McElwee, P (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Sch Environm & Biol Sci, Dept Human Ecol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",pamela.mcelwee@rutgers.edu; van@nature.org.vn; dungnv@nature.org.vn; nghi@tropenbos.vn; thivanhue@gmail.com; tuyennghiem_cres@yahoo.com; huongvudieu@yahoo.com,"McElwee, Pamela D/A-9442-2009; McElwee, Pamela/AAP-1695-2020","McElwee, Pamela D/0000-0003-3525-9285; McElwee, Pamela/0000-0003-3525-9285; NGUYEN, VAN THI HAI/0000-0003-4153-1150",National Science Foundation Geography and Regional Science Division [11028793]; Hatch funding of the US National Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA); US Agency for International Development (USAID); Tropenbos; PanNature,National Science Foundation Geography and Regional Science Division(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Hatch funding of the US National Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA); US Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Tropenbos; PanNature,"This research was made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation Geography and Regional Science Division for the project Downscaling REDD+ policies in developing countries: Assessing the impact of carbon payments on household decision-making and vulnerability to climate change in Vietnam (grant #11028793) to McElwee, support to McElwee from Hatch funding of the US National Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA), and a US Agency for International Development (USAID) Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research grant to the CRES, Tropenbos and PanNature for the project: Research and capacity building on REDD+, livelihoods, and vulnerability in Vietnam: developing tools for social analysis of development planning.

We used Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) stochastic procedures to estimate temperature and precipitation at the very small scale of urban Census Block Groups (CBGs) in Phoenix, Arizona and Portland, Oregon, and then compared average household water use patterns by climate conditions and land cover characteristics between and within the two cities. Summer household water use was positively related to maximum temperatures and dense vegetation cover in terms of grass cover and trees and shrubs; it was negatively related to precipitation amounts in both cities. Water use was more sensitive to maximum temperature, precipitation levels, and vegetation cover in Phoenix than in Portland. There was substantial intra-city variation with greater sensitivity in urban water use associated with higher densities of trees and shrubs in both cities, but in Phoenix, the highest sensitivities to maximum temperatures occurred in CBGs with the most grass cover while in Portland, high sensitivity was associated with CBGs with the least grass cover. Many of the latter are in highly built-up downtown areas of Portland where artificial irrigation is required to maintain landscapes during the hot summer season. Take-home messages are: (1) BME space/time statistics provide efficient estimates of missing precipitation and temperature data to create continuous high resolution meteorological data that improve water demand analysis and (2) use of landscaping for urban climate adaptation will have differing impacts on water use, depending on local climate conditions, urban layout, and the type of vegetation cover.","[Lee, Seung-Jae] Risk Management Solut Inc, Geospatial Dev, Newark, CA 94560 USA; [Chang, Heejun] Portland State Univ, Dept Geog, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Gober, Patricia] Univ Saskatchewan, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Gober, Patricia] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ USA",Portland State University; University of Saskatchewan; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Chang, H (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, Dept Geog, Portland, OR 97207 USA.",changh@pdx.edu,,,"Climate Program Office of the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [NA09OAR4310140]; National Science Foundation through the Decision Center for a Desert City [SES-0345945]; James F. and Marion L.

The Paris Agreement established the global stocktake to evaluate the collective progress made on adaptation. Nevertheless, various challenges still exist when evaluating adaptation progress, among which is the lack of standard definitions to support evaluation efforts. Therefore, we investigated the views of experts regarding the definitions of adaptation given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the definition of successful adaptation by Doria et al., with a focus on Latin America. Using the Delphi method, we obtained relevant knowledge and perspectives. As a result, we identified a high level of consensus (85%) among the experts regarding the IPCC's definition of climate adaptation. However, there was no consensus on the definition of successful adaptation. For both definitions, we present the elements on which the experts agreed and disagreed, as well as the proposed elements that could improve the definitions to support adaptation evaluation efforts. Additionally, we introduce a list of criteria and indicators that could improve the evaluation of adaptation at different management levels and facilitate the aggregation of information on adaptation progress.","[Guillen Bolanos, Tania; Manez Costa, Maria] Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, Fischertwiete 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany; [Guillen Bolanos, Tania; Scheffran, Juergen] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Res Grp Climate Change & Secur, D-20144 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Bolanos, TG (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, Fischertwiete 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany.;Bolanos, TG (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Res Grp Climate Change & Secur, D-20144 Hamburg, Germany.",tania.guillen@hereon.de; juergen.scheffran@uni-hamburg.de; maria.manez@hereon.de,"Scheffran, Jürgen/M-6876-2019; Manez Costa, Maria/P-1225-2017","Scheffran, Jürgen/0000-0002-7171-3062; Guillen Bolanos, Tania/0000-0003-4601-7783; Manez Costa, Maria/0000-0001-5415-0811",DFG,DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors are grateful to the Latin American experts who participated in the first and second round of the Delphi method exercise: A.

One way for cities to adapt is by enhancing their green infrastructure (GI) to mitigate the impacts of heat waves and flooding. While alternative GI design options exist, there are many unknoWns regarding public support for the various options. This study aims to fill this gap by performing a socio-cultural valuation of urban GI for climate adaptation that encompasses multiple dimensions: people's notion of and concerns about climate impacts, the degree to which people acknowledge the benefits of GI to alleviate such impacts, and people's preferences for different GI measures, including their willingness to pay (WTP). Data were collected through photo-assisted face-to-face surveys (n=200.) with residents in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and linked to GI GIS data. Respondents had a notion of and concerns about climate impacts, but did not necessarily acknowledge that GI may help tackle these issues. Yet, when residents were informed about the adaptation capacity of different GI measures, their preferences shifted towards the most effective options. There was no information effect, however, on people's WTP for GI, which was mostly related to income and ethnicity. Our study shows that economic valuation alone would miss nuances that socio-cultural valuation as applied in this paper can reveal. The method revealed preferences for particular adaptation designs, and assists in detecting why policy for climate adaptation may be hampered. Understanding people's views on climate impacts and adaptation options is crucial for prioritizing effective policy responses in the face of climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Excessive dependence on rainfed agricultural production makes Africa more vulnerable to climate change effects. Weather information and services are essential for farmers to more effectively survive the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events due to climate change. Weather information is important for resource management in agricultural production and helps farmers plan their farming activities in advance. Machine Learning is one of the technologies used in agriculture for weather forecasting and crop disease detection among others. The objective of this study is to develop Machine Learning-based models adapted to the context of daily weather forecasting for Rainfall, Relative Humidity, and Maximum and Minimum Temperature in Senegal. In this study, we made a comparison of ten Machine Learning Regressors with our Ensemble Model. These models were evaluated based on Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error and Coefficient of Determination. The results show that the Ensemble Model performs better than the ten base models. The Ensemble Model results for each parameter are as follows; Relative Humidity: Mean Absolute Error was 4.0126, Mean Squared Error was 29.9885, Root Mean Squared Error was 5.4428 and Coefficient of Determination was 0.9335. For Minimum Temperature: Mean Absolute Error was 0.7908, Mean Squared Error was 1.1329, Root Mean Squared Error was 1.0515 and Coefficient of Determination was 0.9018. For Maximum Temperature: Mean Absolute Error was 1.2515, Mean Squared Error was 2.8038, Root Mean Squared Error was 1.6591 and Coefficient of Determination was 0.8205. For Rainfall: Mean Absolute Error was 0.2142, Mean Squared Error was 0.1681, Root Mean Squared Error was 0.4100 and Coefficient of Determination was 0.7733. From the present study, it has been observed that the Ensemble Model is a feasible model to be used for Rainfall, Relative Humidity, and Maximum and Minimum Temperature forecasting.","[Nyasulu, Chimango; Diattara, Awa; Ba, Cheikh] Univ Gaston Berger, LANI Lab Anal Numer & Informat, St Lous 32000, Senegal; [Traore, Assitan] Business & Decis, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Deme, Abdoulaye] Univ Gaston Berger, Unite Format & Rech Sci Appl & Technol, Lab Sci Atmosphere & Ocean, St Louis 32000, Senegal",,"Nyasulu, C (corresponding author), Univ Gaston Berger, LANI Lab Anal Numer & Informat, St Lous 32000, Senegal.",nyasulu.chimango@ugb.edu.sn,"DEME, Abdoulaye/X-4795-2018","DEME, Abdoulaye/0000-0002-5444-8420; Nyasulu, Chimango/0000-0001-8838-2848; BA, Cheikh/0000-0002-4515-5044","Partnership for skills in Applied Sciences, Engineering and Technology (PASET)-Regional Scholarship and Innovation Fund (RSIF)","Partnership for skills in Applied Sciences, Engineering and Technology (PASET)-Regional Scholarship and Innovation Fund (RSIF)","This research was funded by Partnership for skills in Applied Sciences, Engineering and Technology (PASET)-Regional Scholarship and Innovation Fund (RSIF).",,35,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,SEP,2022,12,9,,,,,,,1473,10.3390/agriculture12091473,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12091473,,,23,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,4V4OB,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000859456700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Coinciding with adverse socio-economic conditions, this event triggered the last subsistence crisis in the western World. Here, we model reductions in potential crop yields for 1816 and 1817 and address the question, what impact a similar climatic anomaly would have today. We reconstructed daily weather for Switzerland for 1816/17 on a 2 km grid using historical observations and an analogue resampling method. These data were used to simulate potential crop yields for potato, grain maize, and winter barley using the CropSyst model calibrated for current crop cultivars. We also simulated yields for the same weather anomalies, but referenced to a present-day baseline temperature. Results show that reduced temperature delayed growth and harvest considerably, and in combination with reduced solar irradiance led to a substantial reduction (20%-50%) in the potential yield of potato in 1816. Effects on winter barley were smaller. Significant reductions were also modelled for 1817 and were mainly due to a cold late spring. Relative reductions for the present-day scenario for the two crops were almost indistinguishable from the historical ones. An even stronger response was found for maize, which was not yet common in 1816/17. Waterlogging, which we assessed using a stress-day approach, likely added to the simulated reductions. The documented, strong east-west gradient in malnutrition across Switzerland in 1817/18 could not be explained by biophysical yield limitations (though excess-water limitation might have contributed), but rather by economic, political and social factors. This highlights the importance of these factors for a societies' ability to cope with extreme climate events. While the adaptive capacity of today's society in Switzerland is much greater than in the early 19th century, our results emphasize the need for interdisciplinary approaches to climate change adaptation considering not only biophysical, but also social, economic and political aspects.","[Fluckiger, Simon; Bronnimann, Stefan] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Bern, Switzerland; [Fluckiger, Simon; Bronnimann, Stefan; Holzkamper, Annelie; Fuhrer, Jurg; Kramer, Daniel; Pfister, Christian; Rohr, Christian] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Holzkamper, Annelie; Fuhrer, Jurg] Agroscope, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kramer, Daniel; Pfister, Christian; Rohr, Christian] Univ Bern, Inst Hist, Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern; University of Bern; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; University of Bern,"Bronnimann, S (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Bern, Switzerland.;Bronnimann, S (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland.",stefan.broennimann@giub.unibe.ch,,"Bronnimann, Stefan/0000-0001-9502-7991; Kramer, Daniel/0000-0002-4839-0090",Swiss National Science Foundation; Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research of the University of Bern; PAGES working group VICS (Volcanic Impacts on Climate and Society),Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research of the University of Bern; PAGES working group VICS (Volcanic Impacts on Climate and Society),This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (projects CHIMES and EXTRA-LARGE).

Towards this it is essential to understand the climate change perceptions, adaptation practices and barriers to effective adaptation at household and community level. This paper using household surveys and focus group discussions in one of the drought prone areas of Odisha in India, explores various aspects of perception on climate change and barriers to adaptation. It also analyses the accuracy of perceptions based on rainfall data from nearest meteorological stations. The study reinforces the argument by earlier studies that the perception by people simply cannot be wrong because they may have a just a low correlation with underlying meteorological data. Results suggest that farmers increasingly perceive the changes in the rainfall and temperature patterns. However, when compared with the trend in actual rainfall data, perceptions on rainfall are found to more closely align with the results from the nearest station as compared to the station farther from it. Analysis revealed that seasonal rainfall variability has a profound influence on the farmers' perceptions on climate change and drought in the study region. Farmers' are still dependent on the traditional forecasting system because of the lack of access to modern climate forecasting and tailored information for agricultural practice. Although farmers in the study region are already adapting to the changing climate, the study finds that while lack of access to water and irrigation, information on climate change adaptation and early warning systems are major barriers to adaptation at the household level lack of government intervention, lack of knowledge on drought resistant crops and varieties and lack of renovation of water bodies and irrigation were mentioned as the major barriers at the community level. Findings from the paper argue for better adaptation planning at the local level incorporating local level perceptions and barriers to adaptation. In such areas local level planning can be crucial in enhancing the adaptive capacity of the farmers.","[Panda, Architesh] IRRI, Climate Change Unit, Los Banos, Philippines",CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI),"Panda, A (corresponding author), IRRI, Climate Change Unit, Los Banos, Philippines.",architesh@gmail.com,"Panda, Architesh/D-3959-2014","Panda, Architesh/0000-0002-1083-5314",,,,,62,29,29,4,61,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

In 2018 and 2019, we conducted field trials in arid areas (Changji), semi-arid areas (Qitai) and semi-humid areas (Xinyuan). The hybrid XY335 was selected for the experiment, the planting density was 12.0 x 10(4) plants ha(-1), and five irrigation amounts were set. The results showed that yield, biomass, and transpiration varied substantially and significantly between experimental sites, irrigation and years. Likewise, water use efficiency (WUE) for both biomass (WUEB) and yield (WUEY) were affected by these factors, including a significant interaction. Normalized water productivity (WP*) of maize increased significantly with an increase in irrigation. The WP* for film mulched drip irrigation maize was 37.81 g m(-2) d(-)(1); it was varied significantly between sites and irrigation or their interaction. We conclude that WP* differs from the conventional parameter for water productivity but is a useful parameter for assessing the attainable rate of film-mulched drip irrigation maize growth and yield in arid areas, semi-arid areas and semi-humid areas. The parametric AquaCrop model was not accurate in simulating soil water under film mulching.

Here, we decomposed six drivers of CO2 emissions in Changxing County using the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method. We then constructed a model for CO2 emissions prediction based on a revised version of the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model and used it to simulate energy-related CO2 emissions in five scenarios. Results show that: (1) From 2010 to 2017, the economic output effect was a significant, direct, dominant, and long-term driver of increasing CO2 emissions; (2) The STIRPAT model predicted that energy structure will be the decisive factor restricting total CO2 emissions from 2018 to 2035; (3) Low-carbon development in the electric power sector is the best strategy for Changxing to achieve low-carbon development. Under the tested scenarios, Changxing will likely reach peak total CO2 emissions (17.95 million tons) by 2030.

This systematic review of empirical studies of farmers' adaptation in SSA drylands from 1990 to 2021 shows that farmers have used an array of strategies to respond to changes in their environment and climate based on local and scientific knowledge. Although both types of knowledge have their effectiveness, they also have gaps and challenges. Thus, there is growing evidence that farmers are integrating the two knowledge types to help them close the gaps in their knowledge and increase the effec-tiveness of adaptation strategies implemented. The review further reveals the existence of various enabling conditions for knowledge integration such as stakeholder engagement and buy-in, continuous learning and improvements, access to extension, and government, scientific and policy support. Other enabling conditions are the role of different institutions, market access, identification of existing practices, equitable access to natural resources, enforceable property rights and consistency of practices.","[Jellason, Nugun P.] Teesside Univ, Int Business Sch, Middlesbrough TS1 3BZ, England; [Salite, Daniela] Aston Univ, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Birmingham B4 7ER, England; [Conway, John S.] Natl Assoc Disabil Practitioners, Brighton, England; [Ogbaga, Chukwuma C.] Nile Univ Nigeria, Dept Biol Sci, Airport Rd, Abuja, Nigeria; [Ogbaga, Chukwuma C.] Nile Univ Nigeria, Dept Microbiol & Biotechnol, Airport Rd, Abuja, Nigeria",University of Teesside; Aston University,"Jellason, NP (corresponding author), Teesside Univ, Int Business Sch, Middlesbrough TS1 3BZ, England.",nugunjellason@gmail.com; d.salite@aston.ac.uk; jscnwy@gmail.com; chukwumaogbaga@gmail.com,"Ogbaga, Chukwuma C/ABD-5384-2020","Ogbaga, Chukwuma C/0000-0003-4951-2253; Jellason, Nugun P/0000-0002-5583-354X",,,,,103,2,2,2,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2211-4645,2211-4653,,ENVIRON DEV,Environ.

The lake water level has decreased in recent years due to human activities and climate change. Several studies have highlighted the significant roles of climatic and anthropogenic factors on the shrinkage of the lake. Management policies for water resources harvesting must be adopted to adapt to climate change and avoid the consequent problems stemming from the drought affecting Lake Urmia, and rationing must be applied to the upstream water demands. This study analyzes strategies and evaluates their effectiveness in overcoming the Urmia Lake crisis. Specifically, system dynamics analysis was performed for simulating the water volume of Lake Urmia, and the Hadley Centre coupled model was applied to project surface temperature and precipitation for two future periods: 2021-2050 and 2051-2080. Six management scenarios were considered for decreasing the allocation of agricultural water demand corresponding to two options: (1) one-reservoir option (Bukan reservoir only), and (2) six-reservoir option. The net inflow of Urmia Lake was simulated for the two future periods with the IHACRES model and with artificial neural network models under the six management scenarios. The annual average volumes of Lake Urmia would be 30 x 10(9) and 12 x 10(9) m(3) over the first and second future periods, respectively, without considering the management scenarios. The lake volumes would rise by about 50% and 75% for the first and second periods, respectively under the management scenarios that involve strict protective measures and elimination of the effect of all dams and their reservoirs. Implementing strict measures would increase the annual average lake volume to 21 x 10(9) m(3) in the second period; yet, this volume would be less than the long-term average and strategic volume. The human water use would be completely eliminated under Scenario 6. Nevertheless, Lake Urmia would experience a considerable loss of storage because of drought.","[Bozorg-Haddad, Omid; Dehghan, Paniz; Zolghadr-Asli, Babak] Univ Tehran, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Fac Agr Engn & Technol, Dept Irrigat & Reclamat Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Singh, Vijay P.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, 321 Scoates Hall, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Singh, Vijay P.] Texas A&M Univ, Zachry Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 321 Scoates Hall, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Chu, Xuefeng] North Dakota State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Dept 2470, Fargo, ND 58108 USA; [Loaiciga, Hugo A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Isla Vista, CA 93106 USA",University of Tehran; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; North Dakota State University Fargo; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Bozorg-Haddad, O (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Fac Agr Engn & Technol, Dept Irrigat & Reclamat Engn, Tehran, Iran.",obhaddad@ut.ac.ir,"Zolghadr-Asli, Babak/L-4853-2019; Dehghan, Paniz/HLG-2389-2023","Zolghadr-Asli, Babak/0000-0002-3392-2672; ",Iran's National Science Foundation (INSF),Iran's National Science Foundation (INSF),The authors thank Iran's National Science Foundation (INSF) for its support for this research.,,50,2,2,3,10,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,APR 6,2022,12,1,,,,,,,5828,10.1038/s41598-022-09212-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-09212-x,,,17,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,0J5SN,35388036,"Green Accepted, Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000780164200101,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of the climate suitability for maize on the NCP in the present and future may help sustainably use climate-related resources to ensure food security in China. In this study, 30 general circulation models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 and a statistical downscaling model (NWAI-WG) were used to project meteorological data in 2021-2100 under representative concentration pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) and RCP8.5 for 23 national climatic stations on the NCP. Based on agricultural climate suitability theory and the fuzzy mathematics method, the suitability of temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation on summer maize were analysed. The results showed that temperature suitability is decreasing for 2021-2100, especially during the stages from jointing to maturity; temperature suitability is the lowest in the southwest and increases to the northeast under both scenarios. Compared to 1996-2015, the precipitation suitability in 2021-2100 increases greatly under both scenarios, especially in the central part under RCP4.5 and in the north part under RCP8.5. Solar radiation suitability shows a decreasing trend for 1996-2015, however, an increasing trend for 2021-2100 under both scenarios. At spatial scale, the solar suitability increases from southwest to northeast. The integrated climate suitability under RCP4.5 in 2021-2100 is averaged approximately 0.8 and varies slightly, indicating climate change may do small effect on maize growth, though the high values shifting from the central part in 2021-2040 to the northern part in 2081-2100; however, under RCP8.5, the integrated climate suitability shows a downward trend, indicating that climate change will make many regions less suitable for maize growth. These results could provide basic information for agriculture to adapt to climate change and ensure food security for China.","[Tang, Xiaopei; Liu, Haijun] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Water Sci, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Tang, Xiaopei; Liu, Haijun] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing Key Lab Urban Hydrol Cycle & Sponge City, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University,"Liu, HJ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Water Sci, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",shanxilhj@bnu.edu.cn,"Liu, Haijun/C-8294-2016","Liu, Haijun/0000-0001-9786-8313",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFD0201500]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51939005]; 111 Project [B18006],"National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project)","National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2017YFD0201500; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 51939005; the 111 Project, Grant/Award Number: B18006",,73,5,5,8,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Mitigating and adapting to climate change requires fundamental changes in urbanism and city automobile traffic. Superblocks, a grid of blocks and basic roads forming a polygon, approximately 400 by 400 m, are one of the instruments for such changes. These type of city Superblocks represent a new model of mobility that restructures the typical urban road network, thereby substantially reducing automobile traffic, and accordingly GHG emissions, while increasing green space in the city and improving the health and quality of life of its inhabitants. Furthermore, the Superblocks do not require investment in hard infrastructures, nor do they involve demolishing buildings or undertaking massive development; they are in fact very low-tech urbanism. The city of Barcelona has been implementing Superblocks as one of the measures to combat climate change with very positive results. The paper analyzes the concept of the Superblock and its relation with climate change in cities. Along these lines, it analyzes the pioneer experience of Barcelona in the development and implementation of the Superblocks, as a radical plan aimed at taking back the streets from cars. The role of political power and institutional leadership has been key in societal acceptance and the achievement of tangible results. But there are also obstacles and drawbacks in the development of these types of Superblocks, such as the necessity to redesign the collective transport network so that car traffic can truly be reduced in cities, the possible negative influence on traffic going in and out of the city, the lack of visible advantages if they are not implemented in the entire city, the risk of gentrification in the areas with Superblocks, public opposition, and opposition from certain sectors of the business community.","[Lopez, Ivan] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Psychol & Sociol, Zaragoza 50009, Spain; [Ortega, Jordi] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Barcelona 08019, Spain; [Pardo, Mercedes] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Social Anal, Getafe 28903, Spain",University of Zaragoza; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Lopez, I (corresponding author), Univ Zaragoza, Dept Psychol & Sociol, Zaragoza 50009, Spain.",ivalopez@unizar.es; jordiortega@hotmail.com; mercedes.pardo@uc3m.es,"lopez, ivan/GSM-8495-2022","Lopez Ortega, Jordi/0000-0001-5364-1037; Lopez Ortega, Jordi/0000-0002-1239-3943",,,,,47,7,7,14,38,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,APR,2020,11,4,,,,,,,410,10.3390/atmos11040410,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11040410,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,LW9WE,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000539492200097,View Full Record in Web of Science

The IPCC's 5th assessment suggests these changing systems are susceptible to unforeseen and dangerous 'emergent risks'. An archetypal example is the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) where the river dyke network has been heightened and extended over the last decade with the dual objectives of (1) adapting the delta's 18 million inhabitants and their livelihoods to increasingly intense river-flooding, and (2) developing rice production through a shift from double to triple-cropping. Negative impacts have been associated with this shift, particularly in relation to its exclusion of fluvial sediment deposition from the floodplain. A deficit in our understanding of the dynamics of the rice-sediment system, which involve unintuitive delays, feedbacks, and tipping points, is addressed here, using a system dynamics (SD) approach to inform sustainable adaptation strategies. Specifically, we develop and test a new SD model which simulates the dynamics between the farmers' economic system and their rice agriculture operations, and uniquely, integrates the role of fluvial sediment deposition within their dyke compartment. We use the model to explore a range of alternative rice cultivation strategies. Our results suggest that the current dominant strategy (triple-cropping) is only optimal for wealthier groups within society and over the short-term (ca. 10 years post-implementation). The model suggests that the policy of opening sluice gates and leaving paddies fallow during high-flood years, in order to encourage natural sediment deposition and the nutrient replenishment it supplies, is both a more equitable and a more sustainable policy. But, even with this approach, diminished supplies of sediment-bound nutrients and the consequent need to compensate with artificial fertilisers will mean that smaller-scale farmers in the VMD are more vulnerable to accruing debt.

On the average, climate models show a tendency for higher mean annual rainfall and for wetter conditions, in particular during October, November and December, but there is much uncertainty about the future amount, distribution, timing and intensity of rainfall. Ethiopia's low level of economic development, combined with its heavy dependence on agriculture and high population growth rate make the country particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of climate change. Nearly 90% of Ethiopia's population lives in the Highlands, which include the critical Blue Nile (Abay) Highlands-a region that holds special importance due to its role in domestic agricultural production and international water resources. A five year study of climate vulnerability and adaptation strategies in communities of Choke Mountain, located in the center of the Abay Highlands, has informed a proposed framework for enhancing climate resilience in communities across the region. The framework is motivated by the critical need to enhance capacity to cope with climate change and, subsequently, to advance a carbon neutral and climate resilient economy in Ethiopia. The implicit hypothesis in applying a research framework for this effort is that science-based information, generated through improved understanding of impacts and vulnerabilities of local communities, can contribute to enhanced resilience strategies. We view adaptation to climate change in a wider context of changes, including, among others, market conditions, the political-institutional framework, and population dynamics. From a livelihood perspective, culture, historical settings, the diversity of income generation strategies, knowledge, and education are important factors that contribute to adaptive capacities. This paper reviews key findings of the Choke Mountain study, describes the principles of the climate resilience framework, and proposes an implementation strategy for climate resilient development to be applied in the Abay Highlands, with potential expansion to agricultural communities across the region and beyond.","[Simane, Belay] Univ Addis Ababa, Coll Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Zaitchik, Benjamin F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Mesfin, Desalegn] Ethiopia Environm Protect Author, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University; Johns Hopkins University,"Simane, B (corresponding author), Univ Addis Ababa, Coll Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",simaneb@yahoo.com; zaitchik@jhu.edu; epa_ddg@ethionet.et,"Zaitchik, Benjamin/AAB-3298-2020; Zaitchik, Benjamin/B-9461-2013","Zaitchik, Benjamin/0000-0002-0698-0658; ",Johns Hopkins University; Addis Ababa University,Johns Hopkins University(Johns Hopkins University); Addis Ababa University,The authors thank the Johns Hopkins University Global Water Program and Addis Ababa University for providing funds for the workshop in Bahir Dar.

Yet evidence shows that some of the most adverse effects of climate change will be in developing countries, where populations are most vulnerable and least likely to easily adapt to climate change, and that climate change will affect the potential for development in these countries. Some synergies already exist between climate change policies and the sustainable development agenda in developing countries, such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, transport and sustainable land-use policies. Despite limited attention from policy-makers to date, climate change policies could have significant ancillary benefits for the local environment. The reverse is also true as local and national policies to address congestion, air quality, access to energy services and energy diversity may also limit GHG emissions. Nevertheless there could be significant trade-offs associated with deeper levels of mitigation in some countries, for example where developing countries are dependent on indigenous coal and may be required to switch to cleaner yet more expensive fuels to limit emissions. The distributional impacts of such policies are an important determinant of their feasibility and need to be considered up-front. It follows that future agreements on mitigation and adaptation under the convention will need to recognise the diverse situations of developing countries with respect to their level of economic development, their vulnerability to climate change and their ability to adapt or mitigate. Recognition of how climate change is likely to influence other development priorities may be a first Step toward building cost-effective strategies and integrated, institutional capacity in developing countries to respond to climate change. Opportunities may also exist in developing countries to use regional economic organisations to assist in the design of integrated responses and to exploit synergies between climate change and other policies such as those designed to combat desertification and preserve biodiversity.

However, the increasing recognition of the value of urban ecological processes and services as well as their contribution to climate change adaptation and mitigation has recently become an area of great research interest. Specifically, the emerging geospatial analytical approaches like remote sensing have led to an increase in the number of studies that seek to quantify and map urban ecosystem services at varying scales. Hence, this study sought to review the current remote sensing trends, challenges and prospects in quantifying urban ecosystem services in sub-Saharan Africa cities. Literature shows that consistent modelling and understanding of urban ecosystem services using remotely sensed approaches began in the 1990s, with an average of five publications per year after around 2010. This is mainly attributed to the approach's ability to provide fast, accurate and repeated spatial information necessary for optimal and timely quantification and mapping of urban ecosystem services. Although commercially available high spatial resolution sensors (e.g. the Worldview series, Quickbird and RapidEye) with higher spatial and spectral properties have been valuable in providing highly accurate and reliable data for quantification of urban ecosystem services, their adoption has been limited by high image acquisition cost and small spatial coverage that limits regional assessment. Thus, the newly launched sensors that provide freely and readily available data (i.e. Landsat 8 and 9 OLI, Sentinel-2) are increasingly becoming popular. These sensors provide data with improved spatial and spectral properties, hence valuable for past, current and future urban ecosystem service assessment, especially in developing countries. Therefore, the study provides guidance for future studies to continuously assess urban ecosystem services in order to achieve the objectives of Kyoto Protocol and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD +) of promoting climate-resilient and sustainable cities, especially in developing world.","[Mngadi, Mthembeni; Odindi, John; Mutanga, Onisimo; Sibanda, Mbulisi] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Geog, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Mngadi, M (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Geog, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",mngadimthe@gmail.com,,"Odindi, John/0000-0002-4934-1346",DST-NRF SARChI Chair in Land Use Planning and Management at UKZN [84157],DST-NRF SARChI Chair in Land Use Planning and Management at UKZN,The authors would like to acknowledge the DST-NRF SARChI Chair in Land Use Planning and Management at UKZN (Grant No. 84157) for their financial support.,,112,1,1,11,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-6369,1573-2959,,ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS,Environ.

Identifying solutions that minimize variability in projected vegetation productivity may represent a less risky conservation investment by reducing the amount of anticipated environmental change. In this study, we assessed hypothetical protected area networks designed for future vegetation variability under a range of different climate conditions to provide relevant recommendations of conservation requirements that support ongoing boreal conservation and land-use planning. We constructed a boreal conservation assessment using both a conventional (Marxan) and a new probabilistic site-selection approach (Marxan with probability) with projected 2080 vegetation variability probability (VVP) for least change (B1), business as usual (A1B) and most extreme change (A2) climate scenarios. We then assessed (1) reserve network performance (cost and area), (2) high conservation priority areas and (3) the influence and implications of VVP on reserve networks. We found that including VVP dramatically increased the relative cost and total area of reserve networks. Many low-cost sites with high VVP values were given higher conservation priority over fewer sites with low VVP values. Reserve networks designed for A1B and A2 climate scenarios contained more sites with very high VVP values. The ratio of sites with high and very high VVP values changes dramatically for reserve networks designed for current and least change (B1) climate scenarios when under more severe A1B and A2 conditions. We conclude that introducing additional complexity and realism into national or boreal-wide conservation assessments, that include, for example, elements of climate change, will increase the total area and cost of a reserve network. Moreover, reserve networks designed for current or least change (B1) climate scenarios will likely not achieve conservation targets when faced with more severe conditions, and will require additional sites. The adaptive strategies presented are well suited for a boreal conservation assessment and may improve long-term effectiveness of biodiversity conservation objectives.","[Powers, Ryan P.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 165 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Coops, Nicholas C.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Resources Management, IRSS, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Tulloch, Vivitskaia J.] Univ Queensland, Austrailian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Gergel, Sarah E.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, Landscape Ecol Lab, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Nelson, Trisalyn A.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ USA; [Wulder, Michael A.] Nat Resources Canada, Pacific Forestry Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, Victoria, BC, Canada",Yale University; University of British Columbia; University of Queensland; University of British Columbia; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service,"Powers, RP (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 165 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",ryan.powers@yale.edu,"Wulder, Michael A/J-5597-2016; Coops, Nicholas/J-1543-2012; Coops, Nicholas/L-3652-2019; Tulloch, Vivitskaia/G-1336-2013; Tulloch, Vivitskaia/GNH-4554-2022","Wulder, Michael A/0000-0002-6942-1896; Coops, Nicholas/0000-0002-0151-9037; Coops, Nicholas/0000-0002-0151-9037; Tulloch, Vivitskaia/0000-0002-7673-3716; Nelson, Trisalyn/0000-0003-2537-6971","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Ivey Foundation; Nature Conservancy of Canada, Canadian Space Agency (CSA); Government Related Initiatives Program (GRIP); Canadian Forest Service (CFS); Pacific Forestry Centre (PFC); University of British Columbia (UBC)","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Ivey Foundation; Nature Conservancy of Canada, Canadian Space Agency (CSA); Government Related Initiatives Program (GRIP)(Canadian Space Agency); Canadian Forest Service (CFS)(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service); Pacific Forestry Centre (PFC); University of British Columbia (UBC)","This research was undertaken as part of the 'BioSpace: Biodiversity monitoring with Earth Observation data' project jointly funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Ivey Foundation, the Nature Conservancy of Canada, Canadian Space Agency (CSA), Government Related Initiatives Program (GRIP), Canadian Forest Service (CFS), Pacific Forestry Centre (PFC) and the University of British Columbia (UBC).",,57,6,6,3,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",,2056-3485,,REMOTE SENS ECOL CON,Remote Sens.

This has been accompanied by a variety of climate hazards such as flooding and more frequent storms, initiating adaptation planning and decision-making on multiple governance levels. A spatial understanding of climate risk and its associations with socioeconomic vulnerabilities raises essential questions about the underlying roots of such associations and can help local govern-ments prioritize social vulnerabilities in their adaptation efforts. Using coastal flooding as a climate stressor in this region, this paper conducts analyses that strive to help policymakers more effectively utilize social vulnerability in adaptation planning. The analysis reveals significant associations between climate risk, represented by flood risk, and social vulnerability measures such as poverty, access to infrastructure, education, and housing in certain parts of coastal Vir-ginia. The paper then discusses how associations between vulnerability and climate risk in the region could influence policymaking on the local and state level. This research presents several empirical relationships that raise important questions regarding the drivers of social equity in the face of climate adaptation in coastal Virginia. The methodology developed in this study may be modified to assess social equity in climate adaptation in other coastal communities in the United States and possibly other countries. Such modification can help to illuminate the associations between location-specific social vulnerabilities, such as social safety net policies, and climate risks.","[Eghdami, Sadegh; Louis, Garrick] Univ Virginia, Dept Engn Syst & Environm, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Scheld, Andrew M.] Virginia Inst Marine Sci VIMS, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA",University of Virginia,"Eghdami, S (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Engn Syst & Environm, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",me2ts@virginia.edu,,,,,,,83,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

Increasingly, these decisions include instream flow requirements (IFRs) below dams for river ecosystem management. However, WYTs are typically based on assumptions of stationarity, and are thus rendered less meaningful with climate change. Hydrologic alteration resulting from climate change means that a WYT-based IFR scheme using stationary historical observations might inadvertently result in long-term river management outcomes inconsistent with original water management goals. This study assesses the management implications of assuming hydrologic nonstationarity in a WYT-based IFR scheme in California's upper Yuba River and demonstrates a rolling period of record as a climate adaptation strategy. The existing, nonadaptive water management scheme leads to vastly different possible water allocation outcomes than originally planned for. Results indicate that water year types, if regularly updated, can help maintain historical instream flow distributions. However, gains toward maintaining desired IFRs are obfuscated by future increases in unmanaged reservoir spill. These findings indicate that hydroclimatic uncertainty can partially be accounted for with simple modifications to existing operating rules for reservoirs, though other, risk-based management approaches are also likely needed.

Emphasis on local inclusion is increasing, yet participatory approaches often fall short of facilitating meaningful engagement of diverse forms of knowledge. A central challenge is the lack of a comprehensive and comparative understanding of the social-ecological knowledge that various stakeholders use to inform adaptation decisions. We employed cultural consensus analysis to quantitatively measure and compare social-ecological knowledge within and across three stakeholder groups: government employees, researchers, and local residents in rural coastal Maryland. The results show that 1) local residents placed more emphasis on addressing socioeconomic and cultural changes than researchers and government employees, and 2) that the greatest variation in social-ecological knowledge was found among local residents. These insights yielded by cultural consensus analysis are beneficial for facilitating more inclusive adaptation planning for resilient social-ecological systems.","[Hesed, Christine D.

Biden administration policy in relation to the given transition, i.e. the shift from the use of fossil fuels in the economy to renewable energy sources. In the context of the B. Obama and D. Trump administrations' attitudes to the problem of climate change, the authors study achievements and failures o the current American leadership on this path. Particular attention is paid to the obstacles faced by the Biden administration. Among them are the inability to consistently finance environmental initiatives through Congress, inconsistency in the implementation of the Green Course within the country, the lack of readiness of key emission countries (China, India) to actively participate in achieving the Paris climate goals, etc. In addition, the contradictions within the Democratic Party on the issue of environmental policy between the centrists and supporters of the Green New Deal program are analyzed, which consist in different stances on the role of a state in the Green Transit, importance of social measures, main spheres for investments, the role of America in global transit, etc. It is also pointed to the fierce opposition to the administration's climate policy from the Republican Party. Its conservative faction is convinced that the scale, pace and role of a man in the crisis are artificially inflated by the Democrats, so there is no need to rush and resort to semi-military methods of centralized resource mobilization. Market forces, which simply must not be hindered, will cope much more successfully with the problem of the impact of warming on humans. The neoconservative group believes that the resources of humanity should be directed not to the fight against greenhouse emissions, but to economic development, which will allow the country and civilization to adapt to climate changes. It is concluded that there is a potential possibility of reaching a bipartisan consensus on climate change, but at this stage, under pressure from radical groups, this possibility seems unlikely. Therefore, in the coming years, it is questionable that the Biden administration will be able to actively promote its domestic climate agenda and new model of globalization.","[Golub, Yurii G.; Shenin, Sergei Yu] Saratov NG Chernyshevskii State Univ, Dept Int Relat & Russian Foreign Policy, 83 Astrakhanskaya Str, Saratov 410012, Russia",Saratov State University,"Golub, YG (corresponding author), Saratov NG Chernyshevskii State Univ, Dept Int Relat & Russian Foreign Policy, 83 Astrakhanskaya Str, Saratov 410012, Russia.",goloub@sgu.ru; shenins@yahoo.com,,"Golub, Yury/0000-0001-9819-7494",,,,,33,0,0,2,3,NAUKA PUBLISHING HOUSE,MOSCOW,"PROFSOYUZNAYA UL 90, MOSCOW, 117864, RUSSIA",0131-2227,,,MIROVAYA EKON MEZHD,Mirovaya Ekon.

Therefore, in order to understand the spatial-temporal variations and controlling mechanisms of global forest carbon (C) storage under future climate change, an improved individual-based forest ecosystem carbon budget model and remote sensing outputs in this study were applied to investigate the spatial-temporal dynamics of global forest (vegetation+soil) C storage in the future climate change scenario. The results showed that in the future RCP4.5 (representative concentration pathways) climate scenario, the total C storage per unit area per year in vegetation and soil of the global forest ecosystem showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing from 2006 to 2100, with an average of 22.77 kg C m(-2)year(-1). However, the evolution trends of C storage changes in vegetation and soil were different. Moreover, the average soil C storage per unit area per year was 2.87 times higher than the average vegetation C storage. The impact of climate change on total C storage in vegetation and soil of the global forest ecosystems was positive, showing an obvious increase during 2006-2100. The total C storage varied significantly in spatial distribution. Spatially, the vegetation C storage and the soil organic C storage were projected to decrease significantly in most parts of South America and southern Africa in the Southern Hemisphere and increase in eastern North America, western Asia, and most areas of Europe in the Northern Hemisphere. Especially in the middle and high latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere, the total forest C stock was projected to increase by 30-90% from 2046 to 2100. In the future, in these areas where forest C reserves were predicted to be reduced, it was suggested to increase afforestation, prohibit deforestation, and develop projects to increase forest C. Sustainable forest managements also offered opportunities for immediate mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Our findings provided not only a projection of C storage of global forest ecosystem responses to future climate change but also a useful methodology for estimating forest C storage at global levels.","[Zhao, Junfang] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, 46 Zhongguancun Nandajie, Beijing 10081, Peoples R China; [Ma, Jianyong] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Plant Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Ma, Jianyong] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res Atmospher Environm Re, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Hou, Meiting] China Meteorol Adm, Training Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Li, Sen] Natl Meteorol Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Huazhong Agricultural University; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; China Meteorological Administration,"Zhao, JF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, 46 Zhongguancun Nandajie, Beijing 10081, Peoples R China.",zhaojfcams@163.com,,,,,,,46,6,7,16,69,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

This has made carbon reduction a global concern. Previous studies have provided a limited understanding of carbon budgets because they have used top-down data on a single spatial or temporal scale. In this study, urban spatial and statistical data for metropolitan Tainan in southwestern Taiwan are used to explore inside and outside of the CO2 system of the city and estimate the amount of CO2 emissions from road traffic, the use of electricity and gas in buildings, and the amount of CO2 absorbed by green spaces and water bodies within the system. Innovative annual and monthly carbon budget maps composed of 200 x 200-m grids are developed for the city through a geographic information system (GIS). An analysis of the highly detailed maps yields the following findings: First, CO2 emissions are concentrated in over-urbanized areas, where the population density is higher than 5000 people/km(2). Buildings account for the majority of carbon dioxide emissions (54%) and produced 11% more carbon dioxide in summer than in winter (owing to air-conditioning usage). Second, road traffic is the main source of CO2 emissions for under-urbanized areas (87%), and emissions from this source exhibit insignificant seasonal variation. On the basis of these findings, the carbon budgets of four different over-urbanized areas are formulated and presented on 50 x 50-m grids. The results suggest that green spaces in these areas absorb limited amounts of carbon dioxide. Therefore, this study assesses the annual and monthly carbon-reduction potential of rooftops equipped with solar panels occupying 30% of their area. The annual carbon-reduction potential for the four areas was 4.5-31.1 kg CO2 m(-2) yr(-1), and the solar energy replacement rate is higher in winter than in summer. In summary, this study presents carbonbudgets in high-resolution grids, quantifies the carbon-reduction potential of rooftops with solar panels, and proposes a reduction strategy for reducing CO2 emissions from urban activities to improve the sustainability of urban areas and their environs and inform urban planning and climate change adaptation.

However, this region has largely escaped the attention of studies investigating potential impacts of future climate change on the marine environment. Understanding how marine ecosystems in coastal East Africa may respond to various climatic stressors is vital for the development of conservation and other ocean management policies that can help to adapt to climate change impacts on natural and associated human systems. Here, we use a high-resolution (1/4 degrees) ocean model, run under a high emission scenario (RCP 8.5) until the end of the 21st century, to identify key regionally important climate change stressors over the East African Coastal Current (EACC) that flows along the coasts of Kenya and Tanzania. We also discuss these stressors in the context of projections from lower resolution CMIP5 models. Our results indicate that the main drivers of dynamics and the associated ecosystem response in the TWIO are different between the two monsoon seasons. Our high resolution model projects weakening of the Northeast monsoon (December-February) winds and slight strengthening of the Southeast monsoon (May-September) winds throughout the course of the 21st century, consistent with CMIP5 models. The projected shallower mixed layers and weaker upwelling during the Northeast Monsoon considerably reduce the availability of surface nutrients and primary production. Meanwhile, primary production during the Southeast monsoon is projected to be relatively stable until the end of the century. In parallel, a widespread warming of up to 5 degrees C is projected year-round with extreme events such as marine heatwaves becoming more intense and prolonged, with the first year-long event projected to occur as early as the 2030s. This extreme warming will have significant consequences for both marine ecosystems and the coastal populations dependent on these marine resources. These region-specific stressors highlight the importance of dynamic ocean features such as the upwelling systems associated with key ocean currents. This indicates the need to develop and implement a regional system that monitors the anomalous behaviour of such regionally important features. Additionally, this study draws attention to the importance of investment in decadal prediction methods, including high resolution modelling, that can provide information at time and space scales that are more directly relevant to regional management and policy making.","[Jacobs, Z.

Most of the farming communities in this area have failed to produce sufficient food and have become dependent on foreign food donations. Yet, the impact, vulnerability and adaptive capacity of the community to climate change in the above-mentioned mountain areas are not well documented. This paper examined the temporal temperature and rainfall trends, and the communities' vulnerability to climate change as well as their adaptive capacities to the changing climate to fill the existing information gaps regarding issues called forth in the Semien Mountains and other highland environments. Data were gathered using questionnaires, interviews, focus group discussions and field observations. Information from meteorological recordings was also collected for this study. The collected data were analyzed using standardized precipitation index, livelihood vulnerability index, bi-logit model and descriptive statistics. The results confirmed highest climatic variability manifested in rainfall and temperature changes. Rainfall decreased by a total of 573.46 mm (by approximate to 16.38 mm per year on average) from 1979 to 2013. Mean annual temperature increased from 18.54 degrees C in 1979 to 20 degrees C in 2013. In this light, majority of the respondents (85%) reported facing climatic hazards. About 70% of them perceive that climate change has decreased land productivity and numerous others (74%) felt its future implications on farmlands. Recurrent crop and animal diseases were indicated by 95.21 and 93.41% of the sampled households, respectively. These climate change-induced incidents were exacerbated by lower adaptive capacities and limited institutional services. Livestock rearing, livelihood diversification, stone bund building, tree planting, organic fertilizer application, selling home articles, soil bund construction, rainwater harvesting, utilizing synthetic fertilizers and preparing hand-dug wells were important adaptive strategies used and ranked 1-10, respectively, by the studied households. Extension services, family size, farm income, access to training and livestock ownership found influential during the use of composting, terracing and tree planting to reduce the negative impact of climate change. Farmer-to-farmer extension appeared to significantly reduce composting, terrace building and tree planting at p < 0.01 level. This calls for further social and cultural related studies to explore the reasons. Climate change adaptation strategies should thus focus on enhancing households' access to key livelihood assets such as education (training), family size, farm income, extension service, and livestock ownership opportunities.","[Yohannes, Zigiju] Univ Gondar, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Gondar, Ethiopia; [Teshome, Menberu] Debre Tabor Univ, Dept Geog & Environm studies, POB 272, Debre Tabor, Ethiopia; [Belay, Mehretie] Bahir Dar Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, POB 79, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia",University of Gondar; Bahir Dar University,"Teshome, M (corresponding author), Debre Tabor Univ, Dept Geog & Environm studies, POB 272, Debre Tabor, Ethiopia.",zigiju.yohannes@gmail.com; menberuteshome@gmail.com; belaymehrete@yahoo.com,,,,,,,53,7,7,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

The sub-coastal areas and flood plains of the Greater Pamba Basin have provided palaeorecords of peat indicating that the deposits are essentially formed within freshwater. The combination of factors like stabilized sea level and its subsequent fall since the Middle Holocene, topographic relief and climatic conditions led to rapid peat accumulation across the coastal lowlands. The high rainfall and massive floods coupled with a rising sea level must have inundated > 75% of the coastal plain land converting it into a veritable lagoon-lake system that eventually led to abrupt termination of the forest ecosystem and also converted the floodplains into peatland where accumulation of peat almost to 2.0-3.0 m thickness in coastal lowlands and river basins during the shorter interval in the Middle Holocene. Vast areas of the coastal plains of Kerala have been converted into carbon rich peatland during the Middle Holocene and transforming the entire coastal stretch and associated landforms as one of the relatively youngest peatlands in the extreme southern tip of India. Unlike the uninterrupted formation of peatlands of considerable extent during the Holocene in Southeast Asia, the south Peninsular Indian region has restricted and short intervals of peatlands in the floodplains and coastal lowlands. Such a scenario is attributed to the topographic relief of the terrain and the prevailing hydrological regimes and environmental conditions as a consequence of monsoon variability since Middle Holocene in SW India. Considering the tropical coastal lowlands and associated peatlands are excellent repositories of carbon, they are very important for regional carbon cycling and habitat diversity. The alarming rate of land modification and development is destabilizing these carbon pools resulting in large scale carbon emissions to the atmosphere and loss of low-latitude peat palaeorecords. Therefore, these palaeorecords are to be conserved and addressed for better understanding and utilizing the carbon pool for effective climate change adaptation. This communication is the first attempt of addressing the peat formation and peatland development during the Holocene from the tropical region of Peninsular India.","[Kumaran, Navnith K.

Using game theory and the computable general equilibrium approach, it proposes a compromise between the two countries for agricultural protection, to reduce possible divergences and confrontations. The findings show that game results differ among the three countries as per interest indexes. Compared to full tariff exemption, an FTA with agricultural protection not only stimulates economic growth in the three countries but also reduces Japan and South Korea's agricultural concerns and impact on employment. We also evaluate the impacts of the trilateral FTA on manufacturing and services industries. The results show that China will increase imports of energy-intensive products from Japan and South Korea, which may reduce domestic output and generate environmental benefits. Implementing the trilateral FTA with agricultural protection may reduce carbon emission in Northeast Asia by 6.53 million tons. This study can promote economic integration in Northeast Asia and coping with climate change.

Agricultural producers are likely to be adversely affected by changes in higher mean temperatures, more frequent extreme climatic events, and an increase in inter-annual weather variability, with implications for established management practices. While probabilities of future change in key climatic variables become more refined, significant uncertainties remain, complicating efforts at adaptation action on the ground. Adaptation pathways planning allows stakeholders to consider a range of possible futures, identify and evaluate adaptation options, and sequence them over time. The aim is to have a robust plan that is flexible enough to deliver desired outcomes regardless of how the future unfolds. We developed and applied a pathways approach to support regional adaptation planning in Hawke's Bay, New Zealand, a premier food- and wine-producing region, where changing land use, competition for freshwater, and climate change, are presenting challenges to agricultural producers and rural communities. Working with a range of stakeholders from local government, community and the region's diverse agricultural sectors, comparative case study analysis in two catchments is used to identify values relating to productive landscapes, likely impacts of climate change and potential adaptation options at the local level. Actions for key areas of decision making were evaluated and sequenced over time, providing the basis for a regional adaptation pathway. The results highlight the complex interaction between climatic and non-climatic drivers of change at the local and regional scale, and the need to closely consider trade-offs and synergies in any adaptations. With adaptation rapidly emerging as a priority for policy-making and practice, the results can help inform and empower stakeholders to implement actions towards climate adapted futures, and demonstrate the utility of pathways approaches for local- and regional planning.","[Cradock-Henry, Nicholas A.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Landscape Policy & Governance, Lincoln, New Zealand; [Blackett, Paula] Natl Inst Water & Atmosphere, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Hall, Madeline] Hawkes Bay Reg Council, Napier, New Zealand; [Johnstone, Paul] Plant & Food Res, Hastings, New Zealand; [Teixeira, Edmar] Plant & Food Res, Lincoln, New Zealand; [Wreford, Anita] Lincoln Univ, AERU, Lincoln, New Zealand",Landcare Research - New Zealand; National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand; New Zealand Institute for Plant & Food Research Ltd; Lincoln University - New Zealand,"Cradock-Henry, NA (corresponding author), Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Landscape Policy & Governance, Lincoln, New Zealand.",cradockhenryn@landcareresearch.co.nz; Paula.Blackett@niwa.co.nz; madeline.hall@hbrc.govt.nz; Paul.johnstone@plantandfood.co.nz; edmar.teixeira@plantandfood.co.nz; Anita.Wreford@lincoln.ac.nz,"Wreford, Anita/Y-1996-2018","Wreford, Anita/0000-0002-9546-4080; Cradock-Henry, Nicholas/0000-0002-4409-9976",New Zealand's Ministry for Primary Industries' Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change fund [LC3548]; Hawke's Bay Regional Council (HBRC); Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund,New Zealand's Ministry for Primary Industries' Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change fund; Hawke's Bay Regional Council (HBRC); Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund(Royal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ)),"This work was supported by New Zealand's Ministry for Primary Industries' Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change fund, Contract LC3548 and Hawke's Bay Regional Council (HBRC); author NCH was supported by the Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund.

A prerequisite is to ensure that crop models can simulate a range of agrohydrological processes in such agrosystems. The current study deepened the evaluation of the AquaCrop model by conducting a multicriteria evaluation (canopy cover CC, dry aboveground biomass AGB, actual evapotranspiration ETa, runoff R, soil water content SWC) for a range of crop and soil combinations, and for contrasted hydroclimatic years in northeastern Tunisia. The data were collected in the Kamech catchment (OMERE Observatory) during nine measurement campaigns on predominant soils and crops. AquaCrop simulations were based on field observations and parameters from the literature. AquaCrop could simulate plant dynamics and water fluxes for contrasted hydroclimatic years, with a slight dependence on soil class and a significant dependence on crop type. Model simulations were of moderate quality for CC (R-2 of 0.45, RMSE of 0.24 on average) and of acceptable quality for AGB (R-2 of 0.81, RMSE of 0.85 ton ha(-1) on average). AquaCrop acceptably simulated water transfer across the soil-plant continuum (R-2 of 0.62, RMSE of 0.77 mm day(-1) on average for ETa; R-2 of 0.68, RMSE of 0.75 mm day(-1) on average for R; R-2 of 0.86, RMSE of 27.4 mm on average for SWC). The model performances were satisfactory for most cases, with p values larger than 5 % for the Student's t test on linear regressions of validation. Our results were similar to those reported in previous studies over flat terrain, including delayed senescence by model simulations with subsequent overestimation of CC and AGB observations. Additionally, soil cracks likely altered the AquaCrop ability to simulate runoff. Despite these limitations, our results support the application of AquaCrop to evaluate water productivity in hilly agrosystems.","[Dhouib, M.] Univ Montpellier, Inst Agro Montpellier UMR LISAH, Inst Agro Montpellier, AgroParisTech,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Zitouna-Chebbi, R.; Mekki, I] Univ Carthage, INRGREF, Tunis, Tunisia; [Prevot, L.; Molenat, J.] Univ Montpellier, Inst Agro Montpellier, AgroParisTech, INRAE,IRD,INRAE UMR LISAH, Montpellier, France; [Jacob, F.] Univ Montpellier, Agro Montpellier Inst, AgroParisTech, INRAE,IRD UMR LISAH,IRD, Montpellier, France",AgroParisTech; Institut Agro; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Universite de Carthage; AgroParisTech; INRAE; Institut Agro; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; AgroParisTech; INRAE; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier,"Dhouib, M (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, Inst Agro Montpellier UMR LISAH, Inst Agro Montpellier, AgroParisTech,IRD, Montpellier, France.",mariemdhouib93@gmail.com,"Mekki, Insaf/HMV-6192-2023; Prevot, Laurent/A-5929-2011; Jacob, Frederic P/A-5946-2011","Prevot, Laurent/0000-0002-4627-4379; Jacob, Frederic P/0000-0002-2491-3096; Molenat, Jerome/0000-0002-5957-0927",Tunisian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MESRS); French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD),Tunisian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MESRS); French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD),"The first author benefited from funding provided by the Tunisian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MESRS) and the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD) to carry out her Ph.D. research.

The increases of SOC storage and reliable estimation of its potential are essential for evaluating the soil sustainability and climate change adaptation under intensive cultivation. In this work, a data-driven approach combining mixture clustering and Random Forest models was proposed to estimate the SOC storage potential of cropland topsoil and its controlling factors in East China. The carbon landscapes systems (CLSs) were delineated using a mixture clustering model by combining the climatic condition, soil properties, cropping systems, and soil management practices. The SOC storage potentials with 95 % confidence intervals at 250 m spatial resolution were estimated as the difference between the current SOC stock and empirically maximum SOC stock at basic (75 %), intermediate (85 %), and ambitious (95 %) expectation objectives for each CLS. The SOC storage potential increased with the increasing of expectation objective settings, with the averaged levels of 13.1, 20.8, and 35.5 t C ha(-1) at 75 %, 85 %, and 95 % percentile objectives, respectively. The variable importance from Random Forest indicated that the cropping systems and soil management practices were the unignorable factors controlling the SOC storage potential beyond the climatic conditions and soil properties. Moreover, the shifts of human-induced controlling factors, e.g., cropping systems, also indicated their capability of SOC sequestration potential for partly achieving the 4p1000 initiative (annual growth rate of 0.4 % carbon stocks in the first 30 cm of topsoil). The currently optimal soil management practices for achieving the SOC sequestration potential was the combination of rice-based cropping systems, straw return, and organic fertilizer applied. The data-driven approach coupling with CLSs improved our understanding of the controlling factors on SOC storage potential at regional level with homogenous conditions, enabling evidence-based decision making in promoting carbon sequestration by adopting locally feasible soil management practices.","[Ma, Wanzhu; Ren, Zhouqiao; Chen, Xiaojia; Lv, Xiaonan; Deng, Xunfei] Zhejiang Acad Agr Sci, Inst Digital Agr, Hangzhou 310021, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ma, Wanzhu; Ren, Zhouqiao; Lv, Xiaonan; Deng, Xunfei] Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Key Lab Informat Traceabil Agr Prod, Hangzhou 310021, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Yu] Sichuan Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Yu] Sichuan Univ Yibin Pk, Yibin Inst Ind Technol, Yibin 644000, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Songchao] Natl Res Inst Agr Food & Environm INRAE, Unite InfoSol, F-45075 Orleans, France; [Qin, Fangjin] Stn Agr Technol Extens Ningbo City, Ningbo 315012, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Lu, Ruohui] Adm Stn Cultivated Land Qual & Fertilizer Zhejian, Hangzhou 310029, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Sichuan University; INRAE,"Deng, XF (corresponding author), Zhejiang Acad Agr Sci, Inst Digital Agr, Hangzhou 310021, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",dengxf@zaas.ac.cn,"Chen, Songchao/S-7982-2019","Chen, Songchao/0000-0003-1245-0482; deng, xunfei/0000-0001-7306-6199","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0200802, 2018YFD0200502]; Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province, China [2020C02023]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province, China","We are grateful to Junfang Ding, Jianxia Liang, Zhen Tong,Gengmiao Zhang, and other colleagues for their assistance in document collecting, field sampling, and laboratory analyses.

However, many of these DSTs are still not fully utilized. Understanding the use of DSTs can help identify strategies to promote their usage to more end-users. This study surveyed farmers (n = 2,633) and advisors (n = 2,719) across 12 states in the Midwest to draw comparisons on their usage of DSTs and factors influencing the usage. The advisors are more likely to take advantage of free and publicly available sources than farmers. Advisors are also more likely to agree on the usefulness of DSTs, feel social pressure to use DSTs, be concerned and perceive risks from variable weather, believe in climate change, and show positive attitudes towards climate change adaptation than farmers. Concerns about weather or climate, descriptive social norms, greater farm size, and general propensity to adopt a new technology are positively associated with higher adoption rate of DSTs for both farmers and advisors. Higher level of perceived behavioral control to deal with weather-related risks, injunctive social norms, gender (male), and age are positively associated with higher adoption rate of DSTs for only advisors. Positive adaptation attitude towards climate change and higher education level are positively associated with higher adoption rate of DSTs for only farmers. Unlike advisors, age is negatively associated with higher adoption rate of DSTs for farmers. Implications of our findings include DST educators leveraging social networks and reinforcing social norms to promote usage among current non-users, building up both farmers' and advisors' confidence and knowledge in using DSTs, understanding the role of advisors as change agents to promote DST usage among farmers, and connecting networks of innovators and early adopters. With more and more DSTs developed, future scholarship can draw upon our findings to understand how to encourage DSTs adoption among current non-users and extend to other regions.","[Lu, Junyu] Arizona State Univ, Sch Community Resources & Dev, 411 N Cent Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [Singh, Ajay S.] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Environm Studies, 6000 J St, Sacramento, CA 95818 USA; [Koundinya, Vikram] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Human Ecol & UC Cooperat Extens, 301 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Ranjan, Pranay; Getson, Jackie M.; Prokopy, Linda S.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, 195 Marsteller St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Haigh, Tonya] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, 3310 Holdrege St, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Klink, Jenna] Univ Wisconsin, Div Extens, Off Program Support Serv, 432 N Lake St, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix; California State University System; California State University Sacramento; University of California System; University of California Davis; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Prokopy, LS (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, 195 Marsteller St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",Junyu.Lu@asu.edu; singh@csus.edu; vkoundinya@ucdavis.edu; ranjanp@purdue.edu; thaigh2@unl.edu; jgetson@purdue.edu; jenna.klink@wisc.edu; lprokopy@purdue.edu,"Ranjan, Pranay/AAU-2260-2021","Singh, Ajay/0000-0002-5576-8178",Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2011-68002-30220],Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture,"This work is part of Useful to Usable (U2U): Transforming Climate Variability and Change Information for Cereal Crop Producers, and is supported by Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant no. 2011-68002-30220 from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

Adaptation of farming practices to mitigate adverse impacts of climate change on wetland water levels is a potential watershed management option. We chose a modeling approach (WETSIM 3.2) to examine the effects of changes in climate and watershed cover on the water levels of a semi-permanent wetland in eastern South Dakota. Land-use practices simulated were unmanaged grassland, grassland managed with moderately heavy grazing, and cultivated crops. Climate scenarios were developed by adjusting the historical climate in combinations of 2 degrees C and 4 degrees C air temperature and +/- 10% precipitation. For these climate change scenarios, simulations of land use that produced water levels equal to or greater than unmanaged grassland under historical climate were judged to have mitigative potential against a drier climate. Water levels in wetlands surrounded by managed grasslands were significantly greater than those surrounded by unmanaged grassland. Management reduced both the proportion of years the wetland went dry and the frequency of dry periods, producing the most dynamic vegetation cycle for this modeled wetland. Both cultivated crops and managed grassland achieved water levels that were equal or greater than unmanaged grassland under historical climate for the 2 degrees C rise in air temperature, and the 2 degrees C rise plus 10% increase in precipitation scenarios. Managed grassland also produced water levels that were equal or greater than unmanaged grassland under historical climate for the 4 degrees C rise plus 10% increase in precipitation scenario. Although these modeling results stand as hypotheses, they indicate that amelioration potential exists for a change in climate up to an increase of 2 degrees C or 4 degrees C with a concomitant 10% increase in precipitation. Few empirical data exist to verify the results of such land-use simulations; however, adaptation of farming practices is one possible mitigation avenue available for prairie wetlands.","[Voldseth, Richard A.; Johnson, W.

While these valuable datasets have proven to be powerful tools for studying the relationships between people and their environment, they also introduce unique oversights and forms of invisibility, which have the potential to become endemic in the climate adaptation literature. This is especially dangerous as it has the potential to introduce a double exposure where the individuals and groups most likely to be invisible to climate adaptation research using secondary datasets are also the most vulnerable to climate change. Building on significant literature on invisibility in survey data focused on hard-to-reach and under-sampled populations, we expand the idea of invisibility to all stages of the research process. We argue that invisibility goes beyond a need for more data. The production of invisibility is an active process in which vulnerable individuals and their experiences are made invisible during distinct phases of the research process and constitutes an injustice. We draw on examples from the specific subfield of environmental change and migration to show how projects using secondary data can produce novel forms of invisibility at each step of the project conception, design, and execution. In doing so, we hope to provide a framework for writing people, groups, and communities back into projects that use secondary data and help researchers and policymakers incorporate individuals into more equitable climate planning scenarios that leave no one behind.","[Borderon, Marion] Univ Wien, Vienna, Austria; [Best, Kelsea B.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Bailey, Karen] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Hopping, Doug L.] UNC Dept Geog, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Dove, Mackenzie] NCAR Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO USA; [de Blois, Chelsea L.

Recent research and practices have demonstrated that effective utilization of these natural resources in dry areas can improve agricultural productivity per unit area and per unit water applied. This paper focuses on the following three case studies as examples: (1) low productivity soils affected by high levels of magnesium in soil solution and on the cation exchange complex; (2) degraded sandy soils under rainfed conditions characterized by low water-holding capacity, organic matter and clay content and (3) abandoned irrigated soils with elevated levels of salts inhibiting growth of income generating crops. The results of these studies demonstrate that application of calcium-supplying phosphogypsum to high-magnesium soils, addition of clays to light textured degraded soils and phytoremediation of abandoned salt-affected soils significantly improved productivity of these soils. Furthermore, under most circumstances, these interventions were economically viable, revealing that the efficient use of marginal-quality water and soil resources has the potential to improve livelihoods amid growing populations in dry areas while reversing the natural resource degradation trend. However, considerably more investment and policy-level interventions are needed to tackle soil degradation/remediation issues across both irrigated and dryland agricultural environments if the major challenge of producing enough food, forage and fibre is to be met.

There is a growing literature examining the psychological determinants of various climate adaptation strategies among smallholder farmers but little attention to how psychological factors vary across adaptation decisions and the underlying motivations for these decisions. We assess climate adaptation in terms of five risk management categories outlined by Agrawal (2009). Using a sample of farming households in Kenya (N = 494), we find that while 98% of smallholders believe that various dimensions of climate change pose a significant threat to their livelihood, these beliefs do not necessarily translate into climate actions. Results show that environmental concerns are not salient motivators for or against adaptation strategies, but food insecurity and household expenses are, suggesting a disconnect between climate beliefs and actions. Future research on decision-making related to climate adaptation within semi-arid agroecosystems should consider that while perceptions of climate change are important in shaping climate adaptive actions, they are not necessarily a salient motivator. Climate change is predicted to have significant negative impacts on food security but concerns about food security are what motivate farmers to adopt practices that will prepare them for climate change.","[Waldman, K.

As the impacts of these extremes are particularly prominent in urban agglomerations, cities face an urgent need to develop adaptation strategies. Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) provides helpful strategies that harness ecological processes in addition to technical interventions. EbA has been addressed in informal adaptation planning. Formal municipality planning, namely landscape planning, is supposed to include traditionally some EbA measures, although adaptation has not been their explicit focus. Our research aims to investigate how landscape plans incorporate climate-related extremes and EbA as well as to discuss the potential to enhance EbA uptake in formal planning. We conducted a document analysis of informal planning documents from 85 German cities and the analysis of formal landscape plans of 61 of these cities. The results suggest that city size does affect the extent of informal planning instruments and the comprehensiveness of formal landscape plans. Climate-related extremes and EbA measures have traditionally been part of landscape planning. Almost all landscape plans address heat stress, while climate change and heavy rain have been addressed less often, though more frequently since 2008. Greening of walls and roofs, on-site infiltration and water retention reveal significant potential for better integration in landscape plans. Landscape planning offers an entry point for effective climate adaptation through EbA in cities. Informal and formal planning instruments should be closely combined for robust, spatially explicit, legally binding implementation of EbA measures in the future.","[Schneider, Philipp; Walz, Ariane; Lipp, Torsten] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Albert, Christian] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Geog, Bochum, Germany",University of Potsdam; Ruhr University Bochum,"Schneider, P (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.",phschneider@uni-potsdam.de; awalz@uni-potsdam.de; christian.albert@rub.de; tlipp@uni-potsdam.de,"Albert, Christian/A-1604-2012","Albert, Christian/0000-0002-2591-4779","Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany [01LR1709A1-E]","Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","This research was conducted in the context of one project: ExTrass Urbane Resilienz gegenuber extremen Wetterereignissen -Typologien lund Transfer von Anpassungsstrategien in kleinen Gro ss stadten und Mittelstadten; this project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany (grant number 01LR1709A1-E).",,66,2,2,1,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,OCT,2021,109,,,,,,,,105722,10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105722,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105722,,,11,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UZ7RY,,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000702400100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two rules link animal coloration with climate: Gloger's rule (darker coloration where wet and warm), and Bogert's rule (darker coloration where cold). Whereas Gloger's rule was proposed for endotherms, and Bogert's rule for ectotherms, both rules may apply more broadly, despite their seemingly opposing effects. Here, we test this contradiction on a global scale across passerine birds. Consistent with Gloger's rule, birds were darker in wetter areas and, following Bogert's rule, lighter where warm, although birds became lighter again at very low temperatures. Rainfall and temperature had antagonistic or additive effects depending on their pattern of covariation, and this predicted whether birds followed the rules. We integrate both rules into a general framework to explain heterogeneity in climatic effects on coloration, which has implications to understand patterns of diversification, climatic adaptation and climate change impacts.","[Delhey, Kaspar] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Dale, James] Massey Univ, Inst Nat & Math Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Valcu, Mihai; Kempenaers, Bart] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Seewiesen, Germany",Monash University; Massey University; Max Planck Society,"Delhey, K (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",kaspardelhey@gmail.com,"Delhey, Kaspar/AAZ-5362-2020; Valcu, Mihai/AAX-8842-2021","Delhey, Kaspar/0000-0001-5190-5406; Valcu, Mihai/0000-0002-6907-7802; Kempenaers, Bart/0000-0002-7505-5458",Royal Society of New Zealand [15-MAU-136],Royal Society of New Zealand(Royal Society of New Zealand),"We thank three anonymous reviewers for constructive criticism that helped improve the manuscript, in particular the suggestion to explore non-linear climatic effects, and Alex McQueen for sharing data on nuptial moult.

Our results show that despite the increasingly active role of women in managing water during the drought, they are excluded from community-level decision-making about water.

Local, regional, state, and federal planning and regulation should begin to address how to adapt to these changes. Purpose: This article presents a policy synthesis of adaptation planning issues, using California as a case study. We examine the institutional and regulatory challenges and tradeoffs that climate change poses in six particularly vulnerable areas: water resources, electricity, coastal resources, air quality, public health, and ecosystem resources. We discuss obstacles to adaptation planning and successes overcoming these barriers, and suggest how planning can incorporate adaptation. Methods: This article presents a policy synthesis of adaptation planning issues, drawing on our recent research on California's experience and related literature. We summarize the results of six studies that draw on quantitative and qualitative information gathered through surveys, interviews, and literature review. Results and conclusions: Planners should use forward-looking climate data that include higher water and air temperatures, sea-level rise, and increased numbers of extreme events like heat waves, floods, and wildfires when making decisions about future development, infrastructure investments, open-space protection, and disaster preparedness. Climate change will exacerbate conflicts between goals for economic development, habitat protection, and public safety, requiring stronger interagency coordination and new laws and regulations. Takeaway for practice: Local and regional planners can help society adapt to a changing climate by using the best available science, deciding on goals and early actions, locating relevant partners, identifying and eliminating regulatory barriers, and encouraging the introduction of new state mandates and guidelines.

St. Paul, a remote island located in the Bering Sea, Alaska, and home to similar to 450 Unangan, or Aleut, residents, is experiencing relatively new erosion and associated flooding issues. This study aimed to inform St. Paul's erosion monitoring and climate adaptation strategies by documenting community perceptions of coastal erosion as an ecological and social threat within a broader context of multiple established climate stressors. We interviewed 21 residents to answer: (1) what are the community's perceptions of erosion on St. Paul in the context of the island's other environmental concerns?; (2) do current perceptions of erosion affect how local governing and management entities address erosion impacts?; and (3) how does erosion relate to and impact Unangan cultural traditions and heritage? Residents identified six locations of primary concern, owing to how erosion of those areas impact their culture, subsistence practices, and sense of place. We suggest methods in which local entities can better support proactive climate adaptation and mitigation measures and utilize resources for community-driven adaption planning. By documenting perspectives in Indigenous communities on emergent climate impacts, as well as perceptions of adaptation planning and implementation, it can establish the foundation for more collaborative, culturally relevant, and successful community-driven climate adaptation planning.","[Tran, Jessica; Divine, Lauren M.] Ecosystem Conservat Off, Aleut Community St Paul Isl, 2050 Venia Minor Rd,Box 86, St Paul, AK 99660 USA; [Tran, Jessica] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 100 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Heffner, Leanna R.] Northwest Boreal Partnership, 1227W 9th Ave 300, Anchorage, AK 99501 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Tran, J (corresponding author), Ecosystem Conservat Off, Aleut Community St Paul Isl, 2050 Venia Minor Rd,Box 86, St Paul, AK 99660 USA.;Tran, J (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 100 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",jessica.tran@alumni.stonybrook.edu,,"Tran, Jessica/0000-0002-8751-8173",Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program at Northern Arizona University; Aleut Community of St. Paul Island Tribal Government,Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program at Northern Arizona University; Aleut Community of St. Paul Island Tribal Government,This study was funded by the Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program at Northern Arizona University and the Aleut Community of St. Paul Island Tribal Government.,,96,5,5,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0364-152X,1432-1009,,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

A number of reviews have identified this general issue in multiple nations and jurisdictions. In Australia, it is argued here that adaptation of the coastal built environment is operating at two speeds: the two-speed adaptation economy. Large civil assets and facilities in Australia now mostly have adaptation plans and strategies in place; although progress in actual on-the-ground implementation is variable in some cases. By contrast, adaptation of coastal communities and settlements continues at a very slow pace with very few specific adaptation measures being implemented that were not already being implemented as business as usual for flood or erosion management.

A key outcome of the thinking presented here is the reinforcement of the result that adaptation of coastal communities is not a challenge of relocating buildings, but rather a challenge of incentivising and supporting communities to act.","[Gibbs, Mark T.] Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Future Environm, George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Gibbs, MT (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Future Environm, George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",Mt.gibbs@qut.edu.au,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,,,,,50,7,7,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,JUN 1,2020,190,,,,,,,,105150,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105150,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105150,,,5,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Oceanography; Water Resources,LG7HU,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000528268100001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Duus-Otterstrom, G; Jagers, SC",,,,"Duus-Otterstrom, Goran; Jagers, Sverker C.",,,Identifying burdens of coping with climate change: A typology of the duties of climate justice,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Adaptation; Burden-sharing; Climate change; Justice; Mitigation,EMISSIONS,"One of the central questions in climate change debates concerns fair burden-sharing, i.e. justice in the distribution of costs of undertaking climate-managing policies. In this paper it is argued that in order to distribute such costs justly, it is necessary to have a nuanced understanding of what types of burdens they represent. Climate managing policies are usually divided into responses that seek to reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (mitigation) and responses that seek to prevent harm arising from a changing climate (adaptation). Some have argued that there are normatively significant differences between mitigation and adaptation: that the two responses adhere to different logics and evoke different patterns of burden-sharing. This paper argues that the relevant distinction is instead between negative and positive climate duties, i.e. whether an agent has a duty to undertake climate-managing policies on account of the harm its excessive emissions are causing or simply on account of its ability to assist those in need. The paper offers a typology of the different mitigation and adaptation responses that can be sorted under the negative/positive distinctions. This way of conceptualizing the issue not only enables us to better address the burden-sharing question, offering a more nuanced understanding of the types of climate burdens that are ascribable to agents and pointing out the appropriate roles of contributory responsibility and ability. It also clarifies aspects of the climate negotiations, and explains why it matters whether adaptation finance transferred to vulnerable countries is portrayed as compensation for harmful emissions or simply as donor countries discharging their humanitarian duties.

However, actual cropping systems are characterized by a succession of distinct crop cycles that are sometimes interspersed with long periods of bare soil. Sequential cropping (also known as multiple or double cropping) is particularly common in tropical regions, where the crop seasons are largely dictated by the main wet season. In this paper, we implement sequential cropping in a branch of the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) and demonstrate its use at sites in France and India. We simulate all the crops grown within a year in a field or location in a seamless way to understand how sequential cropping influences the surface fluxes of a landsurface model. We evaluate JULES with sequential cropping in Avignon, France, providing over 15 years of continuous flux observations (a point simulation). We apply JULES with sequential cropping to simulate the rice-wheat rotation in a regional 25 km resolution gridded simulation for the northern Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and four single-gridbox simulations across these states, where each simulation is a 25 km grid box. The inclusion of a secondary crop in JULES using the sequential cropping method presented does not change the crop growth or development of the primary crop. During the secondary crop growing period, the carbon and energy fluxes for Avignon and India are modified; they are largely unchanged for the primary crop growing period. For India, the inclusion of a secondary crop using this se- quential cropping method affects the available soil moisture in the top 1.0 m throughout the year, with larger fluctuations in sequential crops compared with single-crop simulations even outside the secondary crop growing period. JULES simulates sequential cropping in Avignon, the four India locations and the regional run, representing both crops within one growing season in each of the crop rotations presented. This development is a step forward in the ability of JULES to simulate crops in tropical regions where this cropping system is already prevalent. It also provides the opportunity to assess the potential for other regions to implement sequential cropping as an adaptation to climate change.","[Mathison, Camilla; Falloon, Pete; Williams, Karina; Wiltshire, Andy] Met Off Hadley Ctr, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter, Devon, England; [Mathison, Camilla; Challinor, Andrew J.; Deva, Chetan] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Garrigues, Sebastien] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England; [Garrigues, Sebastien; Moulin, Sophie] Avignon Univ, INRAE, Environm Mediterraneen & Modelisat AgroHydrosyst, 228 Route Aerodrome Domaine St Paul Site Agropar, Avignon, France; [Williams, Karina; Wiltshire, Andy] Univ Exeter, Global Syst Inst, Laver Bldg,North Pk Rd, Exeter, Devon, England",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; University of Leeds; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); Avignon Universite; INRAE; University of Exeter,"Mathison, C (corresponding author), Met Off Hadley Ctr, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter, Devon, England.;Mathison, C (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",camilla.mathison@metoffice.gov.uk,"Mathison, Camilla Therese/ABD-5210-2020; garrigues, sebastien/GZM-5933-2022","Mathison, Camilla Therese/0000-0002-6269-4605; Williams, Karina/0000-0002-1185-535X",European Union Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013 [603864]; Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme - BEIS; Defra,"European Union Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013; Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme - BEIS; Defra(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA))","The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013 under grant agreement no. 603864.

It therefore offers too small a sample of extreme low-flow events to properly explore the long-term evolution of their characteristics and associated impacts. To overcome this limit, this work makes use of a daily 140-year ensemble streamflow reanalysis for a reference network of 661 near-natural catchments in France. This reanalysis, called FYRE Hydro, is based on (1) the high-resolution surface reanalysis FYRE Climate combining the outputs of a probabilistic downscaling of the Twentieth Century Reanalysis and historical observations from the Meteo-France database, (2) a continuous hydrological modelling using this reanalysis as forcings over the whole period and (3) a data assimilation scheme using all available historical streamflow observations. This work makes use of tools defining spatio-temporal extreme low-flow events. Extreme low-flow events are first locally defined through the Sequent Peak Algorithm using a novel combination of a fixed threshold and a daily variable threshold. A dedicated spatial matching procedure is then established to identify spatio-temporal events across France. This procedure is furthermore adapted to the ensemble dataset to characterise in a probabilistic way unrecorded historical events at the national scale. Extreme low-flow events are described and compared in a spatially and temporally homogeneous way over more than 140 years on the whole set of 661 catchments. Many different results can be derived from this work, allowing to better understand and characterise extreme low-flow events. Local severity, duration, dynamics or spatial extent are obtained for each station. The spatial characterisation provides a national outlook of such extreme events, with the region of incidence, the percentage of the territory affected, or the temporal evolution. Applied to the last 140 years, results highlight well-known events like 1949 or 1989-1990, but also older and relatively forgotten events like the 1878 and 1893 events. These results contribute to improving our knowledge of historical events and provide a selection of benchmark events for climate change adaptation purposes.","[Caillouet, Laurie; Graff, Benjamin; Vannier, Olivier] Compagnie Natl Rhone, Lyon, France; [Vidal, Jean-Philippe; Sauquet, Eric; Devers, Alexandre; Lauvernet, Claire] INRAE, UR RiverLy, Villeurbanne, France",INRAE,"Caillouet, L (corresponding author), Compagnie Natl Rhone, Lyon, France.",l.caillouet@cnr.tm.fr,"Vidal, Jean-Philippe/E-6187-2010; Devers, Alexandre/S-9216-2017","Vidal, Jean-Philippe/0000-0002-3748-6150; Devers, Alexandre/0000-0001-6708-0066; Sauquet, Eric/0000-0001-9539-7730",,,,,18,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,2767-8490,,LHB,LHB,,2021,107,1,,,,,,,1914463,10.1080/00186368.2021.1914463,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00186368.2021.1914463,,,9,Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Water Resources,YU7BX,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000752194900009,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article assesses the readiness of California's public health institutions to cope with the changes that will accompany a changing climate and how they relate to strategies laid out in the state's Climate Adaptation Strategy. County-level health offices are the front line actors to preserve public health in the face of numerous threats, including climate change.

Yet, scholarship and practice continue to work with inadequate conceptualisations of how these inequalities are perpetuated. In this critical examination, we illustrate that the feminist literature on intersectional subjectivities provides pertinent insights into transformational, emancipatory futures for disenfranchised individuals and groups who bear the brunt of the climate crisis. By focusing on how power dynamics produce and sustain multidimensional inequalities, across cultural and geographic contexts, and linking this with understandings of subject making, we draw attention to the many ways pervasive inequalities are challenged and (re)negotiated in the everyday of human-environment relations. As part of this line of inquiry, we further demonstrate how a focus on intersectional subjectivities helps to expose and overcome lingering ethical dilemmas and injustices within transformation efforts, with emphasis on the roles researchers and practitioners can play in nourishing emancipatory spaces. Progress in this space is crucial to critically examine and establish more transformative adaptation trajectories that foreground dignified lives in an increasingly unequal world.","[Garcia, Alicea; Tschakert, Petra] Univ Western Australia, Dept Geog & Planning, Perth, WA, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Garcia, A (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Dept Geog & Planning, Perth, WA, Australia.",alicea.garcia@research.uwa.edu.au,,"Tschakert, Petra/0000-0002-4268-3378; Garcia, Alicea/0000-0002-1980-264X",Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship; University of Western Australia,"Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); University of Western Australia",This work was supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship and The University of Western Australia.,,103,3,3,4,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-2754,1475-5661,,T I BRIT GEOGR,Trans.

The analysis focuses on which devices they qualify as useful for translating between knowledge, policy and practice concluding with a discussion of what this suggests in the development of efficient climate adaptation strategies. The paper demonstrates that although transportation sector managers accept the findings of climate science knowledge presented to them, their understanding of the climate change problem and the range of qualifying anchoring devices used in the development of climate adaption strategies are differentiated according to where they are located in the institutional context. For transportation sector managers on the regional and district level, the climate problem is largely perceived through the occurrence of extreme weather rather than through climate science. However, this knowledge basis is not considered sufficient to support 'knowing how to act' and has resulted in waiting for the authorities to make standards and regulations that would translate climate change knowledge into methods of practice. We argue that the development of standards and regulations might be underestimated in relation to user demands in climate adaptation work that involves reconciling scientific information.","[Ryghaug, Marianne; Solli, Joran] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Interdisciplinary Studies Culture, Ctr Technol & Soc, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Solli, J (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Interdisciplinary Studies Culture, Ctr Technol & Soc, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",marianne.ryghaug@ntnu.no; joran.solli@ntnu.no,,,Norwegian Research Council through the NORKLIMA-programme,Norwegian Research Council through the NORKLIMA-programme,"The research was funded by the Norwegian Research Council through the NORKLIMA-programme.

Climate adaptation strategies that aim to manage urban microclimates through purposeful design can reduce the heat exposure of urban populations, however, it is unclear how the temperature impacts of urban green space and albedo vary across cities and background climate. This study quantifies the sensitivity of surface temperature to landcover characteristics tied to two widely used climate adaptation strategies, urban greening and albedo manipulation (e.g. white roofs), by combining long-term remote sensing observations of land surface temperature, albedo, and moisture with high-resolution landcover datasets in a spatial regression analysis at the census block scale across seven United States cities. We find tree cover to have an average cooling impact of -0.089 K per % cover, which is approximately four times stronger than the average grass cover cooling impact of -0.021 K per % cover. Variability in the magnitude of grass cover cooling impacts was primarily a function of vegetation moisture content, with the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) explaining 89 % of the variability in grass cover cooling impacts across cities. Variability in tree cover cooling impacts was primarily a function of sunlight and vegetation moisture content, with solar irradiance and LSWI explaining 97 % of the cooling variability across cities. Albedo cooling impacts were consistent across cities with an average cooling impact of -0.187 K per increase of 0.01. While these interventions are broadly effective across cities, there are critical regional trade-offs between vegetation cooling efficiency, irrigation requirements, and the temporal duration and evolution of the cooling benefits. In warm, arid cities, high albedo surfaces offer multifaceted benefits such as cooling and water conservation, whereas temperate, mesic cities likely benefit from a combination of strategies, with greening efforts targeting highly paved neighborhoods.","[Smith, Ian A.; Hutyra, Lucy R.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, 685 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Fabian, M.

Among these actions, chloride ingress leads to corrosion initiation and its interaction with service loading could reduce its operational life. Experimental evidence indicates that chloride ingress is highly influenced by weather conditions in the surrounding environment and therefore by climate change. Consequently, both structural design and maintenance should be adapted to these new environmental conditions. This work focuses on the assessment of the costs and benefits of two climate adaptation strategies for new RC structures placed in chloride-contaminated environments under various climate change scenarios. Their cost-effectiveness is measured in terms of the benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR) and the probability that BCR exceeds unity -i.e., Pr(BCR > 1). It was found that increasing concrete strength grade is more cost-effective than increasing design cover. The results also indicate that the cost-effectiveness of a given adaptation strategy depends mainly on the type of structural component, exposure conditions and climate change scenarios.

This study was designed to determine the effects of climate change on perception, the risks of sheep farmers and the actions taken to mitigate these impacts. Nearly all farmers in both production systems agreed on the increased use of drugs and chemicals in their farming activities due to the increase in unknown and known disease outbreaks. The current study showed that transhumance farmers focused mainly on selling livestock as an adaptive strategy. In contrast, semi-intensive farmers concentrated on modifying their farm management and feed operations. Our findings show that semi-intensive farmers do not take deliberated and consistent action against climate change but adapt spontaneously. Sheep farmers' perceptions of climate change and its impacts and the adaptation strategies they consider to address these risks are of great importance in ensuring the resilience of farming practice. This study focused on sheep farmers' perception of climate change and the risks and actions taken to mitigate these impacts. A total of 68 surveys were carried out among sheep farmers (39 transhumance and 29 semi-intensive farmers) by two different representative production systems in Turkiye. Variables regarding the socio-economic profile, climate change impacts, and adaptation strategies were identified and analyzed. Principal component analysis and a Pearson Chi-square test were used to evaluate the data. Both farmers' groups accepted and perceived climate change, showing good awareness and perception. The farmers' attitudes towards adaptation to climate change were associated with production systems. Transhumance farmers had limited adaptation and coping strategies compared to semi-intensive farmers. Transhumance farmers focused mainly on selling livestock (mostly to cope with degraded natural grassland/feed deficiency) as an adaptive strategy. In contrast, semi-intensive farmers focused on modifying their farm management and feed operations, such as changing the feed ratio and supplement use, improving water and feed storage, and considering crop feed production. The knowledge obtained from this study could be helpful for farmers and policymakers who develop long-term small ruminant production strategies that consider the effects of climate change and adapt them to different farming systems in the Turkiye.","[Yetisgin, Sezen Ocak; Onder, Hasan] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Dept Anim Sci, TR-55139 Samsun, Turkey; [Sen, Ugur] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Dept Agr Biotechnol, TR-55139 Samsun, Turkey; [Piwczynski, Dariusz; Kolenda, Magdalena; Sitkowska, Beata] Bydgoszcz Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Anim Breeding & Biol, Dept Anim Biotechnol & Genet, PL-85796 Bydgoszcz, Poland; [Yucel, Ceyhun] Gaziosmanpasa Univ, Grad Educ Inst, Organ Agr Program, Tasliciftlik Campus, TR-60000 Tokat, Turkey",Ondokuz Mayis University; Ondokuz Mayis University; Bydgoszcz University of Science & Technology; Gaziosmanpasa University,"Onder, H (corresponding author), Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Dept Anim Sci, TR-55139 Samsun, Turkey.",honder@omu.edu.tr,"Ocak, Sezen/HJH-5292-2023; Kolenda, Magdalena/T-9937-2018","Kolenda, Magdalena/0000-0002-9260-4391; Sitkowska, Beata/0000-0002-1036-7450; SEN, Ugur/0000-0001-6058-1140; Onder, Hasan/0000-0002-8404-8700; Piwczynski, Dariusz/0000-0001-8298-2316",Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange [PPI/APM/2019/1/00003]; TUBITAK [1919B011903284],Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange(Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange (NAWA)); TUBITAK(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"This article was supported by the Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange under Grant No. PPI/APM/2019/1/00003.

Climate change is an increasingly complex challenge for these territories. Tackling climate change, moreover, in a sustainable way, is a priority in the European Union, which has set several ambitious short- and long-term mitigation, adaptation, and sustainability targets. It is a central issue of how society can respond to the climate emergency that is affected by and depends on the vertical and horizontal interrelations among different stakeholders, organizations, governance actors, etc., and their activities. Countries, regions, counties, and cities around the world react by developing climate strategies. The operationalization of the high-level political agreements and discourses is uncertain, and the policies in practice should also be evaluated on regional and city levels, just as the milestones of related strategic planning processes fostering local adaptive capacity. According to regional and urban governance, it is pivotal addressing not only mitigation but adaptation issues to be able to foster sustainable regional development, also considering the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) specified in the Agenda 2030. Adaptation to climate change is increasingly becoming a priority for policy action. It also has high relevance to find the synergic interrelations towards an adaptive future. This paper evaluates the recent changes in Hungarian regional and urban planning in relation to climate policy approach and reports a state of adaptation oriented spatial planning on NUTS-3 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) and LAU-1 (Local Administrative Units) levels. The results are based on the collection of all relevant climate change-related strategic documents on these levels in Hungary and on the analysis of specific information. There is a lack of knowledge related to the comprehensive adaptation policy and planning on regional and local levels in Hungary. The results of the evaluation show the state-of-art knowledge related to possible adaptation pathways and the various engagement level for climate policy approach on different spatial levels in Hungary. In the case of the examined research area, the development of more mitigation oriented planning documents and low level of adaptation measures and monitoring process management tools is seen as critical.","[Csete, Maria Szalmane; Buzasi, Attila] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Environm Econ, Magyar Tudosok Krt 2, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Csete, MS (corresponding author), Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Environm Econ, Magyar Tudosok Krt 2, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",csete@eik.bme.hu,"Buzási, Attila/AAG-1339-2020; Csete, Maria/AAP-1198-2021","Buzási, Attila/0000-0002-4088-9276; Csete, Maria/0000-0001-7170-9402",Higher Education Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities in the frame of the Water sciences & Disaster Prevention research area of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME FIKP-VIZ),Higher Education Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities in the frame of the Water sciences & Disaster Prevention research area of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME FIKP-VIZ),The research reported in this paper was supported by the Higher Education Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities in the frame of the Water sciences & Disaster Prevention research area of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME FIKP-VIZ).,,62,4,4,2,9,HUNGARIAN METEOROLOGICAL SERVICE,BUDAPEST,"PO BOX 38, BUDAPEST, H-1525, HUNGARY",0324-6329,,,IDOJARAS,Idojaras,APR-JUN,2020,124,2,,,SI,,253,276,,10.28974/idojaras.2020.2.6,http://dx.doi.org/10.28974/idojaras.2020.2.6,,,24,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,MA3BR,,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000541793200007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Knowledge of the average amount and stability of available agro-climate resources for maize in the main cropping regions of China under climate change is essential for farmers and advisors to optimize cropping choices and develop adaptation strategies under limited resources. In this study, the three main maize cropping regions in China-the North China spring maize region (NCS), the Huanghuaihai summer maize region (HS), and the Southwest China mountain maize region (SCM)-were selected as study regions. Based on observed solar radiation, temperature, and precipitation data, we analyzed the spatial distributions and temporal trends in the available agro-climate resources for maize during 1981-2010. During this period, significantly prolonged climatological growing seasons for maize [3.3, 2.0, and 4.7 day (10 yr)(-1) in NCS, HS, and SCM] were found in all three regions. However, the spatiotemporal patterns of the available agro-climate resources differed among the three regions. The available heating resources for maize increased significantly in the three regions, and the rates of increase were higher in NCS [95.5 degrees C day (10 yr)(-1)] and SCM [93.5 degrees C day (10 yr)(-1)] than that in HS [57.7 degrees C day (10 yr)(-1)]. Meanwhile, decreasing trends in the available water resources were found in NCS [-5.3 mm (10 yr)(-1)] and SCM [-5.8 mm (10 yr)(-1)], whereas an increasing trend was observed in HS [3.0 mm (10 yr)(-1)]. Increasing trends in the available radiation resources were found in NCS [20.9 MJ m(-2) (10 yr)(-1)] and SCM [25.2 MJ m(-2) (10 yr)(-1)], whereas a decreasing trend was found in HS [11.6 MJ m(-2) (10 yr)(-1)]. Compared with 1981-90, the stability of all three resource types decreased during 1991-2000 and 2001-10 in the three regions. More consideration should be placed on the extreme events caused by more intense climate fluctuations. The results can provide guidance in the development of suitable adaptations to climate change in the main maize cropping regions in China.","[Zhao, Jin; Yang, Xiaoguang] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Yang, XG (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",yangxg@cau.edu.cn,"yang, xiao/HJI-7815-2023",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [31471408]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0300101]; China Postdoctoral Science Fund [2015M580147],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; China Postdoctoral Science Fund(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31471408), National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0300101), and China Postdoctoral Science Fund (2015M580147).",,60,18,22,1,22,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2095-6037,2198-0934,,J METEOROL RES-PRC,J.

The motivation for this study is the observation that little research and no concerted efforts have been made at the global level to provide a consistent and equitable drought risk management framework for multiple regions, population groups and economic sectors. Drought risk is assessed for the period 20002014 and is based on the product of three independent determinants: hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Drought hazard is derived from a non-parametric analysis of historical precipitation deficits at the 0.5; drought exposure is based on a non-parametric aggregation of gridded indicators of population and livestock densities, crop cover and water stress; and drought vulnerability is computed as the arithmetic composite of high level factors of social, economic and infrastructural indicators, collected at both the national and sub-national levels. The performance evaluation of the proposed models underlines their statistical robustness and emphasizes an empirical resemblance between the geographic patterns of potential drought impacts and previous results presented in the literature. Our findings support the idea that drought risk is driven by an exponential growth of regional exposure, while hazard and vulnerability exhibit a weaker relationship with the geographic distribution of risk values. Drought risk is lower for remote regions, such as tundras and tropical forests, and higher for populated areas and regions extensively exploited for crop production and livestock farming, such as South-Central Asia, Southeast of South America, Central Europe and Southeast of the United States. As climate change projections foresee an increase of drought frequency and intensity for these regions, then there is an aggravated risk for global food security and potential for civil conflict in the medium- to long-term. Since most agricultural regions show high infrastructural vulnerability to drought, then regional adaptation to climate change may begin through implementing and fostering the widespread use of irrigation and rainwater harvesting systems. In this context, reduction in drought risk may also benefit from diversifying regional economies on different sectors of activity and reducing the dependence of their GDP on agriculture.

However, to achieve impact at scale, CSA innovations must address agricultural systems' context-specific and multi-dimensional nature and be purveyed through feasible scaling processes. Unfortunately, knowledge on the scaling of CSA innovations under smallholder farming systems and in the context of developing countries remains scant. Understanding scaling processes is essential to the design of a sustainable scaling strategy. This study aimed to draw lessons on scaling from 25 cases of scaling CSA, and related projects in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania implemented by public institutions, local and international research organisations, Non-Govermental Orginsations(NGOs), and community-based organisations. Generally, scaling follows a linear pathway comprising technology testing and scaling. Most cases promoted technologies and models geared towards climate change adaptation in crop-based value chains, and only a few cases incorporated mitigation measures. Efforts to engage the private sector involved building business models as a potential scaling pathway. The cases were very strong on capacity building and institutionalisation from local, national, and even regional levels. However, four critical areas of concern about the sustainability of scaling emerged from the study: (i) There is little understanding and capture of the dynamics of smallholder farming systems in scaling strategies; (ii) climate data, projections, and impact models are rarely applied to support the decision of scaling; (iii) considerations for the biophysical and spatial-temporal impacts and trade-offs analysis in scaling is minimal and just starting to emerge; and (iv) there are still challenges effecting systemic change to enable sustainable scaling. In response to these concerns, we propose investment in understanding and considering the dynamics of the smallholder farming system and how it affects adoption, and subsequently scaling. Programme design should incorporate climate change scenarios. Scaling programmes can maximise synergies and leverage resources by adopting a robust partnerships model. Furthermore, understanding the spatio-temporal impact of scaling CSA on ecological functioning deserves more attention. Lastly, scaling takes time, which needs to be factored into the design of programmes.","[Kirina, Thomas; Ludwig, Fulco] Wageningen Univ & Res, Water Syst & Global Change WSG Grp, Wageningen Inst Environm & Climate Res WIMEK, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Groot, Annemarie] Wageningen Univ & Res, Environm Syst Anal Grp, Wageningen Inst Environm & Climate Res WIMEK, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Shilomboleni, Helena; Demissie, Teferi] Int Livestock Res Inst ILRI, Climate Change Agr & Food Secur Programme CCAFS, POB 30709, Nairobi 00100, Kenya",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Kirina, T (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Water Syst & Global Change WSG Grp, Wageningen Inst Environm & Climate Res WIMEK, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",thomas.kirina@wur.nl; annemarie.groot@wur.nl; h.shilomboleni@cgiar.org; fulco.ludwig@wur.nl; teferidem@gmail.com,,"Demissie, Teferi/0000-0002-0228-1972; groot, annemarie/0000-0002-7111-1088",Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs [4000000819],Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs,"This research was funded by Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Activity number 4000000819.",,117,0,0,10,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,APR,2022,12,4,,,,,,,820,10.3390/agronomy12040820,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12040820,,,30,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,0Q6KA,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000785023900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

At the same time wetlands are typically biodiversity hotspots and provide a range of valuable ecosystem services, such as water supply and purification, disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and carbon sequestration. Pressures on wetlands are likely to further intensify in the coming decades due to increased global demand for land and water, and due to climate change. Stakeholders at all levels of governance have to be involved to slow, stop and reverse these processes. However, the information they need on wetland extent, their ecological character, and their ecosystem services is often scattered, sparse and difficult to find and access. The freely available Sentinel satellite data of the Copernicus Programme, as well as the Landsat archive, provide a comprehensive basis to map and inventory wetland areas (extent), to derive information on the ecological status, as well as long- and short-term trends in wetland characteristics. However, making use of these Earth Observation (EO) resources for robust and standardized wetland monitoring requires expert knowledge on often complex data processing techniques, which impedes practical implementation. In this respect, the Satellite-based Wetland Observation Service (SWOS), a Horizon 2020 funded project (www.swos-service.eu) has developed and made disseminated monitoring approaches based on EO data, specifically designed for less experienced satellite data users. The SWOS monitoring tools aim at assisting countries in conducting national wetland inventories for their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting and monitoring obligations, and additionally facilitates other monitoring obligations such as those required by the Ramsar Convention and supports decision-making in local conservation activities. The four main components of the SWOS approach are: map and indicator production; software development; capacity building; and initializing the GEO Wetlands Community Portal. Wetland managers and data analysists from more than fifty wetland sites and river basins across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa investigated the benefits and limitations of this EO-based wetland mapping and monitoring approach. We describe research that applies the SWOS tools to test their potential for the mapping of wetlands in a case study based in Albania, and show its effectiveness to derive metrics relevant to the monitoring of SDG indicator 6.6.1.","[Weise, Kathrin; Hoefer, Rene; Schwarz, Michael; Kunz, Ina; Thuemer, Grit] Jena Optron GmbH, Otto Eppenstein Str 3, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Franke, Jonas] RSS Remote Sensing Solut GmbH, Dingolfinger Str 9, D-81673 Munich, Germany; [Guelmami, Anis] Res Inst Conservat Mediterranean Wetlands Tour Va, F-13200 Arles, France; [Simonson, Will; O'Connor, Brian; Scott, Emma; Ling, Matthew] World Conservat Monitoring Ctr, Environm Programme, 219 Huntingdon Rd, Cambridge CB3 0DL, England; [Muro, Javier; Strauch, Adrian] Univ Bonn, Ctr Remote Sensing Land Surfaces ZFL, Genscherallee 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Flink, Stephan; Hilarides, Lammert] Wetlands Int, POB 471, NL-6700 AL Wageningen, Netherlands; [Eberle, Jonas; Truckenbrodt, John; Zanderg, Franziska] Friedrich Schiller Univ, Remote Sensing Sect, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Mino, Eric] UT SEMIDE EMWIS TU, BP23, F-06901 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Thulin, Susanne; Philipson, Petra] Brockmann Geomat Sweden AB, Torshamnsgatan 39, SE-16440 Kista, Sweden; [van Valkengoed, Eric] TerraSphere Imaging & GIS BV, Keizersgracht 125-127, NL-1015 CJ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Sanchez, Antonio; Schroeder, Christoph] ETC UMA, Edificio Invest Ada Byron C Arquitecto Francisco, Malaga 29010, Spain; [Thonfeld, Frank] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, German Remote Sensing Data Ctr DFD, Munchener Str 20, D-82234 Wessling, Germany; [Thonfeld, Frank] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Remote Sensing, Oswald Kulpe Str 86, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; [Fitoka, Eleni] Greek Biotope Wetland Ctr EKBY, 14th Km Thessaloniki Mihaniona,POB 60394, Thermi 57001, Greece; [Plasmeijer, Anouska] IUCN European Reg Off, Blvd Louis Schmidt 64, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium",Jena-Optronik GmbH; University of Bonn; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); University of Wurzburg,"Weise, K (corresponding author), Jena Optron GmbH, Otto Eppenstein Str 3, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",Kathrin.Weise@jena-optronik.de,"Scott, Emma/HMP-3056-2023; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Scott, Emma/0000-0001-8850-3339; Sanchez Espinosa, Antonio/0000-0003-0283-2532; Scott, Emma/0000-0002-9900-564X; Strauch, Adrian/0000-0001-9309-1543; Mino, Eric/0000-0002-5089-7640; Thonfeld, Frank/0000-0002-3371-7206; Simonson, Will/0000-0001-5795-6802",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [642088]; Ramsar Convention on Wetlands,European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; Ramsar Convention on Wetlands,"The SWOS project received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 642088.

EbA scholarship argues that community-based projects can strengthen those ecosystems that deliver critical services to communities and in doing so enhance community resilience. In particular, the inclusion of indigenous and traditional knowledge (ITK) into community-based EbA projects is positioned as critical to successful climate adaptation. Yet, there is surprisingly little investigation into how ITK is being defined and incorporated into EbA initiatives. This paper critically reviews EbA literature and provides empirical examples from Vanuatu and Samoa to demonstrate the different ways ITK relates to EbA projects. We find that there is widespread recognition that ITK is important for indigenous and local communities and can be employed successfully in EbA. However, this recognition is more aspirational than practical and is not being necessarily translated into ITK-informed or ITK-driven EbA projects. ITK should not be conceptualized simply as a collection of local environmental information that is integrated with Western scientific knowledge. Instead, ITK is part of nested knowledge systems (information-practices-worldviews) of indigenous peoples. This knowledge includes local natural resource management, sociocultural governance structures, social norms, spiritual beliefs, and historical and contemporary experiences of colonial dispossession and marginalization. At present, most EbA projects focus on the provision of information to main decision-makers only; however, since ITK is held collectively, it is essential that entire communities are included in ITK EbA projects. There is a huge potential for researchers and ITK holders to coproduce knowledge that would be best placed to drive climate adaptation in a changing world.","[Nalau, Johanna] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Gold Coast Campus, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Nalau, Johanna; Becken, Susanne] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Griffith Inst Tourism, Gold Coast Campus, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Schliephack, Johanna] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Tourism Sport & Hotel Management, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Parsons, Meg; Brown, Cilla] Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Auckland, New Zealand; [Mackey, Brendan] Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Gold Coast Campus, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University; University of Auckland; Griffith University,"Nalau, J (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Gold Coast Campus, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia.;Nalau, J (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Griffith Inst Tourism, Gold Coast Campus, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia.",j.nalau@griffith.edu.au,"Nalau, Johanna/V-5692-2018; Mackey, Brendan/ABE-3805-2020; Becken, Susanne/AFK-2875-2022; Parsons, Meg/C-2405-2019","Nalau, Johanna/0000-0001-6581-3967; Becken, Susanne/0000-0002-3348-2750; Parsons, Meg/0000-0001-8721-659X; Mackey, Brendan/0000-0003-1996-4064",private charitable trust,private charitable trust,This research was supported by a grant from a private charitable trust that wishes to remain anonymous.

In this study, we identified the factors with the greatest influence on dengue virus spread using a spatio-temporal analysis. We applied the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) to determine the spatial distribution of DF and identify areas with high probability of presence of A. aegypti by analyzing monthly climatic conditions, locations of reported dengue cases during 2012, and social factors in Guayaquil. Social variables showed greater influence on the presence and spread of disease during dengue outbreak season. The best model performance was obtained when the most important social variables were grouped based on components of the population's unsatisfied basic needs (UBN). Head of the household was a woman, the household was unoccupied, and UBN related to housing conditions at the household level were the most significant social risk factors. The final spatial distribution shows that the districts with the highest risks of infection are located mainly in the southern portion of the city, therefore these areas must take priority when integrated vector-control interventions and prevention protocols are carried out.","[Jacome, Gabriel; Vilelaa, Paulina; Yoo, ChangKyoo] Kyung Hee Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Coll Engn, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Seocheon Dong 1, Yongin 446701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Jacome, Gabriel] UTN, Fac Ingn Ciencias Agr & Ambient, Escuela Recursos Nat Renovables, Ave 17 Julio 5-21, EC-100150 Ibarra, Ecuador; [Vilelaa, Paulina] ESPOL Polytech Univ, Escuela Super Politecn Litoral, Fac Ingn Ciencias Tierra, Campus Gustavo Galindo Km 30-5 Via Perimetral, Guayaquil, Ecuador",Kyung Hee University; Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral,"Yoo, C (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Coll Engn, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Seocheon Dong 1, Yongin 446701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",ckyoo@khu.ac.kr,"Vilela, Paulina/AAU-2476-2021; 유, 창규/AAJ-1226-2020; Jácome-Aguirre, Gabriel/ABE-6508-2020","Vilela, Paulina/0000-0001-7631-9470; Jácome-Aguirre, Gabriel/0000-0001-8305-6226; Yoo, ChangKyoo/0000-0002-9406-7649",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [2017R1E1A1A03070713]; Korea Ministry of Environment(MOE) as Graduate School specialized in Climate Change,National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT); Korea Ministry of Environment(MOE) as Graduate School specialized in Climate Change,"This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No. 2017R1E1A1A03070713) and by Korea Ministry of Environment(MOE) as Graduate School specialized in Climate Change.

A comprehensive understanding of the ecological environment changes is crucial for humans to implement environmental protection measures to adapt to climate change and alleviate the contradiction between humans and land. In this study, fractional vegetation coverage (FVC), leaf area index (LAI), gross primary productivity of vegetation (GPP), land surface temperature (LST), and wetness (WET) were retrieved from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite remote sensing products in 2008 and 2018. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to establish the MODIS data-based ecological index (MODEI) in the study area, and the spatial differentiation characteristics and driving mechanism of ecological quality in the last ten years were explored. The results showed that: (1) FVC, GPP, LAI, and WET had positive effects on the ecological environment, while LST had a negative impact on the ecological environment. FVC and GPP were more significant than other indicators. (2) The MODEI showed a spatial pattern of excellent in the north and poor in the south and changed from north to south in the study area. (3) From 2008 to 2018, the average MODEI of Fuyun County increased from 0.292 to 0.303, indicating that the ecological quality in Fuyun County became better overall. The improved areas were mainly located in the summer pastures at higher elevations. In comparison, the deteriorated areas were concentrated in the spring and autumn pastures and winter pastures at lower elevations. The areas where the ecological environment had obviously improved and degraded were distributed along the banks of the Irtysh River and the Ulungur River. (4) With the increase in precipitation and the decrease in grazing pressure, the MODEI of summer pasture was improved. The deterioration of ecological environment quality in spring and autumn pastures and winter pastures was related to the excessive grazing pressure. The more significant changes in the MODEI on both sides of the river were associated with implementing the herdsmen settlement project. On the one hand, the implementation of newly settled villages increased the area of construction land on both sides of the river, which led to the deterioration of ecological quality; on the other hand, due to the increase in cropland land and the planting of artificial grasses along the river, the ecological quality was improved. The study offers significant information for managers to make more targeted ecological restoration efforts in ecologically fragile areas.","[Bi, Xu; Hou, Fen] Shanxi Univ Finance & Econ, Coll Resources & Environm, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China; [Bi, Xu; Yang, Zihan; Li, Bo] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Nat Resources, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Chang, Bianrong] Tianjin Agr Univ, Coll Humanities, Tianjin 300384, Peoples R China; [Fu, Qi] Soochow Univ, Sch Polit & Publ Adm, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China; [Fu, Qi] Soochow Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr New Urbanizat & Social Gov, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China; [Fu, Qi] Soochow Univ, Ctr Chinese Urbanizat Studies, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China",Shanxi University Finance & Economics; Beijing Normal University; Tianjin Agricultural University; Soochow University - China; Soochow University - China; Soochow University - China,"Li, B (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Nat Resources, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Fu, Q (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Sch Polit & Publ Adm, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China.;Fu, Q (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr New Urbanizat & Social Gov, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China.;Fu, Q (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Ctr Chinese Urbanizat Studies, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China.",geo_bnu@163.com; changbianrong1220@163.com; houyuhoufeng@163.com; 201631190022@mail.bnu.edu.cn; fuqi@suda.edu.cn; libo@bnu.edu.cn,"Fu, Qi/ABB-2288-2021","Bi, Xu/0000-0002-1569-8523; Fu, Qi/0000-0003-0468-0632",National Science and Technology Support Plan of China [2014BAC15B04]; Scientific and Technological Innovation Programs of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi (STIP) [2019L0480]; Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project of Shanxi Province [2020YY082]; Jiangsu Social Science Foundation [19GLC016]; Major Projects of Philosophical and Social Sciences Research in Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province [2019SJZDA043],National Science and Technology Support Plan of China; Scientific and Technological Innovation Programs of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi (STIP); Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project of Shanxi Province; Jiangsu Social Science Foundation; Major Projects of Philosophical and Social Sciences Research in Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province,"This research was supported by National Science and Technology Support Plan of China (No.2014BAC15B04), the Scientific and Technological Innovation Programs of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi (STIP, 2019L0480), the Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project of Shanxi Province in 2020 (2020YY082), the Jiangsu Social Science Foundation (19GLC016), and the Major Projects of Philosophical and Social Sciences Research in Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province (2019SJZDA043).",,70,8,8,14,74,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

El Nino, as one of the most dominant modes of climate variability, is closely linked to hydrologic extremes such as floods and droughts that cause great loss of lives and properties. However, the different impacts of the two types of El Nino, i.e., central Pacific (CP-) and eastern Pacific (EP-) El Nino, on runoff across the conterminous US (CONUS) are not well understood. This study characterizes the impacts of the CP- and EP-El Nino on seasonal and annual runoff using observed streamflow data from 658 reference gaging stations and the NCAR-CCSM4 model. We found that surface runoff responds similarly to the two types of El Nino events in southeastern, central, southern, and western coastal regions, but differently in northeast (NE), Pacific northwest (PNW) and west north central (WNC) climatic zones. Specifically, EP-El Nino events tend to bring above-average runoff in NE, WNC, and PNW throughout the year while CP-El Nino events cause below-than normal runoff in the three regions. Similar findings were also found by analyzing NCAR-CCSM4 model outputs that captured both the CP- and EP-El Nino events, representing the best data set among CMIP5 models. The CCSM4 model simulates lower runoff values during CP-El Nino years than those in EP-El Nino over all of the three climatic regions (NE, PNW, and WNC) during 1950-1999. In the future (2050-2099), for both types of El Nino years, runoff is projected to increase over the NE and PNW regions, mainly due to increased precipitation (P). In contrast, the increase of future evapotranspiration (ET) exceeds that of future P, leading to a projected decrease in runoff over the WNC region. In addition, model analysis indicates that all of the three regions (NE, PNW, and WNC) are projected to have lower runoff in CP-El Nino years than in EP-El Nino years. Our study suggests that the US water resources may be distributed more unevenly in space and time with more frequent and intense flood and drought events. The findings from this study have important implications to water resource management at regional scales. Information generated from this study may help water resource planners to anticipate the influence of two different types of El Nino events on droughts and floods across the CONUS.","[Tang, T.; Li, W.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Earth & Ocean Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Sun, G.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Southern Res Stn, Eastern Forest Environm Threat Assessment Ctr, Raleigh, NC 27606 USA",Duke University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Li, W (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Earth & Ocean Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",wenhong.li@duke.du,"Sun, Ge/ABF-6673-2020","Tang, Tao/0000-0002-0763-4239",National Science Foundation [AGS-1147608]; US Department of Agriculture [2014-67003-22068],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"We would like to thank USGS for providing runoff data, NOAA for providing land precipitation data, and ECMWF for providing ERA ET data, as well as ESGF portal for providing CMIP5 global climate model output.

Today's world has increasingly become aware of the adverse effects of climate change and its impact on the poor, though the latter impact is not that well known. To address these impacts, recommendations exist that follow two different though interrelated approaches - mitigation and adaptation. Design/methodology/approach - Using a survey questionnaire as the research instrument and a sampling frame of 350 junior corporate executives, an empirical study was conducted in the Chennai area in southern part of India to evaluate/measure the linkages between awareness to climate change, its impact on the poor and the willingness of private sector to act on adaptation as well as mitigation strategies. Findings - From the data analysis, it emerges that there is significant awareness about the impacts of climate change, though the awareness to vulnerability of the poor is not yet significant in Chennai area in the private sector. However, the study concludes that there does exist a significant linkage between awareness and the willingness to support adaptation strategies on the part of junior corporate executives. Research limitations/implications - The study is country specific because the research was carried out in a defined region in India. Practical implications - Because the study brought out the result that private sector was willing to participate in adaptation strategies, extensive awareness building can be carried out for corporate executives and plan out activities which will enable them to participate in adaptation strategies which would help the poor in India to help address the devastations caused by Climate Change from time to time. Social implications - Executives taking up the Climate Change adaptation strategy would help protect and benefit all communities especially the poor in the country. Companies operating in India would find an avenue to reach out in their efforts to touch communities around them. Employees in such companies may be organized and gathered together to participate in such reach-out activities on the part of the companies. Originality/value - This paper fulfils urgent need to inspire the corporate executives to take up initiatives related to climate change. The paper lays the groundwork on which an array of corporate activities can be developed to implement the adaptation strategies. Further extensive thinking can follow this research as to where and how exactly private sector can help.","[Rao, Purba H.] Great Lakes Inst Management, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Thamizhvanan, Arun] Loyola Inst Business Adm, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India",,"Rao, PH (corresponding author), Great Lakes Inst Management, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.",purba.h.rao@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,2,2,1,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Here, digital environments can support strategic decisions and planning through visual representations of local climate risks and vulnerabilities. This study targets visualization of vulnerability to heat and floods as a means of supporting adaptation action in preschools, primary schools, caring units, and municipal residential buildings in Norrkoping, Sweden. Workshops with sector leaders identified vulnerability indicators used as a basis for collecting, calculating and representing self-assessed vulnerability of individual units and buildings. Informed by user inputs, a map-based interactive visual tool representing resulting vulnerability scores and risk maps was developed to support (1) planners and sector leaders in strategic prioritization and investments, and (2) unit heads in identifying adaptation measures to reduce local flood and heat risks. The tool was tested with adaptation coordinators from targeted sectors. The study finds that the tool made it possible to overview climate risks and adaptation measures, which arguably increases general governance capacity Allowing yearly updates of set scores, the tool was also found to be useful for monitoring how vulnerability in the municipality evolves over time, and for evaluating how adaptive efforts influence calculated risks.","[Opach, Tomasz; Glaas, Erik; Hjerpe, Mattias; Navarra, Carlo] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Opach, Tomasz] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Social & Educ Sci, Dept Geog, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Linkoping University; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Opach, T (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.;Opach, T (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Social & Educ Sci, Dept Geog, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",tomasz.opach@ntnu.no,,"Hjerpe, Mattias/0000-0002-5500-3300; Glaas, Erik/0000-0002-5126-3973; Navarra, Carlo/0000-0001-9892-8875",Norrkoping Research and Development Foundation; Swedish Research Council Formas [942-2015-106],Norrkoping Research and Development Foundation; Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),This research was supported by the Norrkoping Research and Development Foundation and the Swedish Research Council Formas under Grant No. 942-2015-106.,,47,4,4,1,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2020,12,3,,,,,,,1179,10.3390/su12031179,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12031179,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LB8SF,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000524899603013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Formal processes to decision-making under uncertainty weigh the ability of a decision rule to achieve multiple and sometimes conflicting objectives in an evaluation procedure. Increasingly, computer simulation models are being applied for this reason, so that the effectiveness of decisions can be evaluated before actually implementing them in reality. In this paper, we develop a simple stochastic simulation model of beach recession under climate change in Australia and evaluate decision rules for beach replenishment in the context of three management objectives: (i) to reduce beach recession, (ii) reduce variation in beach recession, and (iii) do so cost-effectively. Results indicate that a decision to intervene and replenish the beach based on a trigger level would be effective at maintaining shoreline position, with relatively little variation, but did so at a relatively high cost of multiple interventions. A decision procedure to intervene at a fixed period resulted in greater shoreline position variation but constrained management efforts and costs. This structured approach offers an evidence-based process to decision-making that lays bare the assumptions upon which decisions are made. This, in turn, allows for a more complete analysis of all the uncertainties and better outcomes.","[Little, L.

To carry out the process, pruning waste was used as structuring material (SM), in a 1:1 and 1:2, v:v, OFMSW:SM ratio. Monitoring was carried out through the control of physico-chemical and microbiological parameters, such as temperature, pH, humidity, Rottegrade, Solvita tests, the presence of Salmonella sp. and Escherichia coli, total coliform, and Enterococcus sp. concentrations. After carrying out the tests, it can be affirmed that the three types of installations used worked correctly in terms of the monitoring of physico-chemical parameters, giving rise to a compost of sufficient stability and maturity to be applied on agricultural soil. In all cases the bacterial concentrations in the final compost were lower than those detected in the mixture of initial components for its preparation, thus complying with the requirements established in RD 506/2013 and RD 999/2017RD on fertilizer products. However, it cannot be affirmed that one of the three types of installation used produces a greater bacterial inactivation than the others. When composting with different types of facilities, it is of interest to optimize the irrigation and aeration system in order to have a better control of the process and to study the possible temperature gradients in the piles to ensure good sanitization without the risk of bacterial proliferation a posteriori. Finally, the different initial mixtures of OFMSW and SM used in this study did not have a significant influence on the functioning of the composting process or on the microbiological quality during the process. The irrigation water can provide a bacterial contribution that can lead to increases in concentration during the composting process.

The concept of sustainability also has come to include adapting to climate change and the associated dynamic timber markets. This study aims to: (1) incorporate several ESs indicators in a Forest Management Decision Support System (FMDSS) that can deal with climate change and dynamic timber markets; and (2) analyse the impact that intensified forest management, resulting from global change scenarios that represent different levels of climate change mitigation efforts, will have on forest ES indicators in the west of Ireland. A linear programming model that optimized Net Present Value (NPV) from mill-gate sales was previously developed in Remsoft Woodstock, a DSS framework used for strategic forest planning around the world. This Woodstock model was modified to include the effects of global scenarios that include climate change and dynamic timber prices. This model was further developed to include indicators for five ESs (carbon storage in the forest as well as in harvested wood products and carbon substitution, windthrow risk, biodiversity, water quality, and cultural values), to assess the impacts of these global scenarios on the forest landscape and the sustainability of forest management. The ES indicator values were mainly linked to forest age, forest type, and yield tables, and their inclusion in the FMDSS had almost no impact on total model run times. Intensified forest clearfelling, as a result of increasing timber prices associated with most global scenarios, led to increased phosphor emissions to waterbodies, and reductions in windthrow risk and carbon storage. The global scenarios only resulted in minor differences in the indicator values for biodiversity and cultural values. Besides the global scenarios, recent forest policy development and the poor soil conditions in the study area impacted on the results. The developed system, with its innovative method to incorporate climate change and associated market dynamics, could be applied to other forest landscapes in Ireland and Europe, or indeed by any forest company or organization that uses Remsoft Woodstock.","[Lundholm, Anders; Black, Kevin; Corrigan, Edwin; Nieuwenhuis, Maarten] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Agr & Food Sci, UCD Forestry, Dublin, Ireland; [Black, Kevin] Forest Environm Res & Serv Ltd, Dublin, Meath, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Lundholm, A (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Agr & Food Sci, UCD Forestry, Dublin, Ireland.",anders.lundholm@ucdconnect.ie,,"Black, Kevin/0000-0002-9502-961X; Nieuwenhuis, Maarten/0000-0002-3883-4559",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [676754],European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme,This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 676754.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper analyses flood risk and highlights the need for an adaptive strategic plan for flood risk management under the impact of climate change. It introduces a framework for the development of an adaptive strategic plan. The paper identifies organizational issues (at the local government scale) associated with having an adaptive strategic plan and developing a methodology to address these issues. It also identifies the need for a strategic decision support system (SDSS) and conceptualizing the system in order to support adaptive planning principle. Findings - This study identifies lack of adaptability as a gap in traditional strategic planning for addressing flood risk associated with climate change. An adaptive strategic plan has adequate flexibility, promptness and responsiveness to adapt itself to new realities as they emerge and can sustain itself and remain relevant in a changing environment. The study introduces a SDSS that is necessary to support the adaptive element of an adaptive strategic plan. Originality/value - This study distinguishes between a strategy for adaptation and an adaptive strategy. Most research on the topic of adaptation to climate change have been focused on developing strategies that offer adaptive solutions to pressing problems such as flooding. For instance, they may recommend more investment on non-structural methods for flood mitigation, as they are more adaptive than alternative structural methods and therefore more sustainable under climate change. An issue that has attracted less attention is the fact that the strategic plans themselves (or in a sense the decision-making framework) need to be equally adaptive. Some of public institutions do not have adequate flexibility and promptness to change and rectify high-level strategic plans. The study identifies the lack of an SDSS, which allows new scientific findings to be converted to new policies in a short period of time, as a reason for absence of promptness, responsiveness and flexibility in such organizations. This study makes an attempt to address this issue by suggesting a frame work that will enable a government institution to become more responsive to change.","[Mirfenderesk, Hamid] Gold Coast City Council, Waterways & Flood Management, Gold Coast, Australia; [Mirfenderesk, Hamid] Griffith Univ, Gold Coast, Australia; [Corkill, David] Gold Coast City Council, Strateg & Environm Planning & Policy, Gold Coast, Australia",Griffith University,"Mirfenderesk, H (corresponding author), Gold Coast City Council, Waterways & Flood Management, Gold Coast, Australia.",h.mirfenderesk@gu.edu.ac,,,,,,,16,23,23,1,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

For sports organizations, adaptive measures may include designing and constructing new stadiums. In this study, the authors explore climate change as a vehicle for urban transformation, particularly as it relates to the replacement of existing stadiums with new, more sustainable and resilient venues. Design/methodology/approach The authors employed a collective case study approach focusing on three recent cases of stadium replacement: Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas; Oakland Ballpark in Oakland, California; and Marlins Park in Miami, Florida. These cases were selected because an official representative of each team made explicit references to some form of climate adaptation, though each ballpark faces a distinctive climate-related threat. Findings Each of the cases illustrates the various ways in which climate vulnerability may be deployed by teams and policymakers to replace professional sports stadiums. Although all three examples involved the replacement of an existing ballpark, only in the Texas case was climate adaptation openly cited as the primary reason for stadium replacement. Still, ballpark replacement plans in Oakland and Miami included significant and costly design features to protect the stadiums from extreme weather events. Originality/value This study applies the concept of climate vulnerability to illustrate a potential strategy to justify stadium replacement. As cities and metropolitan regions continue to grapple with the grand challenge of climate change, the associated vulnerability of large public assembly facilities such as major sports stadiums - particularly those prominently situated in urban centers - can no longer be ignored.","[Kellison, Timothy] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Orr, Madeleine] SUNY Coll Cortland, Cortland, NY USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Cortland,"Kellison, T (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",tkellison@gsu.edu; orrxx163@umn.edu,"Kellison, Timothy/AGE-0579-2022","Kellison, Timothy/0000-0002-3706-250X",,,,,76,3,3,5,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1464-6668,2515-7841,,INT J SPORT MARK SPO,Int.

Activities are also planned for countries that are not members of the European Union (EU), which require complex changes in the field of legislation, strategic planning, implementation, and monitoring. To successfully plan short-term and long-term activities on these grounds, it is necessary to have a realistic picture of the state of climate change in each country-as they spill over into the entire region of Europe. The main objective of this paper is to answer the following questions: (i) is climate change observed in Western Balkans? (ii) how are certain sectors vulnerable to climate change in Western Balkans? (iii) what are the climate change adaptation strategies in the six countries of the Western Balkans? The answers to these questions can help in planning activities and initial alignment of Western Balkan countries with the EU plan to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Main body The main results of the research show that in all countries of the region, the average annual temperature increased by 1.2 degrees C compared to 1970, with stabilization and the beginning of the decline which can be expected around 2040. The main reasons for climate change in the region are: industry, energy, and heating sector based on coal exploitation, low energy efficiency, etc. Conclusions It can be concluded that Croatia as a member of the EU has adopted, and other five Western Balkans countries are in the process of adopting the necessary regulations and strategies towards climate change mitigation, but the implementation of specific activities is at a low level. The reason for this most often lies in the insufficient commitment of decision-makers to make significant changes in the field of climate change transition (lower level of economic development, lack of investment, and preservation of social peace). Finally, this paper provides an overview of climate change by country, scenario analysis, and policy recommendations.","[Knez, Sandi] CEO, Aviat Career Ctr, Orehova Vas 2312, Slovenia; [Strbac, Snezana] Univ Belgrade, Inst Chem Technol & Met, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Podbregar, Iztok] Univ Maribor, Fac Org Sci, Kranj 4000, Slovenia",University of Belgrade; University of Maribor,"Strbac, S (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Inst Chem Technol & Met, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",snezana.strbac@ihtm.bg.ac.rs,,,"Public Scholarship, Development, Disability, and Maintenance Fund of the Republic of Slovenia; Ministry of Education, Science and Sport of the Republic of Slovenia [11081-4/2019]; Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [451-03-9/2021-14/200026]","Public Scholarship, Development, Disability, and Maintenance Fund of the Republic of Slovenia; Ministry of Education, Science and Sport of the Republic of Slovenia; Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)","The authors would like to thank the Public Scholarship, Development, Disability, and Maintenance Fund of the Republic of Slovenia, Ministry of Education, Science and Sport of the Republic of Slovenia (Grant No: 11081-4/2019), and Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia (Grant No: 451-03-9/2021-14/200026) for financial support.",,43,10,10,11,22,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2192-0567,,,ENERGY SUSTAIN SOC,Energy Sustain.

The effects of climate change on grain production of a winter wheat-summer maize cropping system were investigated, corresponding to the temperature rising 2 and 5 degrees C, precipitation increasing and decreasing by 15% and 30%, and atmospheric CO2 enriching to 500 and 700 ppmv. The study focused on two typical counties in the Huang-Huai-Hai (3H) Plain (covering most of the North China Plain), Botou in the north and Huaiyuan in the south, considering irrigated and rain-fed conditions, respectively. Climate change scenarios, derived from available ensemble outputs from general circulation models and the historical trend from 1996 to 2004, were used as atmospheric forcing to a bio-geo-physically process-based dynamic crop model, Vegetation Interface Processes (VIP). VIP simulates full coupling between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, and other energy and water transfer processes. The projected crop yields are significantly different from the baseline yield, with the minimum, mean (+/-standardized deviation, SD) and maximum changes being -46%, -10.3 +/- 20.3%, and 49%, respectively. The overall yield reduction of -18.5 +/- 22.8% for a 5 degrees C increase is significantly greater than -2.3 +/- 13.2% for a 2 degrees C increase. The negative effect of temperature rise on crop yield is partially mitigated by CO2 fertilization. The response of a C3 crop (wheat) to the temperature rise is significantly more sensitive to CO2 fertilization and less negative than the response of C4 (maize), implying a challenge to the present double wheat-maize systems. Increased precipitation significantly mitigated the loss and increased the projected gain of crop yield. Conversely, decreased precipitation significantly exacerbated the loss and reduced the projected gain of crop yield. Irrigation helps to mitigate the decreased crop yield, but CO2 enrichment blurs the role of irrigation. The crops in the wetter southern 3H Plain (Huaiyuan) are significantly more sensitive to climate change than crops in the drier north (Botou).

The potential of adaptive delta management to contribute to governance capabilities for dealing with the wicked problem of climate change adaptation,JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,ADM; climate change adaptation; governance capabilities; long term planning,SCALE MISMATCHES; REAL OPTIONS; UNCERTAINTY; RISE,"Due to the long term character of the policy issue, the associated uncertainties and the large variety of affected stakeholders, adapting densely populated delta areas to the impacts of climate change is an important governance challenge and a wicked problem. In this paper, we analyse adaptive delta management (ADM), a policy development approach that relies on adaptation tipping points and adaptation pathways, used by the Dutch Delta Programme to climate proof the Dutch delta. ADM operationalizes adaptive management ideas for the long term governance of river deltas. Taking a governance perspective, we assess the potential of ADM to contribute to each of the five governance capabilities required to deal with wicked problems: reflexivity, responsiveness, resilience, revitalization and rescaling. We conclude that ADM can contribute substantially to the governance capabilities of resilience (through robustness and flexibility) and rescaling (through addressing the time scale mismatch). ADM has the potential to contribute to the governance capabilities of reflexivity and responsiveness, but also has some characteristics that could result in non-reflexivity and non-responsiveness. Enabling ADM as a policy development approach for long term issues requires a long term commitment to iterative policy revision, flexibility and learning in the broader governance system.","[Dewulf, Art; Termeer, Catrien] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Dewulf, A (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",art.dewulf@wur.nl,"Dewulf, Art/C-1271-2010; Dewulf, Art/ABA-7434-2020","Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644",,,,,64,23,23,2,23,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",2040-2244,,,J WATER CLIM CHANGE,J.

However, the potential for these traditional urban policy instruments to promote climate-adapted greenfield development remains largely untested. This study examines this potential through an analysis of four urban development partnerships for master-planned estates in two rapidly urbanising regions of Australia. We interview private property developers, government land organisations and municipal level actors. The analysis focuses on the convergence, and tensions, between partners' goals of affordability, profitability and sustainability; benefits and risks of partnering; and, the management of assets over time, in light of environmental risks. The partnerships studied contributed to the state's capacity to implement policy efficiently, encourage innovation and de-risk projects for private partners. However, these initiatives also transferred longer term environmental risks to the broader planning system and to non-partners. The central role of the state in coordinating these arrangements presents opportunities to redress these limitations.","[Taylor, Bruce M.; Harman, Ben P.] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org CSIRO Land & Water, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Taylor, BM (corresponding author), Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org CSIRO Land & Water, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",bruce.taylor@csiro.au,"Taylor, Bruce M/C-5771-2011","Taylor, Bruce/0000-0002-7740-2898",CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship,CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),The research was funded by the CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship.

However, the exact benefits of these measures remain unknown or inadequately quantified for potential future events in some flood-prone areas such as Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, which this paper addresses. This study examines the present (2021) and future (2031) flood risk in Kathmandu Valley, considering two flood occurrence cases (with 100-year and 1000-year mean return periods) and using four residential exposure inventories representing the current urban system (Scenario A) or near-future development trajectories (Scenarios B, C, D) that Kathmandu Valley could experience. The findings revealsubstantial mean absolute financial losses (EUR 473 million and775 million in repair and reconstruction costs) and mean loss ratios(2.8 % and 4.5 %) for the respective flood occurrence cases in current times if the building stock's quality is assumed to have remained the same as in 2011 (Scenario A). Under a no change pathway for 2031 (Scenario B), where the vulnerability of the expanding building stock remains the same as in 2011, mean absolute financial losses would increase by 14 %-16 % over those of Scenario A. However, a minimum (0.20 m) elevation of existingresidential buildings located in the floodplains and the implementation offlood-hazard-informed land-use planning for 2031 (Scenario C) could decrease the mean absolute financial losses of the flooding occurrences by9 %-13 % and the corresponding mean loss ratios by 23 %-27 %,relative to those of Scenario A. Moreover, an additional improvement of thebuilding stock's vulnerability that accounts for the multi-hazard-pronenature of the valley (by means of structural retrofitting and building codeenforcement) for 2031 (Scenario D) could further decrease the mean lossratios by 24 %-28 % relative to those of Scenario A. The largest mean loss ratios computed in the four scenarios are consistently associated with populations of the highest incomes, which are largely located in thefloodplains. In contrast, the most significant benefits of risk mitigation(i.e., largest reduction in mean absolute financial losses or mean lossratios between scenarios) are experienced by populations of the lowestincomes. This paper's main findings can inform decision makers about thebenefits of investing in forward-looking multi-hazard risk-mitigationefforts.","[Mesta, Carlos; Galasso, Carmine] Scuola Univ Super IUSS Pavia, Understanding & Managing Extremes UME Grad Sch, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Cremen, Gemma; Galasso, Carmine] UCL, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, London WC1E 6BT, England",IUSS PAVIA; University of London; University College London,"Galasso, C (corresponding author), Scuola Univ Super IUSS Pavia, Understanding & Managing Extremes UME Grad Sch, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.;Galasso, C (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, London WC1E 6BT, England.",c.galasso@ucl.ac.uk,,,European Centre for Training and Research in Earthquake Engineering(EUCENTRE); UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) [NE/S009000/1],European Centre for Training and Research in Earthquake Engineering(EUCENTRE); UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)),"This research has been supported by the European Centre for Training and Research in Earthquake Engineering(EUCENTRE) and the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF, grant no.

The variables that influence the abundance of dengue vectors are numerous and complex. This has generated a need to focus on areas at risk of disease transmission, the spatial-temporal distribution of vectors, and the factors that modulate vector abundance. To help guide and improve vector-control efforts, this study identified the ecological, social, and other environmental risk factors that affect the abundance of adult female and immature Ae. aegypti in households in urban and rural areas of northeastern Thailand. A one-year entomological study was conducted in four villages of northeastern Thailand between January and December 2019. Socio-demographic; self-reported prior dengue infections; housing conditions; durable asset ownership; water management; characteristics of water containers; knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding climate change and dengue; and climate data were collected. Household crowding index (HCI), premise condition index (PCI), socio-economic status (SES), and entomological indices (HI, CI, BI, and PI) were calculated. Negative binomial generalized linear models (GLMs) were fitted to identify the risk factors associated with the abundance of adult females and immature Ae. aegypti. Urban sites had higher entomological indices and numbers of adult Ae. aegypti mosquitoes than rural sites. Overall, participants' KAP about climate change and dengue were low in both settings. The fitted GLM showed that a higher abundance of adult female Ae. aegypti was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with many factors, such as a low education level of household respondents, crowded households, poor premise conditions, surrounding house density, bathrooms located indoors, unscreened windows, high numbers of wet containers, a lack of adult control, prior dengue infections, poor climate change adaptation, dengue, and vector-related practices. Many of the above were also significantly associated with a high abundance of immature mosquito stages. The GLM model also showed that maximum and mean temperature with four-and one-to-two weeks of lag were significant predictors (p < 0.05) of the abundance of adult and immature mosquitoes, respectively, in northeastern Thailand. The low KAP regarding climate change and dengue highlights the engagement needs for vector-borne disease prevention in this region. The identified risk factors are important for the critical first step toward developing routine Aedes surveillance and reliable early warning systems for effective dengue and other mosquito-borne disease prevention and control strategies at the household and community levels in this region and similar settings elsewhere.","[Rahman, Md.

The goals of AgMIP are to improve substantially the characterization of world food security due to climate change and to enhance adaptation capacity in both developing and developed countries. Analyses of the agricultural impacts of climate variability and change require a transdisciplinary effort to consistently link state-of-the-art climate scenarios to crop and economic models. Crop model outputs are aggregated as inputs to regional and global economic models to determine regional vulnerabilities, changes in comparative advantage, price effects, and potential adaptation strategies in the agricultural sector. Climate, Crop Modeling, Economics, and Information Technology Team Protocols are presented to guide coordinated climate, crop modeling, economics, and information technology research activities around the world, along with AgMIP Cross-Cutting Themes that address uncertainty, aggregation and scaling, and the development of Representative Agricultural Pathways (RAPs) to enable testing of climate change adaptations in the context of other regional and global trends. The organization of research activities by geographic region and specific crops is described, along with project milestones. Pilot results demonstrate AgMIP's role in assessing climate impacts with explicit representation of uncertainties in climate scenarios and simulations using crop and economic models. An intercomparison of wheat model simulations near Obregon, Mexico reveals inter-model differences in yield sensitivity to [CO2] with model uncertainty holding approximately steady as concentrations rise, while uncertainty related to choice of crop model increases with rising temperatures. Wheat model simulations with mid-century climate scenarios project a slight decline in absolute yields that is more sensitive to selection of crop model than to global climate model, emissions scenario, or climate scenario downscaling method. A comparison of regional and national-scale economic simulations finds a large sensitivity of projected yield changes to the simulations' resolved scales. Finally, a global economic model intercomparison example demonstrates that improvements in the understanding of agriculture futures arise from integration of the range of uncertainty in crop, climate, and economic modeling results in multi-model assessments.

The SWAT model was run under a variety of prescribed scenarios including three climate changes, two land use changes, and three combined changes for the future period (2068-2100). The uncertainty and attribution of the sediment yield variations to the climate and land use/land cover changes at the monthly and annual scale were analyzed. The responses of the sediment yield to changes in climate and land use/land cover were considered. The results showed that all scenarios of climate changes, land use/land cover alterations, and combined changes projected an increase in sediment yield in the basin. Under three representative concentration pathways (RCP), climate change significantly increased the annual sediment yield (by 41.03-54.88%), and deforestation may also increase the annual sediment yield (by 1.1-1.2%) in the future. The comprehensive influence of changes in climate and land use/land cover on sediment yield was 97.33-98.05% (attributed to climate change) and 1.95-2.67% (attributed to land use/land cover change) at the annual scale, respectively. This means that during the 2068-2100 period, climate change will exert a much larger influence on the sediment yield than land use/land cover alteration in XRB if the future land use/land cover remains unchanged after 2015. Moreover, climate change impacts alone on the spatial distribution of sediment yield alterations are projected consistently with those of changes in the precipitation and water yield. At the intra-annual scale, the mean monthly transported sediment exhibits a significant increase in March-May, but a slight decrease in June-August in the future. Therefore, the adaptation to climate change and land use/land cover change should be considered when planning and managing water environmental resources of the reservoirs and catchments.","[Li, Huiyun; Qin, Boqiang; Shi, Kun; Zhu, Guangwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, State Key Lab Lake Sci & Environm, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Yu, Chuanguan; Wu, Zhixu] Hangzhou Bur Ecol & Environm, Chunan Branch, Hangzhou 311700, Peoples R China; [Li, Yuan] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Tourism & Urban & Rural Planning, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Jin, Junliang] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, Yangtze Inst Conservat & Dev, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Luo, Liancong] Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Inst Ecol Res & Pollut Control Plateau Lakes, Kunming 650504, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology, CAS; Zhejiang Gongshang University; Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute; Yunnan University","Qin, BQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, State Key Lab Lake Sci & Environm, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.;Luo, LC (corresponding author), Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Inst Ecol Res & Pollut Control Plateau Lakes, Kunming 650504, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",hyli@niglas.ac.cn; qinbq@niglas.ac.cn; liyuan@zjgsu.edu.cn; jljin@nhri.cn; billluo@ynu.edu.cn; caepb@126.com; kshi@niglas.ac.cn; gwzhu@niglas.ac.cn,"Shi, Kun/O-2638-2013","Li, Yuan/0000-0003-0381-2605; Luo, Liancong/0000-0002-8359-0733","National Natural Science Foundation of China [42171034, 41671205, 41830757]; Yunnan University [C176220100043]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Yunnan University,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42171034, 41671205 and 41830757) and Yunnan University (C176220100043).",,60,3,3,19,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,AUG,2022,14,15,,,,,,,2346,10.3390/w14152346,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14152346,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,3R6XZ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000839054200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is an increasing amount of environmental information available to policy makers concerning observations and trends relating to the climate. However, this data is hosted across a multitude of websites often with inconsistent metadata and sparse information relating to the quality, accuracy and validity of the data. Subsequently, the task of comparing datasets to decide which is the most appropriate for a certain purpose is very complex and often infeasible. In support of the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) mission to provide authoritative information about the past, present and future climate in Europe and the rest of the world, each dataset to be provided through this service must undergo an evaluation of its climate relevance and scientific quality to help with data comparisons. This paper presents the framework for Evaluation and Quality Control (EQC) of climate data products derived from satellite and in situ observations to be catalogued within the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS). The EQC framework will be implemented by C3S as part of their operational quality assurance programme. It builds on past and present international investment in Quality Assurance for Earth Observation initiatives, extensive user requirements gathering exercises, as well as a broad evaluation of over 250 data products and a more in-depth evaluation of a selection of 24 individual data products derived from satellite and in situ observations across the land, ocean and atmosphere Essential Climate Variable (ECV) domains. A prototype Content Management System (CMS) to facilitate the process of collating, evaluating and presenting the quality aspects and status of each data product to data users is also described. The development of the EQC framework has highlighted cross-domain as well as ECV specific science knowledge gaps in relation to addressing the quality of climate data sets derived from satellite and in situ observations. We discuss 10 common priority science knowledge gaps that will require further research investment to ensure all quality aspects of climate data sets can be ascertained and provide users with the range of information necessary to confidently select relevant products for their specific application.","[Nightingale, Joanne; Douglas, Sarah; Ryder, James] Natl Phys Lab, Earth Observat Climate & Optic Grp, Hampton Rd, Teddington TW11 0LW, Middx, England; [Mittaz, Jonathan P.

During the period of the Baodun Culture (approximately 4500-3700 cal. yr BP), the inhabitants of the Chengdu Plain (CDP) in the UYR of southwestern China were confronted with a dynamic climate. Archaeological sites, including 9 walled sites located in a relatively small region, were built during the migration process. This paper attempts to demonstrate the linkage between the evolutionary history of the Baodun Culture and paleoclimate change. Subsistence strategies during the Baodun period, such as farming, tool use and food resources were investigated. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal distribution of the archaeological sites, the construction method of the sites' walls, and the growth of weeds were examined and assessed based on archaeological excavations and the literature. The ancient water network at the Baodun site was investigated based on auger surveys and borehole data. By comparing multiple paleoclimatic proxies from regions mainly controlled by the Indian Monsoon, we found that: (1) the drying and cooling climate conditions were responsible for the increases of proportions of millet and supplementary food resources and for the transformation of tool assemblages during the late Baodun period; (2) the increasing numbers of flood events were caused by the weakening of the monsoon and the dramatic climate during the Baodun period, and the interconnected river networks at low elevations in the CDP exacerbated the impact of flooding, which may have partially caused the frequent human migration and the construction method of the site walls; (3) the Baodun people that originally lived in the southwestern and western CDP were forced to gradually migrate to higher elevations in the northern and central territories because of the rapid climate change; and (4) the topography and river-grade also influenced human migration and settlement selection. Climate deterioration hindered the sustainable development of the Baodun Culture and eventually caused it to decline. Common subsistence strategies in human history, such as site location, migration, flood-control methods, agricultural changes, and food diversification, played important roles in the Baodun people's adaptation to climate change.

Seven process-based growth models were applied to 14 representative forest sites across Europe under one climate change scenario. The chosen scenario was the HadCM2 run, based on emission scenario IS92a, and resulted in an increase in mean temperature of 2.5degreesC between 1990 and 2050, and an increase in annual precipitation of 5-15%. The information from those runs was incorporated in a transient way in a large-scale forest resource scenario model, EFISCEN (European forest information scenario). European scale forest resource projections were made for 28 countries covering 131.7 million ha of forest under two management scenarios for the period until 2050. The results showed that net annual increments in sternwood of European forests under climate change will further increase with an additional 0.9 m(3) ha(-1) y(-1) in 2030 compared to the ongoing increase under a current climate scenario, i.e. an extra 18% increase. After 2030 the extra increment increase is reduced to 0.79 m(3) ha(-1) y(-1) in 2050. Under climate change, absolute net annual increments will increase from the present 4.95, on average for Europe, to 5.93 m(3) ha(-1) y(-1) in 2025. After 2025, increments in all scenarios start to decline owing to ageing of the forest and the high growing stocks being reached. The results of the present study are surrounded by large uncertainties. These uncertainties are caused by unknown emissions in the future, unknown extent of climate change, uncertainty in process-based models, uncertainty in inventory data, and uncertainty in inventory projection. Although the results are thus not conclusive, climate change may lead to extra felling opportunities in European forests of 87 million m(3) y(-1). Because Europe's forests are intensively managed already, management may adapt to climate change relatively easily. However, this study also indicates that climate change may lead to a faster build-up of growing stocks. That may create a less stable forest resource in terms of risks to storm damage.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, ALTERRA, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; European Forest Inst, FIN-80100 Joensuu, Finland; Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Dept Global Change & Nat Syst, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany",Wageningen University & Research; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Nabuurs, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, ALTERRA, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",g.j.nabuurs@alterra.wag-ur.nl,"Nabuurs, Gert-Jan/D-8048-2015",,,,,,75,75,82,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Development of improved genotypes of different crop plants through enlightened plant breeding are earnestly needed to deliver climate change adaptation and help in food security. Five durum wheat cultivars (Syrian-4, Dumes-1, Sham-7, Yousef-1 and Haurani) were crossed during 2016-17 in a half diallel fashion to create 10 F-1 hybrids at Duhok University, Iraq. During 2017-18, the seeds of all the genotypes (five parental genotypes + 10 F-1 hybrids) were grown with early (November 20, 2017) and late (December 20, 2017) sowing in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications at two different locations i.e., Sumel - Duhok University and Amedi - Duhok city, Iraq. The combined analysis of variance showed significant (p <= 0.01) differences for hybrids, environments, and hybrid x environment interactions. Analysis of variance for combining ability showed that mean squares due to GCA and SCA were significant (p <= 0.01) indicating the role of both additive and non-additive gene effects in inheritance of studied traits. In general, parental lines i.e., Sham-7 and Haurani were found as good general combiners for most of characters. The SCA effects were significant for three hybrids i.e., Syrian-4 x Sham-7, Sham-7 x Haurani and Duma-1 x Haurani for majority of the characters. In order to determine the stability of genotypes in four different environments, the stability parameters were used to identify the stable genotypes through regression coefficient (Bi) and variance of deviation from regression (S(2)d). Results further revealed that genotypes differed in their response across various environments for all the variables. Some genotypes reflected stability for one character and unstable for other trait, showing a wide range of variation. According to stability parameters parental lines (Sham-7 and Haurani) and F-1 hybrids i.e., Duma-1 x Haurani, Sham-7 x Haurani and Duma-1 x Sham-7, had the best stability for grain yield and its components, thus indicating a wide range of adaptation across environments. These investigations will play an important role in managing some strategies for improvement in durum wheat through diallel cross in future breeding program.","[Askander, Hajer Saeed Ali] Univ Duhok, Dept Field Crops, Coll Agr Engn Sci, Duhok, Kurdistan Regio, Iraq",University of Duhok,"Askander, HSA (corresponding author), Univ Duhok, Dept Field Crops, Coll Agr Engn Sci, Duhok, Kurdistan Regio, Iraq.",Hajar.askandar@uod.ac,,,,,,,49,1,1,0,8,PAKISTAN BOTANICAL SOC,KARACHI,"DEPT OF BOTANY UNIV KARACHI, 32 KARACHI, PAKISTAN",0556-3321,2070-3368,,PAK J BOT,Pak.

The experiment was conducted in the academic year 2017-2018, in collaboration with the city of Wejherowo. The project's main goal was to solve the city's real problems related to climate change, land development and water management. The project was implemented experimentally as part of two subjects: spatial planning, and monitoring and environmental management to ensure an interdisciplinary approach and cover the scope of the project fully. The results of the experiment confirmed the evidence-based advantages of PjBL. However, several methodological, organisational and technical problems, which need to be resolved before a new edition starts, were encountered during the experimental implementation of the method. The experiment was positively received by students, clients, and tutors.

One key outcome of this change is a subsequent potential increase in stormwater runoff, a concern exacerbated by the region's shallow, often clay soils and exposed bedrock, along with highly impervious urban surfaces. This situation, coupled with public perception of climate change that is increasingly inclusive of severe weather, highlights an opportunity to apply green infrastructure to the challenge of stormwater management, referred to as green stormwater infrastructure. In addition to coordinated public action at local, state, and national levels, there is a role for the private landowner to participate in this form of climate adaptation. Private citizens have an opportunity to both protect their home and property while contributing to overall stormwater management for the community in which they live. Focus group research was conducted to better understand outreach and involve local residents in the creation of a tool to assist private green stormwater infrastructure efforts. Results of the focus group sessions were analyzed, and key themes emerged from the data to guide this process and support private home/landowner action. It is recommended that a fifth domain be added to the typology for public and private roles in climate adaptation, i.e. private adaptation for public and private benefit.","[Beery, Thomas] Univ Minnesota, Minnesota Sea Grant, Duluth, MN 55812 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth,"Beery, T (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Minnesota Sea Grant, Duluth, MN 55812 USA.",tbeery@d.umn.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Beery, Thomas/0000-0002-2774-3731",Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 [NA17NOS4190062],Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972,"This research was funded in part by the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended, administered by the Office for Coastal Management, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under Award NA17NOS4190062 provided to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources for Minnesota's Lake Superior Coastal Program.",,41,15,15,3,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2018,10,12,,,,,,,4791,10.3390/su10124791,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10124791,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HG9OL,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000455338100457,View Full Record in Web of Science

The purpose of the studies was to identify areas of commonality between the two studies with respect to the assessment steps, tools used, and the types of strategies and actions recommended. Four topics were identified for the assessment: forecasting future climate conditions, identifying impacts and disruptions, identifying adaptation strategies and options, and considering risks and uncertainties and the implications for engineering design. The paper concludes that the use of surrogate approaches for considered environmental conditions can be a valuable tool for those conducting adaptation assessment studies. Data quality was an important concern in both studies, and adaptation strategies should include both those designed to avoid damage and disruption and those designed to mitigate any potential consequence of an event. A broader concept of loss should be incorporated into the assessment process and into the engineering decisions relating to individual project designs.","[Armstrong, Amit] Fed Highway Adm, Technol Deployment Program, Western Fed Lands Highway Div, Vancouver, WA 98661 USA; [Cromar, James] Broward Metropolitan Planning Org, Trade Ctr South, 100 West Cypress Creek Rd,Suite 850, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33309 USA; [Dorney, Chris; Flood, Mike] WSP Parsons Brinckerhoff, 100 South Charles St,Tower 1,10th Floor, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Meyer, Michael D.] WSP Parsons Brinckerhoff, 3340 Peachtree Rd NE,Tower Pl 100,Suite 2400, Atlanta, GA 30326 USA",,"Meyer, MD (corresponding author), WSP Parsons Brinckerhoff, 3340 Peachtree Rd NE,Tower Pl 100,Suite 2400, Atlanta, GA 30326 USA.",meyer@pbworld.com,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,2,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0361-1981,2169-4052,,TRANSPORT RES REC,Transp.

However, overlooking a holistic climate-adaptive capacity-building of a vulnerable sector down to the last link of its value chain renders inadequate contribution, jeopardizes the adaptation intervention, and prevents achieving a high level of buy-in of the chain actors for the results of the sought capacity-building programs. Thus, this study developed a hybrid system-wide and participatory (focus groups-based) multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to conduct adaptive-capacity needs assessments for the actors of the agribusiness value chain of the developing country of Jordan. Our holistic approach enabled highlighting the sector's climate vulnerability along the value chain, conducting self-regulated adaptive training needs assessment (TNA) of the sector's actors and identifying and prioritizing their real adaptive capacity-building needs. This approach proved to be uniquely advantageous in comparison to the sector's commonly used questionnaire-based surveys that are limited-participatory, researcher-regulated, and subsystem-oriented approaches. The advantages of this hybrid hands-on and wide-ranging MCDA-TNA approach are evident from its revelation of unique results. The approach enabled actors of such a highly vulnerable sector to spontaneously identify and prioritize the indirect downstream climate adaptive capacity-building needs surprisingly over the direct needs. This is because the actors considered the indirect needs more important to their businesses and livelihoods than the direct needs, thus considering the indirect needs as post-requisites of the fate of the direct upstream needs. The hybrid approach also enabled the beneficiaries to formulate the intervention outcomes, unveil the factors ignored by the conventional researcher-controlled approaches, secure high buy-in of the self-attained results, and prioritize the actual adaptive capacity-building demands. This robust combination of qualitative research methods and tools could be straightforwardly applied to design and conduct efficient and cost-effective adaptive capacity-building programs, especially during time-restricted and resource-limited interventions. The results of such types of quick and cost-effective qualitative investigations of adaptive capacity-building needs could be considered a preliminary and a first step toward deeper and more extensive quantitative studies, if needed.","[Abdel-Fattah, Ahmad] Minist Planning & Int Cooperat, Directorate Local Dev & Enhanced Prod, Amman, Jordan; [Al Hiary, Masnat] Natl Agr Res Ctr NARC, Directorate Socio econ Res, Al Baqa, Jordan",,"Abdel-Fattah, A (corresponding author), Minist Planning & Int Cooperat, Directorate Local Dev & Enhanced Prod, Amman, Jordan.",ahmad.abdelfattah72@gmail.com,,,Adaptation Fund [JOR/NIE/Multi/2012/1],Adaptation Fund,"This exercise was conducted as part of the activities of an Adaptation Fund-sponsored Program in Jordan (Grant No. JOR/NIE/Multi/2012/1), addressing the adaptation of the agricultural sector to the impacts of climate change, entitled Increasing the Resilience of Poor and Vulnerable Communities to Climate Change Impacts in Jordan by Implementing Innovative Projects in Water and Agriculture in Support of Adaptation to Climate Change (Adaptation Fund, 2022).

On the other hand, particularly in parts of the EU, a strong negative connotation has emerged in public debate and EC policy, with a particular emphasis on the (presumed) displacement effect in markets and land use. This is a remarkable contrast because the reasons to use sustainable biomass, on the one hand, and the possibilities and synergies for supplying sustainable biomass, on the other, are underpinned with strong evidence, also providing insights on how displacement issues can be avoided. Sustainable biomass supplies can contribute 20-30% of the future global and European energy supply, leading to reduced overall mitigation costs, including realizing the net CO2 removal from the atmosphere using BECCS concepts. This paper highlights which options, pathways and preconditions are key to achieving such a substantial contribution of sustainable biomass in future (2050) energy and material supply (with a focus on the European setting). By pinpointing how biomass can be done right and how important synergies can be achieved via better agricultural methods, the restoration of marginal and degraded lands and the adaptation of climate change, a different policy agenda emerges in sharp contrast to how a biobased economy has been framed in recent years. It is recommended that future policy priorities, particularly at the EU level, take a more integral view on the synergy between the role of biomass in the energy transition, climate adaptation and mitigation, better agriculture and the better use of land in general. Strategies to achieve such positive results typically require an alignment between renewable energy, and agricultural, environmental, mitigation and adaptation policies, which is a largely missing nexus in different policy arenas. Resolving this lack of alignment offers a major opportunity, globally, to contribute to the European Green deal and improve energy security.","[Faaij, Andre P.

One of the principal obstacles that hinders effective decision making is insufficient spatial knowledge frameworks. Cities climate adaptation planning must become strategic to rethink and transform urban fabrics holistically. Contemporary urban planning should merge future threats with older and unsolved criticalities, like social inequities, urban conflicts and drosscapes. Retrofitting planning processes and redefining urban objectives requires the development of innovative spatial information frameworks. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to overcome knowledge production limits and to support climate adaptation planning. The research was undertaken in collaboration with the Metropolitan City of Venice and the Municipality of Venice, and required the production of a multi-risk climate atlas to support their future spatial planning efforts. The developed tool is a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS), which aids adaptation actions and the coordination of strategies. The model recognises and assesses two climate impacts: Urban Heat Island and Flooding, representing the Metropolitan City of Venice (CMVE) as a case study in complexity. The model is composed from multiple assessment methodologies and maps both vulnerability and risk. The atlas links the morphological and functional conditions of urban fabrics and land use that triggers climate impacts. The atlas takes the exposure assessment of urban assets into account, using this parameter to describe local economies and social services, and map the uneven distribution of impacts. The resulting tool is therefore a replicable and scalable mapping assessment able to mediate between metropolitan and local level planning systems.","[Maragno, Denis; Dall'Omo, Carlo Federico; Pozzer, Gianfranco; Musco, Francesco] Iuav Univ Venice, Dept Architecture & Arts, EPiC Earth & Polis Res Ctr, I-30135 Venice, Italy",IUAV University Venice,"Maragno, D (corresponding author), Iuav Univ Venice, Dept Architecture & Arts, EPiC Earth & Polis Res Ctr, I-30135 Venice, Italy.",denis.maragno@iuav.it; carlo.dallomo@iuav.it; gianfranco.pozzer@iuav.it; francesco.musco@iuav.it,"dall'Omo, Carlo Federico/AAT-6265-2021; Maragno, Denis/AHE-1762-2022","dall'Omo, Carlo Federico/0000-0002-7299-1566; Maragno, Denis/0000-0002-9489-7538; Musco, Francesco/0000-0002-8377-0128",SECAP project (Supporting energy and climate adaptation policies),SECAP project (Supporting energy and climate adaptation policies),"The paper publication is funded by SECAP project (Supporting energy and climate adaptation policies).

Emerging evidence indicates that various non-price factors such as lack of knowledge, trust in institutions, beliefs, and perceptions about climate change partly explain the low uptake. This study uses the CVM approach to investigate the effect of one such factor - farmers' climate change perceptions - on the adoption of weather index micro-insurance. We introduce two hypothetical weather index microinsurance products to farming households in Nepal: the first one (basic) insures paddy only, whereas the second one (comprehensive) also insures livestock. We use bivariate probit models with order effects for empirical estimation. We find that households' ex ante perception of future climate change as well as their ex-post perceptions of past climate change impacts have significant effects on their microinsurance purchase decisions. Mean WTP-values for the basic and comprehensive products are NRs. 3096 and NRs. 13209 respectively. We also find some evidence of crowding-out effects on private risk transfer markets by other public and donor climate adaptation programmes. Our findings suggest that public policies should focus on increasing climate awareness, accountability and the development of competitive microinsurance markets.","[Rayamajhee, Veeshan] North Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, NDSU Dept 7610,POB 6050, Fargo, ND 58108 USA; [Bohara, Alok K.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo; University of New Mexico,"Rayamajhee, V (corresponding author), North Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, NDSU Dept 7610,POB 6050, Fargo, ND 58108 USA.",veeshan.rayamajhee@ndsu.edu,,"Rayamajhee, Veeshan/0000-0002-2117-7337",,,,,73,3,3,2,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

We describe local responses to climate change already implemented in the city and explore some of the factors that affect its adaptation. We argue that although the megacity has recently implemented innovative urban policies and a set of municipal actions that aim to overcome many of the city's challenges, Sao Paulo is missing an opportunity to mainstream climate change to improve its adaptive capacity.

Anomalously wet years over the region are associated with low-level convergence, the advection of moisture from both the Indian Ocean and the Congo and an ascending limb of the Walker circulation cell centered over the western Indian Ocean (WIO). During positive Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) events, the Walker circulation cell over the Indian Ocean is well defi ed, and more so compared with observed during El Nino years. In El Nino years, the Walker circulation cell becomes weak compared with positive IOD events, where the zonal winds strengthen, resulting in active convective activities over the WIO. A key fi ding is that the Walker circulation cell developing over the Indian Ocean is strongly connected to IOD activity. The weakening of the Walker circulation cell is likely the reason for the decrease in rainfall during El Nino events compared with that of positive IOD events in recent years over Tanzania during the October-December season. The variability of the Walker circulation cell over the Indian Ocean can lead to extreme weather conditions, making the full understanding of the climate system essential. This is crucial for decision making about adaptation and mitigation measures for coping with climate change and for the minimization of huge socio-economic losses associated with extreme weather events in the region.","[Limbu, Paul Tilwebwa Shelleph; Tan Guirong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Int Joint Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILECE, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ KLME, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Limbu, Paul Tilwebwa Shelleph] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Limbu, Paul Tilwebwa Shelleph] Univ Dar es Salaam, Dept Phys, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of Dar es Salaam,"Tan, GR (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Int Joint Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILECE, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ KLME, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",tanguirong@nuist.edu.cn,"谭, 桂容/HPD-9886-2023; Limbu, Paul/ABE-7618-2020","Limbu, Paul/0000-0001-6467-6403",Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC); National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1505804]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41575070],Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors are grateful to the Tanzania Meteorological Agency (TMA), GPCC, ERSST, NCEP/NCAR, ERA-Interim, and NOAA/NCDC for providing the datasets used in this study.

Thus, the implementation of agricultural adaptation strategies is essential for an optimal allocation of water resources in a changing climate. The objective of this study is to examine the changes in management criteria for a multi-purpose reservoir system and its downstream Gharanghu irrigation network in Iran under climate change. Five management scenarios were evaluated by changing cropping patterns. First, simulations were performed by using HadCM3 (under the A2) for different climatic scenarios to quantify future reservoir inflows and estimate the future downstream demand (2040-2069). The results showed that water resources decreased by 20% and water use increased by 25% compared to the baseline (1971-2000). Then, eight management indexes were calculated based on the water resources and uses simulated by the WEAP model for the future. The indexes were compared for conditions with and without applying the climate adaptation strategies. Results showed that flexibility increased by 19% and vulnerability decreased by 1.7% with demand management and a 5% reduction of water consumption, while flexibility increased by 38% and vulnerability decreased by 28% with a 20% reduction of demand. Applying adaptation strategies in agriculture can significantly reduce the negative effects of climate change.

Urban planning needs to address this problem focusing on areas where people are exposed to heat such as in public squares. Typical square designs include green infrastructure which can positively affect outdoor thermal comfort by providing regulating ecosystem services, but knowledge on the effectiveness of different design approaches is still limited. The present study assessed typical greening designs of rectangular public squares and their microclimatic influences during a hot summer day both during day and night-time conditions. By using a validated ENVI-met V4 model, thermal comfort values expressed by the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) index were compared. Moreover, a novel greening design was developed and tested with the model. The results showed that at 3pm the greening design with most trees and trees placed in the sunlit areas of the square provided 5.2% higher cooling effect compared to the current greening, whereas for 4am the design without trees, but with meadow areas performed best (4.2% heat reduction). This led to the conclusion that for a comfortable thermal situation a climate adapted design has to include trees to maximize the shaded surface areas, while the main wind channel is kept free from trees, but planted with grass to minimize the heat storage. The number of trees and their placement together with the extent and placement of grass areas can thus serve as indicators for designing climate adapted public squares.","[Zoelch, Teresa; Rahman, Mohammad A.; Pfleiderer, Elisabeth; Wagner, Georg; Pauleit, Stephan] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Strateg Landscape Planning & Management, Emil Ramann Str 6, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Zolch, T (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Chair Strateg Landscape Planning & Management, Emil Ramann Str 6, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",teresa.zoelch@tum.de,,"Pauleit, Stephan/0000-0002-0056-6720; Rahman, Mohammad Asrafur/0000-0001-9872-010X",Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung,Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),The field measurements were carried out when M.A. Rahman was in receipt of a post-doctoral fellowship from Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung.,,56,73,76,20,138,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

Beyond dehydration, hyperthermia, and effects on the cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, immune, and nervous systems, high temperatures are associated with increased mortality, accidents at work, suicides, domestic violence, and assaults. Urban heat islands amplify the health effects of heat waves. Extreme climatic events lead to deaths and injuries. Climate change may also increase the development of skin cancers. More indirectly, it modifies the geographic distribution of some vector-borne diseases and aquatic bacteria (cholera outbreaks). The melting of permafrost could generate viral and bacterial threats. High temperatures and extreme climate events are associated with a decline in agricultural yields, which can lead to malnutrition and the stunting of children. Climate change could exacerbate toxic algae bloom, and it has implications for allergies. It will also influence atmospheric concentrations of pollutants and increase the frequency of forest fires and sand and dust storms, which are associated with respiratory problems. The increase in sea levels may contribute to mass climate-caused migrations, with resulting hygiene problems, infectious diseases, and conflicts. The salinization of aquifers will affect access to drinking water. Ocean acidification will amplify the impact of tsunamis and hurricanes and disrupt fishing-based economies. Measures to fight against and to adapt to climate change can also influence health. These involve urban environments and the economic sectors of agriculture, transport, energy, and industry, which shape major determinants of health (physical activity, diet, air pollution, noise, and chemical contaminants). The fight against climate change thus represents a tremendous opportunity to improve health. It is accordingly important to incorporate public health issues into the research agenda related to climate change, in a disciplinary continuum combining, among others, epidemiology and public health, climate sciences, the various human and social sciences, urbanism, and political science.","[Chaix, Basile] Sorbonne Univ, INSERM, Inst Pierre Louis Epidemiol & Sante Publ IPLESP, Equipe Nemesis,Fac Med St Antoine, 27 Rue Chaligny, F-75012 Paris, France; [Slama, Remy] CNRS, INSERM, Equipe Epidemiol Environm Appl Dev & Sante Resp, Site Sante,Allee Alpes, F-38700 La Tronche, France; [Slama, Remy] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Inst Avancee Biosci, Site Sante,Allee Alpes, F-38700 La Tronche, France",Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Saint-Antoine - APHP; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Chaix, B (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, INSERM, Inst Pierre Louis Epidemiol & Sante Publ IPLESP, Equipe Nemesis,Fac Med St Antoine, 27 Rue Chaligny, F-75012 Paris, France.",basile.chaix@iplesp.upmc.fr; remy.slama@inserm.fr,,,,,,,72,0,0,6,7,JOHN LIBBEY EUROTEXT LTD,ARCUEIL,"30, RUE BERTHOLLET, BATIMENT A, 94110 ARCUEIL, FRANCE",1635-0421,1952-3998,,ENVIRON RISQUE SANTE,Environ.

Some governments still deny the existence of climate change and its impact on rural-urban areas around the world. However, the effects of climate change have been visible in rural Zimbabwe, with some communities facing food insecurity, water scarcity and loss of livestock. Climate change has impacted negatively on agriculture, which is the main source of livelihood in Zimbabwe's rural communities. This study aims at exploring challenges faced by rural people in mitigating the effects of climate change in the Mazungunye community, Masvingo Province, in Zimbabwe. The objectives of the study were to identify the challenges that impede effective adaptation of rural people to climate change hazards and to examine their perceptions on how to foster effective adaptation. The researchers conducted a qualitative research study guided by descriptive and exploratory research designs. Purposive sampling was employed to draw the population of the study. The population sample consisted of 26 research participants drawn from members of the community. Data was collected through in-depth individual interviews and focus group discussions. Thematic content analysis was used to analyse data. The findings of the study revealed the following challenges: unpredictability of indigenous knowledge systems, lack of resources and technoscience adaptive methods, lack of support to implement viable mitigation strategies, lack of information about resilience and adaptive capacity to climate change. This study has significance to policymakers and other stakeholders concerned with devising and implementing policies and programmes that are responsive to rural people's needs in the climate change terrain, tapping into their presenting challenges as a departure point for intervention. The study recommended that the most important way to help rural poor people adapt to climate change is through the provision of information; immediate response to needs and climate-smart agricultural policies.","[Nyahunda, Louis] Univ Limpopo, Dept Social Work, Polokwane, South Africa; [Tirivangasi, Happy M.] Univ Limpopo, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Polokwane, South Africa",University of Limpopo; University of Limpopo,"Tirivangasi, HM (corresponding author), Univ Limpopo, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Polokwane, South Africa.",mathewtirivangasi@gmail.com,"Tirivangasi, Happy Mathew/W-7695-2019; Nyahunda, Louis F/W-4577-2018","Tirivangasi, Happy Mathew/0000-0002-1353-6635; ",,,,,61,6,6,0,10,AFRICAN CENTRE DISASTER STUDIES,POTCHEFSTROOM,"INTERNAL BOX 265, NORTH-WEST UNIV, PRIVATE BAG X6001, POTCHEFSTROOM, 2520, SOUTH AFRICA",1996-1421,2072-845X,,JAMBA-J DISASTER RIS,Jamba-J.

A quantitative understanding of spatio-temporal air (T-a) and water (T-w) temperature dynamics is required to guide river management and to facilitate adaptations to climate change. This study determined the magnitude, drivers and models for increasing T-w in three river segments of the Yongan watershed in eastern China. Over the 1980-2012 period, T-w in the watershed increased by 0.029-0.046 degrees C yr(-1) due to a similar to 0.050 degrees C yr(-1) increase of T-a and changes in local human activities (e.g., increasing developed land and population density and decreasing forest area). A standardized multiple regression model was developed for predicting annual T-w (R-2 = 0.88-0.91) and identifying/partitioning the impact of the principal drivers on increasing T-w:T-a (76 +/- 1%), local human activities (14 +/- 2%), and water discharge (10 +/- 1%). After normalizing water discharge, climate warming and local human activities were estimated to contribute 81-95% and 5-19% of the observed rising T-w, respectively. Models forecast a 0.32-1.76 degrees C increase in T-w by 2050 compared with the 2000-2012 baseline condition based on four future scenarios. Heterogeneity of warming rates existed across seasons and river segments, with the lower flow river and dry season demonstrating a more pronounced response to climate warming and human activities. Rising T-w due to changes in climate, local human activities and hydrology has a considerable potential to aggravate river water quality degradation and coastal water eutrophication in summer. Thus it should be carefully considered in developing watershed management strategies in response to climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Predicting and mapping pluvial flood-prone areas is becoming a crucial step in flood mitigation and early warnings, as well as climate change adaptation strategies, to be incorporate in urban planning. Most commonly applied machine learning (ML) procedures for pluvial flood risk assessment, neglect to account for spatio-temporal constraints, leading to overoptimistic models that underestimate the prediction error. In this paper, we propose a novel ML -based methodology for pluvial flood risk prediction in the Metropolitan City of Venice which, introducing a features selection process and spatio-temporal cross-validation, permits to reduce overfitting of the resulting ML models. Spatio-temporal characteristics of floods are derived from a dataset of 60 historical events occurred in the area between 1995 and 2020. Logistic Regression (LR), Neural Networks (NN) and Random Forest (RF) models are applied to identify and prioritize sub-areas that are more likely to be affected by pluvial flood risk, considering the daily precipitation amount and 12 different triggering factors. The models were validated using Random Cross-Validation (R-CV) and Leave Location and Time Out cross-validation (LLTO-CV), that split data in training and validation set considering both time and space. In addition, a forward features selection procedure was applied to identify the features, among the triggering factors, that better face spatio-temporal overfitting in pluvial flood prediction based on the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score. Results suggest that Logistic Regression and LLTO-CV represent the most reliable model to predict pluvial flood events in new spatio-temporal conditions, while, among the triggering factors, distance to river and distance to road resulted the prominent ones.","[Marco, Zanetti; Elena, Allegri; Silvia, Torresan; Andrea, Critto] Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Via Ind 21-8, I-30175 Venice, Italy; [Marco, Zanetti; Elena, Allegri; Anna, Sperotto; Silvia, Torresan; Andrea, Critto] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Via Augusto Imperatore 16, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Anna, Sperotto] Univ Basque Country, BC3 Basque Ctr Climate Change, Sci Campus,Sede Bldg 1,Barrio Sarriena S-N, Leioa 48940, Spain",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); University of Basque Country,"Andrea, C (corresponding author), Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Via Ind 21-8, I-30175 Venice, Italy.;Andrea, C (corresponding author), Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Via Augusto Imperatore 16, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",critto@unive.it,,,,,,,114,0,0,17,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

We assess the potential for 40 practices to address these land challenges and find that: Nine options deliver medium to large benefits for all four land challenges. A further two options have no global estimates for adaptation, but have medium to large benefits for all other land challenges. Five options have large mitigation potential (>3 Gt CO(2)eq/year) without adverse impacts on the other land challenges. Five options have moderate mitigation potential, with no adverse impacts on the other land challenges. Sixteen practices have large adaptation potential (>25 million people benefit), without adverse side effects on other land challenges. Most practices can be applied without competing for available land. However, seven options could result in competition for land. A large number of practices do not require dedicated land, including several land management options, all value chain options, and all risk management options. Four options could greatly increase competition for land if applied at a large scale, though the impact is scale and context specific, highlighting the need for safeguards to ensure that expansion of land for mitigation does not impact natural systems and food security. A number of practices, such as increased food productivity, dietary change and reduced food loss and waste, can reduce demand for land conversion, thereby potentially freeing-up land and creating opportunities for enhanced implementation of other practices, making them important components of portfolios of practices to address the combined land challenges.","[Smith, Pete;

In this study, the impacts of future climate change on water saving and stormwater capture performances of RWH systems at cities across four climatic zones of China are investigated. A downscaling technique based on the Climate Generator is evaluated and employed to generate future (2020-2050) daily rainfall data. Performance indices of RWH systems (i.e., water saving efficiency, reliability, and stormwater capture efficiency) calculated using both the future and historical (1985-2015) daily rainfall data are compared. Twowater demand scenarios (i.e., lawn irrigation and toilet flushing) are included in the investigation. The water saving performance is positively affected by the increases in future rainfall at the four cities, while the stormwater capture performance is negatively affected as a larger tank size is required to achieve a desired stormwater capture efficiency in the future period. The responses of water saving and stormwater capture performances of RWH systems to climate change are varying with not only the system dimensions (i.e., storage capacity and catchment area), but also the water demand scenarios and locations. RWH systems with larger storage capacity for larger water demand scenarios at humid and semi-humid cities is expected to be more resilient to climate change. The various changing patterns of the performance indices highlight the importance of incorporating climate change in the design of RWH systems. Location-specific adaptive adjustments (e.g., adjusting tank sizes, catchment areas or water demand rates) need to be adopted so that RWH systems can sustainably meet water saving and stormwater control requirements under future climate conditions.

These stressors require innovative solutions that ensure the sustainability of water resources, without which the consequences could be dire for a region exposed to a host of vulnerabilities, including climate change. This review outlines the role of water markets in water management in times of water scarcity, highlighting the drivers of water markets in southern Africa, such as water scarcity, transboundary nature of water resources, and their uneven distribution. The review further discusses the role of water markets in climate change adaptation. Related institutional and legal frameworks as well as water allocation mechanisms are explored, aiming at improving water markets governance. The impact of adaptation to new water regimes in the face of scarcity are assessed by considering characteristics of current markets as related to future opportunities. In a diverse region such as southern Africa with unevenly distributed water resources, advancing the concept of water markets could play an important role in mitigating water scarcity challenges and promoting regional integration through coordinated transboundary water transfers. The emergence of water markets in the region is influenced by the continued depletion of water resources, which is resulting in the adoption of innovative water marketing strategies, such as inter-farm sharing or farm joint venture systems and inter-basin and intra-basin water transfers. As the concept is new in the region, it still has challenges that include general market inefficiencies, high transaction costs, market information asymmetries, imperfect competition, and weak or absent robust institutional frameworks that can facilitate market development.","[Matchaya, Greenwell; Nhamo, Luxon; Nhlengethwa, Sibusiso; Nhemachena, Charles] Int Water Management Inst IWMI SA, 141 Cresswell St,Weavind Pk, ZA-0184 Pretoria, South Africa",,"Nhamo, L (corresponding author), Int Water Management Inst IWMI SA, 141 Cresswell St,Weavind Pk, ZA-0184 Pretoria, South Africa.",g.matchaya@cgiar.org; l.nhamo@cgiar.org; s.nhlengethwa@cgiar.org; c.nhemachena@cgiar.org,"Nhamo, Luxon/AAO-1511-2021; Nhamo, Luxon/H-4000-2019","Nhamo, Luxon/0000-0003-2944-1769; Nhamo, Luxon/0000-0003-2944-1769; Nhlengethwa, Sibusiso/0000-0002-7687-3452; Matchaya, Greenwell/0000-0003-3035-1648",Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) through the International Food Policy Research Institute's (IFPRI); United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the International Food Policy Research Institute's (IFPRI); Regional Strategic Analysis and Knowledge Support System (ReSAKSS-SA) programme,Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) through the International Food Policy Research Institute's (IFPRI); United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the International Food Policy Research Institute's (IFPRI); Regional Strategic Analysis and Knowledge Support System (ReSAKSS-SA) programme,"This research was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the International Food Policy Research Institute's (IFPRI), the Regional Strategic Analysis and Knowledge Support System (ReSAKSS-SA) programme.",,86,20,20,11,30,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAY,2019,11,5,,,,,,,1006,10.3390/w11051006,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11051006,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,IE9FN,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000472680400136,View Full Record in Web of Science

System dynamics simulation was used to build a model and conduct policy analysis for a simulation period over the years 2000-2050. The model was built with a focus on the interaction among three factors: damage restoration costs from heavy rains, heat waves, and sea level rise; the total cost of food imports due to decreases in arable land and agricultural productivity; and changes in the government budget to respond to climate change problems. A policy experiment was conducted with the model under four scenarios mainly based on the government budget for climate change. The results indicated, firstly, that the climate budget needs to be increased to at least 13 trillion KoreanWon (US $11.6 billion) per year. Secondly, an earlier budget increase would more effectively reduce the total disaster restoration cost than a delayed budget increase. Third, if an earlier budget increase is difficult, the next best alternative would be to allocate a greater fraction of the climate budget to urban rather than to rural areas. Lastly, an early response to climate change would more effectively reduce food import costs, maintain agricultural productivity, and improve infrastructure for climate change adaptation than a delayed response. In conclusion, an earlier increase in the climate change budget would be more effective than a delayed budget increase of the same amount, and allocating a larger fraction of the climate budget to urban areas could be more cost-effective than increasing the budget, if urban and rural parties could agree on the method of allocation.","[Moon, Tae Hoon; Lee, Dong-Sung] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Real Estate, Seoul 06974, South Korea; [Kim, Dong-Hwan] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Publ Serv, Seoul 06974, South Korea; [Park, Chang Sug] Korea Environm Inst, Div Climate Change & Interdisciplinary Res, Sejong 30147, South Korea",Chung Ang University; Chung Ang University; Korea Environment Institute (KEI),"Moon, TH (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Real Estate, Seoul 06974, South Korea.;Kim, DH (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Dept Publ Serv, Seoul 06974, South Korea.",sapphire@cau.ac.kr; sddhkim@cau.ac.kr; plade@kei.re.kr; baby8803@cau.ac.kr,,,"Korea Environment Institute (KEI), Republic of Korea [GP2015-03-01]","Korea Environment Institute (KEI), Republic of Korea","This research was supported by research project #GP2015-03-01 through the Korea Environment Institute (KEI), Republic of Korea.",,47,6,6,0,13,MDPI AG,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2017,9,4,,,,,,,524,10.3390/su9040524,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9040524,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EV9FE,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000402090300047,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hitherto, in Hydrology, solutions of this equation mainly serve as an alimentation of the source term for the surface runoff modelling. Therefore, the complete resolution of the 3D model looks surplus to requirements and the infiltration is dealt either thanks to 1D vertical modelling of the Richards equation or through derivate models (like e.g. the Green-Ampt infiltration model or the Horton law), thus ignoring eventual horizontal transfers. Nowadays, the request for more detailed information is real, and the physics of groundwater unsaturated flow needs to be represented more reliably. This information could be furnished by the resolution of the complete 3D model, but, although numerically mastered and well documented, it is very costly for large scale - both in time and space real applications (climate change adaptation of watersheds). The authors propose an original solution decoupling the 3D equations into 1D vertical equations and a 2D depth-integrated horizontal equation. The aim is to consider independent vertical columns of infiltration coupled with lateral transfer of mass through the boundary conditions. On this basis, they postulate that the mass transfers in the three dimensions are correctly represented. This way problematic like the supply of the aquifers, the re-emergence of groundwater to surface water or especially the capability of memorization of past rainy events...could be reliably depicted. The two coupled models are solved on a unique numerical frame. A cell-centred Finite Volume method is used to solve the parabolic partial differential equations. The spatial derivatives are approximate by a second order central difference scheme, while the time splitting follows an implicit backward Euler scheme coupled with Picard iteration. The method has been tested and its reliability assessed on different theoretical two-dimensional cross-sectional test cases representing infiltration phenomena. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

These systems act as an integrating medium. They link climate, human activities and ecologic processes through groundwater and surface water interactions. For simulating these linkages an integrated regional hydrologic model has been coupled to an ecologic evaluation model. The simulated ecologic effects of climate change on mesotrophic riverine grasslands are clearly positive. Simulation results also indicate a high sensitivity of the peak discharges to the precipitation. For modelling the long-term development of land use and water management an integrated 'bio-economic' model has been constructed. It includes a model for the development of agriculture. Results for the autonomous development in reaction to climate change indicate a strong increase of field drainage by agriculture. This development would substantially reduce the predicted positive effects of climate change on riverine grasslands. The challenge is to guide regional developments in such a manner that opportunities for improving nature are not lost, but that at the same time the peak discharges are kept under control. Flow retardation in the 'fine arteries' of the upstream areas appear to be a viable option for the latter.

Options are selected and identified and discussed by stakeholders on the basis of a sectoral approach, and assessed with respect to their importance, urgency and other characteristics by experts. The preliminary quantitative assessment identifies incremental costs and benefits of adaptation options.

We have also undertaken climate modelling to ascertain long-term future trends of climate forcing.

It was through FCM-based simulations that we realised that a coastal river delta in a developing nation merits special attention for climate-resilient adaptation planning and execution. Measures that are likely to enhance adaptive capabilities of the local communities include those involving gender-responsive and adaptive governance, human resource capacity building, commitments of global communities for adaptation financing, education and awareness programmes, and embedding indigenous and local knowledge into decision making.","[Singh, Pramod K.; Chudasama, Harpalsinh] IRMA, Anand 388001, Gujarat, India; [Papageorgiou, Konstantinos] Univ Thessaly, Comp Sci Dept, Lamia 35100, Greece; [Papageorgiou, Elpiniki I.] Univ Thessaly, Fac Technol, Larisa 41500, Greece",Institute of Rural Management Anand; University of Thessaly,"Singh, PK (corresponding author), IRMA, Anand 388001, Gujarat, India.",pramod@irma.ac.in; konpapageorgiou@uth.gr; harpalsinh@irma.ac.in; elpinikipapageorgiou@uth.gr,"Singh, Pramod/AAS-1648-2021; Papageorgiou, Elpiniki/AAG-7122-2020","Singh, Pramod/0000-0003-2212-0583; Papageorgiou, Elpiniki/0000-0003-2498-9661; Papageorgiou, Konstantinos/0000-0002-6117-1220","Department of Science and Technology, Government of India","Department of Science and Technology, Government of India(Department of Science & Technology (India))","This research was funded by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.",,60,20,20,4,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2019,11,23,,,,,,,6655,10.3390/su11236655,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11236655,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KD9MV,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000508186400127,View Full Record in Web of Science

It seeks to identify effective institutional, participatory and collaborative processes involved in designing agricultural adaptation strategies at the national and sub-national levels in Germany, Finland, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. Its methodology is based on review of agricultural adaptation policy documents, research initiatives, stakeholder engagement processes, and cross-sectoral collaborations as well as interviews with key informants such as leaders and actors in adaptation planning. The gathered data show that early adapters have an improved regional and national understanding of climatic impacts, and of the risks to agriculture before the initiation of the planning process. The results indicate that the interplay between bottom-up and top-down initiatives has been crucial in the development of adaptation strategies. The former has provided rich and robust participation in designing, implementing and monitoring adaptations, while the latter was important for prioritizing and legitimizing the development of strategy. It also provided access to high-level decision makers and funding. The results of the study suggest that fostering cross-sectoral collaborations-especially by focusing on broader questions such as the role of agriculture in society-has become an important part of adaptation planning. Finally, our results also stress that adaptation planning in agriculture could be enhanced by skills development and mutual learning across stakeholder groups, research and policy-makers, and through the ongoing interactive development of institutional capabilities.","[Bizikova, Livia] Int Inst Sustainable Dev IISD, Ottawa, ON K1P 5E7, Canada; [Crawford, Erica] Univ British Columbia, Sch Community & Reg Planning SCARP, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Nijnik, Maria] James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Swart, Rob] Alterra Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Earth Syst Sci & Climate Change Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",University of British Columbia; James Hutton Institute; Wageningen University & Research,"Bizikova, L (corresponding author), Int Inst Sustainable Dev IISD, 75 Albert St, Ottawa, ON K1P 5E7, Canada.",lbizikova@iisd.ca,"Nijnik, Maria/AAW-4987-2020","Nijnik, Maria/0000-0003-0280-9543; Swart, Rob/0000-0002-1563-1150",Horizons; Institute for Forecasting at the Slovak Academy of Sciences [VEGA 2/0213/09 (1/2009-12/2012)]; Scottish Centre of Expertise on Climate Change; Environment and Rural Affairs Department of the Scottish Government,Horizons; Institute for Forecasting at the Slovak Academy of Sciences(Slovak Academy of Sciences); Scottish Centre of Expertise on Climate Change; Environment and Rural Affairs Department of the Scottish Government,"We would like to thank all of the interviewees participating in this study.

We explore to what extent organisational embedding of project teams, input in the project, and project governance influence project performance in climate adaptation projects. Our results indicate that aligning incentive systems and lower partner diversity lead to higher effectiveness and satisfaction. Project size enhances effectiveness, but decreases satisfaction. Satisfaction is enhanced by committed project members. Furthermore, dealing with diverse partner sets and large teams is not eased by careful management in the course of the project. Careful balancing of divergence and convergence should be taken into account during the design stage of these projects. In the context of knowledge co-production for environmental challenges, project management should proactively consider project structure, required level of partner diversity and project size.

Densely populated station squares are particularly important outdoor activity areas which more require the mitigation of thermal conditions during extreme weather. The traditional station square design focuses on the transport system and lacks the co-regulation of landscape services (e.g., climate change, scale, and element configuration). Moreover, holistic optimal design strategies are still deficient. This study examines how thermal comfort is positively affected by various landscape layout patterns, the configuration ratio of deciduous to evergreen trees and vegetation structure. We selected a typical station square of the Hokuriku region as an example, measured a landscape microclimate environment in winter and summer during extremely cold and hot days. The thermal comfort performance, represented by the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) thermal index, was compared using the ENVI-met simulation to reproduce the original case and new landscape design scenarios. The results indicated that planting trees in an array layout pattern with low PMV distributions improved thermal performance at 14:00 (0.3 PMV increase in winter and 1.3 PMV decrease in summer). The tree configuration ratio is a critical greening indicator that also regulates thermal comfort during the day and night. The finds of the research can be used optimized scenarios as a guide for urban station square design to mitigate thermal comfort issues and to promote the development of station square planning complying with climate-adaptive design strategies and the construction of sustainable cities.","[Xiao, Jing; Yuizono, Takaya] Japan Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Adv Sci & Technol, 1-1 Asahidai, Nomi, Ishikawa 9231292, Japan",Japan Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (JAIST),"Xiao, J (corresponding author), Japan Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Adv Sci & Technol, 1-1 Asahidai, Nomi, Ishikawa 9231292, Japan.",s1920419@jaist.ac.jp; yuizono@jaist.ac.jp,,"Xiao, Jing/0000-0001-7346-3426; Yuizono, Takaya/0000-0002-9576-362X",,,,,72,7,7,25,25,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

Many previous papers have highlighted the implications of different effort-sharing principles and schemes in determining national contributions to global mitigations. In this paper, China's energy transformation towards the 2 degrees C goal until 2100 is examined in an integrated-assessment model in light of different effort-sharing principles to understand how the application of such schemes may alter China's energy system transformation on a pathway to this long-term goal. Across scenarios, China's non-fossil energy will account for 50-70% and 85% of primary energy consumption in 2050 and 2100, respectively in the scenarios in this study. Fossil energy with carbon capture and storage technologies and non-fossil energy will dominate power generation in China over the long run. Coal will be phased out in end-use sectors and electricity use will expand regardless of the effort-sharing principles. The sensitivity analysis of long-term steady-state levels implies that the ultimate level that emissions could reach will have great influences on the energy system transformation in China.","[Pan Xunzhang] China Univ Petr, Acad Chinese Energy Strategy, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China; [Chen Wenying; Wang Lining] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Clarke, Leon E.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Wang Lining] CNPC, CNPC Econ & Technol Res Inst, Beijing 100724, Peoples R China; [Liu Guannan] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",China University of Petroleum; Tsinghua University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; China National Petroleum Corporation; Beihang University,"Wang, LN (corresponding author), CNPC, CNPC Econ & Technol Res Inst, Beijing 100724, Peoples R China.",wanglining87@126.com,"Chen, WY/HKN-5931-2023",,"Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China [71690243]; Science Foundation of China University of Petroleum, Beijing [2462016YJRC023]","Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science Foundation of China University of Petroleum, Beijing","This study was supported by the Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (71690243) and the Science Foundation of China University of Petroleum, Beijing (2462016YJRC023).",,56,52,55,7,92,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2017,103,,,,,,116,126,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.020,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP4NA,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000397356000010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Agroforestry systems occupy large areas in the Andes but climatic pressures, market volatility and diseases may result inagroforest abandonment, promoting secondary succession. Secondary forests are well-adapted and efficient carbon sinks whose conservation is vital to mitigate and adapt to climate change and to support biodiversity. Little is known, however, about how secondary TMF recover their aboveground biomass (AGB) and composition after abandonment. We established a 1.5 ha plot at 1780 masl on a 30-year old abandoned agroforest and compared it against two control forest plots at similar elevations. Agroforestry legacies influenced AGB leading to far lower stocks (42.3 +/- 5.4-59.6 +/- 7.9 Mg ha(-1) using allometric equations) than those expected after 30 years (106 +/- 33 Mg ha(-1)) based on IPCC standard growth rates for secondary montane forests. This suggests a regional overestimation of mitigation potentials when using IPCC standards. Satellite-derived AGB largely overestimated our plot values (179 +/- 27.3 Mg ha(-1)). Secondary growth rates (1.41-2.0 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for DBH >= 10 cm) indicate recovery times of ca. 69 to 97 years to reach average control AGB values (137 +/- 12.3 Mg ha(-1)). This is 26 years above the average residence time of montane forests at our elevation (71 +/- 1.91 years) suggesting a non-recovery or far slower recovery to control AGB values. Three variables appear to define this outcome compared to the control plots: lower DBH (15.8 +/- 5.9 cm vs 19.8 +/- 11.0 cm), lower basal area (12.67 +/- 0.7 vs 28.03 +/- 1.5 m(2) ha(-1)) and higher abundance of lighter-wood tree genera (0.46 +/- 0.10 vs 0.57 +/- 0.11 gr cm(3)) such as Inga, a common shade-tree in Andean agroforests. With 3.2 million hectares committed to restoration, Peru needs to target currently neglected TMF recovery schemes to support biodiversity, water and carbon storage and fulfill its international commitments.","[Aragon, Susan; Salinas, Norma; Nina-Quispe, Alex; Huaman Qquellon, Vicky; Rayme Paucar, Gloria; Huaman, Wilfredo; Chambi Porroa, Percy; Olarte, Juliana C.; Cruz, Rudi; Salas Yupayccana, Carlos; Boza Espinoza, Tatiana E.; Tito, Richard; Cosio, Eric G.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru PUCP, Inst Nat Earth & Energy INTE, Av Univ 1801, Lima 15088, Peru; [Muniz, Julia G.] Univ Nacl San Antonio Abad Cusco, Escuela Biol, Av Cultura S-N, Cuzco 08003, Peru; [Roman-Cuesta, Rosa Maria] Univ Wageningen, Dept Environm Sci, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, POB 476700AA, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Roman-Cuesta, Rosa Maria] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, POB 0113 BOCBD, Bogor 16000, Indonesia",Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru; Universidad Nacional de San Antonio Abad del Cusco; Wageningen University & Research; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),"Aragon, S (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru PUCP, Inst Nat Earth & Energy INTE, Av Univ 1801, Lima 15088, Peru.",saragongeo@yahoo.com,"Tito, Richard/ABI-7894-2020; Boza Espinoza, Tatiana Erika/AHC-5048-2022; Aragón, Susan/R-5218-2019; Salinas, Norma/K-8960-2015","Tito, Richard/0000-0002-4184-5654; Aragón, Susan/0000-0002-7364-6094; Cruz Chino, Rudi Saul/0000-0003-1463-8278; Centeno Olarte, Juliana Carmensilvia/0000-0002-6425-4603; Roman-Cuesta, Rosa Maria/0000-0002-6945-8402; Salinas, Norma/0000-0001-9941-2109; Boza Espinoza, Tatiana Erika/0000-0002-9925-1795",CONCYTEC (Peru) - World Bank grant [011-2019-FONDECYT-BM-INC-INV],CONCYTEC (Peru) - World Bank grant,This work was supported by a CONCYTEC (Peru) -World Bank grant (Contract 011-2019-FONDECYT-BM-INC-INV).

The ecosystem is fragile and sensitive to climate change. Grassland ecosystem not only provides essential ecological and life functions for human society but also plays a vital role in mitigating and adapting to climate change. The empirical literature on grassland ecosystem services value (ESV) does not consider the impact of climate change and regional economic development level factors, which prevents policymakers from making appropriate decisions. This paper aims to analyze the influencing factors of grassland ESV assessment, and, based on the meta-prediction model, account the grassland ESV in Qinghai province. Design/methodology/approach To understand the value of grassland ecosystem services in China under climate change, this paper used 61 research literature on the evaluation of grassland ESV in China, including a total of 564 value observations to establish a value transfer database. Based on the meta-analysis method, this study has constructed a value transfer model, to evaluate the grassland ESV in Qinghai province, and an interpretation model, which can analyze if the independent variables affect the grassland ESV significantly. Findings The study finds that the evaluation methods, types of ecosystem service functions, climate change and grassland types can affect the grassland ESV significantly. Based on the meta-regression prediction model to evaluate the grassland ESV in Qinghai is US$1,542.67/ha/year. It indicates several targeted approaches to increase the grassland ESV, and climate change also has a specific impact on the value of grassland ecosystem services. Research limitations/implications This study provides a scientific basis for grassland management related to the development of grasslands and ecological compensation, as well as promote the sustainable development of grassland ecosystems. Originality/value This paper contributes to the field of grassland ESV assessment in at least three aspects; first, it innovatively introduces the meta-analysis to carry out an integrated analysis of previous research results; second, it includes a broader set of influence variables in the analysis, including meteorological and economic factors; and third, it establishes a methodological basis for the field of grassland ESV accounting.","[Kang, Binyue; Xu, Hengkang; Jiang, Fengyan; Wei, Xiaoting; Shao, Xinqing] China Agr Univ, Coll Grassland Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Kang, Binyue] Nankai Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Shao, Qiuyu] Univ Sci & Technol, Beijing Dongling Sch Econ & Management, Haidian, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; Nankai University,"Shao, XQ (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Grassland Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",13982787876@163.com; stephanieshao1999@163.com; xuhengkang@cau.edu.cn; jiangfy@cau.edu.cn; weixiaoting6@163.com; shaoxinqing@163.com,"Hengkang, Xu/AHD-5032-2022","Kang, Binyue/0000-0002-6530-0560",,,,,53,5,5,9,75,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

We comprehensively assessed the potential impacts of PSF on rice and flour consumption, rice and wheat planting, energy and nutrient supply, irrigation-water, chemical nitrogen (N), phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) and potassium oxide (K2O) fertilizer inputs and total greenhouse gases (GHG) emission for potatoes, rice and wheat, by assuming different proportions of potato substitutes for rice and flour. The results showed that per capita, 2.9 +/- 0.3 and 4.7 +/- 0.5 kg more potatoes per year would enter the Chinese staple-food diet, under the government's target. PSF consumed are expected to reach 5.2 +/- 0.7 Tg yr(-1), equivalent to substituting potatoes for 4.2 +/- 0.8-8.5 +/- 0.8 Tg yr(-1) wheat and 5.1 +/- 0.9-10.1 +/- 1.8 Tg yr(-1) rice under different scenarios. While this substitution can increase the nutrient supply index by 63% towards nutrient reference values, it may induce no significant effect on staple-food energy supply with lower chemical fertilizer (except for K2O) and irrigation-water inputs and GHG emissions in different substitution scenarios than the business as usual scenario. The reduction in rice and wheat demands lead to wheat in the North China Plain and early rice decrease by 6.1-11.4% and 12.1-24.1%, respectively. The total GHG reduction is equal to 1.1-9.0% of CO2 equivalent associated with CH4 and N2O emitted from the Chinese agroecosystem in 2005. The saved irrigation water for three crops compared to 2012 reaches the total water use of 17.9 +/- 4.9-21.8 +/- 5.9 million people in 2015. More N fertilizer, irrigation-water, and GHG can be reduced, if the PSF ratio is increased to 50% together with potato yield improves to the optimal level. Our results implied that the PSF policy is worth doing not only because of the healthier diets, but also to mitigate resource inputs and GHG emissions and it also supports agricultural structure adjustments in the areas of irrigated wheat on the North China Plain and early rice across China, designed to increase the adaptability to climate change.","[Gao, Bing; Huang, Wei; Hu, Yuanchao; Wang, Lan; Ding, Shengping; Cui, Shenghui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Urban Environm, Key Lab Urban Environm & Hlth, Xiamen 361021, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Gao, Bing; Hu, Yuanchao; Cui, Shenghui] Xiamen Key Lab Urban Metab, Xiamen 361021, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Huang, Wei; Wang, Lan; Ding, Shengping] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Xue, Xiaobo] SUNY Albany, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Albany, NY 12144 USA; [Huang, Yunfeng] Jimei Univ, Sch Biotechnol Engn, Xiamen 361021, Fujian, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Urban Environment, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; Jimei University","Cui, SH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Urban Environm, Key Lab Urban Environm & Hlth, Xiamen 361021, Fujian, Peoples R China.;Cui, SH (corresponding author), Xiamen Key Lab Urban Metab, Xiamen 361021, Fujian, Peoples R China.",shcui@iue.ac.cn,"Ding, Shengping/GZK-2694-2022; Gao, Bing/AAV-1324-2021; CAS, KLUEH/T-5743-2019","Hu, Yuanchao/0000-0002-1965-5395; Huang, Wei/0000-0003-0639-9887","Young Talents Projects of the Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences [IUEMS201402]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71704171]; National Basic Research Program of China [2014CB953801]; International (regional) cooperation and exchange programs; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC-JPI_UE) [7181101187]","Young Talents Projects of the Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); International (regional) cooperation and exchange programs; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC-JPI_UE)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This research was funded by the Young Talents Projects of the Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IUEMS201402), the International (regional) cooperation and exchange programs, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC-JPI_UE, 7181101187), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71704171), and the National Basic Research Program of China (2014CB953801).",,56,14,14,5,31,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The United States (US), China, and Australia have all made adaptation attempts through legislative, executive, and judicial action. However, because the systems of law and governance of the three countries differ, the ways in which adaptation issues are managed vary. State and local adaptation planning functions as the leading adaptation pathway in the US, whereas in Australia judicial intervention is more influential than executive action. By contrast, China relies primarily on policy to manage adaptation issues. This article argues that the differences in adaptation responses are the result of a complex combination of factors, which include climate politics and awareness of adaptation, the status of environmental principles, and the role of the judiciary. This analysis helps in identifying the opportunities and barriers associated with different adaptation solutions, and also contributes to cross-jurisdictional learning.","[He, Xiangbai] Soochow Univ, Kenneth Wang Sch Law, Suzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Soochow University - China,"He, XB (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Kenneth Wang Sch Law, Suzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xiangbaitree@163.com,,,Chinese Ministry of Education's Young Scholar Research Project on Humanities and Social Science [16YJC820010],Chinese Ministry of Education's Young Scholar Research Project on Humanities and Social Science,"I wish to thank Bruce Huber, Justin Gundlach and Alexander Zahar for their valuable comments, and am also grateful for the valuable advice from four anonymous peer reviewers.

To that end, it is critical to conserve soil fertility, promote ecological agriculture, employ climate change adaptation technology, significantly enhance irrigated agriculture, and decrease agricultural production risks. Sustainable agricultural production requires optimized land usage, increased energy efficiency, reduced use of fossil fuels, and minimized environmental consequences. Energy has been used in agriculture in a dramatically increased manner, and the agri-food chain now accounts for 30% of the total global energy use. Energy analysis quantifies the amount of energy used in agricultural production, so it may be used to optimize energy consumption and boost energy efficiency, further propelling the sustainable development of agriculture. Recently, the Mongolian government has expressed concerns about how to realize food sustainability and self-sufficiency in wheat production and agriculture, while also maintaining environmental sustainability. However, there is a substantial study gap between agriculture and energy analysis in Mongolia. This study investigated energy consumption and the effects of energy inputs and energy types on the agricultural production of Mongolia from 2005 to 2018. The output was calculated based on the annual wheat equivalent for the 14 major provinces as a whole. The output level is given as a function of human labor, machinery, electricity, diesel fuel, fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation water, and seed energy, and the yield and different energy inputs are determined using the ordinary least squares of the Cobb-Douglas function. Total energy input grew from 2359.50 MJ ha(-1) in 2005 to 3047.61 MJ ha(-1) in 2018, while total output energy increased from 2312.08 MJ ha(-1) to 4562.56 MJ ha(-1). During this period, the energy use efficiency (input-output ratio), energy productivity, and net energy of wheat production were studied. The fertilizer inputs were statistically significant. The contribution of nitrogen, diesel, and irrigation water towards the production level was 3.52, 3.09, and 2.33, respectively. As a result, the data indicated that non-renewable, direct, and indirect energy sources all had a positive impact on the output level. Furthermore, non-renewable energy in Mongolian agriculture has been used in a significantly increased manner.","[Bayasgalankhuu, Lyankhua; Ilahi, Sara; Wei, Wenshan; Wu, Yongchang] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Dev, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Bayasgalankhuu, Lyankhua] Mongolian Acad Sci, Bot Garden & Res Inst, Dept Vegetat Ecol & Plant Econ, Ulaanbaatar 13330, Mongolia","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Economics & Development, CAAS; Mongolian Academy of Sciences","Wu, YC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Dev, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",lyalya2020@gmail.com; Saraimran1303@gmail.com; weiwenshan@caas.cn; wuyongchang@caas.cn,,,Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Project of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences [ASTIP-IAED-21-07],Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Project of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,This study was supported by Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Project of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (grant number: ASTIP-IAED-21-07).,,37,0,0,7,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9717,,PROCESSES,Processes,FEB,2022,10,2,,,,,,,190,10.3390/pr10020190,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr10020190,,,14,"Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,ZN6KZ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000765142000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we focused on the Ningxia Plain in China, an important wine grape (Vitis vinifera L.) growing region. Based on the daily average air temperature data from 1981 to 2017, we investigated changes in the planting boundaries of different climate zones for wine grape before and after 1997 (when an abrupt change in regional air temperature occurred). The goal of this study is to provide scientific evidence for local agricultural authorities to make long-term climate change adaptation plans. We used the effective accumulated temperature as an indicator to evaluate the inter-decadal changes in the climate zones for wine grape. We concluded as follows: (1) since the abrupt change in regional air temperature in 1997, the subtotal area of climate zone I for wine grape was reduced by 31%, while the subtotal area of climate zone II (moved southward) and III (part of climate zone II in the northern part of the region turned into climate zone III) for wine grape was expanded by 7% and 24%, respectively; (2) during the 1990s, climate zone III for wine grape emerged in the study region; during the 2000s, the planting boundaries of climate zone II and III moved southward; during the period of 2011-2017, climate zone I (suitable) for wine grape mostly vanished in the Ningxia Plain; and (3) since the abrupt change in regional air temperature in 1997, most of the area in the Eastern Foothills of the Helan Mountains turned from climate zone II to climate zone III for wine grape, with the exceptions of Hongsipu district and the relatively high altitude area. During the 37 study years, most of the area in the study region remained as climate zone II for wine grape with a probability of 80%. Overall, the climate zones for wine grape in Ningxia, China have changed against the background of global warming. In particular, the wine grape varieties and wine types are expected to be changed in the Helan Mountains area in order to adapt to the ongoing climate change.","[Wang, Jing; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Li, Hongying; Zhang, Lei; Wei, Jianguo] China Meteorol Adm, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster Monitoring & Early Warn, Yinchuan 750002, Ningxia, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jing; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Li, Hongying; Zhang, Lei; Wei, Jianguo] Ningxia Key Lab Meteorol Disaster Prevent & Reduc, Yinchuan 750002, Ningxia, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jing; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Li, Hongying; Zhang, Lei] Ningxia Meteorol Sci Inst, Yinchuan 750002, Ningxia, Peoples R China; [Su, Long] Domaine Chandon Ningxia Moet Hennessy Co Ltd, Yongning 750100, Peoples R China; [Wei, Jianguo] Ningxia Meteorol Informat Ctr, Yinchuan 750002, Ningxia, Peoples R China",China Meteorological Administration,"Zhang, XY (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster Monitoring & Early Warn, Yinchuan 750002, Ningxia, Peoples R China.;Zhang, XY (corresponding author), Ningxia Key Lab Meteorol Disaster Prevent & Reduc, Yinchuan 750002, Ningxia, Peoples R China.;Zhang, XY (corresponding author), Ningxia Meteorol Sci Inst, Yinchuan 750002, Ningxia, Peoples R China.",zhang_xynet@163.com,"zhang, xiaoyu/HJI-4374-2023; ZHU, XIAOYU/HJY-7240-2023",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41675114]; Climate Change Special Fund of China Meteorological Administration [CCSF201511]; Key Research and Development Program of Ningxia Hui autonomous region [2018 BFH03012]; Natural Science Foundation of Ningxia [NZ16202],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Climate Change Special Fund of China Meteorological Administration; Key Research and Development Program of Ningxia Hui autonomous region; Natural Science Foundation of Ningxia,"This study is funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 41675114), Climate Change Special Fund of China Meteorological Administration (Grant no.

Future leaders must make decisions from an informed position and the public will need to embed climate change mitigation tools into their work and private life. It is therefore essential to understand the range of CCE strategies being taken globally by Higher Education Institutions (HEls) and to explore and analyse the ways that HEIs could better address this challenge. Consistent with this research need, this paper offers an analysis of the extent to which HEIs in 45 countries approach CCE and provides a conceptual framework for exploring how HEls are embedding CCE into their curricula. In addition to the specialist approach (where students choose to study a degree to become experts in climate change adaptation and mitigation tools), the CCE framework developed identifies and highlights three other approaches HEls can deploy to embed CCE: Piggybacking, mainstreaming and connecting (transdisciplinary). Using data gathered in an explorative international survey involving participants working across academic and senior management, this paper illustrates the different approaches taken and analyses practical examples of current CCE practice from across the world. Responses from 212 university staff from 45 countries indicated that CCE was highly variable - no clear pattern was identified at the country level, with CCE approaches varying significantly, even within individual HEls. This plurality highlights the wide range of ideas and examples being shared and used by institutions in very different countries and contexts, and underlines the importance of the independence and autonomy of HEIs so that they can choose the right CCE approaches for them. To highlight the breadth and variety of approaches that were uncovered by our survey, the paper offers a range of examples illustrating how climate change education may be embedded in a higher education context, some of which could be replicated in HEls across the world. The conceptualisation of CCE and the examples given in this paper are valuable for anyone who is thinking about strategies for embedding more climate education in the higher education curriculum.

As the need for adaptation actions increase, how finance is used to enable adaptation plays a vital role in the resilience of infrastructure. This research aims to understand how infrastructure adaptation measures are carried out, focusing on how financing is used to aid such efforts. Exploratory interviews with infrastructure and finance practitioners from a broad range of organisations were conducted to understand the dynamics of how infrastructure adaptation occurs. The findings reveal that infrastructure agencies conduct adaptation activities to maintain the serviceability of assets under climate change risks, with most climate financing targeting mitigation rather than adaptation. Most actions are taken at individual asset or agency level with little collaboration across agencies and sectors.

In the form of crops and livestock and associated knowledge on their cultivation and use, food-related biocultural diversity likewise underpins global food security. As food system transformation is increasingly recognized as an urgent priority, we argue that food security, sustainability, resilience, and adaptive capacity can be furthered through greater emphasis on conservation, use, and celebration of food-related biocultural diversity. We provide examples from the Parque de la Papa, Peru, a food biocultural diversity neighborhood which through advocacy and partnerships based around its diversity, has both enhanced local communities and contributed to food security at a much larger scale. We outline collaborative actions which we believe are important to up- and out-scale food biocultural diversity neighborhood successes. Further research and knowledge sharing are critical to better document, understand, track, and communicate the value, functions, and state of biocultural diversity in food systems. Expanded training and capacity development opportunities are important to enable the interchange of experiences and visions on food, health, sustainability and resilience, climate adaptation, equity and justice, and livelihood generation with others facing similar challenges. Finally, strengthened networking across food biocultural diversity neighborhoods is essential to their persistence and growth as they increasingly engage with local, national, and international organizations, based on shared interests and on their own terms, across five continents.","[Argumedo, Alejandro] Int Network Mt Indigenous Peoples INMIP, Cuzco, Peru; [Argumedo, Alejandro] Swift Fdn, Santa Fe, NM USA; [Song, Yiching] Chinese Acad Sci, Environm Programme Int Ecosyst Management Partner, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Song, Yiching] Farmer Seeds Network, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Khoury, Colin K.] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Cali, Colombia; [Khoury, Colin K.] San Diego Bot Garden, Encinitas, CA USA; [Hunter, Danny] Alliance Biovers Int & Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Rome, Italy; [Dempewolf, Hannes; Guarino, Luigi] Global Crop Div Trust, Bonn, Germany; [de Haan, Stef] Int Potato Ctr CIP, Lima, Peru",Chinese Academy of Sciences; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; CGIAR; International Potato Center (CIP),"Khoury, CK (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Cali, Colombia.;Khoury, CK (corresponding author), San Diego Bot Garden, Encinitas, CA USA.",c.khoury@cgiar.org,"Khoury, Colin K./AAA-1864-2020","Khoury, Colin K./0000-0001-7893-5744",Global Alliance for the Future of Food,Global Alliance for the Future of Food,Funding An early version of this work was supported by the Global Alliance for the Future of Food.

Increasing the level of dual-use benefits is therefore a viable way of reducing corruption in contexts of poor governance. We test this hypothesis using data from a survey of 1,901 households living near four recently completed climate projects and interviews with over 30 key informants. The results indicate that households are more likely to monitor climate projects if they provide dual-use benefits and households with above-average incomes from agricultural and business activities are the most likely to benefit from dual-use attributes. Furthermore, we find that higher levels of monitoring by these influential households are associated with reduced corruption during project implementation.","[Khan, Mushtaq; Watkins, Mitchell] SOAS Univ London, London, England; [Aminuzzaman, Salahuddin; Khair, Sumaiya; Khan, Muhammad Zakir Hossain] Transparency Int Bangladesh, Dhaka, Bangladesh",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Khan, M (corresponding author), SOAS Univ London, London, England.",mk100@soas.ac.uk,,"Watkins, Mitchell/0000-0001-9816-1926","UK aid from the UK Government [GB-1-203752, P07073]",UK aid from the UK Government(CGIAR),"This publication is an output of the SOAS Anti-Corruption Evidence (ACE) research consortium funded by UK aid from the UK Government [IATI Identifier: GB-1-203752, Contract P07073].

Using a county-panel dataset spanning the past 35 years, we evaluate the impact of global warming on agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) as well as the impacts on agricultural inputs and outputs in China. Results show that, in the short run, extreme heat has negative effects on China's agricultural TFP and input utilization, which results in a more negative effect on agricultural output measured by yield. However, longer-run adaptation has offset 37.9% of the short-run effects of extreme heat exposure on TFP, while climate adaptation mitigates agricultural output loss to a greater extent due to more flexible adjustment in labor, fertilizer, and machines in the long run. Despite the detected climate adaptation, projections of impacts under future climate change scenarios still imply a substantial loss in China's agriculture.","[Chen, Shuai; Gong, Binlei] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev CARD, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Chen, Shuai; Gong, Binlei] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Hangzhou, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University,"Gong, BL (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev CARD, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.",gongbinlei@zju.edu.cn,"chen, shuai/GXG-9235-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71903172, 71703149]; Research Program for Humanities and Social Science by Chinese Ministry of Education [18YJC790034]; Soft Science Research Program of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs [RKX202001A]; Soft Science Research Program of Zhejiang Province [2020C25020]; Qianjiang Talent Program [QJC1902008]; National Social Science Foundation of China [19ZDA106]; EfD Initiative of the University of Gothenburg through Sida; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Academy of Social Governance at Zhejiang University","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Program for Humanities and Social Science by Chinese Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, China); Soft Science Research Program of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs; Soft Science Research Program of Zhejiang Province; Qianjiang Talent Program; National Social Science Foundation of China; EfD Initiative of the University of Gothenburg through Sida; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Academy of Social Governance at Zhejiang University","We are grateful to Jikun Huang, Eldon Ball, Frank Scrimgeour, Carlos San Juan Mesonada, Nillabja Ghosh, Songqing Jin, Shiji Zhao, Paul McNamara, Huanguang Qiu, Jinxia Wang, Yu Sheng, Shingo Kimura, Wei Si, Junfei Bai, Jian Zhang and the participants at the Second CCAP's Workshop on Measuring China's Agricultural Total Factor Productivity and Its International Comparison.

Although information effects are widely documented in stated preference studies, the reasons underlying the effects are less established. We focus on information about the policy context of the valuation scenario and examine two pathways which may help explain how including such information in a survey affects stated preferences. We hypothesize and empirically analyze whether the information effects on stated preferences can emerge as a result of changed perceptions about (1) the survey consequentiality and (2) the credibility of the valuation scenario upon facing the additional information. Our results confirm that the frequently found information effects can be present in the context of urban green and climate adaptation. The role of the additional information appears to be negligible for consequentiality perceptions. In contrast, the additional information strengthens the perceived credibility, and this may partially explain the information effects on stated preferences. We conclude that stated preference research may benefit from an increased attention to perceived credibility of the valuation scenario.","[Welling, Malte] Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus, Chair Environm Econ, Cottbus, Germany; [Welling, Malte] Inst Ecol Econ Res, Berlin, Germany; [Zawojska, Ewa] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland; [Sagebiel, Julian] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden",Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus; University of Warsaw; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Welling, M (corresponding author), Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus, Chair Environm Econ, Cottbus, Germany.;Welling, M (corresponding author), Inst Ecol Econ Res, Berlin, Germany.",malte.welling@ioew.de; ewa.zawojska@uw.edu.pl; julian.sagebiel@slu.se,,"Welling, Malte/0000-0001-9051-6913",Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,65,0,0,3,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The results showed that the bargaining power of both banks and enterprises had an important influence on the final financing price. In the bargaining process, new-energy companies were at a disadvantage, and financing prices were 17.2% higher than fair prices. The nature of state-owned enterprises hinders the improvement of the bargaining power of new-energy enterprises.

The case studies are intended to provide a context for thinking about adaptive capacity with stakeholders in the four areas of human settlement and health; energy: agriculture, forestry and fisheries; and ecosystems and biodiversity. The case studies demonstrate that adaptive capacity varies with context and is affected by the complexity, technology, leadership, institutions and imaginative resources inherent to the social system examined. To increase the possibilities for reflection by stakeholders, the case studies were used to create a set of historical scenarios that explore some of the key features of human responses to challenges such as climate change.

This study evaluated the annual forest ecosystem service values (ESVs) and their spatial evolution characteristics from 2001 to 2020 in China and revealed the impact of climatic factors as well. The equivalent factor method was applied to calculate ESVs in combination with net primary productivity (NPP) calculated by the CASA model. The water conservation results based on the InVEST model and equivalent factor method were compared to test the reliability of the method. From 2001 to 2020, the annual forest ESVs ranged from RMB 9.17 trillion to 10.81 trillion, with an average of RMB 9.99 trillion in China. The forest ESVs increased from the northwest to the southeast regions of China with the lowest values of less than RMB 3 million per square kilometer and relatively high values of more than RMB 9 million per square kilometer. In the past 20 years, the forest ESVs have shown a significant increasing trend, especially in the Northeast Forest Region and Southeast Forest Region. The ESVs have decreased only in very few forest areas such as Cuona and Motuo counties on the southern edge of Tibet Province in Southwest China and Pingtung and Kaohsiung counties in southern Taiwan. The mean annual forest ESV was necessarily higher in the recent 10 years (2011-2020, RMB 10.43 trillion) than in the previous 10 years (2001-2010, RMB 9.55 trillion), while the spatial growth rate was usually less than 20%. The annual forest ESVs were significantly correlated with temperature, precipitation and evapotranspiration but not with sunshine hours and relative humidity across the 20 years. In most areas (>60%), the positive impact of various climatic factors was dominant, and the area positively affected by precipitation was the largest (76%). The mean annual forest water conservation from 2001 to 2020 was RMB 1.46 trillion based on the InVEST model and was RMB 1.77 trillion based on the equivalent factor method. Overall, the results obtained by the two methods are roughly equal and mostly spatially matched.

While extreme events have been hypothesized to stimulate organization change and act as windows of opportunity and pacemakers driving toward adaptation, they do not always seem to do so. We therefore sought to understand the responses and motivations for organizational behavior in the wake of two significant droughts across five smaller water systems in Western Colorado, USA. We conducted interviews and focus groups across these systems to understand whether and why significant droughts in 2002 and 2012 prompted adaptive change. Results indicate that systems did not uniformly decide to change their policies in the wake of drought, and even well-prepared systems were driven to change policies by other pressures, such as peer-system pressure and political pressure from residents. We find that organizational worldviews were important mediators of how the experience of drought manifest, or not, in organizational changes. These findings have implications for assumptions about what might drive organizational learning and change among water managers for climate adaptation in the future.","[Page, Rebecca] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program & Western Water Assessme, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Dilling, Lisa] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Ctr Sci & Technol Policy Res, Environm Studies Program,Western Water Assessment, UCB 397, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Dilling, L (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Ctr Sci & Technol Policy Res, Environm Studies Program,Western Water Assessment, UCB 397, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",ldilling@colorado.edu,,"Dilling, Lisa/0000-0001-5061-0809",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Sectoral Applications Research Program [NA16OAR4310132],National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Sectoral Applications Research Program,"We thank all of the Western Slope water managers who gave of their time to participate in this study.

Zeotropic mixture R32/R236fa is employed due to its characteristic of temperature glide during phase change. A module for composition regulation is incorporated based on boiling point difference of zeotropic mixture. High/low boiling point component increasing modes are operated when indoor air state deviates from the accuracy standard. Temperature glide regions of non-isothermal cooling sources change with the concentration of zeotropic mixture, which conforms to cascade utilization for moisture and heat load removal. The cooling and dehumidifying capacity of the chiller is regulated correspondingly. The models of evaporation temperature glide, affordable e, cooling and dehumidification efficiency are established. The effects on the affordable e are analyzed with the changing outdoor meteorological parameters and indoor personnel fluctuation. The relationship between mass concentration of working fluid and sliding temperature regions is revealed. The affordable e varies from 3500 to 4700 kJ/kg, which illustrates that the CATHICS can totally afford changing heat and humidity load. The cooling and dehumidification efficiency are approximately 3.2 and 1.2. The vapor quality of the working fluid from the condenser is analyzed. The highly-integrated CATHICS is suitable for realizing individualized thermal comfort in residential buildings.","[Zhu, Yutong; Yin, Yonggao] Southeast Univ, Sch Energy & Environm, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China,"Yin, YG (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Energy & Environm, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",y.yin@seu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [52076039]; National Key Research and Development Plan Project of China [2019YFB1504301],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Plan Project of China,This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 52076039] and the National Key Research and Development Plan Project of China (2019YFB1504301) .,,36,5,5,4,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

The primary emission sources of HFC-134a are its use as a refrigerant, and in the industrial sector, during the manufacturing of foam. International regulations have addressed the concerns related to HFC-134a treatment technologies, and more stringent guidelines have been introduced. Diverse strategies and treatment technologies are employed for the reduction in emission of HFC-134a, that is, recovery methods, incineration, plasma treatment, and catalytic decomposition (pyrolysis and hydrolysis) technologies. HFC-134a decomposition is an important step when coping with climate change. All the methods have shown promising results for HFC-134a abatement.

Adaptation measures to reduce the sensitivity of a city to climate risks are therefore of particular importance. Nevertheless, it is also common to develop compact and dense urban areas to reduce urban sprawl. Urban infill development and sustainable spatial climate policies are thus in apparent conflict with each other. This article examines how German cities deal with the tensions between these two policy fields. Using six case studies, a new heuristic analysis method is applied. This study identifies three key governance aspects that are essential for promoting the joint implementation: instruments, organisation and interaction. Based on our case studies, we conclude that successful implementation can only be achieved through integrative governance including all three domains.","[Eichhorn, Sebastian] ILS Res Inst Reg & Urban Dev, Dept Spatial Planning & Urban Design, Dortmund, Germany; [Rusche, Karsten] Fed Univ Appl Adm Sci, Dept Econ, Munster, Germany; [Weith, Thomas] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Dept Codesign Change & Innovat, Working Grp Codesign Change & Innovat, Muncheberg, Germany; [Weith, Thomas] Univ Potsdam, Dept Spatial Planning & Environm Dev, Potsdam, Germany",Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); University of Potsdam,"Eichhorn, S (corresponding author), ILS Res Inst Reg & Urban Dev, Dept Spatial Planning & Urban Design, Dortmund, Germany.",sebastian.eichhorn@ils-forschung.de,,"Rusche, Karsten/0000-0003-1866-7498; Eichhorn, Sebastian/0000-0003-3825-0614","Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Agriculture, Nature Conservation and Consumer Protection of the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany [17-08.02.01-25/15]","Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Agriculture, Nature Conservation and Consumer Protection of the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany","Funded by the Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Agriculture, Nature Conservation and Consumer Protection of the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany (17-08.02.01-25/15).",,88,3,3,4,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

In the UK, much of this impact is likely to arise by amplifying existing risks related to heat exposure, flooding, and chemical and biological contamination in buildings. Identifying the health effects of climate change on the indoor environment, and risks and opportunities related to climate change adaptation and mitigation, can help protect public health. We explored a range of health risks in the domestic indoor environment related to climate change, as well as the potential health benefits and unintended harmful effects of climate change mitigation and adaptation policies in the UK housing sector. We reviewed relevant scientific literature, focusing on housing-related health effects in the UK likely to arise through either direct or indirect mechanisms of climate change or mitigation and adaptation measures in the built environment. We considered the following categories of effect: (i)indoor temperatures, (ii) indoor air quality, (iii) indoor allergens and infections, and (iv) flood damage and water contamination. Climate change may exacerbate health risks and inequalities across these categories and in a variety of ways, if adequate adaptation measures are not taken. Certain changes to the indoor environment can affect indoor air quality or promote the growth and propagation of pathogenic organisms. Measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions have the potential for ancillary public health benefits including reductions in health burdens related heat and cold, indoor exposure to air pollution derived from outdoor sources, and mould growth. However, increasing airtightness of dwellings in pursuit of energy efficiency could also have negative effects by increasing concentrations of pollutants (such as PM2.5, CO and radon) derived from indoor or ground sources, and biological contamination. These effects can largely be ameliorated by mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) and air filtration, where such solution is feasible and when the system is properly installed, operated and maintained. Groups at high risk of these adverse health effects include the elderly (especially those living on their own), individuals with pre-existing illnesses, people living in overcrowded accommodation, and the socio-economically deprived. A better understanding of how current and emerging building infrastructure design, construction, and materials may affect health in the context of climate change and mitigation and adaptation measures is needed in the UK and other high income countries. Long-term, energy efficient building design interventions, ensuring adequate ventilation, need to be promoted.

There remain outstanding political dangers and obstacles for extreme weather attribution if it is to be used, as some claim it can and should be, for guiding climate adaptation investments, for servicing the putative loss and damage agenda of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change or for underpinning legal claims for liability for damages caused by extreme weather.","Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; King's College London,"Hulme, M (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London WC2R 2LS, England.",mike.hulme@kcl.ac.uk,"Hulme, Mike/F-9012-2010","Hulme, Mike/0000-0002-1273-7662",,,,,72,107,109,28,179,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0309-1333,1477-0296,,PROG PHYS GEOG,Prog.

While many possible solutions are known, effective adaptation strategies have been insufficiently implemented to ameliorate urban climate problems. Reasons for this 'implementation gap' such as the level of awareness about implementable solutions have received little attention in the literature. An important question thus remains unanswered: what do different urban actors (citizens; politicians; urban planners and designers; and urban climate experts) who shape the urban environment and thus its climate, know about urban climate adaptation measures? We conducted a pilot study using semi-structured interviews with specialists in the field of urban sustainability related to urban planning and climate in ten countries worldwide. Interview results indicated that awareness of adaptation measures differs between countries, but even more so between different actor groups. Citizens and politicians are less aware than urban planners or designers and urban climate experts. Awareness raising should involve media campaigns, further education and display of good practice.

In addition, they should be economically efficient, that is their benefits should exceed their costs, Although many measures are appropriate anticipatory measures, not all of them need to be implemented now, Those most in need of immediate implementation should meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) address irreversible or costly impacts; (2) be urgent, i.e. reverse trends that make adoption of the measure more difficult over time; or (3) address long-term decisions, such as building infrastructure, A method is proposed for natural resource policymakers to use in analyzing the need for anticipatory adaptation policies and the effectiveness of policy options to anticipate climate change. This method enables policy makers to identify those anticipatory policies most in need of immediate implementation.

By looking into the effect of the cryosphere on human-being, the study develops a unified approach in the analysis of cryospheric risks and services, with one focusing on the adverse impacts by cryospheric hazards and another emphasizing on the benefits that people can obtain from the natural capitals in the cryosphere. Meanwhile, climate change could further alter and complicate the roles of the cryosphere, not only by the changes in risks to cryospheric hazards, but also the changes in services that could potentially add more risks. The study further proposed a risk-based approach for the development of climate adaptation in the cryosphere. The approach essentially takes options to reduce exposure and vulnerability of societies to cryospheric hazards, and to better manage natural capitals and demands together with enhancing utility of the cryosphere, so as to maintain the benefit of cryosphere services in a sustainable way. The study further addresses the role of cryosphere services in strengthening sustainable development in terms of its relation with the sustainable development goals (SDGs), and provides a preliminary results on how the services contributes to SDGs. Overall, the approach developed in this study creates a new way to comprehensively assess the effect of cryosphere changes on our society and identify measures to maximize the benefit while minimizing the risk in relation to the cryosphere.","[Wang Xiaoming; Liu Shi-Wei; Zhang Jing-Lin] Chinese Acad Sci Lanzhou, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Liu Shi-Wei; Zhang Jing-Lin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Wang, XM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci Lanzhou, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",xiaonungwang@lzb.ac.cn,"Wang, Xiaoming/A-3804-2008","Wang, Xiaoming/0000-0002-6648-0057",Natural Science Foundation of China [41690141]; Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20100305]; CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program,Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program,"Authors are supported by Natural Science Foundation of China (41690141), Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA20100305), and CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program.

Recent GHG emission trends are consistent with worst-case scenarios of the previous decade. Dramatic and near-term emission reductions likely will be needed to ameliorate the potential deleterious impacts of climate change. To achieve such reductions, fundamental changes are required in the way that energy is generated and used. New technologies must be developed and deployed at a rapid rate. Advances in carbon capture and storage, renewable, nuclear, and transportation technologies are particularly important; however, global research and development efforts related to these technologies currently appear to fall short relative to needs. Even with a proactive and international mitigation effort, humanity will need to adapt to climate change, but the adaptation needs and damages will be far greater if mitigation activities are not pursued in earnest. In this review, research is highlighted that indicates increasing global and regional temperatures and ties climate changes to increasing GHG emissions. GHG mitigation targets necessary for limiting future global temperature increases are discussed, including how factors such as population growth and the growing energy intensity of the developing world will make these reduction targets more challenging. Potential technological pathways for meeting emission reduction targets are examined, barriers are discussed, and global and U. S. modeling results are presented that suggest that the necessary pathways will require radically transformed electric and mobile sectors. While geoengineering options have been proposed to allow more time for serious emission reductions, these measures are at the conceptual stage with many unanswered cost, environmental, and political issues. Implications: This paper lays out the case that mitigating the potential for catastrophic climate change will be a monumental challenge, requiring the global community to transform its energy system in an aggressive, coordinated, and timely manner. If this challenge is to be met, new technologies will have to be developed and deployed at a rapid rate. Advances in carbon capture and storage, renewable, nuclear, and transportation technologies are particularly important. Even with an aggressive international mitigation effort, humanity will still need to adapt to significant climate change.","[Princiotta, Frank T.; Loughlin, Daniel H.] US EPA, Off Res & Dev, Natl Risk Management Res Lab, Air Pollut Prevent & Control Div, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Princiotta, FT (corresponding author), US EPA, APPCD, 109 TW Alexander Dr, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA.",princiotta.frank@epa.gov,,,,,,,33,18,18,2,42,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1096-2247,2162-2906,,J AIR WASTE MANAGE,J.

Rotational grazing can support control and decrease reliance on chemical intervention, but is often complex due to the need to track grazing periods and infection levels, and the effect of weather on larval availability. In this paper, a simulation model was developed to predict the availability of infective larvae of the bovine GIN, Ostertagia ostertagi, at the level of individual pastures. The model was applied within a complex rotational grazing system and successfully reproduced observed variation in larval density between fields and over time. Four groups of cattle in their second grazing season (n = 44) were followed throughout the temper-ate grazing season with regular assessment of GIN faecal egg counts, which were dominated by O. oster-tagi, animal weight and recording of field rotations. Each group of cattle was rotationally grazed on six group-specific fields throughout the 2019 grazing season. Maps and calendars were produced to illustrate the change in pasture infectivity (density of L3 on herbage) across the 24 separate grazing fields. Simulations predicted differences in pasture contamination levels in relation to the timing of grazing and the return period. A proportion of L3 was predicted to persist on herbage over winter, declining to similar intensities across fields before the start of the following grazing season, irrespective of contami-nation levels in the previous year. Model predictions showed good agreement with pasture larval counts. The model also simulated differences in seasonal pasture infectivity under rotational grazing in systems that differed in temperature and rainfall profiles. Further application could support individual farm deci-sions on evasive grazing and refugia management, and improved regional evaluation of optimal grazing strategies for parasite control. The integration of weather and livestock movement is inherent to the model, and facilitates consideration of climate change adaptation through improved disease control.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Not much is known about temperature and precipitation trends along the different bioclimatic zones nor how changes in these parameters might impact the whole natural process, including biodiversity and ecosystems, in the CHAL. Analysis of daily temperature and precipitation time series data (1970-2019) was carried out in seven bioclimatic zones extending from lowland Terai to the higher Himalayas. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was applied to determine the trends, which were quantified by Sen's slope. Annual and decade interval average temperature, precipitation trends, and lapse rate were analyzed in each bioclimatic zone. In the seven bioclimatic zones, precipitation showed a mixed pattern of decreasing and increasing trends (four bioclimatic zones showed a decreasing and three bioclimatic zones an increasing trend). Precipitation did not show any particular trend at decade intervals but the pattern of rainfall decreases after 2000AD. The average annual temperature at different bioclimatic zones clearly indicates that temperature at higher elevations is increasing significantly more than at lower elevations. In lower tropical bioclimatic zone (LTBZ), upper tropical bioclimatic zone (UTBZ), lower subtropical bioclimatic zone (LSBZ), upper subtropical bioclimatic zone (USBZ), and temperate bioclimatic zone (TBZ), the average temperature increased by 0.022, 0.030, 0.036, 0.042 and 0.051 degrees C/year, respectively. The decade level temperature scenario revealed that the hottest decade was from 1999-2009 and average decade level increases of temperature at different bioclimatic zones ranges from 0.2 to 0.27 degrees C /decade. The average temperature and precipitation was found clearly different from one bioclimatic zone to other. This is the first time that bioclimatic zone level precipitation and temperature trends have been analyzed for the CHAL. The rate of additional temperature rise at higher altitudes compared to lower elevations meets the requirements to mitigate climate change in different bioclimatic zones in a different ways. This information would be fundamental to safeguarding vulnerable communities, ecosystem and relevant climate-sensitive sectors from the impact of climate change through formulation of sector-wise climate change adaptation strategies and improving the livelihood of rural communities.","[Luitel, Dol Raj; Jha, Pramod K.; Siwakoti, Mohan] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Bot, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal; [Luitel, Dol Raj] Minist Forests & Environm, Dept Plant Resources, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal; [Shrestha, Madan Lall] Nepal Acad Sci & Technol, Lalitpur 44600, Nepal; [Munniappan, Rangaswamy] IPM IL Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 23922 USA",Tribhuvan University; Nepal Academy of Science & Technology (NAST),"Luitel, DR (corresponding author), Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Bot, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal.;Luitel, DR (corresponding author), Minist Forests & Environm, Dept Plant Resources, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal.",Dolraj.735702@cdb.tu.edu.np; pk.jha@cdbtu.edu.np; m.siwakoti@cdbtu.edu.np; madan@smallearth.org.np; rmuni@vt.edu,"Muniappan, Rangaswamy/AAP-6973-2021","Muniappan, Rangaswmay/0000-0002-2992-2792",United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Bureau of Food Security as a part of Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Integrated Pest Management [AID-OAA-L-15-00001],United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Bureau of Food Security as a part of Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Integrated Pest Management(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),This work was funded in whole by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Bureau of Food Security under the Cooperative Agreement No. AID-OAA-L-15-00001 as a part of Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Integrated Pest Management.,,47,5,5,2,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,NOV,2020,8,11,,,,,,,136,10.3390/cli8110136,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli8110136,,,18,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,OW6EH,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000592976800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Science and public policy differ in their timeframes, epistemologies, objectives, process-cycles and criteria for judging the quality of knowledge, while global change and sustainability issues involve value pluralities and large uncertainties. In literature and in practice, it is argued that joint knowledge production in projects through collaboration between (and within) science and policy serves as a means to bridge the gap between the two domains. However, an assessment framework for analysing the merits and limitations of such projects, identifying good practices and enabling adaptive management as well as social learning had not yet been developed. This paper aims to develop such a framework. We portray joint knowledge production projects as policy arrangements in which the degree of success depends on the actors involved, contents of dominant discourses, presence of rules and the availability of resources. Literature was discussed to specify these four dimensions into seven success conditions for joint knowledge production. Scholars, boundary organizations and actors in projects can use the framework for retrospective analyses of projects, providing joint knowledge production with the empirical basis it still requires. The framework can also be used for promoting reflection in action as well as for formative assessments enabling social learning. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The generated future climate data combined with comfort model assessment has been proposed as a new way including future climate scenarios in preliminary building design for two representative sites, in Rome, Italy and Stockholm, Sweden. The existing vulnerability to the expected climate conditions from psychometric analysis indicates that: (1) the climate trend in Rome would gradually lead to more failures in the majority of conventional adaptive design measures, as the cooling and dehumidification demands would rise from 5.3% to 23.6%, while the heating and humidification demands would decrease from 27% to 16%; (2) the climate trend in Stockholm would result in an increased comfort period by exploiting more adaptive design measures, since the heating and humidification demands would be reduced from 67% to 53%. However, the cooling and dehumidification demands would increase slightly from 0% to 1.5%. Accordingly, four main key risks are identified: 1) overheating would become a rising increasing public health threat for buildings in Rome that rely exclusively on natural ventilation; 2) open questions remain for the design team in the area of correct cooling load selection, additional space for the future installation and the effectiveness of current cooling device etc.; 3) occasional heat waves and gradual rising humidity levels are expected to be a vulnerable topic for conventional lightweight building in Stockholm; 4) buildings with a heavy heating load would tend to have greater cooling demand, especially those with poor ventilation resources or greater internal gains. In conclusion, it is suggested that envelope optimization, whichever climate type, is one of the most efficient and effective adaptation measures towards future climate conditions.","[Shen, Jingchun; Copertaro, Benedetta; Zhang, Xingxing] Dalarna Univ, Dept Energy & Built Environm, Falun, Sweden; [Sangelantoni, Lorenzo] Univ LAquila, Ctr Excellence, Dept Phys & Chem Sci, CETEMPS, Laquila, Italy; [Suo, Hua; Guan, Xinxin] Guangzhou Univ, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Dalarna University; University of L'Aquila; Guangzhou University,"Zhang, XX (corresponding author), Dalarna Univ, Dept Energy & Built Environm, Falun, Sweden.;Suo, H (corresponding author), Guangzhou Univ, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",xza@du.se; suohua@gzhu.edu.cn,"yu, yang/HIZ-9682-2022",,European and Dalarna Regional Development Fund through the project Energiinnovation in Sweden,European and Dalarna Regional Development Fund through the project Energiinnovation in Sweden,"The authors would like to acknowledge the Climate Consultant 6.0 that developed by the UCLA Energy Design Tools Group, along with the financial support from the European and Dalarna Regional Development Fund through the project Energiinnovation in Sweden.",,47,18,18,1,26,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2352-7102,,J BUILD ENG,J.

A point often neglected in the climate adaptation literature is that the physical sources of predictability differ between projects with long and short planning periods: While historical and paleo climate records emphasize low-frequency modes of variability, anthropogenic climate change is expected to alter their occurrence at longer time scales. In this paper we present a set of stylized experiments to assess the uncertainties and biases involved in estimating future climate risk over a finite future period, given a limited observational record. These experiments consider both quasi-periodic and secular change for the underlying risk, as well as statistical models for estimating this risk from an N-year historical record. The uncertainty of IPCC-like future scenarios is considered through an equivalent sample size N. The relative importance of estimating short- or long-term risk depends on the investment life M. Shorter design lives are preferred for situations where interannual to decadal variability can be successfully identified and predicted, highlighting the importance of sequential investment strategies for adaptation.","[Doss-Gollin, James; Farnham, David J.; Lall, Upmanu] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Doss-Gollin, James; Farnham, David J.; Lall, Upmanu] Columbia Univ, Columbia Water Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Steinschneider, Scott] Cornell Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY USA",Columbia University; Columbia University; Cornell University,"Doss-Gollin, J (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Doss-Gollin, J (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Columbia Water Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA.",james.doss-gollin@columbia.edu,"Doss-Gollin, James/J-4273-2014; Lall, Upmanu/B-7992-2009","Doss-Gollin, James/0000-0002-3428-2224; Steinschneider, Scott/0000-0002-8882-1908; Lall, Upmanu/0000-0003-0529-8128; Farnham, David J./0000-0002-6690-4251",NSF GRFP program [DGE 16-44869]; SERDP program [2516],NSF GRFP program(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); SERDP program,"The authors thank Celine Mari, Alberto Montanari, and one anonymous reviewer for comments which greatly improved this manuscript.

However, while the implementation of participatory research approaches, such as those associated with knowledge co-production, have become increasingly commonplace, to date there has been little consideration given to the challenges and subsequent risks associated with their use. To start to address this gap we review the literature on participatory research in climate adaptation science. In doing so we identify and articulate several challenges, and subsequent risks, created by participatory research approaches to adaptation (i) science, (ii) scientists and scientific institutions, (iii) decision-makers and decision-making institutions and (iv) research funders. Based on this we identify seven strategies to help manage these challenges and reduce the associated risks: (a) choose participants carefully; (b) monitor team composition and adjust as necessary; (c) set clear expectations, and agreed conflict resolution mechanisms; (d) use different modes of scientific inquiry that can account for different knowledges and biases; (e) incorporate mechanisms for independent review at all stages of research; (f) reimagine professional development for adaptation researchers, and (g) ensure that appropriate institutional support is in place. These strategies can help to increase the likelihood that participatory research approaches will achieve their goal of generating knowledge that will help society successfully navigate modern day sustainability challenges, such as those posed by climate change.","[Cvitanovic, Christopher] Australian Natl Univ, Australian Natl Ctr Publ Awareness Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Cvitanovic, Christopher] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Howden, Mark; Colvin, R.

Conceived as a way to move beyond traditional models of science communication, this project involved public and private decision makers in specific at-risk communities in Oregon (U.S. Pacific coast) and Maine (Atlantic coast). Both state projects sought to move behavior toward decisive action that results in coastal communities that are more resilient to climate variability at all scales. To promote engagement between project staffs and publics, a dialogic model of communication was advanced, beginning with interviews and focus groups that in turn shaped further engagement through workshops and targeted video products. This means of communication led to a deeper understanding of participants' knowledge, beliefs, perceptions, values, and barriers to action related to climate change and its effects. Coinciding with this, project participant evaluations in both Oregon and Maine indicate that the workshops and videos were successful at informing them on this complex issue; and in both states, project participation led to action outcomes.

Quantifying coastal flood vulnerability serves as a tool to identify a system's weakness, monitor its change, and support making targeted climate adaptation policies. The assessment framework proposed in this research uses principal component analysis (PCA) and a weighting method to build a composite indicator of flood vulnerability index and evaluate the vulnerability for 256 coastal census tracts and 24 municipalities along the coast of Connecticut, USA. The research uses Keiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test and Bartlett's test of sphericity to test sample adequacy and performs data standardization for all indicators. Through PCA, 30 coastal vulnerability-related indicators were grouped into four major dimensions: hazard exposure, socio-economic, physical/land use and land cover, and natural. The findings highlight the variations of flood vulnerability across highly ur-banized areas, suburban areas, and rural areas; and the gradient from coastal low-elevation region to high-elevation inland area. This variance is unevenly caused by different dimensions although they may trade-off with each other when aggregated, the dominant dimensions play a significant or decisive role in the vulnera-bility assessment. This research built an automatic and objective assessment framework that is flexible enough to be applied at a smaller scale so as to obtain detailed analysis and it can be used as a decision-making support system.","[Wu, Tao] Univ Connecticut, Dept Plant Sci & Landscape Architecture, 1376 Storrs Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Wu, Tao] Nanjing Agr Univ, Fac Dept Landscape Architecture, 1 Weigang, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",University of Connecticut; Nanjing Agricultural University,"Wu, T (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Plant Sci & Landscape Architecture, 1376 Storrs Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.;Wu, T (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Fac Dept Landscape Architecture, 1 Weigang, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",tao.2.wu@uconn.edu,,,University of Connecticut,University of Connecticut,This study was supported by the University of Connecticut through a Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship to the author.

This study aimed at investigating the factors that determine adaptation choices using multivariate and ordered econometric models. It also examined the complementarity and substitutability of adaptation strategies using primary data collected from 383 smallholder farmers in North-Western Ethiopia. Our findings revealed adoption complimentary but no evidence of substitutability among adaptation strategies. The multivariate probit model estimation showed that household heads education level, gender, farmland soil fertility, access to extension service, credit access, climate information and key assets ownership are the key determinants of adoptions. The likelihood of adoption decreased when average long-term rainfall increased. In terms of the interaction effect between gender and access to credit, the study found that women-headed households with access to credit were more likely to use a higher number of adaptation strategies relative to women-headed households without access to credit. The significant factors for each strategy were different that entails how important it is to consider their unique characteristics in policy design and interventions. As per the finding, policy makers should consider gender-disaggregated interventions. It is also highly imperative to increase information access, basic education and extension service to boost farmers' adaptation practices.","[Adego, Tsega] Addis Ababa Univ, Ctr Environm & Dev Studies, Coll Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Woldie, Getachew A.] Trent Univ, Dept Econ, Peterborough, ON, Canada",Addis Ababa University; Trent University,"Adego, T (corresponding author), Addis Ababa Univ, Ctr Environm & Dev Studies, Coll Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",tsega.adego@aau.edu.et,,,"Ethiopian Ministry of Education (Addis Ababa University), Ethiopia; Ethiopian Ministry of Education (Aksum University), Ethiopia","Ethiopian Ministry of Education (Addis Ababa University), Ethiopia; Ethiopian Ministry of Education (Aksum University), Ethiopia","This work was supported by the Ethiopian Ministry of Education (Addis Ababa University and Aksum University), Ethiopia.",,64,2,2,5,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Unlike dry forests of the interior western United States, temperate rain forests of the Pacific Northwest have experienced limited recent fire activity, and debates surrounding what drove the 2020 fires, and management strategies to adapt to similar future events, necessitate a scientific evaluation of the fires. We evaluate five questions regarding the 2020 Labor Day fires: (1) How do the 2020 fires compare with historical fires? (2) How did the roles of weather and antecedent climate differ geographically and from the recent past (1979-2019)? (3) How do fire size and severity compare to other recent fires (1985-2019), and how did forest management and prefire forest structure influence burn severity? (4) What impact will these fires have on westside landscapes? and (5) How can we adapt to similar fires in the future? Although 5 of the 2020 fires were much larger than any others in the recent past and burned similar to 10 times the area in high-severity patches >10,000 ha, the 2020 fires were remarkably consistent with historical fires. Reports from the early 1900s, along with paleo- and dendro-ecological records, indicate similar and potentially even larger wildfires over the past millennium, many of which shared similar seasonality (late August/early September), weather conditions, and even geographic locations. Consistent with the largest historical fires, strong east winds and anomalously dry conditions drove the rapid spread of high-severity wildfire in 2020. We found minimal difference in burn severity among stand structural types related to previous management in the 2020 fires. Adaptation strategies for similar fires in the future could benefit by focusing on ignition prevention, fire suppression, and community preparedness, as opposed to fuel treatments that are unlikely to mitigate fire severity during extreme weather. While scientific uncertainties remain regarding the nature of infrequent, high-severity fires in westside forests, particularly under climate change, adapting to their future occurrence will require different strategies than those in interior, dry forests.","[Reilly, Matthew J.; Zuspan, Aaron; Kim, John B.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, Western Wildland Environm Threat Assessment Ctr, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Halofsky, Joshua S.; Donato, Daniel C.] Washington State Dept Nat Resources, Olympia, WA USA; [Halofsky, Joshua S.; Raymond, Crystal; Donato, Daniel C.; Harvey, Brian J.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA USA; [McEvoy, Andy; Bell, David M.; Kerns, Becky K.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, Corvallis, OR USA; [Dye, Alex W.; Dunn, Christopher J.; Gregory, Matthew J.; Johnston, James D.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Forestry, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Potter, Brian E.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, Seattle, WA USA; [Walker, Nathan] US Forest Serv, USDA, Off Sustainabil & Climate, Portland, OR USA; [Davis, Raymond J.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Northwest Reg, Corvallis, OR USA; [Halofsky, Jessica E.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, Western Wildland Environm Threat Assessment Ctr, Olympia, WA USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Oregon State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Reilly, MJ (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, Western Wildland Environm Threat Assessment Ctr, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",matthew.reilly@usda.gov,"Potter, Brian/GYE-3596-2022","Zuspan, Aaron/0000-0003-1583-3710; Dye, Alex/0000-0003-3469-5608; Kim, John/0000-0002-3720-7916; Bell, David/0000-0002-2673-5836","Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) [20IA11261952084, 18IA11261952030]; Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE); Office of Sustainability and Climate; Western Wildland Environmental Threat Assessment Center (WWETAC); Pacific Northwest Research Station; US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service",Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU); Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE); Office of Sustainability and Climate; Western Wildland Environmental Threat Assessment Center (WWETAC); Pacific Northwest Research Station(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service),"Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU), Grant/Award Numbers: 20IA11261952084, 18IA11261952030; Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE); Office of Sustainability and Climate; Western Wildland Environmental Threat Assessment Center (WWETAC); Pacific Northwest Research Station; US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service",,124,3,3,5,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,JUN,2022,13,6,,,,,,,e4070,10.1002/ecs2.4070,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4070,,,20,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,2B4RR,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000810177700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

At the same time a growing number of disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation measures are being implemented by governmental and non-governmental organizations, and substantial post-disaster donations are frequently pledged. At the same time there has been increasing demand for transparency and accountability, and thus evidence of those measures having a positive effect. We hypothesized that resilience-enhancing interventions should result in less damage during a hazard event, or at least quicker recovery. In this study we assessed recovery over a 3 year period of seven municipalities in the central Philippines devastated by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. We used very high resolution optical images (<1 m), and created detailed land cover and land use maps for four epochs before and after the event, using a machine learning approach with extreme gradient boosting. The spatially and temporally highly variable recovery maps were then statistically related to detailed questionnaire data acquired by DEval in 2012 and 2016, whose principal aim was to assess the impact of a 10 year land-planning intervention program by the German agency for technical cooperation (GIZ). The survey data allowed very detailed insights into DRR-related perspectives, motivations and drivers of the affected population. To some extent they also helped to overcome the principal limitation of remote sensing, which can effectively describe but not explain the reasons for differential recovery. However, while a number of causal links between intervention parameters and reconstruction was found, the common notion that a resilient community should recover better and more quickly could not be confirmed. The study also revealed a number of methodological limitations, such as the high cost for commercial image data not matching the spatially extensive but also detailed scale of field evaluations, the remote sensing analysis likely overestimating damage and thus providing incorrect recovery metrics, and image data catalogues especially for more remote communities often being incomplete. Nevertheless, the study provides a valuable proof of concept for the synergies resulting from an integration of socio-economic survey data and remote sensing imagery for recovery assessment.","[Kerle, Norman; Ghaffarian, Saman] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Nawrotzki, Raphael; Leppert, Gerald; Lech, Malte] German Inst Dev Evaluat DEval, Competence Ctr Evaluat Methodol, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Twente,"Kerle, N (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",n.kerle@utwente.nl; s.ghaffarian@utwente.nl; Raphael.Nawrotzki@deval.org; Gerald.Leppert@deval.org; malte.lech@gmail.com,,"Kerle, Norman/0000-0002-4513-4681; Nawrotzki, Raphael/0000-0002-1671-3676; Ghaffarian, Saman/0000-0001-9882-4603",,,,,79,9,9,3,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,NOV,2019,11,21,,,,,,,2511,10.3390/rs11212511,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11212511,,,24,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,JY9HH,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000504716700052,View Full Record in Web of Science

At local scales, the information provided by climate models is insufficient to support the water sector in making future adaptation decisions. Furthermore, projections of change in local water resources are wrought with uncertainties surrounding natural variability, future greenhouse gas emissions, model structure, population growth, and water consumption habits. To analyse the magnitude of these uncertainties, and their implications for local-scale water resource planning, we present a top-down approach for testing climate change adaptation options using probabilistic climate scenarios and demand projections. An integrated modelling framework is developed which implements a new, gridded spatial weather generator, coupled with a rainfall-runoff model and water resource management simulation model. We use this to provide projections of the number of days and associated uncertainty that will require implementation of demand saving measures such as hose pipe bans and drought orders. Results, which are demonstrated for the Thames Basin, UK, indicate existing water supplies are sensitive to a changing climate and an increasing population, and that the frequency of severe demand saving measures are projected to increase. Considering both climate projections and population growth, the median number of drought order occurrences may increase 5-fold by the 2050s. The effectiveness of a range of demand management and supply options have been tested and shown to provide significant benefits in terms of reducing the number of demand saving days. A decrease in per capita demand of 3.75% reduces the median frequency of drought order measures by 50% by the 2020s. We found that increased supply arising from various adaptation options may compensate for increasingly variable flows; however, without reductions in overall demand for water resources such options will be insufficient on their own to adapt to uncertainties in the projected changes in climate and population. For example, a 30% reduction in overall demand by 2050 has a greater impact on reducing the frequency of drought orders than any of the individual or combinations of supply options; hence, a portfolio of measures is required.","[Walsh, Claire L.; Blenkinsop, Stephen; Fowler, Hayley J.; Burton, Aidan; Dawson, Richard J.; Glenis, Vassilis; Manning, Lucy J.; Jahanshahi, Golnaz; Kilsby, Chris G.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Ctr Earth Syst Engn Res, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Walsh, CL (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Ctr Earth Syst Engn Res, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",claire.walsh@newcastle.ac.uk,"WALSH, CLAIRE L/B-7932-2008; Glenis, Vassilis/AGX-6525-2022; Fowler, Hayley J/A-9591-2013; Glenis, Vassilis/U-4374-2017","Glenis, Vassilis/0000-0001-6037-9508; Fowler, Hayley J/0000-0001-8848-3606; Glenis, Vassilis/0000-0001-6037-9508; kilsby, chris/0000-0003-3422-294X; Walsh, Claire/0000-0002-4047-1216; Dawson, Richard/0000-0003-3158-5868; Blenkinsop, Stephen/0000-0003-0790-6545","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/F037422/1]; EPSRC Fellowship [EP/H003630/1]; NERC Postdoctoral Fellowship award [NE/D009588/1]; Wolfson Foundation; Royal Society as a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award [WM140025]; EPSRC [EP/H003630/1, EP/F037422/1, EP/G013403/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [NE/D009588/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/G013403/1, EP/F037422/1, EP/H003630/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/D009588/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); NERC Postdoctoral Fellowship award(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Wolfson Foundation; Royal Society as a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work was undertaken as part of the SWERVE project which was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) project no.

We found that the heterogeneity of residential savings substantially mattered the income effect on urban household carbon emission. Especially, low-saving households struggled to obtain clean energy, needed more government intervention to replace the fossil fuel system with a clean household energy system. By comparison, middle- and high-saving households could easily transit towards a clean energy system, including natural gas and electricity. Moreover, residential income strongly drives the rising household electricity and related CO2 at the upper-middle saving level. High-saving households showed high sensitivity to heating energy in northern China.

Our findings indicate how the inclusion of our framework helps to identify important knowledge gaps regarding environmental co-benefits and trade-offs, and can be beneficial to both those developing the innovation and the local authorities charged with assessing the suitability of innovations.

In addition, the Covid-19 pandemic has been promoting strategies to increase resilience, e.g. by improving both urban green and health prevention, which can be seen as synergetic to climate adaptation. Despite a broad consensus that immediate climate action is needed, progress in implementation is advancing rather slowly. By investigating case studies in Dresden and Erfurt, Germany, this article points out barriers in implementing adaption measures and within the communication between stakeholders in the adaption process. The study has found insufficiencies in the current standing of climate adaption in cities' responsibilities and in conflict with competing interests, its integration into administrative tasks and the cross-departmental, collaborative approach in planning and implementation of adaption measures. Furthermore, a relevant obstacle has been identified in the holding on to traditional urban design principles that conflict with climate adaption to urban heat. The analysis is followed by a discussion of possible solutions to these obstacles, which are contextualized by theorical approach of Climate Adaption Governance by reviewing available instruments and examining the relations between key stakeholders.

With climate change introducing significant uncertainties to water resources management, flexible allocation frameworks are needed that can adapt to changing conditions. This paper explores options for climate-adaptive water allocation in Australia's Murray Darling Basin. The 2026 revision of the Basin Plan may provide significant opportunities for proactive climate risk mitigation, but this depends on rigorous evaluation of policy options. The Water Act requires that the Plan's revisions use the best available science to inform strategies that minimise the impact of climate risks. The Act also enables the use of ratios and formulas as alternatives to using long-term averages as the basis of the Plan. However, there have been limited investigations into using these alternatives. Achieving more adaptive policies depends on rigorously assessing climate risk management options. Given the far-reaching consequences of climate change, rigorous investigations are needed into reforms to the established approaches to water resources planning and to existing water entitlements and allocation regimes. At minimum, this means reassessing the total resource pool and all subsidiary targets and investigating allocation frameworks that equitably share risks between extractive users and the environment.","[Alexandra, Jason] Alexandra & Associates, Pyrmont, Australia; [Alexandra, Jason] ANU Inst Water Futures & Climate Energy & Disaste, Canberra, ACT, Australia",,"Alexandra, J (corresponding author), Alexandra & Associates, Pyrmont, Australia.;Alexandra, J (corresponding author), ANU Inst Water Futures & Climate Energy & Disaste, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",jason@alexandra-consulting.com,,"Alexandra, Jason/0000-0002-9624-1698",,,,,109,2,2,2,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",1324-1583,2204-227X,,AUSTRALAS J WAT RESO,Australas.

Increasing dissatisfaction about the results of traditional development cooperation and the appeal of climate policy as a new policy field led to a rapid reorientation of aid flows. At the turn of the century, over 7% of aid flows were spent on greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. However, the contribution of emissions mitigation projects to the central development objective of poverty reduction as specified in the Millennium Development Goals is limited and other project types are likely to be much more effective. Adaptation to climate change can be expected to have higher synergies with poverty alleviation than mitigation, primarily through its impact on health, the conservation of arable land and the protection against natural disasters. An analysis of the Clean Development Mechanism shows that projects addressing the poor directly are very rare; even small renewable energy projects in rural areas tend to benefit rich farmers and the urban population. Use of development aid for CDM projects and / or their preparation via capacity building is thus clearly not warranted. We further analyze whether the use of development aid for climate policy could be justified as a countermeasure against the emission increase related to successful development itself. However, countries that are achieving an improvement of human development from a low level are unlikely to increase their energy consumption substantially. Only at a level where the middle class expands rapidly, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions soar. Thus targeting middle class energy consumption by appliance efficiency standards and public transport-friendly urban planning are the most effective measures to address developing country emissions. Rural renewable energy provision in poor countries has a much higher impact on poverty, but a much lower impact on greenhouse gas emissions. We conclude that while there are valid reasons for long-term collaboration with emerging economies on greenhouse gas mitigation, there should be a separate budget line for such activities to avoid obfuscation of a decline of resources aimed at poverty alleviation. Nevertheless, mitigation will remain attractive for donors because it ensures quick disbursements and relatively simple measures of success. Moreover, mitigation activities in developing countries provide politicians in industrialized countries with a welcome strategy to divert the attention of their constituencies from the lack of success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions domestically.","Univ Zurich, Inst Polit Sci, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Michaelowa, A (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Polit Sci, Muhelgasse 21, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland.",axel.michaelowa@pw.unizh.ch; katja.michaelowa@pw.unizh.ch,"Michaelowa, Katharina/B-4931-2018","Michaelowa, Katharina/0000-0002-0317-209X; Michaelowa, Axel/0000-0001-5053-3700",,,,,33,57,59,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

However, although a large literature about the relationships among land fragmentation, land consolidation, agriculture production and crops diversification concepts exists, less is known about the linkages among the conditions determining the decisions about the adoption of these tools in a given area. This poses a major dilemmatic challenge to policy makers about whether to devise policies in favour of fragmentation conservation or defragmentation. Therefore, this study identifies the conditions under which one could opt for land fragmentation or defragmentation policies by critically reviewing the documented causal-effects relationships between different fragmentation forms and defragmentation approaches. The end goal is the development of an explicit comprehensive model indicating when, where and why farmland fragmentation can be preserved or eliminated for food security purposes within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 1, 2, 12, 13 and 15). Following the rationalist theory, the study adopts an integrative concept-centric qualitative approach which builds on the analysis of existing literature and deductive logical reasoning to create new comprehensive scientific knowledge about a topic, as an informative guidance for future research and policies. Contrary to the majority of existing literature, this study posits that farmland fragmentation is not necessarily a problem. The scenarios and extent to which it becomes problematic or beneficial are dependent on a combination of a number of local specific external circumstances, ranging from biophysical, social, economic, political, technical to agro-ecological ones. For subsistence motives, labour, risks and conflicts management, climate change adaptation and household food security purposes, both physical in terms of internal and location, and tenure fragmentation of farmland in a given heterogeneous area under the subsistence and middle-income economies can be conserved either in combination with or without agriculture intensification programs. On the other hand, both physical and tenure fragmentation of farmland under homogenous agro-ecological conditions, and physical fragmentation under heterogeneous agro-ecological conditions and strong complex economies can be revoked for the purposes of improving farm efficiency, food quantity and supply, and food security. We therefore argue that any policy to adapt the extent of farmland fragmentation should consider both the benefits and costs of such intervention in relation to the specific local context.","[Ntihinyurwa, Pierre Damien; de Vries, Walter Timo] Tech Univ Munchen TUM, Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Ntihinyurwa, PD (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munchen TUM, Munich, Germany.",pdamien.ntihinyurwa@tum.de,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; de Vries, Walter Timo/I-7765-2019","de Vries, Walter Timo/0000-0002-1942-4714",,,,,154,22,23,16,54,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

Practical drought hazard mapping remains challenging due to possible exclusion of the most pertinent drought drivers, and to the use of inadequate predictive models that cannot describe drought adequately. This research aims to develop new approaches to map agricultural drought hazard with state-of-the-art machine learning models, including classification and regression trees (CART), boosted regression trees (BRT), random forests (RF), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), flexible discriminant analysis (FDA) and support vector machines (SVM). Hydro-environmental datasets were used to calculate the relative departure of soil moisture (RDSM) for eight severe droughts for drought-prone southeast Queensland, Australia, over the period 1994-2013. RDSM was then used to generate an agricultural drought inventory map. Eight hydro-environmental factors were used as potential predictors of drought. The goodness-of-fit and predictive performance of all models were evaluated using different threshold-dependent and threshold-independent methods, including the true skill statistic (TSS), Efficiency (E), F-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC). The RF model (AUC-ROC = 97.7%, TSS = 0.873, E = 0.929, F-score = 0.898) yielded the highest accuracy, while the MA model (with AUC-ROC = 73.9%, TSS = 0.424, E = 0.719, F-score = 0.512) showed the worst performance. The plant available water holding capacity (PAWC), mean annual precipitation, and day content were the most important variables to be used for predicting the agricultural drought. About 21.2% of the area is in high or very high drought risk classes, and therefore, warrant drought and environmental protection policies. Importantly, the models do not require data on the precipitation anomaly for any given drought year; the spatial patterns in AGH were consistent for all drought events, despite very different spatial patterns in precipitation anomaly among events. Such machine-learning approaches are able to construct an overall risk map, thus assisting in the adoption of a robust drought contingency planning measure not only for this area, but also, in other regions where drought presents a pressing challenge, including its influence on key practical dimensions of social, environmental and economic sustainability.

Although wildfires are some of the most important ecological processes in forest ecosystems, large-scale wildfires are often perceived as an environmental disaster. Since failure to include the dynamic nature of ecosystems in planning will inevitably lead to unexpected outcomes, we need to enhance our ability to cope with future extreme events coupled with climate change. This study presents several future scenarios in three different time periods for Canada's Columbia Montane Cordillera Ecoprovince, which is prone to wildfires. These scenarios predict the probability of occurrence of widespread wildfires based on the hierarchical Bayesian model. The model was based on the relationships between wildfires and the Monthly Drought Code (MDC). The MDC is a generalized monthly version of the Daily Drought Code widely used across Canada by forest fire management agencies for monitoring of wildfire risk. To calculate future MDC values, we relied on different possible future conditions of climate, given by the Global Circulation Models. We found a regime shift in drought intensity with abrupt decreases in lightning-caused wildfire activity around 1940, suggesting that future wildfire risks can be inferred primarily from the summer drought code. For future periods, we found increasing trends in the probabilities of large-scale fires with time in most areas. It should be notable that, by the 2080s, there is a probability of some areas having more than 50% of large-scale wildfires under the average climatic conditions in the future, indicating that, even without extreme weather conditions, some ecosystems will have a fundamental probability of experiencing catastrophic fires under the condition of average summer. However, the rate of progression toward a fire-prone condition is quite different among the three climate change scenarios and among the region analyzed. Given such scenario-sensitive, spatially-heterogeneous patterns of wildfire probability in response to climate variability, management strategy should be flexible and more localized. By drawing on this knowledge, it may be possible to mitigate climate change impacts both before they arise and once they have occurred. These considerations are critical for maintaining the integrity of systems shaped by large-scale natural disturbances to increase their resilience to the changing climate while protecting human society and infrastructures. Working with alternative scenarios will facilitate our adaptation to climate change in managing fire-prone forest ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Knowledge about these issues and preventive measures can affect the incidence and outbreak risk of dengue. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among urban and rural communities and government officials about climate change and dengue in Laos and Thailand. Methods: A cross-sectional KAP survey about climate change and dengue were conducted in 360 households in Laos (180 urban and 180 rural), 359 households in Thailand (179 urban and 180 rural), and 20 government officials (10 in each country) using structured questionnaires. Data analysis was undertaken using descriptive methods, principal component analysis (PCA), Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test (as appropriate), and logistic regression. Results: Significant differences among the selected communities in both countries were found in terms of household participant's age, level of education, socioeconomic status, attitude level of climate change and KAP level of dengue (P < 0.05; 95% CI). Overall, participants' KAP about climate change and dengue were low except the attitude level for dengue in both countries. The level of awareness among government officials regarding the climatic relationship with dengue was also low. In Lao households, participants' knowledge about climate change and dengue was significantly associated with the level of education and socioeconomic status (SES) (P < 0.01). Their attitudes towards climate change and dengue were associated with educational level and internet use (P < 0.05). Householders' climate change related practices were associated with SES (P < 0.01) and dengue related practices were associated with educational level, SES, previous dengue experience and internet use (P < 0.01). In Thailand, participants' knowledge about climate change was associated with the level of education and SES (P < 0.01). Their attitudes towards climate change were associated with residence status (urban/rural) and internet use (P < 0.05); climate change related practices were associated with educational level and SES (P < 0.05). Dengue related knowledge of participants was associated with SES and previous dengue experience (P < 0.05); participants' dengue related attitudes and practices were associated with educational level (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The findings call for urgently needed integrated awareness programs to increase KAP levels regarding climate change adaptation, mitigation and dengue prevention to improve the health and welfare of people in these two countries, and similar dengue-endemic countries.","[Rahman, Md.

The emergency is to develop pandemic-resilient city planning and management in order to tackle the infectious diseases during COVID-19. Such development includes the reframing of unsustainable urban patterns, hazards, and social inequalities to be prepared for the emerging cases. In this study, we focus on the assessment of disaster risk management (DRM), which will help to develop pandemic-resilient urban strategies (response, mitigation, and preparedness phase) through analyzing previously published literature. Short- and long-term recommendations for pandemic resilience urban planning and design have also been provided. In the response phase, implementation of the smart and resilient city design and policies has been highlighted to identify disease transmission. In the mitigation phase, new technological approaches can be adopted for better management of present and future pandemics. The physical (urban access, infrastructure, environmental factors, and land use patterns) and non-physical (socio-cultural, governance, and economic factors) aspects of resilient urban strategies have been focused, which may help to develop understanding of health- and disaster-related risks in pandemic. In the preparedness phase, proactive measures such as capacity building of people toward any outbreak and different simulation processes (models of transmission pattern) can be adopted for future pandemics. We also discuss about the enhancement of urban resiliency in housing, public spaces, and cities that may bring the effective outcome of DRM framework to combat pandemic. The study focuses on the major lessons that can be adopted for post-pandemic urban resilient planning related to disaster management and climate change adaptation, preventing extensive challenges of sustainability apart. In the following months and years, it will be difficult to assess various changes to develop urban planning and design in the post-COVID-19 world. However, this study expresses the possibility of creating good opportunities for policymakers and city planners to undertake significant transformative and advanced actions during the three different phases of DRM. This study presents a novel approach to delineate the scope of DRM framework in achieving more resilient cities (RC) to tackle future pandemics. This study will also crucially help the planners and decision-makers in better assessing and addressing the strategic and resilient urban design and planning approach in future.","[Afrin, Sadia; Rahman, Md Mostafizur] Jahangirnagar Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Chowdhury, Farhat Jahan] Asian Dev Bank, Bangladesh Resident Mission, Environm, Dhaka, Bangladesh",Jahangirnagar University,"Rahman, MM (corresponding author), Jahangirnagar Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Dhaka, Bangladesh.",rahmanmm@juniv.edu,"Rahman, Mostafizur/X-7420-2019","Rahman, Mostafizur/0000-0002-5290-3821; Afrin, Sadia/0000-0002-2327-312X",,,,,65,20,20,16,61,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9634,,FRONT SUSTAIN CITIES,Front.

Thus, they are of great value to incorporate into climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. In response, a global network of mangrove plots was established to provide policy-relevant ecological data relating to interactions of mangrove C stocks with climatic, tidal, plant community, and geomorphic factors. Mangroves from 190 sites were sampled across five continents encompassing large biological, physical, and climatic gradients using consistent methodologies for the quantification of total ecosystem C stocks (TECS). Carbon stock data were collected along with vegetation, physical, and climatic data to explore potential predictive relationships. There was a 28-fold range in TECS (79-2,208 Mg C/ha) with a mean of 856 +/- 32 Mg C/ha. Belowground C comprised an average 85% of the TECS. Mean soil depth was 216 cm, ranging from 22 to >300 cm, with 68 sites (35%) exceeding a depth of 300 cm. TECS were weakly correlated with metrics of forest structure, suggesting that aboveground forest structure alone cannot accurately predict TECS. Similarly, precipitation was not a strong predictor of TECS. Reasonable estimates of TECS were derived via multiple regression analysis using precipitation, soil depth, tree mass, and latitude (R-2 = 0.54) as variables. Soil carbon to a 1 m depth averaged 44% of the TECS. Limiting analyses of soil C stocks to the top 1 m of soils result in large underestimates of TECS as well as in the greenhouse gas emissions that would arise from their conversion to other land uses. The current IPCC Tier 1 default TECS value for mangroves is 511 Mg C/ha, which is only 60% of our calculated global mean. This study improves current assessments of mangrove C stocks providing a foundation necessary for C valuation related to climate change mitigation. We estimate mangroves globally store about 11.7 Pg C: an aboveground carbon stock of 1.6 Pg C and a belowground carbon stock of 10.2 Pg C). The differences in the estimates of total ecosystem carbon stocks based on climate, salinity, forest structure, geomorphology, or geopolitical boundaries are not as much of an influence as the choice of soil depth included in the estimate. Choosing to limit soils to a 1 m depth resulted in estimates of 1 m depth resulted in global carbon stock estimates that exceeded 11.2 Pg C.","[Kauffman, J.

Future predictions suggest that corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) production in the Midwest may be limited by precipitation and temperature due to climate change. Cross-biome long-term studies in situ are needed to understand carbon assimilation and impact of climate change on the entire region. In this study, we investigated the differences of gross primary production (GPP) and net ecosystem production (NEP) among typical (agro-) ecosystems of corn, soybean and tallgrass prairie from eddy flux stations from 2006 to 2015 under contrasting weather conditions. Corn had the highest annual GPP and NEP with 1305 and 327 g Cm-2 yr(-1), while soybean had significantly lower GPP and NEP with 630 and 34 g Cm-2, excluding additional carbon loss by yield. Corn and soybean NEP was linear related (p < 0.05) to leaf area index (LAI), height or phenological stage, confirming the strong link between plant growth and ecosystem carbon balance. Tallgrass prairie had average values of GPP and NEP of 916 and 61 g Cm-2 yr(-1), excluding loss of carbon by annual burning. Thus, prairie GPP and NEP were significantly lower than corn, but significantly higher than soybean. Probably the long fallow period on cropland, which enhanced heterotrophic respiration, and the low carbon assimilation of soybean reduced its overall carbon balance. In total, the corn-soybean agroecosystem acted as a carbon source due to carbon loss by yield removal. Values for GPP and NEP were reflected in inherent water use efficiency (IWUE*) and light use efficiency (LUE) among the agroecosystems. In addition, IWUE*, LUE or GPP of crops and tallgrass prairie were linearly related (p < 0.05) to precipitation, volumetric soil water content (VWC) and maximum air temperature. Air temperature increased IWUE* in both, cropland and prairie vegetation. However, rainfall and VWC affected crops and prairie vegetation differently: while excessive rainfall and VWC reduced GPP or IWUE* in cropland, prairie vegetation GPP and LUE were adversely affected by reduced VWC or precipitation. Future measures of climate change adaption should consider the contrasting effects of precipitation and VWC among the different agro-ecosystems in the Midwestern USA. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The biophysical characteristics that define these regions of highly localised productivity are associated with processes that are driven by climate. Climate changes will therefore potentially alter the oceanographic features and processes on which top predators rely to find their food. Studying the foraging behaviour of apex predators, such as southern elephant seals (SES), Mirounga leonina, is important during this time of rapid change to detect changes in prey availability. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope (SI) analyses were performed to assess the dietary history (e.g. delta N-15) and infer the foraging habitat (e.g. delta C-13) on consecutive sections of whole whiskers from 119 southern elephant seals from Elephant Island (61 degrees 13'S 55 degrees 23'W) from all age and sex classes. Whisker SI values were spread over a large range, with delta C-13 and delta N-15 values varying from-23.21 to-16.344to (a 6.87 parts per thousand difference) and from 8.90%parts per thousand to 15.47%o (6.57 parts per thousand), respectively. SI analyses also confirmed marked differences in the feeding ecology of southern elephant seals according to sex (e.g. delta N-15 significantly different between sexes in adults, GLMM, p = 0.001) and age group (e.g. delta C-13 related to age classes in females, GLMM, p < 0.001). Results suggest that yearlings foraged more frequently in the sub Antarctic zone whilst adult seals stayed south of the polar front and, adult and sub-adult males fed on higher trophic level prey than other sex and age classes. We discuss how these differences are likely a result of a combination of antra-specific competition, ontogenetic factors and resource distribution. Studying the degree and the ontogeny of individual specialisation within a population is a first step towards understanding its implications in various dimensions of ecological and evolutionary processes and hence for adapting to climate changes.","[Gallon, S.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Gallon, S.] Agence Francaise Biodiversite, Marine Environm Dept, Brest, France; [Hindell, M.

The Mara River Basin of East Africa is such a basin. It hosts the internationally renowned Mara-Serengeti landscape as well as a rich mixture of indigenous cultures. The Mara River is the sole source of surface water to the landscape during the dry season and periods of drought. During recent years, the flow of the Mara River has become increasingly erratic, especially in the upper reaches, and resource managers are hampered by a lack of understanding of the relative influence of different sources of flow alteration. Uncertainties about the impacts of future climate change compound the challenges. We applied the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to investigate the response of the headwater hydrology of the Mara River to scenarios of continued land use change and projected climate change. Under the data-scarce conditions of the basin, model performance was improved using satellite-based estimated rainfall data, which may also improve the usefulness of runoff models in other parts of East Africa. The results of the analysis indicate that any further conversion of forests to agriculture and grassland in the basin headwaters is likely to reduce dry season flows and increase peak flows, leading to greater water scarcity at critical times of the year and exacerbating erosion on hillslopes. Most climate change projections for the region call for modest and seasonally variable increases in precipitation (5-10%) accompanied by increases in temperature (2.5-3.5 degrees C). Simulated runoff responses to climate change scenarios were non-linear and suggest the basin is highly vulnerable under low (-3%) and high (+25%) extremes of projected precipitation changes, but under median projections (+7%) there is little impact on annual water yields or mean discharge. Modest increases in precipitation are partitioned largely to increased evapotranspiration. Overall, model results support the existing efforts of Mara water resource managers to protect headwater forests and indicate that additional emphasis should be placed on improving land management practices that enhance infiltration and aquifer recharge as part of a wider program of climate change adaptation.","[Mango, L.

Local governments around the world are using various strategies to address sea level rise and coastal flooding. Most of these responses are reactive, developed in an ad hoc manner following a specific event, but there is an increasing recognition of the need for more comprehensive and proactive approaches. Research into the topic reflects practice, with numerous studies of particular locations or strategies providing information in a piecemeal manner lacking in comprehensive evaluations. This paper addresses this gap through a systematic literature review that identifies coastal flooding and sea level rise adaptation practices and evaluates their comparative advantages and disadvantages. The findings identify a major knowledge gap in comparative costs and benefits of alternative adaptation strategies and indicate that coastal climate adaptation needs to be tailored to local characteristics and use a combination of different structural and non-structural measures to be effective.","[Dedekorkut-Howes, Aysin; Torabi, Elnaz; Howes, Michael] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Dedekorkut-Howes, Aysin; Torabi, Elnaz; Howes, Michael] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University,"Dedekorkut-Howes, A (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia.",a.dedekorkut@griffith.edu.au,"Dedekorkut-Howes, Aysin/V-5636-2018; Torabi, Elnaz/V-3585-2018","Dedekorkut-Howes, Aysin/0000-0002-3844-4796; Torabi, Elnaz/0000-0003-4578-8199","Griffith University, School of Environment","Griffith University, School of Environment","This study was funded by Griffith University, School of Environment.",,156,24,24,3,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

A field investigation involving 917 historic villages was conducted. The physical features of the villages were superimposed with the visualized spatial trajectories of the cyclones. Case studies were also adopted to reveal their windproofing mechanisms. The results show that villages are safeguarded through systematic approaches. First, planting windbreaks with appropriate densities and locations was a first line of defence. Second, dwellings were arranged to form a dense-alley pattern, through which the windward faces were reduced and rapid drainage was achieved. Third, the courtyard layout, strengthened exterior walls, and a set of roof protection technologies were applied to increase the stability and integrity of the building. Traditional wisdom was identified in that villages and dwellings were built with the philosophy of reducing the possibility of a disaster in an ordinary windstorm situation through appropriate rather than excessive windproof construction to achieve a balance between survival and development under resource constraints. This knowledge complements the traditional technologies of wind protection developed in other regions of the world and has modern significance for building climate-adaptive and environmentally friendly settlements and buildings.","[Tao Jin; Xiao Dawei] South China Univ Technol, State Key Lab Subtrop Bldg Sci, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Qin Qiaohua; Zhuo Xiaolan; Wang Jiayu; Wang Qing] South China Univ Technol, Dept Architecture, 381 Wushan Rd, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chen Huashuai] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Durham, NC USA",South China University of Technology; South China University of Technology; Duke University,"Wang, Q (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Dept Architecture, 381 Wushan Rd, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",Ivorwang521@126.com,,"Tao, Jin/0000-0003-0439-9381","National Key R&D Programme of China [2019YFD1100903]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51878283, 51778232]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2020A1515010683]; Key projects of Guangzhou Science and technology plan [201804020017]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [x2jz/D2190720]",National Key R&D Programme of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Key projects of Guangzhou Science and technology plan; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),This work was supported by the National Key R&D Programme of China [Grant Number: 2019YFD1100903]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant Number: 51878283; 51778232]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [Grant Number: 2020A1515010683]; Key projects of Guangzhou Science and technology plan [Grant Number: 201804020017]; and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [Grant Number: x2jz/D2190720].,,39,3,3,23,75,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1558-3058,1558-3066,,INT J ARCHIT HERIT,Int.

However, a substantial mismatch often exists between the spatial and temporal scale of available data and the requirements of crop simulation models. Conventional model calibration methods which concentrate on a model's performance at plot scale cannot be used for large scale regional simulation (especially for climate change impacts assessments), given the limited observed data and the iterative calibration needed. One primary purpose of regional simulation is to predict the spatial yield variation and temporal yield fluctuation. This purpose could be fulfilled through model input calibration in which the objective of the calibration focuses on spatial or temporal agreement between simulated and observed values. This study examines the performance of CERES-Rice at the regional scale across China using a cross calibration process based on limited experiment data, agroecological zones (AEZ) and 50 km x 50 km grid scale geographical database. Model performance is evaluated using rice yields from experimental sites at the plot scale, and/or observed yield data at the county scale. Results suggest: the CERES-Rice model was able to simulate the site-specific rice production with good performance in most of China, with a root mean square error (RMSE) = 991 kg ha(-1) and a relative RMSE = 14.9% for yield across China. The cross calibration process, in which AEZ-scale parameter values were derived, gave a relative bigger bias to yield estimation, with a RMSE = 1485 kg ha-1 and a relative RMSE = 22.5%, but achieved a reasonable agreement with observed maturity day and yield at spatial scale. The bias rose further if this cross calibrated model was used to simulate the real farmer rice yields at a regional scale, with a RMSE = 2191 kg ha-1 and relative RMSE = 34% across China. The pattern of yield variation was captured spatially by the model in most of the rice planting areas, but not temporally The sources of uncertainties were analyzed for both plot scale and regional scale simulation. This calibration process could be incorporated into climate change integrated assessment and adaptation assessment, especially for those developing counties with limited observed data.

Evaluating the potential impact of climate change on the profitability of farm systems",AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Amazon land use; Farm system modeling; Economically viable adaptation; Uncertainty; High-performance computing,DRY-SEASON; LAND-USE; VARIABILITY; ADAPTATION,"CONTEXT: Farmers in the federal state of Mato Grosso contribute about one-third of national grain production in Brazil. Given their key role in providing food and feed for fast-growing world demand, major shocks on Mato Grosso's farm holdings can lead to devastating consequences for vulnerable consumers and producers inside and outside Brazil. Research has shown that rising temperature and water stress threaten the agricultural productivity of Mato Grosso's rain-fed farm production systems. Failure of current production systems on existing croplands may also foster agricultural expansion and increase pressure on the remaining native forest. Balancing agricultural production and environmental protection is of particular concern in Mato Grosso because more than half of its territory is in the Amazon Rainforest biome. The tight schedule of field activities within double cropping systems reduces farmers' ability to adapt to climate change and manage shocks. The increasing uncertainty about climate change and price volatility further complicate farmers' decision-making. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the impact of two climate change scenarios on the profitability of double cropping systems, considering not only climate variability but also economic uncertainties faced at the farm level. METHODS: Our modeling system combines future climate projections with biophysical and bioeconomic models. We used high-performance computing with many compute nodes and large shared memory to account for the large heterogeneity of possible management options and farm-gate prices. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Simulation results indicate that farmers in Mato Grosso could be exposed to significantly lower economic returns, with a future gross margin reduction of 69% on average compared to current levels. Moreover, the number of profitable cropping alternatives could drop by 18% on average. According to our simulations, climate impacts on gross margins are likely to differ in Mato Grosso, with the Southeast macro-region being the most affected and the South Central region the least. The simulation results also revealed a higher risk of losses during the second cropping season. Double-cropping systems with cotton were the most impacted by changing climatic conditions, and sunflower the least. SIGNIFICANCE: This study revealed that climate change might negatively affect double-cropping systems in the Southern Amazon due to reduced annual precipitation, a shortening of the rainy season, and shifts in the rainy season's onset and cessation dates. Our bioeconomic simulations further suggest that farmers in Mato Grosso could lose one of their most significant comparative advantages, namely the possibility of harvesting two crops in one cropping season.","[Carauta, Marcelo; Parussis, Julia; Berger, Thomas] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Sci Trop, Hans Ruthenberg Inst, Wollgrasweg 43, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; [Hampf, Anna] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Inst Landscape Syst Anal, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Libera, Affonso] Inst Fed Educ Ciencia & Tecnol Mato Grosso IFMT, Campus Sao Vicente,Rodovia BR 364,Km 329, Campo Verde, Brazil",University Hohenheim; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Instituto Federal de Mato Grosso (IFMT),"Carauta, M (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Sci Trop, Hans Ruthenberg Inst, Wollgrasweg 43, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",carauta@uni-hohenheim.de; parussis@uni-hohenheim.de; anna.hampf@zalf.de; affonsodl@gmail.com; i490d@uni-hohenheim.de,,,CarBioCial project of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) plus the Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) [BEX10421/149]; state of Baden-Wurttemberg through their High-Performance Computing program (bwHPC); Computational Science Lab at Hohenheim University; German Research Foundation (DFG) [INST 35/1134-1 FUGG],CarBioCial project of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) plus the Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES); state of Baden-Wurttemberg through their High-Performance Computing program (bwHPC); Computational Science Lab at Hohenheim University; German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This research was funded by the CarBioCial project of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) plus the Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) [grant number BEX10421/149] .

Long-term change and uncertainty require a long view, while current planning approaches and policy making are mostly short-term oriented and are therefore not well suited to respond adequately. The path-dependency it implies causes an irresolvable dilemma between short-term effect and long-term necessities. The objective of the research is to investigate an alternative planning and design approach which is able to overcome the current constraints and take a holistic long-term perspective. Therefore, the methods used in the study underpin a creative process of future visioning through backcasting and finding a dynamic equilibrium in the past as a primer for long-term climate adaptation. This way, the individual vulnerabilities of current sectoral policies can be leapfrogged and integrated into one intervention. This design-led method is applied to the northern landscape of the Groningen region in The Netherlands. This intervention is positioned as a re-dynamization of the landscape by re-establishing the exchange between the land and the sea. The findings in the study show that a long-term perspective on the future of the regional landscape increases climate adaptation and enriches the opportunities for viable agriculture, increased biodiversity, and a raised land that is not only protected against possible storm surges, but benefits from the sediments the sea brings. The economic analysis shows that a new perspective for farming within saline conditions is profitable on a fraction of the land, the biodiversity can be enriched by more than 75%, and the ground level of the landscape can be raised by one meter or more in the next 50-100 years. Moreover, the study shows how a long-term perspective can be implemented in logic stages that comply with the natural step-changes occurring in climate change.","[Roggema, Rob] Cittaideale, Off Adapt Design & Planning, NL-6706 LC Wageningen, Netherlands; [Roggema, Rob] Univ Western Sydney, Inst Culture & Soc, Parramatta, NSW 2124, Australia; [Tillie, Nico] Delft Univ Technol, Urban Ecol & Ecoc Lab, Fac Architecture, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands; [Hollanders, Matthijs] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands",Western Sydney University; Delft University of Technology; Delft University of Technology,"Roggema, R (corresponding author), Cittaideale, Off Adapt Design & Planning, NL-6706 LC Wageningen, Netherlands.;Roggema, R (corresponding author), Univ Western Sydney, Inst Culture & Soc, Parramatta, NSW 2124, Australia.",rob@cittaideale.eu; n.m.j.d.tillie@tudelft.nl; matthijshollanders@urbanisten.nl,,"Roggema, Rob/0000-0003-2492-0779; Hollanders, Matthijs/0000-0001-8422-2820; Tillie, Nico/0000-0003-3195-1290",,,,,80,3,3,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,FEB,2021,10,2,,,,,,,158,10.3390/land10020158,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land10020158,,,25,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QN9FF,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000622755000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we present an innovative scenario of how the integration of a programmable material into a climate-adaptive building envelope (CABE) can create an energy-efficient thermal management system inherent to the material. This novel concept is based on a thermoresponsive shape memory polymer foam (SMP) and is designed to regulate the flow of ambient air through the building envelope in order to enable natural cooling of the structure. Hygrothermal simulation data obtained by the software WUFI (R) Plus indicate that significant cooling energy saving potential may be accessible with this type of concept. As a possible material basis for a corresponding adaptive element, a reactive foamed polyurethane-based SMP foam is proposed, which is capable of executing a thermoreversible shape change of more than 20% while having a suitable switching temperature range. Finally, the ecological impact of such a functional foam element is evaluated in detail as well as its influence on the overall balance of a facade construction by means of a life cycle assessment (LCA).","[Walter, Mario; Pretsch, Thorsten] Fraunhofer Inst Appl Polymer Res IAP, Dept Shape Memory Polymers, Geiselbergstr 69, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Lengsfeld, Kristin; Koelsch, Philipp; Krus, Martin] Fraunhofer Inst Bldg Phys IBP, Dept Hygrotherm Moisture & Thermal Control, Fraunhoferstr 10, D-83626 Valley, Germany; [Borschewski, David; Albrecht, Stefan] Fraunhofer Inst Bldg Phys IBP, Dept Life Cycle Engn, Nobelstr 12, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Borschewski, David] Univ Stuttgart, Dept Life Cycle Engn, Inst Acoust & Bldg Phys, Nobelstr 12, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Lehmann-Brauns, Susanne] Fraunhofer Inst Bldg Phys IBP, Dept Innovat Management, Fraunhoferstr 10, D-83626 Valley, Germany",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; University of Stuttgart; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Lengsfeld, K (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Inst Bldg Phys IBP, Dept Hygrotherm Moisture & Thermal Control, Fraunhoferstr 10, D-83626 Valley, Germany.",kristin.lengsfeld@ibp.fraunhofer.de,"Albrecht, Stefan/F-3037-2013","Albrecht, Stefan/0000-0001-9469-9841; Borschewski, David/0000-0002-7237-2044; Pretsch, Thorsten/0000-0002-5591-7866","Fraunhofer Cluster of Excellence Programmable Materials [630519, 40-03549-2500-00002]",Fraunhofer Cluster of Excellence Programmable Materials,This research was funded by the Fraunhofer Cluster of Excellence Programmable Materials. grant number 630519 (PSP element 40-03549-2500-00002).,,61,0,0,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,DEC,2022,12,12,,,,,,,2236,10.3390/buildings12122236,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings12122236,,,23,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,7G2TM,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000902383500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The annual mean surface temperature has risen about 0.5-0.8 A degrees C. The precipitation trends have not been identified during the past 100 years in China, although the frequency and intensity of extreme weather/climate events have increased, especially of drought. Water scarcity, more frequent and serious outbreaks of insects and diseases, and soil degradation caused by climate change have impacted agro-environmental conditions. However, temperature rise prolonged the crop growth seasons and cold damages have reduced in Northeast China. The projection of climate change indicates that the surface temperature will continue to increase with about 3.9 to 6.0 A degrees C and precipitation is expected to increase by 9 to 11 % at the end of 21st century in China. Climate warming will provide more heat and as a consequence, the boundary of the triple-cropping system (TCS) will extend northwards by as much as 200 to 300 km, from the Yangtze River Valley to the Yellow River Basin, and the current double-cropping system (DCS) will move to the central part of China, into the current single cropping system (SCS) area which will decrease in SCS surface area of 23.1 % by 2050. Climate warming will also affect the optimum location for the cultivation of China's main crop varieties. If no measures are taken to adapt to climate changes, compared with the potential yield in 1961-1990, yields of irrigated wheat, corn and rice are projected to decrease by 2.2-6.7 %, 0.4 %-11.9 % and 4.3-12.4 % respectively in the 2050s. Climate warming will enhance potential evaporation and reduce the availability of soil moisture, thus causing a greater need for agricultural irrigation, intensifying the conflict between water supply and demand, especially in arid and semi-arid areas of China. With adequate irrigation, the extent of the reduction in yield of China's corn and wheat can be improved by 5 % to 15 %, and rice by 5 % or so than the potential yield in 1961-1990. Adaptive measures can reduce the agricultural loss under climate change. If effective measures are taken in a timely way, then climate change in the next 30-50 years will not have a significant influence on China's food security.","[Ju, Hui; Lin, Erda; Xiong, Wei; Li, Yingchun] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Ju, Hui; Xiong, Wei] Minist Agr, Key Lab Agr Environm, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [van der Velde, Marijn] IIASA, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Environment & Sustainable Development in Agriculture, CAAS; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)","Ju, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",juhui@ieda.org.cn,"xiong, wei/O-1782-2014; van der Velde, Marijn/B-3305-2009","van der Velde, Marijn/0000-0002-9103-7081; Xiong, Wei/0000-0003-2007-8190",National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2012CB955904]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31171452]; SAIN project; Defra UK; Chinese Ministry of Agriculture [H5105000],"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); SAIN project; Defra UK(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); Chinese Ministry of Agriculture(Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs)","The project was funded by National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program, No. 2012CB955904), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31171452), and SAIN project initiated by Defra UK and Chinese Ministry of Agriculture (H5105000).

The design of public participation is often determined by local government. Yet, it remains largely unclear to what extent there is deliberate design of participation efforts and which objectives are served with the designs put into practice. This article reviews three cases of adaptation planning in the Netherlands, using a theory-derived framework that links the design of public participation with nine different objectives that participation could have. These case studies illustrate that participants did not depart from an explicitly formulated and agreed-upon objective, leading to a design of the participatory process that was highly contingent. The findings suggest that a more systematic and deliberate approach, in which both the objectives and the design of public participation are communicated explicitly, and are discussed by participants, increases the chance that the objectives are met.","[Uittenbroek, Caroline J.; Mees, Heleen L.

We employed a semi-structured questionnaire based on the literature; it was broken up into sections, and used certain statistical techniques (PLS-SEM) to examine the results. Farmers who had sufficient assets and resources thought they were safer and could withstand the adverse effects of climate change. A total of 900 completed questionnaires were gathered to investigate the link between the control, moderator, and DV variables in the future. As a consequence, the PLS-SEM path analysis findings showed that our model is fit. PLS-SEM direct path analysis revealed AM >FACC, UA- >FACC, SA- >FACC, FS- >FACC, PR- >FACC, and SI- >FACC are significant. The established hypotheses H1-H6 are strengthened by these findings. We also examined the respondents' ages and genders to use as controls; whereas gender showed no correlation with FACC, there was a strong link between age and the dependent variable. There is no statistically significant correlation between gender and climate change awareness, but older people tend to have a broader understanding of the topic and its consequences. Education significantly moderates the relationship of farmer's awareness (climate change) associated with AM, UA, SA, FS, PR, and SI. depicts the moderation role of education on the relationship between AM*Education->FACC, UA*Education->FACC, SA*Education- >FACC, FS*Education- >FACC, PR*Education- >FACC, and SI*Education- >FACC.

However, increase in temperature and change in both magnitude and its spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall under changing climate are adversely affecting the freshwater resources availability. This study aims to model the blue and green water resources availability under changing climate within Weyb River basin in Ethiopia at both basin and sub-basin level using ArcSWAT hydrologic model. All water balance components including blue water flow (sum of the water yield and the deep aquifer recharge), green water flow (actual evapotranspiration), and green water storage (soil water) at both entire basin and sub-basin level were examined. Results reveal that mean annual blue water flow, green water flow, and green water storage exhibit a rise in the entire basin and in all the sub-basins under representative concentration pathway (RCP)8.5/4.5/2.6 scenarios. The mean annual blue and green water flow increases by 28% and 30% under RCP8.5, 20% and 29.89% under RCP4.5, and 17% and 28.65% under RCP2.6 scenarios respectively, while the mean annual green water storage rises by 13.87%, 13.62%, and 13.60% under RCP8.5, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6 scenarios respectively in the entire basin. The sub-basin level analysis reveals that spatial variations of blue and green water resources availability in all the six sub-basins are very high as compared to that of the entire basin analysis under all RCP scenarios. This study provided significant insights into freshwater availability on a sub-basin level under future changing climate and it is paramount important to develop climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies at sub-basin level for optimum planning and management of freshwater availability within the Weyb River basin in upcoming period.

Assessing the reliability of these results is important because of their use for climate change adaptation. A first step to identify possible uncertainties is the validation of the climate model data. In this study, a simple approach is presented which uses statistical methods to estimate the accuracy of climate model data and provides a measure to assess the adequacy of the data for hydrological impact modelling. As an example the data of three regional climate models - including the statistical model WETTREG2006 and the dynamical models REMO and CLM, all driven by the global climate model ECHAM5/MPI-OM - are evaluated with respect to their ability to reproduce observed temperature and precipitation. The validation is carried out for interpolated areal means for the period from 1961-2000 based on daily values using different indices and efficiency criteria. The study area is the whole catchment of the rivers Aller and Leine (Lower Saxony, Germany), including nine subbasins of the catchment. The results show deviations for the dynamical climate models according to the observed temperatures as well as the drought indices. As regards WETTREG, however, all indices were in more or less good agreement. The hydrological model was able to adequately simulate discharge when driven by meteorological data and climate model data from the 20th century control run. However, the bandwidth of the goodness-of-fit of simulated historical high and low discharge was, however, larger than the bandwidth obtained for the corresponding extreme climate conditions. For a significance level of 95 % it could be evidenced by means of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test that the examined model chains are suitable for performing climate impact assessment. Albeit extreme conditions, especially low flows, should invariably be evaluated depending on the model chain in order to provide a more reliable basis for decisions and adaptation measures.","[Petry, Uwe] Hochwasservorhersagezent Niedersachs Landesbetrie, D-31135 Hildesheim, Germany; [Dietrich, Joerg; Berndt, Christian; Haberlandt, Uwe] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Wasserwirtschaft Hydrol & Landwirtschaftlich, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Foerster, Kristian] AlpS Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Wallner, Markus] BGR, D-30655 Hannover, Germany; [Meon, Guenter] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Leichtweiss Inst Wasserbau, Abt Hydrol Wasserwirtschaft & Gewasserschutz, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover; Braunschweig University of Technology,"Petry, U (corresponding author), Hochwasservorhersagezent Niedersachs Landesbetrie, Scharlake 39, D-31135 Hildesheim, Germany.",uwe.petry@nlwkn-hi.niedersachsen.de,"Haberlandt, Uwe/AAN-2788-2021; Dietrich, Jörg/I-1208-2015; Förster, Kristian/I-3813-2019","Dietrich, Jörg/0000-0002-1742-8025; Förster, Kristian/0000-0001-7542-2820; Haberlandt, Uwe/0000-0002-3650-4249",,,,,42,4,4,0,8,BUNDESANSTALT GEWASSERKUNDE-BFG,KOBLENZ,"POSTFACH 200 253, KOBLENZ, 56002, GERMANY",1439-1783,,,HYDROL WASSERBEWIRTS,Hydrol.

Charge-on-the-move is considered to be a key enabling factor in moving toward electric vehicles. The development of individual charging devices for implementing in-motion charging has been rapid but their integration with the road infrastructure at national scale is still in need of more comprehensive consideration. This paper aims to outline the performance requirements of a national power infrastructure suitable for implementing charge-on-the-move. From an estimation of electric vehicles' power requirements in conjunction with Great Britain's road traffic data the anticipated power demand is expected to be augmented by 16 GW. Furthermore, a simulation tool is proposed to investigate the application of dynamic charging and the effects of system design variables. Based on that a possible charging layout is suggested. Such infrastructure involves 30 kW chargers, 1.5-m length apiece, installed every 2.1 and 4.3 m on motorways and rural sections of road, respectively. Finally, a strategic overview for Great Britain suggests that the installation of a nationwide charging infrastructure of this type could be economically viable. Indeed, the cost to develop the infrastructure to enable the electrification of 86% of car-miles in Great Britain is around 76 pound billion at present prices.","[Nicolaides, Doros; Cebon, David; Miles, John] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [McMahon, Richard] Univ Warwick, Warwick Mfg Grp, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Cambridge; University of Warwick,"Nicolaides, D (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",dn314@cam.ac.uk; R.McMahon.1@warwick.ac.uk; dc@eng.cam.ac.uk; jcm91@eng.cam.ac.uk,,"Nicolaides, Doros/0000-0003-4523-1809",EPSRC [EP/K00915X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),,,51,6,6,2,9,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1932-8184,1937-9234,,IEEE SYST J,IEEE Syst.

Anthropologists use postcranial robusticity to infer the activity levels of prehistoric populations, and changes in robusticity are often used to support scenarios of adaptive change. These scenarios explain differences in morphology as the result of a change in lifestyle (habitual activity). One common scenario posits that early modern humans were more gracile than Neandertals because the modern humans' complex culture required less physical exertion. However, lifestyle is only one of many influences on morphology. Climate has clear correlations with physique and skeletal proportions. Analysis of recent humans that differ in terms of lifestyle and climatic adaptations reveals that limb bone robusticity varies with climate as much as or more than with lifestyle. Many of the differences in robusticity between Neandertals and early modern humans appear to be related to climatic adaptations. The results support thr single-recent-origin model of modern human origins. The differences in robusticity between Neandertals and early modem humans suggest that population replacement rather than local evolution best explains the emergence of modern humans in Europe. Both climatic adaptations (primarily body proportions) and lifestyle should be considered in analyses of robusticity.","Univ New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",University of New Mexico,"Pearson, OM (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",ompear@unm.edu,,"Pearson, Osbjorn/0000-0002-1814-7663",,,,,214,169,183,1,33,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0011-3204,1537-5382,,CURR ANTHROPOL,Curr.

It plays an important role in guiding policy makers to plan and implement adaptation practices to mitigate potential climate risks to crop. However, due to the diversity in the methodology of vulnerability assessment, there are still knowledge gaps in assessing and comparing crop vulnerability to climate in different regions of the world, including Australia.OBJECTIVE: Our main objectives were to: (1) present a vulnerability analytical method for wheat yield, which can be applied to different areas where long-term crop yield and climate data are available. (2) quantify temporal changes of the vulnerability of wheat yield to historical climate. (3) identify the most vulnerable region in study area to provide guidance for climate mitigation.METHODS: Our study developed an indicator-based method using exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to assess the vulnerability of crop yield. We used the long-term recorded wheat yield data, combining with comprehensive exposure index to assess climate vulnerability of historical yield with a case study area of south-eastern Australia's wheat belt.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that from the 1930s to the 1990s, both climate exposure and sensitivity had large inter-annual variations with no significant trends detected. However, adaptive capacity increased by 34% from 1930s to 1950s, 54% from 1950s to 1970s, and 54% from 1970s to 1990s. By contrast, climate vulnerability across the wheat belt decreased by 13% from 1930s to 1950s, 15% from 1950s to 1970s, and 33% from 1970s to 1990s. This is mainly due to increased adaptive capacity with the improvement of agronomic management practices, technological and socio-economic progress. We identified the areas with the highest vulnerability were in the northwestern parts of wheat belt while the least vulnerable areas located in the southeast.SIGNIFICANCE: We expect that these identified vulnerable hotspots can be used by different landholders to allocate natural resources and policymakers to plan the priority mitigation to adapt to climate change in the local scale. Moreover, the method of vulnerability assessment used in this study can be applied to other regions around the world where long-term crop yield and climate data are available.","[Li, Siyi; Li, Linchao; Yu, Qiang] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Siyi; Shi, Lijie; Yu, Qiang] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Sci, Sch Life Sci, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Li, Siyi; Wang, Bin; Liu, De Li; Shi, Lijie] Wagga Wagga Agr Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2650, Australia; [Liu, De Li] Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Feng, Puyu] China Agr Univ, Coll Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Yu, Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Northwest A&F University - China; University of Technology Sydney; NSW Department of Primary Industries; University of New South Wales Sydney; China Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Yu, Q (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Wang, B; Liu, D (corresponding author), Wagga Wagga Agr Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2650, Australia.",bin.a.wang@dpi.nsw.gov.au; de.li.liu@dpi.nsw.gov.au; yuq@nwafu.edu.cn,"Wang, Bin/AFI-6568-2022; Yu, Qiang/D-3702-2009","Wang, Bin/0000-0002-6422-5802; Liu, De Li/0000-0003-2574-1908; Yu, Qiang/0000-0001-6950-1821",csc,csc,The first author acknowledges the China Scholarship Council (CSC) for the financial support for her Ph.D. study.

The standard precipitation index (SPI) and the standard precipitation evaporation index (SPEI) were used in this study in conjunction with precipitation and temperature projections from two general circulation models (GCMs), namely, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Parallel Climate Model (PCM) and the UK Meteorological Office Hadley Centre model (HCM) for two emission scenarios-A1B (similar to 720 ppm CO2 stabilization) and B1 (similar to 550 ppm CO2 stabilization) at six major urban centers of south Texas spanning five climatic zones. Both the models predict a progressively increasing aridity of the region throughout the twenty-first century. The SPI exhibits greater variability in the available moisture during the first half of the twenty-first century while the SPEI depicts a downward trend caused by increasing temperature. However, droughts during the latter half of the twenty-first century are due to both increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation. These results suggest that droughts during the first half of the twenty-first century are likely caused by meteorological demands (temperature or potential evapotranspiration (PET) controlled), while those during the latter half are likely to be more critical as they curtail moisture supply to the region over large periods of time (precipitation and PET controlled). The drought effects are more pronounced for the A1B scenario than the B1 scenario and while spatial patterns are not always consistent, the effects are generally felt more strongly in the hinterlands than in coastal areas. The projected increased warming of the region, along with potential decreases in precipitation, points toward increased reliance on groundwater resources which are noted to be a buffer against droughts. However, there is a need for human adaptation to climate change, a greater commitment to groundwater conservation and development of large-scale regional aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) facilities that are capable of long-term storage in order to sustain groundwater availability. Groundwater resource managers and planners must confront the possibility of an increased potential for prolonged (multi-year) droughts and develop innovative strategies that effectively integrate water augmentation technologies and conservation-oriented policies to ensure the sustainability of aquifer resources well into the next century.","[Hernandez, E.

However, the spatio-temporal variations in FFP and FD and their response to climate change remain unclear across China. To investigate the impact of climate change on FFP and FD, the trends and variations in FFP and FD across China from 1950 to 2020 were quantified using ERA5-Land, a reanalysis dataset with high spatial and temporal resolution. The results showed that ERA5-Land has good applicability in quantifying the trends and variations in FFP and FD across China under climate change. The spatial distribution of multi-year average FFP and FD across China showed significant latitudinal zonality and altitude dependence, i.e., FFP decreased with increasing latitude and altitude, while FD increased with increasing latitude and altitude. As a result of climate warming across China, the FFP showed an increasing trend with an increase rate of 1.25 d/10a and the maximum increasing rate of FFP in the individual region was 6.2 d/10a, while the FD showed a decreasing trend with a decrease rate of 1.41 d/10a and the maximum decreasing rate of FD in the individual region was -6.7 d/10a. Among the five major climate zones in China, the subtropical monsoon climate zone (SUMZ) with the greatest increasing rate of 1.73 d/10a in FFP, while the temperate monsoon climate zone (TEMZ) with the greatest decreasing rate of -1.72 d/10a in FD. In addition, the coefficient of variation (C-v) of FFP showed greater variability at higher altitudes, while the C-v of FD showed greater variability at lower latitudes in southern China. Without considering the adaptation to temperature of crops, a general increase in FFP and a general decrease in FD were both beneficial to agricultural production in terms of FFP and FD promoting a longer growing period and reducing frost damage on crops. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the trends and variations in FFP and FD under climate change, which is of great scientific significance for the adjustment of the agricultural production layout to adapt to climate change in China.","[Li, Hongyuan; Han, Chuntan; Yang, Yong; Chen, Rensheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Qilian Alpine Ecol & Hydrol Res Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Li, Hongyuan; Han, Chuntan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Liu, Guohua] Hengyang Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Tourism, Hengyang 421000, Peoples R China; [Chen, Rensheng] Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian 710000, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Hengyang Normal University; Northwest University Xi'an","Chen, RS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Qilian Alpine Ecol & Hydrol Res Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",lihongyuan@nieer.ac.cn; lgh1990@lzb.ac.cn; hancht@lzb.ac.cn; yy177@lzb.ac.cn; crs2008@lzb.ac.cn,,"Li, Hongyuan/0000-0001-6305-0708","National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [41971041]; Joint Research Project of Three-River Headwaters National Park, Chinese Academy of Sciences; People's Government of Qinghai Province [LHZX-2020-11]; Sciences and Technology Plan Project of Gansu Province [21JR7RA056]; Open Research Fund of the National Cryosphere Desert Data Center [2021kf09]","National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Joint Research Project of Three-River Headwaters National Park, Chinese Academy of Sciences; People's Government of Qinghai Province; Sciences and Technology Plan Project of Gansu Province; Open Research Fund of the National Cryosphere Desert Data Center","This research was funded by the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (41971041), the Joint Research Project of Three-River Headwaters National Park, Chinese Academy of Sciences and the People's Government of Qinghai Province (LHZX-2020-11), the Sciences and Technology Plan Project of Gansu Province (21JR7RA056) and the Open Research Fund of the National Cryosphere Desert Data Center (2021kf09).",,85,4,4,8,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,MAY,2022,14,10,,,,,,,2400,10.3390/rs14102400,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14102400,,,19,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,1R6OJ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000803486900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is a valuable indicator for evaluating crop yields and provides information to growers and managers for developing climate change adaptation strategies. The objective of the study was to model the impacts of agroclimatic indicators on the performance of aboveground biomass (AGB) in Arabica coffee trees, a critical income source for millions of Ethiopians. One hundred thirty-five coffee tree stump diameters were measured at 40 cm above ground level. The historical (1998-2010) and future (2041-2070) agroclimatic data were downloaded from the European Coper-nicus climate change services website. All datasets were tested for missing data, outliers, and multicollinearity and were grouped into three clusters using the K-mean clustering method. The parameter estimates (coefficients of regression) were analyzed using a generalized regression model. The performance of coffee trees' AGB in each cluster was estimated using an artificial neural network model. The future expected change in AGB of coffee trees was compared using a paired t-test. The regression model's results reveal that the sensitivity of C. arabica to agroclimatic variables significantly differs based on the kind of indicator, RCP scenario, and microclimate. Under the current climatic conditions, the rise of the coldest minimum (TNn) and warmest (TXx) temperatures raises the AGB of the coffee tree, but the rise of the warmest minimum (TNx) and coldest maximum (TXn) temperatures decreased it (P < 0.05). Under the RCP4.5, the rise of consecutively dry days (CDD) and TNx would increase the AGB of the coffee tree, while TNx and TXx would decrease it (P < 0.05). Except for TXx, all indicators would significantly reduce the AGB of coffee trees under RCP8.5 (P < 0.05). The average values of AGB under the current, RCP4.5, and RCP85 climate change scenarios, respectively, were 26.66, 28.79, and 24.41 kg/tree. The predicted values of AGB under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 will be higher in the first and third clusters and lower in the second cluster in the 2060s compared to the current climatic conditions. As a result, early warning systems and adaptive strategies will be necessary to reduce the detrimental consequences of climate change. More research into the effects of other climatic conditions on crops, such as physiologically effective degree days, cold, hot, and rainy periods, is also required.","[Chalchissa, Fedhasa Benti; Tolossa, Alemayehu Regassa] Jimma Univ, Dept Nat Resource Management, Jimma, Ethiopia; [Diga, Girma Mamo] Ethiopia Agr Res Inst, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Feyisa, Gudina Legese] Addis Ababa Univ, Ctr Environm Sci, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Jimma University; Addis Ababa University,"Chalchissa, FB (corresponding author), Jimma Univ, Dept Nat Resource Management, Jimma, Ethiopia.",fedeesa@gmail.com,,"Benti, Fedhasa/0000-0002-7505-0139",Jimma University,Jimma University,"This work was supported by Jimma University, non-profit makingOrgainization",,67,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,AUG,2022,8,8,,,,,,,e10136,10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10136,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10136,,AUG 2022,13,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,3Y2GE,36016531,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000843545800022,View Full Record in Web of Science

The New South Wales (NSW)/Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Regional Climate Modelling project (NARCliM) has produced three dynamically downscaled reanalysis climate datasets along with 12 downscaled general circulation model (GCM) projections of current (1990-2009) and future climate. It is expected that the NARCliM dataset will be used for many climate change impact studies including water security assessment. Therefore, in this study we perform a case study investigation into the usefulness and limitations of using NARCliM data for water security assessment, using the Lower Hunter urban water supply system managed by Hunter Water Corporation. We compare streamflow and reservoir levels simulated using NARCliM rainfall and a gridded historical rainfall dataset (AWAP) and focus our analysis on the differences in the simulated streamflow and reservoir levels. We show that when raw (i.e. not bias-corrected) NARCliM rainfall and potential evapotran-spiration (PET) data is used to simulate streamflow and reservoir storage levels, some of the NARCliM datasets produce unrealistic results when compared with the simulations using AWAP; for example, some NARCliM datasets simulate reservoirs at or near empty while the AWAP reservoir simulations rarely drop below 60%. The bias-corrected NARCliM rainfall (corrected to AWAP) produces estimates of streamflow and reservoir levels that have a closer, but still inconsistent, match with the streamflow and reservoir levels simulated using AWAP directly. The inconsistency between the simulations using bias-corrected rainfall and historical AWAP rainfall is potentially because while bias-correction reduces systematic deviations it does not fix temporal rainfall sequencing issues. Additionally, the NARCliM PET is not bias-corrected and using bias-corrected rainfall with uncorrected PET in hydrological models results in physical inconsistencies in the rainfall-PET relationship and simulated streamflow. We demonstrate that rainfall plays a large role in the streamflow simulations, while PET seems to play a large role in the reasonableness of the simulated reservoir dynamics by determining the evaporation losses from the reservoirs. The downscaled GCM datasets that simulate the greatest average PET for 1990-2009 show reservoirs often (unrealistically) near empty. This study highlights the need to assess the validity of all climate data for the applications required, with a focus on long-term statistics for reservoir modelling and ensuring realism and coherence across all projected variables.","[Lockart, Natalie; Willgoose, Garry; Kuczera, George; Chowdhury, A.

Most studies, however, centre on theoretical, rather than empirical-based discussions of what path dependency is, how it occurs, and what factors assist in breaking path dependency. This paper provides a case study for the creation, maintenance, and attempts to break path dependency within the management of rivers in the Rangitaiki Plains of Aotearoa New Zealand from the 1890s until 2017. We deploy a historical institutionalist theorising on path dependency and institutional arrangements, while also incorporating ideas from indigenous and postcolonial scholarship, which extends current understandings of the factors that contribute towards path dependency at a local level. Through archival research, we demonstrate how successive generations of government policies and actions directed with a specific goal and underpinned by the hegemonic social values created a profoundly path dependent system of managing rivers and flood events. Increased flood vulnerability is one of the direct consequences of the plethora of freshwater engineering interventions which were (and are still) undertaken on the Rangitaiki Plains over the last century. The foundation of this path dependency, we argue, resides with the processes of indigenous dispossession and the marginalisation of Maori values from environmental governance and policy. Efforts to break path dependency, therefore, involve the formal recognition of Maori governance, values, and knowledge within policies, and the translation of Maori values into tangible actions that seek to destabilise Western command-and control approaches to flood risk management.","[Parsons, Meg; Fisher, Karen; Brown, Cilia] Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Nalau, Johanna] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sci, Sch Environm & Sci, Nathan, Qld, Australia",University of Auckland; Griffith University,"Parsons, M (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",meg.parsons@auckland.ac.nz,"Nalau, Johanna/V-5692-2018; Fisher, Karen/HJH-3615-2023; Parsons, Meg/C-2405-2019","Nalau, Johanna/0000-0001-6581-3967; Parsons, Meg/0000-0001-8721-659X",,,,,149,38,38,3,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

Interviews confirm that 'linear-rationalist' prescriptions commonly used for the ex-ante policy appraisal of science facilitate processes of politicisation, providing a facade of legitimacy behind which the inevitable normative decisions required during evidence development can be safely made for political ends. The UK's risk assessment was used tactically rather than instrumentally at all levels of government to garner political legitimacy for various policy portfolios. The tactical or political use of evidence occurred overtly, as an aid during policy advocacy, and covertly through the politicisation of expert knowledge. However, the linear-rationalist assessment method was largely inadequate for characterising climate change problems, for making instrumental use of climate science and suppressed broader institutional learning about climate-related policy-making.","[Tangney, Peter] Flinders Univ S Australia, Flinders Ctr Sci Educ 21st Century, Adelaide, SA 5042, Australia",Flinders University South Australia,"Tangney, P (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Flinders Ctr Sci Educ 21st Century, Adelaide, SA 5042, Australia.",peter.tangney@flinders.edu.au,"Tangney, Peter/O-2153-2015","Tangney, Peter/0000-0003-3878-4034",Griffith University; Australian Government,Griffith University(Griffith University); Australian Government(Australian Government),Griffith University provided funds as part of publication scholarship scheme run internally by Griffith University's Research Higher Degree office in conjunction with the Urban Research Program.

A particularly important outcome from this body of research has been to demonstrate how poor design and implementation of these projects can create significant negative socio-economic and ecological outcomes at a local level. However, unpicking the causal mechanisms through which these unintended outcomes are created within complex systems remains a challenge. Making use of Sovacool et al.'s (2015) influential 4Es framework and combining it with the 'Mechanisms of Social Change' (MOSC) language for analysing systems, our study aims to provide an approach for setting out casual pathways that explain how the implementation of adaptation projects creates negative as well as positive impacts.

Peatlands and vegetated coastal wetlands are among the most carbon rich sinks on the planet sequestering approximately as much carbon as do global forest ecosystems. Estimates of the consequences of rising temperature on current wetland carbon storage and future carbon sequestration potential are summarized. We also demonstrate the need to prevent drying of wetlands and thawing of permafrost by disturbances and rising temperatures to protect wetland carbon stores and climate adaptation/resiliency ecosystem services. Preventing further wetland loss is found to be important in limiting future emissions to meet climate goals, but is seldom considered. In Part 2, the paper explores the policy and management realm from international to national, subnational and local levels to identify strategies and policies reflecting an integrated understanding of both wetland and climate change science. Specific recommendations are made to capture synergies between wetlands and carbon cycle management, adaptation and resiliency to further enable researchers, policy makers and practitioners to protect wetland carbon and climate adaptation/resiliency ecosystem services.","[Moomaw, William R.] Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch Law & Diplomacy, Ctr Int Environm & Resource Policy, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Moomaw, William R.] Tufts Univ, Global Dev & Environm Inst, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Chmura, G.

Situated in the context of the broader conceptual and comparative literature, we structure our analysis around three themes, namely conceptual and analytical approaches; the research environment; and challenges of implementation. African climate change research reflects diverse mixtures of local priorities and international trends, often with some time lag. The research reviewed and represented in this special issue reveals clear gaps and weaknesses in relation to gendered understandings, approaches to environmental valuation, and climate and environmental justice. Implementational challenges range from resource constraints and perceived conflicts between meeting immediate development needs and longer term climate change action to lack of policy integration and effective governance. The potential importance of socio-ecological and technological transformations remains very largely unexplored and a sea change in attitudes and attention is required if the adaptation challenges are to be met.","[Simon, David] Univ London, Royal Holloway, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; [Simon, David] Chalmers Univ, Mistra Urban Futures, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Leck, Hayley] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London WC2 2AE, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London; Chalmers University of Technology; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Simon, D (corresponding author), Univ London, Royal Holloway, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",d.simon@rhul.ac.uk,,"Simon, David/0000-0002-3164-4138","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1229429] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))",,,66,27,27,3,30,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1877-3435,1877-3443,,CURR OPIN ENV SUST,Curr.

The very presence of Ganga is not only critical from a socio-cultural perspective; but it contributes to various economic and livelihood activities for the people residing in the basin. It is one of the most complex river basins in the world, in terms of the number of people residing in its basin space and the pressure on its water resources. Thus, the river is facing multiple challenges. There is a growing debate in India for improving the health of the Ganga River, mainly at two fronts, i.e., its water quality and quantity. WWF-India along with its partners is working towards the conservation of Ganga since last decade. Whilst the work has been multi-dimensional, ranging from the issues of flows in the river to water pollution, climate change adaptation and habitat and biodiversity conservation; however, in this paper the aspect of adequate flows in the river Ganga is discussed. During 2015-16, along with partners, VVWF-India conducted an action research study in over 2 million hectares of culturable command area of two irrigation systems taking off from River Ganga, to understand the barriers to implement Environmental Flows (E-Flows) in the critical stretch of river Ganga (between Haridwar and Triveni Sangam Allahabad). Under this initiative, the team tried to bridge the knowledge gap about potential trade-offs for implementation of E-Flows in a critical stretch of Ganga. The team made an attempt to understand the surface water allocation and water use scenario in western and central part of the state of Uttar Pradesh, where the Ganga water is used for agricultural purposes through major irrigation infrastructure. The E-Flows recommendations for critical locations downstream of two barrages, i.e., headworks of two major irrigation schemes, were developed. This paper discusses approaches for management of trade-offs to restore E-Flows in this stretch of Ganga and includes various management options-like (i) promotion of irrigation water use efficiency and (ii) institutional aspects. The paper argues that, whilst there is a widespread apprehension that, from the Ganga river water resources use, any curtailment in the allocation quota for irrigation would lead to an adverse impact on the farming community. However, actually after assessing the trade-offs, it can be inferred that although the E-Flows implementation in this stretch of Ganga would require enhancement of water in the river, but that requirement may not be substantial. Toward the end of the paper, challenges and opportunities for E-Flows implementation in the Upper Ganga are discussed.","[Kaushal, Nitin; Babu, Suresh; Mishra, Adit; Ghosh, Nilanjan; Kumar, Ravindra; Sinha, Phanish Kumar] World Wide Fund Nat India, New Delhi, India; [Ghosh, Nilanjan] Observer Res Fdn Kolkata, Kolkata, India; [Tare, Vinod] Indian Inst Technol Kanpur, Ctr Ganga River Basin Management Studies cGanga, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Verma, Ram Ujagir] Aarthik Vikas Evam Jan Kalyan Sansthan, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kanpur,"Kaushal, N (corresponding author), World Wide Fund Nat India, New Delhi, India.",nkaushal@wwfindia.net,,,CGIAR (Consultative Group on Integrated Agricultural Research) Research Programme on Water Land and Ecosystems - IWMI (International Water Management Institute-Sri Lanka),CGIAR (Consultative Group on Integrated Agricultural Research) Research Programme on Water Land and Ecosystems - IWMI (International Water Management Institute-Sri Lanka),"The work presented in the paper was part of the project, titled as Healthy Ganga-Cleaner Water and More Productive Ecosystems (2015-16); funded under CGIAR (Consultative Group on Integrated Agricultural Research) Research Programme on Water Land and Ecosystems, funded by IWMI (International Water Management Institute-Sri Lanka).",,14,6,6,0,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

These studies included the assessment of trends in average temperatures as well as extremes. In this study, historical trends in near-surface minimum and maximum temperatures as well as extreme temperature indices in South Africa were critically investigated by comparing quality-controlled station observations with downscaled model projections. Because climate models are the only means of generating future global warming projections, this critical point comparison between observed and downscaled model simulated time series can provide valuable information regarding the interpretation of model-generated projections. Over the historical 1951-2005 period, both observed data and downscaled model projections were compared at 22 point locations in South Africa. An analysis of model projection trends was conducted over the period 2006-2095. The results from the historical analysis show that model outputs tend to simulate the historical trends well for annual means of daily maximum and minimum temperatures. However, noteworthy discrepancies exist in the assessment of temperature extremes. While both the historical model simulations and observations show a general warming trend in the extreme indices, the observational data show appreciably more spatial and temporal variability. On the other hand, model projections for the period 2006-2095 show that for the medium-to-low concentration Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5, the projected decrease in cold nights is not as strong as is the case for the historically observed trends. However, the upward trends in warm nights for both the RCP4.5 and the high concentration RCP8.5 pathways are noticeably stronger than the historically observed trends. For cool days, future projections are comparable to the historically observed trends, but for hot days noticeably higher. Decreases in cold spells and increases in warm spells are expected to continue in future, with relatively strong positive trends on a regional basis. It is shown that projected trends are not expected to be constant into the future, in particular trends generated from the RCP8.5 pathway that show a strong increase in warming towards the end of the projection period. Significance: Comparison between the observed and simulated trends emphasises the necessity to assess the reliability of the output of climate models which have a bearing on the credibility of projections. The limitation of the models to adequately simulate the climate extremes, renders the projections conservative, which is an important result in the light of climate change adaptation.","[Kruger, Andries C.; Mbatha, Sifiso; Ngwenya, Sandile] South African Weather Serv, Climate Serv, Pretoria, South Africa; [Kruger, Andries C.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, Pretoria, South Africa; [Rautenbach, Hannes; Makgoale, Thabo E.] South African Weather Serv, Res & Dev, Pretoria, South Africa; [Rautenbach, Hannes] Univ Pretoria, Sch Hlth Syst & Publ Hlth, Pretoria, South Africa",South African Weather Service (SAWS); University of Pretoria; South African Weather Service (SAWS); University of Pretoria,"Kruger, AC (corresponding author), South African Weather Serv, Climate Serv, Pretoria, South Africa.;Kruger, AC (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, Pretoria, South Africa.",Andries.Kruger@weathersa.co.za,,"Rautenbach, Hannes/0000-0002-3292-5396; Makgoale, Thabo Elias/0000-0002-5197-4353; MBATHA, SIFISO/0000-0003-1974-6219; Ngwenya, Sandile Blessing/0000-0002-7306-0122",,,,,33,8,8,0,5,ACAD SCIENCE SOUTH AFRICA A S S AF,LYNWOOD RIDGE,"PO BOX 72135, LYNWOOD RIDGE 0040, SOUTH AFRICA",0038-2353,1996-7489,,S AFR J SCI,S.

However, more evidence is needed from the aviation industry or airport context, especially in Africa. This cross-sectional study aims to probe and demonstrate the effect of biospheric value on green management intransigence and perceived green performance, the mediating role of management intransigence and biospheric value, and the influence on pro-environmental behavior among airport management and employees. The extended theory of planned behavior (TPBe) and triple bottom line theory (TBL)/sustainable economic development theory (SED) (TBL/SED) set the foundation for this research study. With the case study approach, data were collected through online questionnaires from employees and management staff of two international airports in Lagos and Abuja, Nigeria. This scientific study contributes to the literature on green energy by shedding light on the importance of integrating green practices into airport operations with environmentally friendly programs. Its focus on green management intransigence and its implications on employees' behavior has received little or no attention. The data were analyzed using PLS-SEM and Importance-performance matrix analysis (IPMA). The IPMA is innovative as it helps to extend the results of PLS-SEM by also taking the importance and performance of each construct into account graphically as it relates to green airport management. IPMA posits that management tends to take actions to improve conditions that enhance factors of most significant concern to stakeholders. Our results reveal the effect of biospheric value and the behaviors of management and nonmanagement staff of the selected airports on the green performance with apparent differences in the group-specific performance. In practice, this implies an urgent need for airport management to review their approach and strategy to sustainable practices, airports' resilience, and adaptation to climate change for sustainable tourism development. This study advances scientific and practical knowledge of eco-design of airport buildings (EAB), biospheric-value (BV), and green management intransigence (GMI). The findings can assist decision makers and practitioners in embracing green technologies and practices in airport management and operations.","[Bamidele, Ruth Oluyemi; Ozturen, Ali; Haktanir, Mine] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Tourism, TR-99628 Famagusta, Turkiye; [Ogunmokun, Oluwatobi A.] Univ Chester, Chester Business Sch, Chester CH1 4BJ, England",University of Chester,"Bamidele, RO (corresponding author), Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Tourism, TR-99628 Famagusta, Turkiye.",rumikdanem@gmail.com,"Öztüren, Ali/AAG-4907-2021; Bamidele, Ruth Oluyemi/AHB-2884-2022","Öztüren, Ali/0000-0001-8879-1916; Bamidele, Ruth Oluyemi/0000-0002-6091-3800; Ogunmokun, Oluwatobi A./0000-0002-0095-1522",Scientific Research Funding Committee of the Eastern Mediterranean University [BAPC-0B-21-01]; R.O.B,Scientific Research Funding Committee of the Eastern Mediterranean University; R.O.B,"This research was funded by the Scientific Research Funding Committee of the Eastern Mediterranean University under project funding number BAPC-0B-21-01, and The APC was funded by R.O.B.",,122,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2023,15,3,,,,,,,2475,10.3390/su15032475,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15032475,,,26,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,8Y3GH,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000932586300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using an irrigated cotton farm in southern Queensland as a case study, we investigated two possible adaptation strategies in response to changes in water resources from projected climate change (CSIRO Mk3.5, A1FI scenario). The modelled farm produced irrigated cotton, wheat, maize, and non-irrigated sorghum. The adaptation Strategy 1 allowed the substitution of current (baseline) production system with a system of less intensive cotton (2 m row spacing) and a maximum of 2 in-crop irrigations instead of 4. Whereas Strategy 2 allowed for the production option of dryland cotton in the rotation and implied as much 2 m row spacing cotton planting as possible depending on the other cropping rules regardless of the state of water storages. These two strategies were examined using a bio-economic farm enterprise model by evaluating the effects of projected changes in yield, water use and farm profitability (gross margin, GM), which resulted from crops competing for resources (i.e. irrigation water). Results showed 14% less water available in the 2030 s and 2050 s compared to the baseline (1960-2010), as a result of climate change and water policy decisions, thereby reducing the input costs. Under Strategy 1 there were 12.1% and 4.4% yield decreases in 2030 and 2050, respectively; while under Strategy 2 the inter-annual yield variability and proportion of low yields (<5 bales/ha) increased over the same periods. Without adaptation GMs were reduced by 27% and 43% in 2030 and 2050, respectively. Strategy 1 resulted in 8.8% increase and 15.8% decrease in 2030 and 2050, respectively. However with Strategy 2, GM increases were observed (49% and 12%, respectively in 2030 and 2050). Moreover, without appropriate adaptation options, the enterprise would have to reduce the area of irrigated cotton, causing reductions in farm business gross margins. Our findings suggested that decreased water availability would not significantly impact the cotton production system and profitability if suitable adaptation options are available.

The social, economic and environmental adaptation that this region must make in the mid- and long-term period has to take into account the changes in the tourist potential when the climate changes. A second-generation climate index for tourism (CIT) has been adopted to measure tourism potential under the present and possible future climatic conditions. CIT is a theoretically based and empirically derived index that allows assessing the sun, sea and sand (3S) weather resource. Daily observed series of 2 m maximum temperature, precipitation, 2 m relative humidity, cloud cover and 10 m wind speed have been used to derive the present climate potential for tourism. For future projections, daily averaged meteorological variables have been obtained from a set of regional climate models (RCMs) within the European ENSEMBLES project. The adoption of a multimodel ensemble strategy allows quantifying the uncertainties arising from model errors and boundary conditions. To use CIT values based on RCM data properly at local scales, a quantilequantile adjustment has been applied. Results show a significant increase in the annual frequency of days with acceptable conditions together with a slightly increment for the ideal climate perceptions at the expense of decreasing unacceptable categories. For the summery peak season, ideal conditions are projected to decrease from mid-century favouring acceptable categories. However, an almost general increase for both classes is anticipated in spring and autumn throughout the century. That is, higher frequencies of optimal climate perceptions for carrying out 3S outdoors activities are expected to shift from the peak to shoulder seasons. Therefore, climate change would result in a major impact for the current seasonally adjusted service sector in SPdP. With this information at hand, policy makers and the team of experts planning its socioeconomic future can respond more effectively to the demanding challenge of local adaptation to climate change by implementing adaptation and mitigation strategies to the tourist sector.

Design Secondary analysis of quantitative data from a prospective cohort study. Setting Community-based interviews in the commune of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Exclusive breastfeeding is not widely practised in Burkina Faso. Participants 866 women (1:1 urban:rural) were interviewed over 12 months. Participants were interviewed at three time points: cohort entry (when between 20 weeks' gestation and 22 weeks' postpartum), three and nine months thereafter. Retention at nine-month follow-up was 90%. Our secondary analysis focused on postpartum women (n=857). Exposure Daily mean temperature (degrees C) measured at one weather station in Bobo-Dioulasso. Meteorological data were obtained from publicly available archives (TuTiempo.net). Primary outcome measures Self-reported time spent breastfeeding (minutes/day), exclusive breastfeeding of infants under 6 months (no fluids other than breast milk provided in past 24 hours), supplementary feeding of infants aged 6-12 months (any fluid other than breast milk provided in past 24 hours), time spent caring for children (minutes/day). Results The population experienced year-round high temperatures (daily mean temperature range=22.6 degrees C-33.7 degrees C). Breastfeeding decreased by 2.3 minutes/day (95% CI -4.6 to 0.04, p=0.05), and childcare increased by 0.6 minutes/day (0.06 to 1.2, p=0.03), per 1 degrees C increase in same-day mean temperature. Temperature interacted with infant age to affect breastfeeding duration (p=0.02), with a stronger (negative) association between temperature and breastfeeding as infants aged (0-57 weeks). Odds of exclusive breastfeeding very young infants (0-3 months) tended to decrease as temperature increased (OR=0.88, 0.75 to 1.02, p=0.09). There was no association between temperature and exclusive breastfeeding at 3-6 months or supplementary feeding (6-12 months). Conclusions Women spent considerably less time breastfeeding (similar to 25 minutes/day) during the hottest, compared with coolest, times of the year. Climate change adaptation plans for health should include advice to breastfeeding mothers during periods of high temperature.","[Part, Cherie; Hajat, Shakoor; Kovats, Sari] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Publ Hlth Environm & Soc, London, England; [Filippi, Veronique; Cresswell, Jenny A.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England; [Ganaba, Rasmane] Agence Format Rech & Expertise Sante Afrique AFRI, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso; [Nakstad, Britt] Univ Oslo, Inst Clin Med, Div Child & Adolescent Hlth, Oslo, Norway; [Nakstad, Britt] Univ Botswana, Dept Pediat & Adolescent Hlth, Gaborone, Botswana; [Roos, Nathalie] Karolinska Inst, Dept Med, Clin Epidemiol Div, Stockholm, Sweden; [Kadio, Kadidiatou; Kouanda, Seni] Inst Rech Sci Sante, Dept Biomed & Sante Publ, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Chersich, Matthew] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Reprod Hlth & HIV Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Lusambili, Adelaide] Aga Khan Univ, Med Coll, Dept Populat Hlth, Nairobi, Kenya",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of Oslo; University of Botswana; Karolinska Institutet; University of Witwatersrand; Aga Khan University,"Part, C (corresponding author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Publ Hlth Environm & Soc, London, England.",cherie.part@lshtm.ac.uk,,"Part, Cherie/0000-0002-3281-1671","Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/K011049/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/T013613/1, NE/T01363X/1]; Research Council of Norway [312601]; Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare; Swedish Research Council (Forte) [2019-01570]","Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte)); Swedish Research Council (Forte)","The PopDev study was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in response to the Joint ESRC-WOTRO-RCN-PRB-Hewlett call on Population & Development (grant number ES/K011049/1).

As croplands are depleted in SOC, they offer a great potential to sequester atmospheric carbon (C). Nonetheless, croplands are still losing SOC under most of the current agricultural systems. Although many factors driving SOC dynamics have already been identified, their relative importance has not been quantified yet. Using one of the densest European soil monitoring networks with 250 sites established in western Switzerland, in the present study we (i) assessed long-term (over 30 years) SOC dynamics in croplands (CR), permanent grasslands (PG) and mountain pastures (MP), and (ii) prioritized the importance of land use, soil characteristics and sites conditions in driving SOC dynamics. The SOC levels in PG and MP were similar when clay content was accounted for, whereas CR were depleted in SOC by 3.9 mg C mg(-1) clay as compared to PG. The majority (61 %) of CR had SOC:clay ratio below 1:10, but only 16 % of PG and MP sites reached this threshold. By contrast, soil organic matter stoichiometry (C:N:Porg ratios) was similar in CR and PG for comparable SOC content. The increase of C:Porg ratio with SOC content (dilution effect) and the high total P in CR and PG (legacy effect) indicate the possibility to sequester atmospheric C at reduced nutrient sequestration costs. SOC changes ranged from -0.61 to 1.32 mg g(-1) soil yr(-1) and were the highest in sites that experienced land-use changes. No PG were losing SOC, while CR sites exhibited both SOC gains and losses. Because of the predominance of the initial SOC content on SOC dynamics, land-use history must be accounted for when assessing the effect of management practices. The main manageable factors driving SOC dynamics were the time under temporary or permanent grasslands along with the soil total P. As PG already are rich in SOC and total P, organic amendments should be partly redirected to CR.","[Guillaume, Thomas; Bragazza, Luca; Sinaj, Sokrat] Agroscope, Res Div Plant Prod Syst, Field Crop Syst & Plant Nutr, Route Duillier 50,POB 1012, CH-1260 Nyon, Switzerland; [Levasseur, Clement] Agr Inst Fribourg Canton, Route Grangeneuve 31, CH-1725 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Libohova, Zamir] NRCS, USDA, Natl Soil Survey Ctr, 100 Centennial Mall North,Fed Bldg Room 152, Lincoln, NE 68508 USA",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Sinaj, S (corresponding author), Agroscope, Res Div Plant Prod Syst, Field Crop Syst & Plant Nutr, Route Duillier 50,POB 1012, CH-1260 Nyon, Switzerland.",sokrat.sinaj@agroscope.admin.ch,"Guillaume, Thomas/B-1651-2018; Sinaj, Sokrat/ABG-6818-2020; Bragazza, Luca/U-9089-2017","Guillaume, Thomas/0000-0002-6926-9337; Bragazza, Luca/0000-0001-8583-284X",internal budet of Agroscope,internal budet of Agroscope,This study was funded by the internal budet of Agroscope.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between heatwaves and hospitalization and the potential influence of socio-economic factors on this relationship in Vietnam. Generalized Linear Models (GLM) with Poisson family and Distributed Lag Models (DLM) were applied to evaluate the effect of heatwaves for each province (province-level effect). A random-effects meta analysis was applied to calculate the pooled estimates (country-level effects) for 'all causes', infectious, cardiovascular, and respiratory admissions queried by lag days, regions, sex, and ages. We used random effects meta-regression to explore the potential influence of socio-economic factors on the relationship between heatwaves and hospitalization. The size of province-level effects varied across provinces. The pooled estimates show that heatwaves were significantly associated with a 2.5% (95%CI: 0.8-4.3) and 3.8% (95%CI, 1.5-6.2) increase in all causes and infectious admissions at lag 0. Cardiovascular and respiratory admissions (0.8%, 95%CI: -1.6-3.3; 2.2%, 95%CI: -0.7-5.2) were not significantly increased after a heatwave event. The risk of hospitalization due to heatwaves was higher in the North than in the South for all causes (5.4%, 95%CI: -0.1-11.5 versus 1.3%, 95%CI: 0.1-2.6), infectious (11.2%, 95%CI: 3.1-19.9 versus 3.2%, 95%CI: 0.7-5.7), cardiovascular (7.5%, 95%CI: 1.1-14.4 versus -1.2%, 95%CI: -2.6-2.3), and respiratory diseases (2.7%, 95%CI: -5.4 -11.5 versus 2.1%, 95%CI: -0.8-1.2). A non-significant influence of socio-economic factors on the relationship between heatwave and hospitalization was observed. This study provides important evidence and suggests implications for the projected impacts of climate change related extreme weather: Climate change adaptation programs of the health sector should be developed to protect residents from the effects of extreme weather events such as heatwaves in Vietnam.

Climate change models predict more extreme rainfall patterns, ranging from droughts to deluges, which will inevitably affect primary productivity in many terrestrial ecosystems. Insects within the ecosystem, living above-and below-ground, may modify plant responses to water stress. For example, some functional groups improve soil conditions via resource provision, potentially alleviating water stress. Enhanced resource provision may, however, render plants more susceptible to herbivores and negate beneficial effects. 2. Using a model system, we tested how plants (Brassica oleracea) responded to drought, ambient and increased precipitation scenarios when interacting with both a soil conditioning ecosystem engineer (dung beetles; Bubas bison) and an above-ground herbivore, the major crop pest diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella). 3. Dung beetles enhanced soil water retention by 10% and promoted growth in plants subjected to drought by 280%, relieving the impacts of water stress on plants. Under drought conditions, plants grown with dung beetles had c. 30% more leaves and were over twice as tall as those without dung beetles. Dung beetles produced a 2.7-fold increase in nitrogen content and more than a threefold increase in carbon content of the shoots, though shoot concentrations of nitrogen and carbon were unchanged. Carbon concentrations in roots, however, were increased by dung beetles under both ambient and increased precipitation regimes. 4. Increased precipitation reduced root and shoot nitrogen concentrations by 16% and 30%, relative to plants under ambient regimes, respectively, most likely due to dilution effects of increased plant growth under increased precipitation. Soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations were largely unaffected. 5. While dung beetles enhanced plant growth and nitrogen content in plants experiencing drought, the anticipated increase in plant suitability to herbivores did not arise, possibly because shoot nitrogen concentrations and C:N ratio were unaffected. 6. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an insect ecosystem engineer alleviating the effects of predicted drought events on plants via physical manipulation of the soil matrix. Moreover, their effects did not change plant suitability to an above-ground herbivore, pointing to potential beneficial role for insect ecosystem engineers in climate change adaptation and crop protection.","[Johnson, Scott N.; Lopaticki, Goran; Barnett, Kirk; Facey, Sarah L.; Powell, Jeff R.] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Hartley, Susan E.] Univ York, York Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Dept Biol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",Western Sydney University; University of York - UK,"Johnson, SN (corresponding author), Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.",Scott.Johnson@western.edu.au,"Johnson, Scott N/B-2268-2012; Barnett, Kirk/H-6964-2019; Powell, Jeff R/A-5076-2010; Johnson, Scott/HDN-6310-2022","Barnett, Kirk/0000-0002-3370-8676; Powell, Jeff R/0000-0003-1091-2452; Hartley, Sue/0000-0002-5117-687X; Johnson, Scott/0000-0002-8388-8345; Facey, Sarah/0000-0003-1036-5110",F.G.

In this article, we analyze negotiations in Houston, Texas, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to identify which methods municipal leaders employed to conduct negotiations to implement climate adaptation policies and also consider whether those methods were effective.

In this study, uptake and accumulation of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and their bioavailability in the rhizosphere across the Salix clones under flooded versus non-flooded (control) conditions were investigated using a pot experiment. The tested Salix clones grew well without showing any toxic symptoms under non-flooded soil condition; in contrast, the clones showed 100% survival for long-term flooding with the development of hypertrophied lenticels and adventitious roots. There were wide clonal variations in biomass production and accumulation of Cu and Zn under flooded and non-flooded conditions. Flooded treatments dramatically decreased aboveground biomass across the Salix clones to different extents compared to the control. The non-flooded clones exhibited relatively high accumulation capacities of Cu and Zn in aerial parts. However, the flooded clones resulted in more substantial reductions in Cu and Zn accumulation in aerial parts, and most of Cu and Zn were limited in roots. EDTA-extractable Cu and Zn predicted well bioavailability of Cu and Zn to the Salix clones under the current condition.

I find that increasing the downstream flow of sediments retained in upstream dams is a crucial measure for dealing with climate change threats (sea-level rise) in the Delta. Yet, state policies do not increase sediment flow, but instead implement incremental adaptation at the site of climate impact (coast), which, at times, requires executing small-scale land expropriations. Refraining from improving human security via increasing sediment flow benefits corporate interests upstream. At the same time, expropriation silences mild farmer protest downstream and adds insult to injury by conveying to farmers a sense of blame for their vulnerability to climate change. Meanwhile, using expropriation at the service of incremental adaptation goes against the very rationale of expropriation established by Spanish legislation and creates a fundamental contradiction between what the practice is meant to deliver, namely security and the social contract from the part of the state, and what it actually does, i.e. permit the state to evade providing human security. I conclude that, under climate change, achieving human security, the delivery of the social contract, and corporate rent-seeking at the same time may not be possible. Moreover, rather than the social contract been threatened by state incapacity to respond to the effects of climate change and breached social contract expectations of vulnerable communities, it is the actual mobilisation of the contract in order to respond to climate change that diminishes human security.

We then use the case of Houston, Texas - the site of more than 3000 such buyouts between 2000 and 2017 - to build a unique dataset that enables, for the first time, address-level analysis of such environmental mobility. Results affirm that most people who move from residences of publicly identified environmental risk relocate to destinations nearby.

The current study assesses the impacts of climate and socio-economic changes on smallholder farms in two districts of Ethiopia representing different agro-ecology in a major agricultural region. For this purpose, observed farm production data, simulated yield under climate change and socio-economic scenarios were used. The aim was to produce information that facilitates an understanding of the unequal economic implications of climate change on farms. To this end, the study applied the Tradeoff Analysis for Multi-Dimensional impact assessment (TOA-MD) economic simulation model in combination with the AquaCrop yield simulation model. The findings on climate change impact towards 2030 highlight the uneven implications of climate change on farms and the role that agro-ecology and future solo-economic development scenarios play in determining climate change impact. It is found that, under the climate projections we considered crops such as tef, barley and wheat are found to benefit from the projected climate change in cool regions. In warm regions, tef and wheat are projected to be negatively affected whereas maize would benefit. The proportion of farms that are negatively affected by climate change ranged between 51% and 78% in warm regions under different scenarios; in cool regions, the proportion of negatively affected farms ranged between 10% and 22%. The implications of climate change are found to vary under various socio-economic scenarios, in which positive socio-economic scenarios considerably reduced the proportion of negatively affected farms. The economic implications of climate change also found to differ among farms within agro-ecology because of differences in land allocation to various crops that have different sensitivity to climate change, and due to other farm differences. Thus, the study shows the importance of using farm and site-specific production and climate data to reveal variabilities in climate change impact. It also provides evidence on the relevance of accounting for agro-ecology and crop differences as well as consideration of potential socio-economic changes. Overall, the results suggest that appropriate agricultural interventions that recognize location and crop differences are essential to minimize climate change impact. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Satellite altimetry data have been widely used for this purpose; however, data collected in regions with strong tidalmotions often suffer from significant aliasing effects unless they are sufficiently corrected using accurate ocean tide models.Long-term trends estimated from altimetry data are often also considerably affected by regional circulation changes, and by artificial effects arising from inconsistencies between different satellite missions. Here, we focused on two regions with high (>5 mm.yr(-1)) rates of long-term linear trend in sea level rise (LTSLR) around the Korean Peninsula (KP). We addressed the impacts of tidal correction and mission inconsistency in satellite altimetry data, and discussed the potential impacts of circulation changes on LTSLR. Because the LTSLR estimation is affected by the aliasing effects of altimetry data when the tidal motions are not corrected sufficiently, yet the correction depends on the performance of ocean tide models, we employed eight ocean tide models to correct altimetry data for comparison and validated the results against observations from 13 tide gauge (TG) stations around the KP. We also estimated LTSLR from 1993 to 2019 using annual mean sea level anomalies (SLAs) from two satellite (two-sat) and all 21 satellite (all-sat) missions, with corrections for ocean tides. The TPXO9 model showed the most reasonable spatial LTSLR rate pattern (similar to 3 mm.yr(-1)), with the smallest difference from TG observations. It performed best near the west coast where the tidal range was the largest and when using two-sat data, because of inconsistencies in all-sat altimetry data. In contrast, off the east coast, where the impact of tidal correction is negligible, the high (similar to 7 mm.yr(-1)) LTSLR rates were robust regardless of ocean tide models and altimetry missions, potentially driven by long-term changes in regional circulation. Our results highlight the importance of tidal correction and mission inconsistency for improving LTSLR estimations around the KP. They also have significant implications for determining regional sea level rise under changing circulation patterns, within and beyond the region.","[Lee, KyungJae; Nam, SungHyun; Cho, Yang-Ki] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Nam, SungHyun; Cho, Yang-Ki] Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Oceanog, Seoul, South Korea; [Jeong, Kwang-Young; Byun, Do-Seong] Korea Hydrog & Oceanog Agcy, Ocean Res Div, Busan, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Nam, S (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul, South Korea.;Nam, S (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Oceanog, Seoul, South Korea.",namsh@snu.ac.kr,,"Nam, SungHyun/0000-0002-3338-0105; Lee, KyungJae/0000-0003-3812-9136","Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries (MOF), Republic of Korea [20160040]; Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency (KHOA), MOF, through the Analysis and Prediction of Sea Level Change in Response to Climate Change around the Korean Peninsula program","Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries (MOF), Republic of Korea; Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency (KHOA), MOF, through the Analysis and Prediction of Sea Level Change in Response to Climate Change around the Korean Peninsula program","This research formed a part of the project titled Deep Water Circulation and Material Cycling in the East Sea (20160040) funded by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries (MOF), Republic of Korea.

Conservation farming (CF), including minimum tillage, crop rotation and crop residue retention, is proposed as a climate smart soil management option to adapt to climate change through enhanced climate resilience. Here, we determine the effect on soil moisture and temperature of CF planting basins in a Zambian Acrisol. Construction of CF planting basins (40 cm x 15 cm, while 20 cm deep), using hand-hoes, is a commonly used minimum tillage practice among small holders in southern Africa, effectively requiring tillage of only 10 % of a field. The study included basins under regular CF and under CF with 4 t ha(-1) pigeon pea biochar (CF + BC). Effects are compared with those in an adjacent soil under conventional tillage, where the entire land surface is ploughed. Soil moisture and temperature sensors were installed in the root zone, 10-12 cm deep, for continuous monitoring during two growing seasons. Soil moisture decreased in the order CF + BC > CF > conventional farming. Due to rainwater harvesting in the basins, maximum soil water retention under CF + BC and CF was greater than under conventional farming ( + 59 % to +107 % and + 15 % to + 65 %, respectively). Soil drying after free drainage until permanent wilting point lasted longer under CF + BC (18.4-22.3 days) than under both CF and conventional farming (13.3-18.4 days and 14.9-17.8 days, respectively). In situ soil maximum temperature and diurnal temperature range in the growing season increased in the order CF + BC < CF < conventional farming due to decreases in soil moisture. However, additional laboratory tests, with soil-BC mixtures at field capacity, revealed that BC addition to soil, which caused a decrease in bulk density, also resulted in a significant decline in soil thermal conductivity (p < 0.001). Thus, we hypothesize that BC-enhanced soil moisture in basins helped to reduce soil temperature and its fluctuations, due to both increased heat capacity and decreased thermal conductivity. This study shows that CF in combination with BC in an Acrisol, through enhancing plant-available water and moderating soil temperature, is important for crop productivity and has potential as an element of climate smart agriculture.","[Obia, Alfred; Cornelissen, Gerard; Smebye, Andreas Botnen] Norwegian Geotech Inst, Dept Environm Engn, POB 3930, NO-0806 Oslo, Norway; [Cornelissen, Gerard; Martinsen, Vegard; Mulder, Jan] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management MINA, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Obia, Alfred] Gulu Univ, Fac Agr & Environm, Dept Agron, POB 166, Gulu, Uganda","Norwegian Geotechnical Institute, NGI; Norwegian University of Life Sciences","Obia, A; Cornelissen, G (corresponding author), Norwegian Geotech Inst, Dept Environm Engn, POB 3930, NO-0806 Oslo, Norway.;Obia, A; Cornelissen, G (corresponding author), Gulu Univ, Fac Agr & Environm, Dept Agron, POB 166, Gulu, Uganda.",obialfrd@yahoo.com; Gerard.Cornelissen@ngi.no,"Obia, Alfred/AAE-7257-2019; Martinsen, Vegard/H-9406-2014","Obia, Alfred/0000-0003-0960-7020; Martinsen, Vegard/0000-0002-7096-1806","Department for International Development (DFID), UK through Climate Smart Agriculture in Zambia (CSAZ) project; Norwegian Research Council under the project FriPro [217918]; Faculty of Environmental Sciences and Natural Resource Management, Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU); Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI); Research Council of Norway through FriPro; DFID through CSAZ","Department for International Development (DFID), UK through Climate Smart Agriculture in Zambia (CSAZ) project; Norwegian Research Council under the project FriPro; Faculty of Environmental Sciences and Natural Resource Management, Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU); Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI); Research Council of Norway through FriPro(Research Council of Norway); DFID through CSAZ","We are grateful to our funders, Department for International Development (DFID), UK through Climate Smart Agriculture in Zambia (CSAZ) project, Norwegian Research Council under the project FriPro number 217918 and Faculty of Environmental Sciences and Natural Resource Management, Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU) through a stipend awarded to Vegard Martinsen for funding our field research in Zambia.

Given its particular institutional status and specific focus on concrete adaptation, it is particularly relevant to study the initial experiences of it for any future upscaling of international adaptation finance, despite the fact that its own resources are getting scarce. Alternative rationales for allocating funds, based on equity and efficiency concerns at both international and subnational levels, are here tested against the criteria and priorities of the Fund and decisions made on project approval. It is concluded that equity concerns appear to be the primary motivation and that allocation is de facto made between states rather than by considering inequity between subnational communities. However, the currency of vulnerability for determining equitable outcomes in allocation decisions has not been formalized, despite its central importance to the Fund. Instead, uniform national caps have been introduced. Such an equality approach can be considered inequitable. Finally, it is noted that although the Adaptation Fund Board has continuously developed its proposal review practices and adopted a learning-by-doing approach, it should provide both a further specification of the evaluation criteria and a compilation of best practices from approved proposals, and moreover enhance the transparency of the review process, all of which would clarify its core priorities for current and future project proponents. Policy relevance Adaptation to climate change is a complex phenomenon. Given the uncertainty of climate impacts, the magnitude of expected adaptation needs globally, the limited knowledge regarding what constitutes effective adaptation, and scarce public resources, it is of vital importance that the policy and scientific communities learn how it can best be supported. The Adaptation Fund is an innovative funding mechanism in several respects, yet it is still unclear what the underlying rationale is that informs the allocation of its scarce resources. This article aims to interpret whether equity or efficiency concerns influence allocation and make some concrete recommendations as to its future form, thereby contributing to the state of knowledge regarding the Fund's role.","[Persson, Asa; Remling, Elise] SEI, SE-10451 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm Environment Institute,"Persson, A (corresponding author), SEI, Linnegatan 87D,Box 24218, SE-10451 Stockholm, Sweden.",asa.persson@sei-international.org,"Persson, Åsa/ABD-8096-2021","Persson, Asa/0000-0002-8886-5046; Remling, Elise/0000-0003-2466-3506",,,,,65,50,51,0,30,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Within the urban canopy layer (UCL), traffic-origin PM2.5 and black carbon followed Gaussian dispersion in the near road area in the daytime, while higher concentrations, over 1 order of magnitude, were correlated to the lapse rate under nocturnal inversions. In the overlying urban boundary layer (UBL), ambient temperature and PM2.5 variations were correlated among urban-wide locations indicating effective thermal and mass communications. Beyond the spatial correlation, LULC-related local urban heat island effects are noteworthy. The high-density urbanized zone along a narrow highway-following corridor is marked by higher nighttime temperature by similar to 1.6 degrees C with a long-term increase by 2.0 degrees C/decade, and by a higher PM2.5 concentration, than in the low-density residential LULC.

Gender, along with other social factors, plays divisive roles to regulate people's capacities to respond to climate crises. This paper undertakes a systematic review of the literature to explore the trends of research in developing countries on gender and adaptive capacity concerns. Leximancer was employed to undertake textual analysis of research articles (n = 59) published from 2010 to 2020. Thematic and concept analysis indicated that agriculture-related concerns were the key topic to prompt discussion on gender and adaptive capacities of vulnerable people. Concepts of power, social norms, control over assets, and decision-making processes were found to have a joint effect on the capacity building of vulnerable people, particularly women. The findings suggested that while discussing vulnerability and adaptive capacity of women, the associated subjects of discussion such as income, organization, community, water, food, farming, security, and land vary in African and Asian countries. The growing attention in adaptation research to better understand the opportunities to adequately support women's adaptive capacities will require focusing on a collective approach of incorporating social, cultural, situational, locational and historical contexts of gendered climate vulnerabilities in society.","[Dev, Debashish Sarker] Univ Queensland, Ctr Commun & Social Change, Sch Commun & Arts, St Lucia, Australia; [Dev, Debashish Sarker] Bangladesh Agr Univ, Dept Agr Extens Educ, Mymensingh, Bangladesh; [Manalo, Jaime A.] Philippine Rice Res Inst, Socioecon Div, Science City Of Munoz, Philippines",University of Queensland; Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU); Philippine Rice Research Institute,"Dev, DS (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Commun & Social Change, Sch Commun & Arts, St Lucia, Australia.",d.dev@uqconnect.edu.au,,"Dev, Debashish Sarker/0000-0001-7700-4761",,,,,92,0,0,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Building on our previous model that simulated key phenological, morphological, and physiological features of a garlic plant, the new garlic model provides comprehensive and integrative estimations of biomass accumulation and yield formation under diverse environmental conditions. This model also showcases an application of Cropbox to develop a comprehensive crop model. Cropbox is a crop modeling framework featuring declarative modeling language and a unified simulation interface for building and improving crop models. Using Cropbox, we first evaluated the model performance against three datasets with an emphasis on biomass and yield measured under different environmental conditions and growing seasons. We then applied the model to simulate optimal planting dates under future climate conditions for assessing climate adaptation strategies between two contrasting locations in South Korea: the current growing region (Gosan, Jeju) and an unfavorable cold winter region (Chuncheon, Gangwon). The model simulated the growth and development of a southern-type cultivar (Namdo, ND) reasonably well. Under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios, an overall delay in optimal planting date from a week to a month, and a slight increase in potential yield were expected in Gosan. Expansion of growing region to northern area including Chuncheon was expected due to mild winter temperatures in the future and may allow ND cultivar production in more regions. The predicted optimal planting date in the new region was similar to the current growing region that favors early fall planting. Our new integrative garlic model provides mechanistic, process-based crop responses to environmental cues and can be useful for assessing climate impacts and identifying crop specific climate adaptation strategies for the future.","[Yun, Kyungdahm; Kim, Soo-Hyung] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA USA; [Shin, Minji; Moon, Kyung Hwan] Rural Dev Adm, Res Inst Climate Change & Agr, Natl Inst Hort & Herbal Sci, Jeju, South Korea","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Institute of Horticultural & Herbal Science (NIHHS), Republic of Korea; Rural Development Administration (RDA), Republic of Korea","Kim, SH (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA USA.",soohkim@uw.edu,,,"Cooperative Research Program for Agricultural Science and Technology Development, Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea [PJ015124012022]","Cooperative Research Program for Agricultural Science and Technology Development, Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea","Funding The information, data, or work presented herein was funded in part by the Cooperative Research Program for Agricultural Science and Technology Development, Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea under grant no.

Drought has caused damage to the local social economy, agricultural production, and the ecological environment. However, the study of drought is more difficult due to the complex topography and the lack of monitoring information.

The results showed that (1) the average change rate of the precipitation in Xinjiang was 8.58 mm/10a, the average change rate of the ET0 was -14.84 mm/10a, and the average change rate of the AI was -1.94/10a; (2) the periods of precipitation, ET0, and AI in Xinjiang were 39, 29, and 14 years, respectively, and the abrupt changes occurred in 1986, 1971, and 1987, respectively; (3) The Moran index of precipitation and temperature are 0.41 and 0.33, respectively, indicating that precipitation and temperature in Xinjiang are positively correlated in spatial distribution and have spatial clustering characteristics; and the z-values are both greater than 2.58 (p < 0.01), indicating that the spatial autocorrelation of precipitation and temperature in Xinjiang is significant.

Moreover hailstorms are a major threat to e.g. agriculture and the automobile industry causing significant economical damages and losses. Despite these significant hail-related meteorological risks no comprehensive observation-based hail climatology for Germany exists. In this study we present a new approach to this task, combining radar data with different kinds of hail reports, such as ground observation and agricultural insurance data. Preprocessing ensures the applicability of the radar data for the presented climatological analysis. In this sense a number of detection methods are applied to filter artefacts, especially clutter pixels and spokes that disrupt radar measurements. To construct a reliable hail climatology for Germany we process all information into a 10-year based annual average number of hail days on a 1 km x 1 km grid using a two-path hail criterion. While the first path combines a threshold of 50 dBZ with a hail report, the second path is based on a 55 dBZ threshold only. By adding radar data we increase the spatial representativity of the ground based hail reports and gain additional information in regions which lack observational data. Overall, the results are mainly determined by events derived from the first path (68%). A validation of our dataset at 65 stations of Deutscher Wetterdienst shows that the method slightly underestimates the number of hail days, especially for mountainous regions. This results in a better adaption of the hail criterion to lowlands. The resulting hail frequency map shows an increase in the average number of hail days per year from north to south. In particular, hailstorms occur less frequently in the Central North German Plain and the Mecklenburg Coastal Lowland, whereas the highest number of hail days occurs mostly in the uplands of the Black Forest and the Swabian Jura, but also in the Rhenish Massif, the Alpine Foreland and the Lower Rhine Plain. Moreover, the Feldberg region in the Southern Black Forest shows the highest number of hail days per year.","[Junghaenel, Thomas; Brendel, Christoph; Winterrath, Tanja] Deutsch Wetterdienst, Dept Hydrometeorol, Frankfurter Str 135, D-63067 Offenbach, Germany; [Walter, Andreas] Deutsch Wetterdienst, Dept Climate & Environm Consultancy, Offenbach, Germany; [Junghaenel, Thomas; Brendel, Christoph] Goethe Univ, Inst Atmospher & Environm Sci, Frankfurt, Germany",Deutscher Wetterdienst; Deutscher Wetterdienst; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Junghanel, T (corresponding author), Deutsch Wetterdienst, Dept Hydrometeorol, Frankfurter Str 135, D-63067 Offenbach, Germany.",Thomas.Junghaenel@dwd.de,,"Junghanel, Thomas/0000-0002-3962-7148",,,,,64,12,12,0,9,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER, SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0941-2948,1610-1227,,METEOROL Z,Meteorol.

It is critical for tackling biodiversity loss, land degradation, climate change and the decline of ecosystem services. It underpins food production, livelihoods, dietary health, social equity, climate change adaptation, and many other outcomes. However, interdependencies, trade-offs, time lags, and non-linear responses make it difficult to predict the combined effects of land management decisions. Policy decisions also have to be made in the context of conflicting interests, values and power dynamics of those living on the land and those affected by the consequences of land use decisions. This makes designing and coordinating effective land management policies and programmes highly challenging. The difficulty is exacerbated by the scarcity of reliable data on the impacts of land management on the environment and livelihoods. This poses a challenge for policymakers and practitioners in governments, development banks, non-governmental organisations, and other institutions. It also sets demands for researchers, who are under ever increasing pressure from funders to demonstrate uptake and impact of their work. Relatively few research methods exist that can address such questions in a holistic way. Decision makers and researchers need to work together to help untangle, contextualise and interpret fragmented evidence through systems approaches to make decisions in spite of uncertainty. Individuals and institutions acting as knowledge brokers can support these interactions by facilitating the co-creation and use of scientific and other knowledge. Given the patchy nature of data and evidence, particularly in developing countries, it is important to draw on the full range of available models, tools and evidence. In this paper we review the use of evidence to inform multiple-objective integrated landscape management policies and programmes, focusing on how to simultaneously achieve different sustainable development objectives in diverse landscapes. We set out key success factors for evidence-based decision-making, which are summarised into 10 key principles for integrated landscape management knowledge brokering in integrated landscape management and 12 key skills for knowledge brokers. We finally propose a decision-support framework to organise evidence that can be used to tackle different types of land management policy decision.","[McGonigle, Daniel F.; Nodari, Giulia Rota] Alliance Biovers Int, Rome, Italy; [McGonigle, Daniel F.; Nodari, Giulia Rota] Int Ctr Trop Agr, Rome, Italy; [McGonigle, Daniel F.] Dept Environm Food & Rural Affairs, London, England; [Phillips, Robyn L.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge, England; [Aynekulu, Ermias; Shepherd, Keith] World Agroforestry ICRAF, Nairobi, Kenya; [Estrada-Carmona, Natalia; Jones, Sarah K.; Remans, Roseline] Alliance Biovers Int, Montpellier, France; [Estrada-Carmona, Natalia; Jones, Sarah K.; Remans, Roseline] Int Ctr Trop Agr, Montpellier, France; [Koziell, Izabella; Wiberg, David] Int Water Management Inst, CGIAR Res Programme Water Land & Ecosyst, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Luedeling, Eike; Whitney, Cory] Univ Bonn, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat INRES Hort Sci, Bonn, Germany; [Zhang, Wei] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Environm & Prod Technol Div, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University of Cambridge; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF); CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI); University of Bonn; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"McGonigle, DF (corresponding author), Alliance Biovers Int, Rome, Italy.;McGonigle, DF (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr, Rome, Italy.;McGonigle, DF (corresponding author), Dept Environm Food & Rural Affairs, London, England.",daniel.mcgonigle@defra.gov.uk,"Luedeling, Eike/I-3269-2019; Whitney, Cory/I-2379-2015; CARMONA, NATALIA ESTRADA/AAN-7794-2020; Aynekulu, Ermias/M-1825-2017","Luedeling, Eike/0000-0002-7316-3631; Whitney, Cory/0000-0003-4988-4583; CARMONA, NATALIA ESTRADA/0000-0003-4329-5470; Aynekulu, Ermias/0000-0002-1955-6995; Jones, Sarah/0000-0002-9422-5563","CGIAR Water, Land, and Ecosystems programme, flagship programme on Enhancing Sustainability Across Agricultural Systems; University of Cambridge Doctoral Training Partnership - UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","CGIAR Water, Land, and Ecosystems programme, flagship programme on Enhancing Sustainability Across Agricultural Systems(CGIAR); University of Cambridge Doctoral Training Partnership - UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC))","This work was funded by the CGIAR Water, Land, and Ecosystems programme, flagship programme on Enhancing Sustainability Across Agricultural Systems.

For this paper we modified a driver-response conceptual model of social-ecological interactions by considering the degree to which each binary set of processes (human or physical) is simultaneously a driver and a response to global change. Processes that we understood to be mutually conditioned offered greater potential compared to solely social or ecological communities to adapt to demographic and economic change, on the one hand, and to climate, water resources, and ecosystems dynamics, on the other. By considering case material from the United States-Mexico border region, we characterized social-ecological interactions along a continuum from those acting exclusively as drivers to others reacting to change primarily as responses. We considered water resources to integrate multiple global change processes including climate change and variability, ecosystem resilience, and human water demands for a variety of purposes. Thus, we examined in detail two watersheds in the Arizona-Sonora borderlands representing mutually conditioned social-ecological systems. First, the Rio Magdalena in Sonora represented an illustrative case of smallholder agriculture and rural livelihoods engaged in social-ecological interaction that exhibited both driver and response elements centered on reflexive, low-impact adaptive strategies. Second, in Ambos Nogales relying on the Santa Cruz River and its associated aquifers, urban growth, the equity of water access for human purposes, and environmental quality represented especially pressing challenges. Here, human impacts on ecosystems were the predominant drivers although there was growing concern for the medium-and longer-term implications of climate change. Adaption planning in Ambos Nogales was centered on infrastructure-based solutions including an inter-basin water transfer connection with the Rio Magdalena. Wastewater flows to riparian corridors posed a particular challenge for human-environment interactions. Cross-border collaboration represents an important opportunity for adaptation based on the mutually conditioned interactions presented here. We summarized the analysis of both cases by raising conceptual questions for further enquiry and for adaptation and planning that are generic for the borderlands and beyond.","[Scott, Christopher A.; Buechler, Stephanie J.] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Scott, Christopher A.] Univ Arizona, Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona; University of Arizona,"Scott, CA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",cascott@email.arizona.edu,,"Scott, Christopher A./0000-0002-6767-0450","National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1010495]; U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Aquifer Assessment Program; Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research [SGP-CRA 005]; NSF [GEO-1138881, EAR-1039127]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate-Society Interactions Program; Morris K. and Stewart L.

Although much research has focused on questions of food security, less has been devoted to assessing the wider health impacts of future changes in agricultural production. In this modelling study, we estimate excess mortality attributable to agriculturally mediated changes in dietary and weight-related risk factors by cause of death for 155 world regions in the year 2050. Methods For this modelling study, we linked a detailed agricultural modelling framework, the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT), to a comparative risk assessment of changes in fruit and vegetable consumption, red meat consumption, and bodyweight for deaths from coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, and an aggregate of other causes. We calculated the change in the number of deaths attributable to climate-related changes in weight and diets for the combination of four emissions pathways (a high emissions pathway, two medium emissions pathways, and a low emissions pathway) and three socioeconomic pathways (sustainable development, middle of the road, and more fragmented development), which each included six scenarios with variable climatic inputs. Findings The model projects that by 2050, climate change will lead to per-person reductions of 3.2% (SD 0.4%) in global food availability, 4.0% (0.7%) in fruit and vegetable consumption, and 0.7% (0.1%) in red meat consumption. These changes will be associated with 529 000 climate-related deaths worldwide (95% CI 314 000-736 000), representing a 28% (95% CI 26-33) reduction in the number of deaths that would be avoided because of changes in dietary and weight-related risk factors between 2010 and 2050. Twice as many climate-related deaths were associated with reductions in fruit and vegetable consumption than with climate-related increases in the prevalence of underweight, and most climate-related deaths were projected to occur in south and east Asia. Adoption of climate-stabilisation pathways would reduce the number of climate-related deaths by 29-71%, depending on their stringency. Interpretation The health effects of climate change from changes in dietary and weight-related risk factors could be substantial, and exceed other climate-related health impacts that have been estimated. Climate change mitigation could prevent many climate-related deaths. Strengthening of public health programmes aimed at preventing and treating diet and weight-related risk factors could be a suitable climate change adaptation strategy.","[Springmann, Marco; Rayner, Mike; Scarborough, Peter] Univ Oxford, Ctr Populat Approaches Noncommunicable Dis Preven, Oxford Martin Programme Future Food, British Heart Fdn,Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Old Rd Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, England; [Garnett, Tara] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Food Climate Res Network, Oxford, England; [Godfray, H.

It emerged that while some address agriculture and adaptation, others do not. Agriculture and climate adaptation must continue to be placed at the centre of the (I)NDCs.

Increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) via soil organic matter (SOM) improvement is widely regarded as a way to both mitigate and adapt to climate change. Using as a case study the Mediterranean coastal area in Spain, which is regarded as one of the most intensively managed areas in Europe for orchards and horticultural cropping, we analyzed the potential for climate change mitigation of introducing different practides that are expected to increase SOC. We selected both as a single measure and in cOmbination, cover cropping and application to the soil of the available underutilized exogenous organic matter (EOM), treated (e.g. composted or digested) or non-treated. These practices were compared against a baseline scenario that intended to reflect the current practices in the area (e.g. all livestock manure produced in the area is applied to the agricultural soil). We carried out a modelling exercise at the regional scale using the agricultural activity data and current climatic conditions as inputs. Modelling nins were performed coupling a widely used dynamic model of SOC turnover (RothC) with a model to simulate the GHG emissions from EOM processing or storage prior to soil application (SIMSWASTE). Results indicate that the most promising practice, considered as a single measure and with respect to the baseline, was introducing cover crops in woody cropping systems. This practice resulted in an increase of 0.44 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) during the first 20 years (range 0.41-0.52 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and led to a total SOC accumulation of about 30 Tg C after 100 years. Amendment of all agricultural land With available underutilized EOM resulted in an increase of up to 0.09 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (range 0.07-0.16 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) as a single measure (Urban waste) and 0.13 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (range 0.11-0.21 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) as a combined measure (urban waste and composted agroindustry by-products), leading to a total SOC accumulation of about 7 Tg C (urban waste) and 10 Tg C (urban waste and composted agroindustry by-products) after 100 years. Manure anaerobic digestion or composting as a single measure did not result in significant SOC changes but, if GHG emissions and savings from manure storage and processing management stages are considered, they could help to reduce about 4.3 (anaerobic digestion) or 1.1 Tg CO(2)eq yr(-1) (composting) in the study area, which represents a significant amount compared with total agricultural emissions in Spain.

This urban turn in environmental governance has been accompanied by normative claims and high expectations regarding a leading role of cities in coping with climate change. However, while time pressures for effective action are growing, little is known about the social learning processes involved in such urban climate governance innovations, and what they actually contribute to achieve the required transformations in urban systems. Therefore, this special issue presents eight selected papers that explore learning in urban climate governance practices in a variety of local, national and international contexts. Their findings point to a more ambiguous role of these practices as they tend to support incremental adjustments rather than deeper social learning for radical systemic change. Against this backdrop we propose a heuristic distinguishing basic modes and sources in governance learning that aims to facilitate future empirical research and comparison, thus filling a critical theory gap. Using this framework for interpretation illustrates that urban climate governance learning urgently requires more openness, parallel processes, exogenous sources, as well as novel meta-learning practices.","[Wolfram, Marc] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Architecture, Suwon, South Korea; [van der Heijden, Jeroen] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Govt, Wellington, New Zealand; [Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Patterson, James] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Victoria University Wellington; University of Helsinki; Utrecht University,"Wolfram, M (corresponding author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Architecture, Suwon, South Korea.",marcwolfram@gmail.com,"van der Heijden, Jeroen/AAG-7582-2020; Juhola, Sirkku/GVS-5485-2022","van der Heijden, Jeroen/0000-0001-6188-0556; Juhola, Sirkku/0000-0003-0095-2282; Wolfram, Marc/0000-0003-3070-0836",INOGOV organization,INOGOV organization,"On behalf of all participants at the INOGOV workshop we wish to thank Rob Imrie (Goldsmits, University of London), Kristine Kern (University of Potsdam), and Jonathan Davies (De Montfoort University) for their engagement during the workshop and for providing essential feedback to earlier versions of the papers included in this special section.

Reducing vulnerability is inherent to climate adaptation and the protection and realization of human rights. However, despite these linkages, vulnerability has been given scant attention in climate law literature. Through a more detailed understanding of vulnerability, we can identify a wider variety of cases that are relevant to why people are climate vulnerable and the potential for strategic interventions. Accordingly, using an interdisciplinary framework drawing upon political ecology, the article outlines two broad approaches to vulnerability: the hazards approach, based upon protecting people from the physical impacts of climate change; and the social vulnerability approach, which foregrounds the socio-political factors that underpin why particular groups of people are more vulnerable than others. India is then used as a case study to illustrate three types of litigation relevant from a vulnerability perspective: litigation on droughts, land conflicts and agrarian debt. These cases, though not traditionally defined as 'climate litigation', fundamentally concern issues of climate vulnerability, adaptation and rights. The cases demonstrate how different framings of climate vulnerability are embedded within the arguments and directions of the courts. Ultimately, the article argues that through a closer understanding of climate vulnerability, litigation can be a vehicle for adaptation by identifying and tackling the structural causes of vulnerability and rights issues.","[Ohdedar, Birsha] Univ Essex, Sch Law, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Ohdedar, Birsha] Univ Essex, Human Rights Ctr, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Ohdedar, Birsha] Univ London, SOAS, London, England",University of Essex; University of Sussex; University of Essex; University of Sussex; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Ohdedar, B (corresponding author), Univ Essex, Sch Law, Brighton, E Sussex, England.;Ohdedar, B (corresponding author), Univ Essex, Human Rights Ctr, Brighton, E Sussex, England.;Ohdedar, B (corresponding author), Univ London, SOAS, London, England.",bo6@soas.ac.uk,,,,,,,99,0,0,2,2,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",1759-7188,1759-7196,,J HUM RIGHTS ENVIRON,J.

In recent history, and especially during 1950s-1970s, extensive lakes and floodplains were reclaimed as polders for agriculture and rural development. Consequently, the flood retention capacity was decreased, many lakes were disconnected from the main channel of the Yangtze by embankments and sluice gates, and eutrophication was common. It is anticipated that there will be a greater frequency of extreme floods and droughts in the basin according to climate change scenarios. WWF commenced a programme in 2002 in partnership with government agencies and local communities to reconnect three lakes (Zhangdu, Hong and Tian-e-zhou) in Hubei Province to the river by opening sluice gates seasonally and improving lake management. The resilience of the lake environment to climate change and the livelihoods of local people were enhanced. The measures assessed here highlight: (a) the need for adaptation programmes to concurrently improve livelihoods and reduce exposure to physical risks; (b) the need to build the capacity of people and institutions; and (c) the value of decentralized adaptation as compared with new infrastructure investments.","[Yu, Xiubo; Jiang, Luguang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li, Lifeng] WWF Int, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland; [Wang, Jinxin] Xuzhou Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Environm Sci, Xuzhou 221116, Peoples R China; [Wang, Limin; Lei, Gang] WWF China Programme Off, Beijing 100006, Peoples R China; [Pittock, Jamie] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; World Wildlife Fund; Jiangsu Normal University; Australian National University","Jiang, LG (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, 11A Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",jianglg@igsnrr.nac.cn,"Pittock, Jamie/N-1541-2018; wang, jinxin/K-7826-2012; Wang, Jin-xin/B-4770-2009; Yu, Xiubo/A-5875-2016","Pittock, Jamie/0000-0001-6293-996X; YU, Xiubo/0000-0002-8266-2432",,,,,14,20,20,3,30,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

A review summarising the findings related to climate change impacts on water demand is carried out in this article. A water management strategy is also proposed, which would help with adaptation to growing pressure on water resources due to climate change and socio-economic development. The study reveals that climate change will increase global water demand, though this will vary widely with geographic location and climatic conditions. Water demand in agriculture will be affected more heavily than will demands in other sectors. As irrigation comprises the major portion of global consumptive water use, increased water demand in irrigation may cause severe stress on water resources. Studies suggest that water demand management or water supply management alone will not able to adapt to mounting water stress. A combination of both water supply and water demand management strategies is necessary in order to adapt to varying environmental and associated uncertainties. A case study from the Haihe River basin of China is presented, to illustrate the effectiveness of water demand management strategies used alongside water supply management in adapting to environmental changes. It is expected that the study will help guide policy responses, with the goal of mitigating the impacts of climate change on water resources.","[Wang, Xiao-jun; Zhang, Jian-yun; Wu, Yong-xiang; He, Rui-min] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiao-jun; Zhang, Jian-yun; Wu, Yong-xiang; He, Rui-min] Minist Water Resources, Res Ctr Climate Change, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiao-jun] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Shahid, Shamsuddin] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Guan, En-hong; Gao, Juan] Minist Water Resources, Dept Water Resources, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China",Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute; Beijing Normal University; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research; Ministry of Water Resources,"Wang, XJ (corresponding author), Minist Water Resources, Res Ctr Climate Change, 225 Guangzhou Rd, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",nhri501@yahoo.com.cn,"gao, juan/GXV-1381-2022; SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/B-5185-2010","SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/0000-0001-9621-6452","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51309155]; National Basic Research Program of China [2010CB951104, 2010CB951103]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2013 M530027]; Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund [Y513004]; Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Simulation and Regulation of Water Cycle in River Basin (China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research Project) [IWHR-SKL-201212]; Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change [ARCP2013-25NSY-Shahid]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund; Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Simulation and Regulation of Water Cycle in River Basin (China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research Project); Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change,"We are grateful to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51309155), the National Basic Research Program of China (No. 2010CB951104 and 2010CB951103), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2013 M530027), the Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund (No. Y513004), the Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Simulation and Regulation of Water Cycle in River Basin (China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research Project No. IWHR-SKL-201212) and the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change (Grant No. ARCP2013-25NSY-Shahid) for providing financial support for this research.

Climate change and land use in the not-too-distant future add to the complexity of this challenge. Therefore, it is essential to achieve reliable methods for predicting changes in aquifer storage to plan for the sustainable use of groundwater resources. This study aimed to investigate the management, protection, and sustainable use of groundwater resources under climate change and land use change conditions. In this regard, groundwater supply and demand in one of the important plains in Iran (Hashtgerd plain) for 2020 as the base year was simulated to forecast the trends until 2050 by considering climate change and land use to develop management scenarios to adapt to these conditions using the WEAP model. First, climate change prediction was performed using the HadGEM2-ES model under two emission scenarios, RCP2.6, and RCP8.5, of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. The LARS-WG model was used to downscale the climatic data, while land use mapping was performed using Landsat satellite images of 1990, 2005, and 2020 in ENVI 5.3 software. Then, the Markov chain method implemented in TerrSet software was used to model land use change for 2050. The effect of climate change and land use on the decrease of groundwater level was then simulated using the MODFLOW model for the period 2020-2050. In order to manage the water allocation in the area, the information obtained from MODFLOW was transferred to the WEAP model using Link Kitchen interface software. The effects of various management scenarios such as increasing irrigation efficiency, reducing the loss of drinking water distribution networks, and allocating water from the transmission line were evaluated on the adaptation to climate change and land use for a 30-year period. The results showed that with the simultaneous consideration of climate change and land use in the most critical state, the average drop in groundwater level would reach 58 m during the study period, and aquifer reserves will be reduced by more than 50%. The evaluation of management scenarios showed that their implementation not only will protect aquifer reserves but, in addition to meeting 100% of the water needs, will result in sustainable exploitation of groundwater resources.","[Hanifehlou, Abolfazl; Hosseini, Seyed Abbas; Sharafati, Ahmad] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Javadi, Saman] Univ Tehran, Coll Abouraihan, Dept Irrigat & Drainage Engn, Tehran, Iran",Islamic Azad University; University of Tehran,"Hosseini, SA (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran.",a_hanifehlou@yahoo.com; abbas_hoseyni@srbiau.ac.ir; javadis@ut.ac.ir; asharafati@gmail.com,,"Hosseini, Seyed Abbas/0000-0001-8858-3543; Sharafati, Ahmad/0000-0003-0448-2871; hanifehlou, abolfazl/0000-0001-7388-2241",,,,,48,2,2,2,4,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1895-6572,1895-7455,,ACTA GEOPHYS,Acta Geophys.,AUG,2022,70,4,,,,,1829,1846,,10.1007/s11600-022-00843-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11600-022-00843-2,,JUL 2022,18,Geochemistry & Geophysics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geochemistry & Geophysics,3B9BX,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000819695700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Farmers' grow upland crops like chickpea (Cicer arietinum), greengram (Vigna radiate), mustard (Brassica nigra), corn (Zea maize), pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), potato (Solanum tuberosum), sunflower (Helianthus annuus) etc. along with rice (Oryza sativa) during the dry season. However, knowledge of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from these rice based cropping systems is very limited. In the present study four rice based cropping systems was studied along with rice-rice rotation system as control in respect of GHG emission, yield potential and economic feasibility. Conventional plantation and fertilizer application methodology was followed for each crop. Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) flux from field plots were studied with conventional closed chamber method using gas chromatograph. CH4 flux was recorded highest from rice-rice rotation plots (304.25 kg ha(-1)). N2O flux was recorded 1.02 kg ha(-1) from rice-rice rotation system during wet season. However, during wet season, higher N2O flux (1.93 kg ha(-1)) was recorded from rice-potato-sesame rotation plots. Annual N2O flux was also recorded significantly low (3.42 kg ha(-1)) from rice-rice rotation plots and high (6.19 kg ha(-1)) from rice-chickpea-greengram rotation plots. Significantly lower annual grain yield was recorded from rice-rice rotation plots (9.25 Mg ha(-1)) whereas it was 18.84 Mg rice eq ha(-1) from rice-potato-sesame rotation system. The global warming potential (GWP) of rice-rice rotation system was recorded significantly high (8.62 Mg CO2 ha(-1)) compare to plots with different rice based cropping systems. Computing all C-emission from cradle-to-grave, highest total C-cost was recorded from the rice-rice rotation system ($62.00 ha(-1)). We have made an attempt to calculate the C-credit of different rice based cropping systems by considering the difference of C-cost with control. The study suggests that the rice-potato-sesame is most sustainable among different cropping system studied in terms of economic profit ($1248.21 ha(-1)) and C-credit ($38.60 ha(-1)).

J,"Thissen, P",,,,"Thissen, Paul",,,"ESTATE LANDSCAPES IN GELDERLAND. GOVERNMENT INTERVENTIONS, PAST AND PRESENT",BULLETIN KNOB,,,Dutch,Article,,,,,,,,"The Province of Gelderland has long boasted a large number of country houses and landed estates, which over time coalesced into estate landscapes around the historical capitals of the Duchy of Guelders quarters of Nijmegen, Arnhem and Zutphen. Rapidly increasing urbanization from the end of the nineteenth century onwards threatened the coherence and accessibility of these landscapes. Gelderland's largest cities, Arnhem and Nijmegen, watched in dismay as many country houses and landed estates fell victim to subdivision and development. In response they started to buy up portions of that estate landscape to ensure that they would remain available to city dwellers. In addition, the `safety net' provided by newly established nature and landscape organizations, in particular Natuurmonumenten and Geldersch Landschap & Kas-teelen, also contributed to preservation and permanent accessibility by offering landed families the opportunity to keep their estate intact, albeit no longer under their ownership. Similar motives - the need to preserve attractive, accessible walking areas for the increasingly urbanized society - underpinned the government's introduction of the Nature Conservation Act in 1928. The Act was invoked more frequently in Gelderland than in any other province. It promoted the opening up of private properties as well as the preservation of the cultural value of the kind of 'natural beauty' to be found on landed estates. After the Second World War, in addition to resorting to the Nature Conservation Act, the owners of country houses and landed estates could avail themselves of an increasing variety of grants aimed at preserving (publicly accessible) nature, landscape and heritage, although the emphasis was firmly on nature. Estate landscapes like the Veluwezoom and the County of Zutphen were eventually safeguarded by a patchwork of different government regulations. In the twenty-first century, government policy shifted towards providing financial support for both public and private contributions to nature, landscape and heritage by country houses and landed estates. This in turn has stimulated interest in estate landscapes. Instead of individual heritage-listed estates, the focus is now on areas with multiple country house and landed estates where there are spatial tasks waiting to be fulfilled: not just the preservation of natural beauty for outdoor recreation, but also spatial articulation, climate change adaptation, increased biodiversity and sustainable agriculture. Interest in design, both past and present, has burgeoned thanks to this development.",,,,,,,,,,,33,0,0,1,2,KONINKLIJKE NEDERLANDSE OUDHEIDKUNDIGE BOND-KNOB,DEFT,"POSTBUS 5043, DEFT, 2600 GA, NETHERLANDS",0166-0470,2589-3343,,BULL KNOB,Bull.

However, production also faces multiple challenges due to more frequent and intense extreme weather phenomena, and uncertain future prices of agricultural inputs and outputs. Extensive studies have been conducted to investigate the impacts of climate change on cereals yield change, but integrated assessments that also consider the management and economy of cereal farms have been rare so far. In this study, the effects of climate change-driven crop productivity change on farm level land use dynamics, input use, production management and farm income were considered from the point of view of dynamic decision making of a rational risk averse farmer. We assessed whether a farmer can gain from improved crop yields when using adapted cultivars and managing the farm accordingly. We incorporated crop yield estimates from a process-based large area crop model (MCWLA) run with two climate scenarios into a dynamic economic model of farm management and crop rotation (DEMCROP) to investigate future input use, land use with crop rotation, economic gross margins and greenhouse gas emissions. A time span of 30 years was considered. The model accounts for the yield responses to fertilisation, crop protection, liming of field parcels, and yield losses due to monoculture. The approach resulted in a novel and necessary analysis of farm management, production and income implications of climate change adaptation under different climate and socio-economic scenarios. We analysed the effects of different climate and price scenarios at a typical cereal farm in the North Savo region, which is currently a marginal area for crop production in Finland due to its harsh climate. Crop modelling results suggest a 19-27% increase of spring cereal yields and 11-19% increase of winter wheat yields from the current level until 2042-2070. According to our economic farm level simulations, these yield increases would incentivise farmers towards more intense input use resulting in additional increase of yields by 3-8% at current prices. More land is allocated to barley and wheat, less to set-aside and oat. The economic gross margin would increase significantly from the current low levels.

Forest managers are therefore investigating strategies to increase forest resistance and resilience, especially by promoting uneven-aged and mixed forests through group selection, and by reducing stand stocking and large trees proportion. However, there is little information on the long-term impacts of these two practices. The objectives of this study were (1) to develop an original silviculture algorithm designed for uneven-aged management and (2) to use it to assess the effects of the above-mentioned management methods in long-term simulations. We simulated individual and group selection techniques in order to study the effects of group size, harvesting intensity and their interactions on wood production, stand heterogeneity, and regeneration in mountain spruce-fir forests. We used the spatially explicit individual-based forest model Samsara2 to simulate forest dynamics. Our simulation results confirmed the positive effect of group selection practices on structure diversity and regeneration but not on spruce maintenance. Increasing harvesting intensity enabled forest destocking but decreased structure diversity and led to non-sustained yields for the most intensive scenarios. As adaptation measure, we thus recommend moderate group selection harvesting creating 500 m(2) gaps.","[Lafond, Valentine; Lagarrigues, Guillaume; Cordonnier, Thomas; Courbaud, Benoit] Irstea EMGR, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France",INRAE,"Lafond, V (corresponding author), Irstea EMGR, 2 Rue Papeterie,BP 76, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France.",valentine.lafond@irstea.fr,"Cordonnier, Thomas/I-2586-2019","Cordonnier, Thomas/0000-0003-3684-4662; Lafond, Valentine/0000-0002-1160-7129; Lagarrigues, Guillaume/0000-0002-6551-9175","GeForHet project from the French research program Biodiversity, Forest Management and Public Policy (BGF) [E23/2010]; European Research project Advanced multifunctional forest management in European mountain ranges (ARANGE) [289437]","GeForHet project from the French research program Biodiversity, Forest Management and Public Policy (BGF); European Research project Advanced multifunctional forest management in European mountain ranges (ARANGE)","This work was financially supported by both the GeForHet project (no E23/2010), from the French research program Biodiversity, Forest Management and Public Policy (BGF), and by the European Research project Advanced multifunctional forest management in European mountain ranges (ARANGE, no 289437).",,41,53,53,4,83,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

Wildfire (influenced by weather), consecutive high temperature summer days, and other extreme events are projected to become more severe and frequent with climate change. These may create challenging conditions for managing air quality despite policy targets to reduce precursor and pollutant emissions. Although extreme events are becoming more intense and interest in climate adaptation is increasing among public health practitioners, little attention in scholarly literature and policy covers climate adaptation for air quality governance. Understanding the management and managers' perspectives at the local level provides insight about the needs for climate adaptation, including their adaptation status, perspectives, responsibilities, and roles. This study explores local manager perspectives and experiences of managing air quality within a changing climate as one puzzle piece to understand the gap in climate adaptation within the air quality sector. A broader goal is to contribute to the discussion of developing a multi-jurisdictional vision for reducing the impacts of air quality in a changing climate. In 2016 local air quality district managers in California were invited to participate in an online survey of 39 questions focused on extreme event impacts on air quality. The questionnaire focused on present air quality threats and extreme event challenges, adaptation status and strategies, adaptive capacities, perceived barriers to adaptation, and jurisdictional responsibilities and roles. Over 85 percent of the 35 local air districts in California participated in the survey, which represents 80 percent of the state's population. High awareness and knowledge of climate change among local managers indicates they are ready to adopt and take action on policies that would support climate adaptation, but barriers reported suggests they may need policies and adequate funding to take action and make necessary changes.Implications: Downscaled global climate models project an increasing severity and frequency of extreme events. In the southwestern United States, these include wildfire, heat events, and dry periods, among others, all of which can place an extra burden on air quality managers and emitters to achieve air quality standards even as they reduce emissions. Despite climate change presenting increasing challenges to meet air quality standards, in the southwestern United States, policy and action to mitigate these impacts have been surprisingly absent. California presents a valuable case study on the topic because of its historic leadership in air quality management for the United States and also because of its initiatives in combating climate change. Yet still we found that adaptation has not been incorporated into air quality management thus far, but local managers seem sufficiently knowledgeable and willing.","[Ekstrom, Julia A.; Bedsworth, Louise] Univ Calif Davis, Policy Inst Energy Environm & Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Bedsworth, Louise] State Calif, Governors Off Planning & Res, Sacramento, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Ekstrom, JA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Policy Inst Energy Environm & Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jaekstrom@gmail.com,,"Ekstrom, Julia/0000-0003-1060-5276",U.S. EPA grant [RD835194010],U.S. EPA grant(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"Financial support for this research was provided by U.S. EPA grant RD835194010.

We forecast global fisheries biomass, catch, and profits to 2100 under three climate scenarios (RCPs 4.5, 6.0, 8.5) and five levels of management reform to (1) determine the impact of climate change on national fisheries and (2) quantify the national-scale benefits of implementing climate-adaptive fisheries reforms. Management reforms accounting for shifting productivity and shifting distributions would yield higher catch and profits in the future relative to today for 60-65% of countries under the two least severe climate scenarios but for only 35% of countries under the most severe scenario. Furthermore, these management reforms would yield higher cumulative catch and profits than business-asusual management for nearly all countries under the two least severe climate scenarios but would yield lower cumulative catch for 40% of countries under the most severe scenario. Fortunately, perfect fisheries management is not necessary to achieve these benefits: transboundary cooperation with 5-year intervals between adaptive interventions would result in comparable outcomes. However, the ability for realistic management reforms to offset the negative impacts of climate change is bounded by changes in underlying biological productivity. Although realistic reforms could generate higher catch and profits for 23-50% of countries experiencing reductions in productivity, the remaining countries would need to develop, expand, and reform aquaculture and other food production sectors to offset losses in capture fisheries. Still, climate-adaptive management is more profitable than business-as-usual management in all countries and we provide guidance on implementing-and achieving the benefits of-climate-adaptive fisheries reform along a gradient of scientific, management, and enforcement capacities.","[Free, Christopher M.; Mangin, Tracey; Costello, Christopher; Gaines, Steven D.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Molinos, Jorge Garcia] Hokkaido Univ, Arctic Res Ctr, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Molinos, Jorge Garcia] Hokkaido Univ, Global Inst Collaborat Res & Educ, Global Stn Arctic Res, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Molinos, Jorge Garcia] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Ojea, Elena] Univ Vigo, Future Oceans Lab, CIM UVigo, Vigo, Spain; [Burden, Merrick] Environm Def Fund, New York, NY USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Hokkaido University; Hokkaido University; Hokkaido University; Universidade de Vigo; Environmental Defense Fund,"Free, CM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",cfree14@gmail.com,"Free, Christopher Michael/AAC-5103-2019; ojea, elena/D-3709-2018; Garcia Molinos, Jorge/C-9252-2015","Free, Christopher Michael/0000-0002-2557-8920; ojea, elena/0000-0003-4991-8077; Garcia Molinos, Jorge/0000-0001-7516-1835","Environmental Defense Fund; Tenure-Track System Promotion Program of the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT); European Research Council project CLOCK [679812]; GAINXunta de Galicia Oportunius program","Environmental Defense Fund; Tenure-Track System Promotion Program of the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT); European Research Council project CLOCK; GAINXunta de Galicia Oportunius program","This work was funded by the Environmental Defense Fund.

As a result, a number of coastal adaptation plans, strategies and guidelines and have been developed for coastal urban communities around the Australian coastline over the last decade. Given that a number of plans have been developed for different communities facing the same issues, it is timely to compare and contrast these plans. To this end a set of these coastal adaptation plans developed for Australian communities were compared in order to consider the variability in the recommended adaptation responses and general consistency of the plans. The adaptation responses proposed in the plans were also assessed for their ability to be implemented. Despite the similarity in the cities and towns considered in the analysis and the commonality of risk arising from sea level rise, no consistent set of adaptation recommendations arose that was common across the communities. This lack of consistency suggests a lack of understanding of the effectiveness and implement-ability of many of the proposed adaptation responses. This lack of consistency is explored here and it appears that many, if not most of the plans considered contained adaptation recommendations which will be difficult to implement.","[Gibbs, Mark T.] Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Future Environm, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Gibbs, MT (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Future Environm, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",Mt.Gibbs@qut.edu.au,,"Gibbs, Mark/0000-0002-9632-1567",,,,,41,11,11,1,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,MAY 1,2019,173,,,,,,131,138,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.03.006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.03.006,,,8,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Oceanography; Water Resources,HU1UJ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000465057000013,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article seeks to: (1) identify southern African farmers' perceptions of rainfall, rainfall variations, and changes; (2) examine the nature of meteorological evidence for the perceived rainfall variability and change; (3) document farmers' responses to rainfall variability; and (4) discuss why discrepancies may occur between farmers' perceptions and meteorological observations of rainfall. Semi-structured interviews were used to identify farmers' perceptions of rainfall changes in Botswana and Malawi. Resulting perceptions were examined in conjunction with meteorological data to assess perceived and actual rainfall with regards to: what was changing (onset, duration or cessation), and how it was changing (amount, frequency, intensity or inter-annual variability). Most farmers perceived that the rains used to start earlier and end later. Meteorological data provided no evidence to support farmer perceptions of rainfall starting as early as September (south Malawi) or October (Botswana); however, a high inter-annual variability in the timing of the onset was observed alongside an increasing number of dry days and declining amounts of rainfall at the onset and cessation of precipitation. While some rainfall patterns are associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) fluctuations and larger-scale changes, one explanation for the differences between farmer perceptions and meteorological evidence is that rainfall changes can be easily confused with changes in farming system sensitivity. Our findings suggest that scientists, policymakers, and developers of climate adaptation projects need to be more in tune with farmers' and extension workers' understandings of how weather is changing in order to improve adaptation policy formulation and implementation.","[Simelton, Elisabeth; Quinn, Claire H.; Dougill, Andrew J.; Dyer, Jen C.; Fraser, Evan D.

Drawing on data collected through surveys, interviews and focus group discussions, this article first documents some of this knowledge and its role in supporting agricultural production. However, this research also uncovered that contemporary climate change is occurring at rates faster than that knowledge base can meaningfully adjust and adapt. Agricultural productivity was found to be greatly reduced, with men seeking off-farm employment to supplement the loss in income. Agrochemical use has soared and resulted in declines in the health of the local population. Village gender dynamics have also shifted and women have taken on the extra burden of farming. This paper posits that if indigenous knowledge was better integrated into adaptation planning and policies, its conservation and application would enhance resiliency to climate change in indigenous communities and beyond. Simultaneously, it also adds that as the nature, speed and severity of climate change in many marginal areas occur at rates faster than indigenous knowledge can adapt, blended forms of knowledge may offer practical solutions.","[Hoa, H.

This can be accomplished by introducing new non-destructive measuring techniques which allow quantifying growth processes of the same plants over a longer period of time (phenotyping). The use of a high-precision laser scanner coupled with a moveable articulated measuring arm to directly obtain 3D data non-invasively at sub-millimetre scale is investigated. This enabled reconstruction of the single barley organs leaf and stem as well as the architecture of the whole barley plant on the decimetre scale. The added data analysing process enabled multiple morphological plant parameters to be simultaneously derived from one scanning process which were highly correlated (R-2 0.85-0.97) to manually obtained parameters from reference measurements. By scanning every 2-3 days organ-specific growth monitoring of single leaves (area) and single stems (height) was established for the first time for cereals. The cumulated parameters of leaf area, stem height and plant volume allowed the growth dynamics of the barley to be quantified until tillering was ended. As an example, drought effect due to reduced irrigation was shown with smallest significant differences and dated precisely. The fineness of the laser scanning measurement system indicated its appropriateness for high-precision phenotyping in plant breeding as well as for detailed morphological measuring questions in the fields of biology and agronomy.

Research has shown that participants in these recreation activities are adapting to climatically changed conditions and are likely to continue to adapt in the future. This study explores these issues as they apply to snowmobiling in Vermont, identifying a suite of climate change manifestations, investigating their salience to the snowmobiler recreation experience, and assessing how these manifestations may impact the snowmobile participation rate and quality of experience. Climate change manifestations are informed by climate change models, helping to define the future conditions and supply of snowmobiling opportunities. Social science research on how snowmobilers may adapt to these changing conditions helps define the future demand for snowmobiling. We conducted an online survey of snowmobilers in Vermont, asking respondents if and how they would change the amount of snowmobiling they do in response to climate change manifestations that may impact snowmobiling conditions. Study findings suggest that the amount of snowmobiling in Vermont is already declining and that these declines are likely to become more substantial. For example, 44.7% of respondents have noticed declines in the length of the winter season during which there is enough snow to snowmobile, and 30.7% of respondents have decreased their amount of snowmobiling in response. Moreover, study data define the future relationship between climate-related changes in snowmobiling conditions and changes in amount of snowmobiling. For example, with 150 days of adequate snow cover, the amount of snowmobiling will increase 36.9%, but with 25 days of adequate snow cover, the amount of snowmobiling will decrease 44%. The length of season threshold for participation in snowmobiling is estimated at 79 days; more than 79 days will cause snowmobiling to increase from current levels, and fewer than 79 days will cause a decrease. Given the climate change sensitivity of snowmobiling found in this study, along with the predictions of climate models for Vermont, snowmobiling may ultimately be unsustainable. This will decrease the benefits of snowmobiling, including the enjoyment of locals and tourists who participate in the sport, the economic contributions, and the culture of the state. Substitution of other winter season recreation activities is a potential adaptation to declining opportunities for snowmobiling.","[Perry, Elizabeth; Manning, Robert; Xiao, Xiao] Univ Vermont, Pk Studies Lab, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Perry, Elizabeth] Univ Vermont, Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Valliere, William] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Reigner, Nathan] Resource Syst Grp Inc, Hartford, CT USA",University of Vermont; University of Vermont; University of Vermont,"Manning, R (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Pk Studies Lab, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",Robert.Manning@uvm.edu,"Xiao, Xiao/Z-1199-2019","Perry, Elizabeth/0000-0002-7992-6345",,,,,33,13,13,1,10,SAGAMORE PUBL LLC,URBANA,"1807 N FEDERAL DR, URBANA, IL 61801 USA",0735-1968,2160-6862,,J PARK RECREAT ADM,J.

The capacity of global ecosystems to provide services such as sequestering carbon and regulating hydrology is being strongly reduced both by climate change itself and by unprecedented rates of ecosystem degradation. These services rely on functional aspects of ecosystems that are causally linked-the same ecosystem components that efficiently sequester and store carbon also regulate hydrology by sequestering and storing water. This means that climate change adaptation and mitigation must involve not only preparing for a future with temperature and precipitation anomalies, but also actively minimizing climate hazards and risks by conserving and managing ecosystems and their fundamental supporting and regulating ecosystem services. We summarize general climate-nature feedback processes relating to carbon and water cycling on a broad global scale before focusing on Norway to exemplify the crucial role of ecosystem regulatory services for both carbon sequestration and hydrological processes and the common neglect of this ecosystem-climate link in policy and landscape management. We argue that a key instrument for both climate change mitigation and adaptation policy is to take advantage of the climate buffering and regulative abilities of a well-functioning natural ecosystem. This will enable shared benefits to nature, climate, and human well-being. To meet the global climate and nature crises, we must capitalize on the importance of nature for buffering climate change effects, combat short-term perspectives and the discounting of future costs, and maintain or even strengthen whole-ecosystem functioning at the landscape level. Significance StatementNatural ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and heaths are key for the cycling and storage of water and carbon. Preserving these systems is essential for climate mitigation and adaptation and will also secure biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Systematic failure to recognize the links between nature and human well-being underlies the current trend of accelerating loss of nature and thereby nature's ability to buffer climate changes and their impacts. Society needs a new perspective on spatial planning that values nature as a sink and store of carbon and a regulator of hydrological processes, as well as for its biodiversity. We need policies that fully encompass the role of nature in preventing climate-induced disasters, along with many other benefits for human well-being.","[Hessen, Dag O.] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, Oslo, Norway; [Hessen, Dag O.] Univ Oslo, Ctr Biogeochem Anthropocene, Oslo, Norway; [Vandvik, Vigdis] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol Sci, Bergen, Norway; [Vandvik, Vigdis] Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway",University of Oslo; University of Oslo; University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; University of Bergen,"Hessen, DO (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, Oslo, Norway.;Hessen, DO (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Ctr Biogeochem Anthropocene, Oslo, Norway.",d.o.hessen@mn.uio.no,"Hessen, Dag Olav/AFI-5448-2022","Hessen, Dag Olav/0000-0002-0154-7847",,,,,78,1,1,5,12,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693, UNITED STATES",1948-8327,1948-8335,,WEATHER CLIM SOC,Weather Clim.

Usually the best data available for constructing such models comes from intensive, detailed field studies. Models, thus implicitly developed at the fine spatial resolution of experimental studies, are then scaled-up to coarser resolution for management decision-making. Typically, this process of scaling-up involves merely adapting the models computer code for data input so that it will accept the large scale spatial averages (often derived from relatively remote (e.g. aerial) sensing) that form the basis for management planning. Unfortunately, such scaling-up can inadvertently affect model predictions and dynamical behavior. Improper incorporation of data collected at multiple resolutions during model development and use, and misinterpretation of model output can result. The consequences of scaling-up a linear, second-order, autoregressive. time series model of spruce budworm population dynamics on the model's predictions and on the interpretation of the model's output are considered. Such time series models have been proposed as templates for incorporating outbreak dynamics in the decision systems supporting forest insect management that tire currently being adapted to climatic change problems. Analysis of the underlying deterministic component of the time series model showed that: (1) parameter estimates changed with the spatial resolution-parameter values estimated from time series data consisting of large area averages were negatively correlated (r = -0.931, P<0.0005) and as much as 40 or 50 times greater in absolute value than the parameters generating the fine resolution data from sampling sites 1600 times smaller in extent. (2) Even the qualitative nature of the dynamics appeared to change in response to scaling-up. The long cycle, converging oscillations generated at fine resolutions gave way to five additional types of qualitative behavior at coarser resolutions including various types of divergent behavior and non-oscillating behavior. (3) The amount of distortion involved in scaling-up depends on the model's degree of non-linearity and on the fine scale spatial variation in population densities. An approach to correcting for such distortion is outlined. The potential consequences of scaling-up deserve consideration whenever data measured at different spatial resolutions are integrated during model development. as often happens in climate change research.

The unbalance between the availability of water resources and demand is currently exacerbated and could become worse in the near future in accordance with climate change observations and scenarios provided by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In this context, Increasing Maximum Capacity of the surface reservoir (IMC) and Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) are adaptation measures that have the potential to enhance water supply systems resiliency. In this paper, a multiple-users and multiple-resources-Water Supply System (WSS) model is implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of these two adaptation strategies in a context of overexploited groundwater under the RCP 4.5 and the RCP 8.5 IPCC scenarios. The presented a case study that is located in the Puglia, a semi-arid region of South Italy characterized by a conspicuous water demand for irrigation. We observed that, although no significant long-term trend affects the proposed precipitation scenarios, the expected temperature increase highly impacts the WSS resources due to the associated increase of water demand for irrigation purposes. Under the RCP 4.5 the MAR scenario results are more effective than the IMC during long term wet periods (typically 5 years) and successfully compensates the impact on the groundwater resources. Differently, under RCP 8.5, due to more persistent dry periods, both adaptation scenarios fail and groundwater resource become exposed to massive sea water intrusion during the second half of the century. We conclude that the MAR scenario is a suitable adaptation strategy to face the expected future changes in climate, although mitigation actions to reduce green-house gases are strongly required.","[Guyennon, Nicolas; Romano, Emanuele] CNR, Water Res Inst, I-00015 Rome, Italy; [Salerno, Franco] CNR, Water Res Inst, Branch Brugherio, I-20861 Brugherio, Italy; [Portoghese, Ivan] CNR, Water Res Inst, Branch Bari, I-70132 Bari, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Ricerca sulle Acque (IRSA-CNR); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Ricerca sulle Acque (IRSA-CNR); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Ricerca sulle Acque (IRSA-CNR),"Guyennon, N (corresponding author), CNR, Water Res Inst, I-00015 Rome, Italy.",guyennon@irsa.cnr.it; salerno.franco73@gmail.com; ivan.portoghese@ba.irsa.cnr.it; romano@irsa.cnr.it,"salerno, franco/ABD-3319-2020; Portoghese, Ivan/AAX-5419-2020; Guyennon, Nicolas/AAI-2216-2021; Romano, Emanuele/I-9378-2019","Portoghese, Ivan/0000-0001-6425-4411; Guyennon, Nicolas/0000-0002-0306-0610; Romano, Emanuele/0000-0003-4846-2389; salerno, franco/0000-0002-3419-6780",,,,,40,27,27,1,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2017,9,9,,,,,,,689,10.3390/w9090689,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9090689,,,18,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,FH9WM,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000411567200062,View Full Record in Web of Science

Even with a step up in mitigation, the goal of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees C remains challenging. Consequences of missing these goals are substantial, especially on regional scales. Because progress in the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions has been slow, climate engineering schemes are increasingly being discussed. But global schemes remain controversial and have important shortcomings. A reduction of global mean temperature through global-scale management of solar radiation could lead to strong regional disparities and affect rainfall patterns. On the other hand, active management of land radiative effects on a regional scale represents an alternative option of climate engineering that has been little discussed. Regional land radiative management could help to counteract warming, in particular hot extremes in densely populated and important agricultural regions. Regional land radiative management also raises some ethical issues, and its efficacy would be limited in time and space, depending on crop growing periods and constraints on agricultural management. But through its more regional focus and reliance on tested techniques, regional land radiative management avoids some of the main shortcomings associated with global radiation management. We argue that albedo-related climate benefits of land management should be considered more prominently when assessing regional-scale climate adaptation and mitigation as well as ecosystem services.","[Seneviratne, Sonia I.; Hirsch, Annette L.; Davin, Edouard L.; Hirschi, Martin; Wilhelm, Micah] ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Phipps, Steven J.; Donat, Markus G.] Univ New South Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Phipps, Steven J.; Pitman, Andrew J.; Donat, Markus G.] Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Phipps, Steven J.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Pitman, Andrew J.] Univ New South Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Lenton, Andrew] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Battery Point, Tas, Australia; [Kravitz, Ben] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Tasmania; University of New South Wales Sydney; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,"Seneviratne, SI (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.",sonia.seneviratne@ethz.ch,"Phipps, Steven J/B-3135-2008; Kravitz, Ben/P-7925-2014; Donat, Markus/J-8331-2012; Seneviratne, Sonia I./G-8761-2011; Davin, Edouard L./L-7033-2016; Lenton, Andrew/D-2077-2012; Pitman, Andrew J/A-7353-2011; Hirschi, Martin/ABF-1564-2020; Hirsch, Annette/B-6892-2011","Phipps, Steven J/0000-0001-5657-8782; Kravitz, Ben/0000-0001-6318-1150; Donat, Markus/0000-0002-0608-7288; Seneviratne, Sonia I./0000-0001-9528-2917; Davin, Edouard L./0000-0003-3322-9330; Lenton, Andrew/0000-0001-9437-8896; Pitman, Andrew J/0000-0003-0604-3274; Hirschi, Martin/0000-0001-9154-756X; Hirsch, Annette/0000-0002-5811-2465",European Community's Seventh Framework Programme [FP7-IDEAS-ERC-617518]; Australian Research Council's Special Research Initiative for the Antarctic Gateway Partnership [SR140300001],European Community's Seventh Framework Programme(European Commission); Australian Research Council's Special Research Initiative for the Antarctic Gateway Partnership(Australian Research Council),The study was initiated during a sabbatical by S.I.S at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science and developed in the context of the European Research Council (ERC) 'DROUGHT-HEAT' project funded by the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (grant agreement FP7-IDEAS-ERC-617518).

As a result, environmental sustainability and human development along with vector-borne disease (VBD) control historically have been especially challenging in Africa, particularly in the sub-Saharan and Sahelian drylands. Here, the VBD burden, food insecurity, environmental degradation, and social vulnerability are particularly severe. Changing climate can exacerbate the legion of environmental health threats in Africa, the social dimensions of which are now part of the international development agenda. Accordingly, the need to better understand the dynamics and complex coupling of populations and environments as exemplified by drylands is increasingly recognized as critical to the design of more sustainable interventions.Main bodyThis scoping review examines the challenge of vector-borne disease control in drylands with a focus on Africa, and the dramatic, ongoing environmental and social changes taking place. Dryland societies persisted and even flourished in the past despite changing climates, extreme and unpredictable weather, and marginal conditions for agriculture. Yet intrusive forces largely out of the control of traditional dryland societies, along with the negative impacts of globalization, have contributed to the erosion of dryland's cultural and natural resources. This has led to the loss of resilience underlying the adaptive capacity formerly widely exhibited among dryland societies. A growing body of evidence from studies of environmental and natural resource management demonstrates how, in light of dryland system's inherent complexity, these factors and top-down interventions can impede sustainable development and vector-borne disease control. Strengthening adaptive capacity through community-based, participatory methods that build on local knowledge and are tailored to local ecological conditions, hold the best promise of reversing current trends.ConclusionsA significant opportunity exists to simultaneously address the increasing threat of vector-borne diseases and climate change through methods aimed at strengthening adaptive capacity. The integrative framework and methods based on social-ecological systems and resilience theory offers a novel set of tools that allow multiple threats and sources of vulnerability to be addressed in combination. Integration of recent advances in vector borne disease ecology and wider deployment of these tools could help reverse the negative social and environmental trends currently seen in African drylands.","[Wilcox, Bruce A.; Echaubard, Pierre] Mahidol Univ, ASEAN Inst Hlth Dev, 999 Salaya Phuttamonthon, Nakon Pathom 73170, Thailand; [de Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel] Univ Montpellier, INRA, CIRA, ASTRE, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [de Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Vet Sci, Bangkok, Thailand; [Ramirez, Bernadette] WHO, Special Programme Res & Training Trop Dis, Geneva, Switzerland",Mahidol University; INRAE; Universite de Montpellier; Kasetsart University; World Health Organization,"Wilcox, BA; Echaubard, P (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ, ASEAN Inst Hlth Dev, 999 Salaya Phuttamonthon, Nakon Pathom 73170, Thailand.",wilcox.bru@mahidol.ac.th; perre.echaubard@globalhealtbasia.org,"Echaubard, Pierre/H-3500-2019; de Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel/AAI-1550-2019","Echaubard, Pierre/0000-0001-6213-1346; de Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel/0000-0002-5438-1473","World Health Organization, acting through the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases","World Health Organization, acting through the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases","This work was supported by the World Health Organization, acting through the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases.",,103,11,13,3,40,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2095-5162,2049-9957,,INFECT DIS POVERTY,Infect.

One such pro-adaptation strategy is the farmer field school (FFS) which is currently being used to promote climate-smart agricultural practices among Jamaican farmers through a number of social learning and capacity building initiatives. A hallmark of the field school methodology is its promotion of adaptation by empowering farmers to plan for and cope with the effects of climate change by improving knowledge, awareness and adoption of best practices, while providing a viable income stream to participants. Though the FFS program has been touted as a huge success, with several community groups sustaining their income diversification and adaptation efforts even after the formal project has ended, the extent of participation in these field schools has however been uneven and limited in numbers. Amidst claims of the program's achievements to date, and plans to replicate and upscale the field school methodology in Jamaica as a climate adaptation strategy, a comparative assessment of the role participation plays in shaping local farmers' cognitive and behavioural responses towards climate change is very timely. The case study reported in this paper is informed by a comparative mixed methods approach, undertaken in three communities in northern Clarendon, Jamaica. The study assesses the particular ways that participation in the farmer field school program has influenced the knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of FFS trainees about climate change compared to their non-FFS counterparts. Preliminary results indicate that FFS participants perceive themselves as having a higher adaptive capacity in comparison to non-field school participants, amidst both groups having access to similar stocks of assets. Ultimately, our results highlight that cognitive factors (e.g. perceptions of adaptive capacity) and involvement in social networks may be as important as the more commonly researched asset-based indicators in shaping individual adaptive behaviour.","[Tomlinson, Jhannel] Univ West Indies, Dept Geog & Geol, Kingston, Jamaica; [Rhiney, Kevon] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Geog, 54 Joyce Kilmer Ave, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA",University West Indies Mona Jamaica; Rutgers State University New Brunswick,"Rhiney, K (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Geog, 54 Joyce Kilmer Ave, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",jhannel.tomlinson@mymona.uwi.edu; kevon.rhiney@rutgers.edu.jm,,"Tomlinson, Jhannel/0000-0001-9874-8831",,,,,88,13,13,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

In this study, Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) was used under three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) from 2015 up to 2100; the purpose was to know any possible climate changes at the Sanandaj (3525MODIFIER LETTER PRIME, 47 degrees 00MODIFIER LETTER PRIME) and Qorveh (35 degrees 16MODIFIER LETTER PRIME, 47 degrees 79MODIFIER LETTER PRIME) locations. Prediction of the flowering date, maturity date, grain-filling period, and potential yield of winter wheat during the studied period were carried out by using the LINTUL model. Then, seven possible sowing dates (from September 27 to November 27) were examined as a strategy for adoptation to the effects of future climate change and also possible changes of the developmental stages and evaluation of final grain yield of winter wheat under all the three RCP scenarios. The findings indicated that the maximum and minimum temperatures tend to increase at both locations under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. In general, change in flowering date will not be significant, particularly at the Sanandaj location, but the maturity date will be earlier than current dates at both stations under all three scenarios. There will be a slight decrease in the grain-filling period, particularly at the Sanandaj location. The total decline in the grain-filling period for the Sanandaj station would be about 1.35, 1.7, and 3.8 days by the year 2100 for the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. The average winter wheat yield changes for the 2015-2100 period would be about - 88.8, - 201.9, and - 364.9 kg ha(-1) at the Sanandaj location and 222.7, - 135.15, and - 348.5 kg ha(-1) at the Qorveh location, under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. Finally, it is found that earlier sowing dates would lead to earlier flowering and maturity dates. At Sanandaj and Qorveh stations, bringing sowing date forward from the current dates (October 27) to September 27 (first possible sowing date) would increase yield by 26 and 12 percent, and its delay to November 27 (the latest possible sowing date) would decrease yield by 19 and 11 percent, respectively. It seems that the expedition of the sowing date in the Mediterranean-type environment can act as a reliable strategy in response to future climate changes. Shifting the sowing date causes the grain-filling period to be less exposed to high temperatures and drought stress in late spring, which may results in even higher wheat yield.","[Rezaie, Behnam; Hosseinpanahi, Farzad; Siosemardeh, Adel] Univ Kurdistan, Dept Agron & Plant Breeding, Fac Agr, Pasdaran St, Sanandaj 6617715175, Kurdistan, Iran; [Darand, Mohammad] Univ Kurdistan, Dept Climatol, Fac Nat Resources, Pasdaran St, Sanandaj 6617715175, Kurdistan, Iran; [Bannayan, Mohammad] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Agr, Dept Agrotechnol, POB 91775, Mashhad 1163, Razavi Khorasan, Iran",University of Kurdistan; University of Kurdistan; Ferdowsi University Mashhad,"Hosseinpanahi, F (corresponding author), Univ Kurdistan, Dept Agron & Plant Breeding, Fac Agr, Pasdaran St, Sanandaj 6617715175, Kurdistan, Iran.",b.agronomy@gmail.com; f.hosseinpanahi@uok.ac.ir; a33@uok.ac.ir; m.darand@uok.ac.ir; mobannayan@yahoo.com,"Hosseinpanahi, Farzad/ABG-4566-2020","Hosseinpanahi, Farzad/0000-0001-8032-6403",University of Kurdistan,University of Kurdistan,This research was supported by University of Kurdistan.,,32,1,1,12,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1735-6814,1735-8043,,INT J PLANT PROD,Int.

How to simulate and calculate such a large number of wind power generations for planning or stability analysis is a technical challenge, especially the detailed research on the interactive characteristics for hundreds of models with IGBT converter. In this technical field, inspired by the decentralized and distributed ideas of Ecological Marxism theory, decoupling and grid division calculation is carried out for the electromagnetic transient model of a large number of DFIGs. Through the design and development of the data-driven large-scale parallel computing framework, multi-stage high-speed task pipelined parallel calculation is realized. It effectively solves the calculation difficulties in matrix dimension disaster caused by the number increase of wind turbines, theoretically breaks the ceiling effect of fine-grain simulation for large-scale wind power generations, and also waveforms comparison verifies the feasibility and correctness.

Internationally community-based adaptation (CBA) is recognised as a promising approach to help vulnerable populations adjust to climate change. However, with pilot projects in their infancy documented experience for Pacific Islands remains scarce. This limits the ability of the region - faced with persisting development challenges and predicted significant climate impacts - to learn from and build on previous experiences and develop robust responses to climate change. Design/methodology/approach - By using a community-based initiative in response to environmental challenges and unsustainable development as a proxy, the paper interrogates the potential usefulness of the CBA framework for the Pacific and identifies potential strengths and weaknesses. Sketching out the process and its outcomes, it shows how the initiative has resulted in a diversity of strategies, ranging from pollution control measures, to improved governance of resources and community participation in decision making, to livelihood and income diversification. Findings - Findings indicate that CBA could have a lot of potential for building more resilient communities in the face of climate change and other pressures associated with modernising Pacific societies. However, to be effective, interventions should pay attention to people's development aspirations; immediate economic, social and environmental benefits; dynamics of village governance, social rules and protocols; and traditional forms of knowledge that can inform sustainable solutions. Originality/value - The conclusions provide a reflection on the CBA framework in general and make concrete suggestions for practitioners on how the framework could be usefully implemented in the Pacific context.","[Remling, Elise] Sodertorn Univ, Sch Nat Sci Technol & Environm Studies, Huddinge, Sweden; [Veitayaki, Joeli] USP, Sch Marine Studies, Suva, Fiji",Sodertorn University; University of the South Pacific,"Remling, E (corresponding author), Sodertorn Univ, Sch Nat Sci Technol & Environm Studies, Huddinge, Sweden.",elise.remling@posteo.de,"Veitayaki, Joeli/AAI-4520-2020","Remling, Elise/0000-0003-2466-3506",,,,,49,28,29,2,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Better incorporation of socio-economic stress in local vulnerability assessments is important when planning for climate adaptation. This is rarely done due to insufficient understanding of their interaction, in both theory and practice. The omission leads to critical weaknesses in local adaptation strategies. This study analyses how socio-economic stress interact with climatic stress and shape local vulnerability to flooding, and how such stress can be more efficiently managed within local government organisations. A framework containing potential stresses was developed and applied to investigate how socio-economic stress affected exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity in two case studies, using interview and group exercise transcripts. Cases consisted of major development projects in two Swedish municipalities, Gothenburg and Lilla Edet. The cases were similarly exposed to climatic stress but differed in socio-economic context, and previous professional climate change experience. Fierce foreign competition and market structure were seen as the two most significant socio-economic stresses influencing local vulnerability to flooding through shaping the 'local' worldview. In falling order sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity were seen to be influenced by the socio-economic stresses. Two approaches to efficiently incorporate climatic and socio-economic stress in local management are proposed: shifting the focus of vulnerability assessments towards future sensitivity of people and settlements, rather than on the current infrastructure's sensitivity, would facilitate their use in planning and by 'mainstreaming' adaptation into long-term strategic planning vulnerability would be more dynamically addressed and periodically revised.","[Hjerpe, Mattias; Glaas, Erik] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res & Water & Environm S, Dept Themat Studies, SE-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University,"Hjerpe, M (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res & Water & Environm S, Dept Themat Studies, SE-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden.",mattias.hjerpe@liu.se; erik.glaas@liu.se,,"Glaas, Erik/0000-0002-5126-3973; Hjerpe, Mattias/0000-0002-5500-3300","Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas) [250-2006-2234]; European Regional Development Fund of the Baltic Sea Region Programme","Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas)(Swedish Research Council Formas); European Regional Development Fund of the Baltic Sea Region Programme","This study was funded by the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas), Grant 250-2006-2234, 'Enhancing municipalities' capacity to manage climate change' and the project 'Baltic Challenges and Chances for local and regional development generated by Climate Change - BalticClimate' funded by the European Regional Development Fund of the Baltic Sea Region Programme.

Urban water managers are thus expanding their roles and responsibilities through the installation and maintenance of green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) systems. This system expansion is perhaps more striking for water utilities administering GSI-related programs because they acquire a role that has an impact on how residents and neighborhoods will differentially experience the effects of climate change. Through an in-depth qualitative study of a GSI program in Tucson, Arizona, USA, we contribute to the socio-environmental justice framework with specific attention to distributive, procedural, recognition, interactional, and mobility justice. We highlight that a socio-environmental justice approach requires resource managers and decision-makers to recognize and respect the ways in which people's everyday relationship to water and water infrastructure is impacted by culturally mediated social norms and values, as well as legacies of exclusion and inclusion in urban development and resource governance. Thus, we argue that discussions around water equity in urban water governance need to be placed within a socio-environmental justice framework to address historical inequalities and ensure these are not reproduced through GSI.","[Radonic, Lucero] Michigan State Univ, Dept Anthropol & Environm Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Radonic, Lucero] Michigan State Univ, Policy Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Zuniga-Teran, Adriana] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog Dev & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University; University of Arizona,"Radonic, L (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Anthropol & Environm Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.;Radonic, L (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Policy Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",radonicl@msu.edu,,,,,,,90,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2023,15,2,,,,,,,1598,10.3390/su15021598,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15021598,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,8Q3IB,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000927103200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

But highly simplified assumptions are often made about the response of organizations to the stimulus of perceived or experienced climate change. This paper reviews recent literature, arguing that three approaches are applied in studies of organizational adaptation: utility-maximizing, behavioral, and institutional approaches. The paper argues that adaptive responses by organizations are conditioned by the processes of perception, evaluation, enactment, and learning by organizations. Organizational adaptation involves adjustments in each of these processes. The extent to which adaptive measures are taken by organizations will be influenced both by endogenous factors, such as the capability to innovate and attitudes to risk, as well as by the external economic and institutional context. Willingness to exercise available adaptation options will vary between organizations. Evidence of organizational adaptation from case studies and meta-analyses is reviewed.

This paper presents a systematic literature review of the recent English language peer-reviewed scholarship on adaptation in glaciated mountain regions. 4050 potentially relevant articles were examined, with 36 included for full review. Results indicate that scholarly investigation into adaptation in glaciated mountains is presently limited to only 40 % of countries with alpine glaciation. Seventy-four discrete adaptation initiatives were identified, with most occurring in Peru (28 %), Nepal (22 %) and India (17 %). Many documented adaptations were initiated in response to intersecting stressors related to cryospheric change and socioeconomic development; were autonomous and initiated in reaction to experienced climatic stimuli; and were carried out at the individual, family, or community scale. The study contributes to an emerging literature tracking on-the-ground adaptation processes and outcomes, and identifies a need to raise the profile of human adaptation in glaciated mountain regions within the HDCC scholarship.

Increasing ventilation has been demonstrated to improve thermal comfort during hot weather conditions in cities. However, during cold conditions increased ventilation lowers thermal comfort. In the context of urban design for climate adaptation, it is desirable to know from which directions hot and cold weather conditions approach the city. For this purpose we present a simple extension to the conventional wind rose concept. This tool, which we refer to as 'heat and cold roses', visualizes the wind direction statistics in combination with hot and cold weather conditions. We demonstrate that for a multitude of cities in the U.S. the main directions of hot and cold weather conditions do not overlap. In analyzing the heat and cold weather roses from the 50 largest U.S. cities, two distinct typologies of heat and cold roses are identified. The implications and potential for using these typologies for developing improved building configuration designs is demonstrated by microscale bioclimatic simulations. The studied, hypothetical building design configuration improved thermal comfort for both hot and cold conditions.","[Heusinger, Jannik; Sailor, David J.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Heusinger, Jannik] TU Braunschweig, Inst Geoecol, Langer Kamp 19c, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Braunschweig University of Technology,"Heusinger, J (corresponding author), 975 S Myrtle Ave, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",nheusing@asu.edu; dsailor@asu.edu,"Sailor, David/E-6308-2014","Sailor, David/0000-0003-1720-8214",Urban Climate Research Center at Arizona State University,Urban Climate Research Center at Arizona State University,"The presented research was funded by the Urban Climate Research Center at Arizona State University.

We conducted interviews with practitioners involved in drought management at urban water utilities across the U.S. to understand: 1) both short-and long-term actions taken in response to drought; 2) perceptions of what constitutes an 'effective' drought response and whether and how this was measured; and 3) limitations to drought response. We apply criteria from a theoretical framing of adaptive capacity and then 'reason by analogy' to understand how adaptive capacity may be built or constrained in the future by such responses, including how future actions may be otherwise limited by political, social, physical and other factors. We find that drought responses overall are seen as successful in reducing water demand and helping to maintain system reliability, but can also reduce flexibility and introduce other limitations. Public perception, the multi-purpose nature of water, revenue structures, expectations and other social factors play a dominant role in constraining drought response options. We also find that some urban water utilities face challenges in measuring the effectiveness of demand reduction strategies because it can be difficult to attribute water savings, especially those related to outdoor water use. The limitations in drought policies experienced by urban utilities offer important lessons for the ability of systems to innovate toward more sustainable water systems for the future.","[Dilling, Lisa] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, UCB 397, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Dilling, Lisa] Univ Colorado, Western Water Assessment, UCB 397, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Daly, Meaghan E.] Univ New England, Dept Environm Studies, 11 Hills Beach Rd, Biddeford, ME 04005 USA; [Kenney, Douglas A.] Univ Colorado, Western Water Policy Program, UCB 401, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Klein, Roberta] Univ Colorado, Ctr Sci & Technol Policy Res, UCB 0488, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Miller, Kathleen; Wilhelmi, Olga] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Res Applicat Lab, 3090 Ctr Green Dr, Boulder, CO 80301 USA; [Ray, Andrea J.] NOAA Earth Syst Res Lab, Phys Sci Div, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Travis, William R.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, UCB 260, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Travis, William R.] Univ Colorado, Western Water Assessment, UCB 260, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of New England - Maine; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Dilling, L (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, UCB 397, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Dilling, L (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Western Water Assessment, UCB 397, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",ldilling@colorado.edu,"; Ray, Andrea/Q-9848-2018","Miller, Kathleen/0000-0002-4040-5139; Travis, William/0000-0002-9197-1317; Ray, Andrea/0000-0001-5385-1202; Dilling, Lisa/0000-0001-5061-0809","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Societal Applications Research Program [NA10OAR4310172]; NOAA/ESRL Physical Sciences Division; Leverhulme Trust, UK; National Science Foundation","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Societal Applications Research Program; NOAA/ESRL Physical Sciences Division; Leverhulme Trust, UK(Leverhulme Trust); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","The authors acknowledge funding support from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Societal Applications Research Program under grant #NA10OAR4310172, and the NOAA/ESRL Physical Sciences Division.

To help formulate coastal management strategies to mitigate the impacts of these extreme changes (e.g., local land-use or climate change adaptation policies), research methodologies that incorporate participatory approaches alongside with computer simulation modeling tools have potential to be particularly effective. One such research methodology, called the Participatory Coastal Land-Use Management (PCLM) approach, consists of three major steps: (a) participatory approach to find key drivers responsible for the water quality deterioration, (b) scenario analysis using different computer simulation modeling tools for impact assessment, and (c) using these scientific evidences for developing adaptation and mitigation measures. In this study, we have applied PCLM approach in the Kendrapara district of India (focusing on the Brahmani River basin), a rapidly urbanizing area on the country's east coast to evaluate current status and predict its future conditions. The participatory approach involved key informant interviews to determine key drivers of water quality degradation, which served as an input for scenario analysis and hydrological simulation in the next step. Future river water quality (BOD and Total coliform (Tot. coli) as important parameters) was simulated using the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) tool, considering a different plausible future scenario (to 2050) incorporating diverse drivers and pressures (i.e., population growth, land-use change, and climate change). Water samples (collected in 2018) indicated that the Brahmani River in this district was already moderately-to-extremely polluted in comparison to the desirable water quality (Class B), and modeling results indicated that the river water quality is likely to further deteriorate by 2050 under all of the considered scenarios. Demographic changes emerged as the major driver affecting the future water quality deterioration (68% and 69% for BOD and Tot. coli respectively), whereas climate change had the lowest impact on river water quality (12% and 13% for BOD and Tot. coli respectively), although the impact was not negligible. Scientific evidence to understand the impacts of future changes can help in developing diverse plausible coastal zone management approaches for ensuring sustainable management of water resources in the region.

Adaptation measures, such as early warning systems for floods (EWSFs), have the potential to reduce the risk and impact of flood events when tailored to reflect the local social-ecological context and needs. Community perceptions and experiences play a critical role in risk management, since perceptions influence people's behaviors in response to EWSFs and other interventions. Methods We investigated community perceptions and responses in flood-prone periurban areas in the coastal city of Machala, Ecuador. Focus groups (n = 11) were held with community members (n = 65 people) to assess perceptions of flood exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and current alert systems. Discussions were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded by topic. Participatory maps were field validated, georeferenced, and digitized using GIS software. Qualitative data were triangulated with historical government information on rainfall, flood events, population demographics, and disease outbreaks. Results Flooding was associated with seasonal rainfall, El Nino events, high ocean tides, blocked drainage areas, overflowing canals, collapsed sewer systems, and low local elevation. Participatory maps revealed spatial heterogeneity in perceived flood risk across the community. Ten areas of special concern were mapped, including places with strong currents during floods, low elevation areas with schools and homes, and other places that accumulate stagnant water. Sensitive populations included children, the elderly, physically handicapped people, low-income families, and recent migrants. Flood impacts included damages to property and infrastructure, power outages, and the economic cost of rebuilding/repairs. Health impacts included outbreaks of infectious diseases, skin infections, snakebite, and injury/ drowning. Adaptive capacity was weakest during the preparation and recovery stages of flooding. Participants perceived that their capacity to take action was limited by a lack of social organization, political engagement, and financial capital. People perceived that flood forecasts were too general, and instead relied on alerts via social media. Conclusions This study highlights the challenges and opportunities for climate change adaptation in coastal cities. Areas of special concern provide clear local policy targets. The participatory approach presented here (1) provides important context to shape local policy and interventions in Ecuador, complimenting data gathered through standard flood reports, (2) provides a voice for marginalized communities and a mechanism to raise local awareness, and (3) provides a research framework that can be adapted to other resource-limited coastal communities at risk of flooding.","[Tauzer, Erica; Stewart-Ibarra, Anna M.] SUNY Upstate Med Univ, Inst Global Hlth & Translat Sci, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Borbor-Cordova, Mercy J.] Escuela Super Politecn Litoral ESPOL, Fac Ingn Maritime & Ciencias Mar, Guayaquil, Guayas Province, Ecuador; [Mendoza, Jhoyzett; De La Cuadra, Telmo] Natl Serv Risk Management & Emergencies, Guayaquil, Guayas Province, Ecuador; [Cunalata, Jorge] Univ Tecn Machala, Machala, El Oro Province, Ecuador; [Stewart-Ibarra, Anna M.] SUNY Upstate Med Univ, Dept Med, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Stewart-Ibarra, Anna M.] InterAmer Inst Global Change Res IAI, Dept Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center; Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center,"Tauzer, E; Stewart-Ibarra, AM (corresponding author), SUNY Upstate Med Univ, Inst Global Hlth & Translat Sci, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.;Stewart-Ibarra, AM (corresponding author), SUNY Upstate Med Univ, Dept Med, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.;Stewart-Ibarra, AM (corresponding author), InterAmer Inst Global Change Res IAI, Dept Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.",erica.tauzer@gmail.com; astewart@dir.iai.int,,,InterAmerican Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) Training Institute Seed Grants [TISG C2012/C2013]; SUNY Upstate Medical University,InterAmerican Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) Training Institute Seed Grants; SUNY Upstate Medical University,"This study was supported by the InterAmerican Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) Training Institute Seed Grants (TISG C2012/C2013) to AMSI and by SUNY Upstate Medical University.

To assess watershed health and develop effective management plans, information about the function and structure of the watersheds in the context of their climatic response, especially to take into account rainfall anomalies and climate change adaptation, is needed. Integration of climatic variables with reliability, resilience and vulnerability (RRV) indicators, is a novel approach for generating this information. This study investigated the behavior of RRV indicators with respect to rainfall variability and drought patterns for three watersheds governed by different climates. Reliability was defined as the probability of a watershed to be in the range of satisfactory Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) values. Resilience was indicated as the speed of recovery from an unsatisfactory condition. Vulnerability was defined as a function of the exposure of a watershed to climate change and variation using the SPI. The study areas were the Foyle Watershed in Northern Ireland (temperate oceanic, Cfb), the Xarrama Watershed in Portugal (Mediterranean hot summer, Csa) and the Shazand Watershed in Iran (moderate to cold semi-arid (Bsk). Based on the SPI pattern of each watershed, the SPI of -0.1 for the Foyle and Xarrama watersheds and +0.1 for the Shazand Watershed was selected as the drought threshold. The drought based RRV index was subsequently calculated from long-term (1981-2012) RRV indicators, resulting in means of 0.52 +/- 0.25, 0.53 +/- 0.21 and 0.30 +/- 0.18 for the three watersheds, respectively. These means reflect the status of the watersheds in terms of climatic conditions, which was moderate dry (0.41-0.60) for the Foyle and Xarrama watersheds and dry (0.21-0.40) for the Shazand Watershed. The temporal trend of the drought based RRV index was found to be non-significantly increasing (P-value > 0.52) for the Foyle and Xarrama watersheds and non-significantly decreasing for the Shazand Watershed (P-value > 0.48). The vulnerability indicator and drought based RRV index were significantly (p-value = 0.00) affected by the climatological gradient. The results of the conceptual framework linked to statistical trends can provide researchers, policy makers, and land managers a more comprehensive base to assess variability of watershed health and design drought management plans.","[Hazbavi, Zeinab; Sadeghi, Seyed Hamidreza] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Nat Resource, Dept Watershed Management Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Baartman, Jantiene E.

Social movements could play an important role in this. Meanwhile, we have recently witnessed a major swell in climate activism, as well as a growing realization among climate activists that it may be too late to prevent major climate disruptions. Yet to what extent this may lead to a focus on adaptation in the climate movement remains understudied. To address this gap in the literature, the current paper draws on survey data from 2,344 participants in Fridays For Future climate demonstrations in September 2019 in 13 cities in Europe, Australia and the USA. The analyses show that while one-half of the respondents still attributes greater weight to mitigation, the other half attributes equal weight to adaptation and mitigation, indicating a greater emphasis on adaptation than previously assumed. It is found that those supporting (equal focus on) adaptation experience less hope about the effectiveness of climate policies, and portray a reluctance to support far-reaching climate action. The latter indicates that support for adaptation in the climate movement is associated with conservative attitudes, indicating constraints for the emergence of a climate movement for transformational adaptation.","[de Moor, Joost] Sci Po, Ctr European Studies & Comparat Polit CEE, Paris, France",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"de Moor, J (corresponding author), Sci Po, Ctr European Studies & Comparat Polit CEE, Paris, France.",joost.demoor@sciencespo.fr,,"de Moor, Joost/0000-0002-0413-9590","FORMAS [2019-01961, 2019-00261]; Stockholm University's Human Sciences Area",FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas); Stockholm University's Human Sciences Area,This study was funded by Stockholm University's Human Sciences Area and FORMAS (2019-01961 and 2019-00261).,,60,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Within many if not most resource management agencies, the number of programs and initiatives designed to adapt to the expected impacts of climate change has risen sharply over the past decade. This article examines the implementation of such climate adaptation initiatives in the context of the United States Forest Service (USFS). Based on semi-structured interviews (N = 25), this paper provides an empirical account of how USFS aquatic resources managers and specialists working at regional and sub-regional levels within the Pacific Northwest region (PNW) are responding to adaptation planning directives established at the federal level, as well as how managers are advancing their own unit-level initiatives. Results illustrate a spectrum of engagement with adaptation across the region. In addition to the expected influence of limited human and financial capacity and institutional constraints, key factors perceived by managers as shaping engagement across the region include the attitudes of key actors, and legacies of (mis-) trust (with respect to the stability of the climate mandate). In contrast, managers did not perceive technical information as a major barrier to adaptation. These observations highlight the asymmetry between the widespread emphasis on the role of technical information in shaping adaptation relative to the often overlooked, but influential role of nonmaterial factors (like attitudes and trust). Findings are discussed in the context of deepening understanding about the interrelated roles of material and nonmaterial barriers in shaping currently unfolding adaptation efforts.

Consequently, there has been extensive focus on developing and implementing adaptation. However, these efforts have prodominantly centred on larger cities. Coastal towns and small cities (urban areas between 1000 and 100,000 people) have received little attention, despite experiencing a number of barriers to adaptation. The absence of information on the global scale of the adaptation challenge within coastal towns and small cities may have contributed to these settlements being overlooked. This paper develops a method that can be used to estimate the numbers, sizes, and locations of coastal towns and small cities worldwide from global population data (Global Human Settlement data). Denmark is used as a pilot for this method with settlements over 1000 people classified with relatively high accuracy. The method developed here represents a potentially fruitful approach to supporting coastal adaptation, as coastal towns and small cities are identifiable globally, they can be classified into types. This will support an assessment of their risk to coastal hazards, and could facilitate knowledge and practice sharing between similar coastal towns and small cities.","[Fitton, James M.; Lehmann, Martin] Aalborg Univ, Dept Planning, Rendsburggade 14, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark; [Major, David C.] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY USA",Aalborg University; Columbia University,"Fitton, JM (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Dept Planning, Rendsburggade 14, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark.",james@plan.aau.dk,,"Fitton, James/0000-0002-9367-2038; Lehmann, Martin/0000-0003-2089-4550",,,,,36,3,3,2,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-8947,1753-8955,,INT J DIGIT EARTH,Int.

Anticipatory climate adaptation planning relies on vulnerability assessments that identify parks and resources at risk from climate change and associated vulnerability drivers. However, there is currently little understanding of where and how protected area assessments have been conducted and what assessment approaches best inform park management. To address this knowledge gap, we systematically evaluated climate-change vulnerability assessments of natural resources in U.S. National Parks. We categorized the spatial scale, resources, methods, and handling of uncertainty for each assessment and mapped which parks have assessments and for what resources. We found that a few broad-scale assessments provide baseline information-primarily regarding physical climate change exposure-for all parks and can support regional to national decisions. However, finer-scale assessments are required to inform decisions for individual or small groups of parks. Only 10% of parks had park-specific assessments describing key climate impacts and identifying priority resource vulnerabilities, and 37% lacked any regional or park-specific assessments. We identify assessment approaches that match the scale and objectives of different protected area management decisions and recommend a multi-scaled approach to implementing assessments to meet the information needs of a large, protected area network like the National Park system.","[Michalak, Julia L.; Lawler, Joshua J.; Agne, Michelle C.; Hsu, Hsin-Wu; Griffey, Vivian] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Gross, John E.] US Natl Pk Serv Climate Change Response Program, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Emmet, Robert L.] Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Illinois Natural History Survey,"Michalak, JL (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",michalaj@uw.edu,,"Gross, John/0000-0002-8758-6205; Hsu, Hsin-Wu/0000-0002-6347-4540; Agne, Michelle/0000-0001-9660-3559; Emmet, Robert/0000-0003-0055-8525",National Park Service,National Park Service,National Park Service,,76,1,1,21,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,2578-4854,,CONSERV SCI PRACT,Conserv.

While it is clear that current urban water challenges need a more integrated approach, practitioners disagree on what such an integrated approach means exactly. Integration could therefore be described as a wicked problem, with practitioners having different understandings of integration, as well as the opportunities and challenges they should focus on; e.g., climate adaptation, resource recovery or collective replacement. This lack of consensus challenges decision-making, and thus the implementation of integration. To foster urban water systems integration, this study uses Q methodology to explore the different perspectives that Dutch urban water practitioners have on integration for future urban water systems. Our analysis reveals four salient perspectives: perspective 1 sees coordination as a means to make the system future-proof, perspective 2 focuses on climate adaptation, perspective 3 aims for recovery, and perspective 4 is all about efficiency and being in control. While all perspectives acknowledge that traditional urban water practices need to change, they differ on which sustainability challenges are considered most important and what means should be used. Practitioners need to understand these differences to deal effectively with the wicked nature of integration.","[Nieuwenhuis, Eva; Langeveld, Jeroen] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Delft, Netherlands; [Nieuwenhuis, Eva] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Delft, Netherlands; [Cuppen, Eefje] Leiden Univ, Fac Governance & Global Affairs, Leiden, Netherlands; [Langeveld, Jeroen] Partners4UrbanWater, Nijmegen, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; Delft University of Technology; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Nieuwenhuis, E (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Delft, Netherlands.;Nieuwenhuis, E (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Delft, Netherlands.",e.m.nieuwenhuis@tudelft.nl,,,Dutch Kennisprogramma Urban Drainage (Urban Drainage Knowledge Programme),Dutch Kennisprogramma Urban Drainage (Urban Drainage Knowledge Programme),"This work was supported by the Dutch Kennisprogramma Urban Drainage (Urban Drainage Knowledge Programme).

Social learning reflects the engagement of interdependent stakeholders within this learning. Much attention has focused on these concepts as a solution for resilience in governing institutions in an uncertain climate; resilience representing the ability of a system to absorb shock and to retain its function and form through reorganisation. However, there are still many questions to how these concepts enable resilience, particularly in vulnerable, developing contexts. A case study from Uganda presents how these concepts promote resilient livelihood outcomes among rural subsistence farmers within a decentralised governing framework. This approach has the potential to highlight the dynamics and characteristics of a governance system which may manage change. The paper draws from the enabling characteristics of adaptive governance, including lower scale dynamics of bonding and bridging ties and strong leadership. Central to these processes were learning platforms promoting knowledge transfer leading to improved self-efficacy, innovation and livelihood skills. However even though aspects of adaptive governance were identified as contributing to resilience in livelihoods, some barriers were identified. Reflexivity and multi-stakeholder collaboration were evident in governing institutions; however, limited self-organisation and vertical communication demonstrated few opportunities for shifts in governance, which was severely challenged by inequity, politicisation and elite capture. The paper concludes by outlining implications for climate adaptation policy through promoting the importance of mainstreaming adaptation alongside existing policy trajectories; highlighting the significance of collaborative spaces for stakeholders and the tackling of inequality and corruption.

In this study, the ex-ante potential of residue retention and fertilization measures to meet this challenge is assessed using a positive mathematical programming (PMP) model. This micro-economic model captures decision making at the farm level for a sample population in Northern Burkina Faso for the 2010 to 2045 simulation period. In contrast to previous studies of mixed farms in this area, we model each individual farm in the sample population, instead of one or a small number of representative farms. We are therefore able identify groups of farms for which each measure is profitable, applied either individually or as a combined package. This approach also enables simulation of the economic impacts from indiscriminate applications of the measures or smart applications which are restricted to the farms that profit from the measures. Our findings are aligned with other studies showing that residue retention causes trade-offs between crop and livestock production, while fertilization can synergistically raise returns to both production activities. The annual profit losses from the middle of the road RCP6 trajectory of climate change assumed in this study were estimated to reach 15% by 2045. The smart package of measures increased aggregate profit the most, although not by nearly enough to claw back the losses from climate change. The fertilizer measures were the next most profitable, with indiscriminately applied residue retention being the only measure to reduce aggregate profit relative to this climate change baseline. Importantly, the measures that are the most profitable at the aggregate level are not necessarily those that would be the most widely adopted. For example, residue retention is profitable for a larger share of the sample population than fertilization. The advantage of the population scale analysis used in this study is that it prevents measures such as residue retention, which can benefit a significant share of farms, from being disregarded by practitioners because they appear to be unprofitable at the aggregate level or when viewed through the lens of an average representative farm. Finally, amidst the growing emphasis of studies on the benefits of packages compared to individual measures, the findings from this study are more equivocal about this choice, suggesting that extension programs should have the flexibility to apply measures individually or as a package.","[Henderson, Benjamin; Herrero, Mario] CSIRO, Queensland Biosci Precinct, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Henderson, Benjamin; Cacho, Oscar] Univ New England, Business Sch, Armidale, NSW, Australia; [van Wijk, Mark] ILRI, Nairobi, Kenya; [Thornton, Philip] ILRI, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Nairobi, Kenya",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of New England; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Henderson, B (corresponding author), CSIRO, Queensland Biosci Precinct, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.",bhender8@myune.edu.au; ocacho@une.edu.au; p.thornton@cgiar.org; m.vanwijk@cgiar.org; mario.herrero@csiro.au,"Cacho, Oscar/F-3012-2011; Thornton, Philip/AAB-8806-2020; Herrero, Mario/A-6678-2015","Cacho, Oscar/0000-0002-1542-4442; Thornton, Philip/0000-0002-1854-0182; Herrero, Mario/0000-0002-7741-5090",CGIAR Trust Fund,CGIAR Trust Fund(CGIAR),"Philip Thornton's input was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from the CGIAR Trust Fund and through bilateral funding agreements.

Smallholder and subsistence farmers, pastoralists and forest-dependent households are the most hit by climate-related hazards. They have to have perception of climate change in order to respond it through making coping and/or adaptation strategies. Local perceptions and coping strategies provide a crucial foundation for community-based climate change adaptation measures. This study was specifically designed to (1) assess households' perception and knowledge in climate change and/or variability, and (2) establish the observed changes in climate parameters with community perceptions and climate anomalies. Purposive stratified random sampling method has been used to gather information from 355 sample households for individual interviews supplemented by group discussion and key informants interviews. The analysis of observed and satellite climate data for the study district showed that mean maximum and minimum temperature for the period 1983-2014 has increased by 0.047 and 0.028 degrees C/year, respectively. However, the total rainfall has declined by 10.16 mm per annum. Seasonally, the rainfall has declined by 2.198, 4.541, 1.814 and 1.608 mm per annum for Ethiopian summer, spring, autumn and winter seasons, respectively. Similarly, the mean maximum temperature of the study area had showed an increment of 0.035, 0.049, 0.044 and 0.065 degrees C per year for spring, winter, autumn and summer seasons, respectively. The observed climate variation has been confirmed by people's perception. Considering what had been the existed situations before 30 years ago as normal, an increase in temperature, an increase in drought frequency, a decrease in total rainfall, erratic nature of its distribution and the tardiness of its onset had been perceived by 88, 70, 97, 80 and 94% of the respondents, respectively, at current time-2015. Deforestation as a casual factor of climate change and variability had been perceived by 99.7% of the respondents. This had been also confirmed by scientific studies as it emits carbon dioxide and is the main driver of climate change and variability. Indigenous knowledge, including climate predictions, has been used by people to implement their day-to-day agricultural activities. Therefore, science should be integrated with the perception and indigenous knowledge of people to come up with concrete solution for climate change and variability impacts on human livelihoods.","[Mekonnen, Zenebe; Woldeamanuel, Teshale; Asfaw, Zebene] Hawassa Univ, Wondo Genet Coll Forestry & Nat Resources, POB 128, Shashemene, Ethiopia; [Kassa, Habtemariam] Ctr Int Forest Res CIFOR, Ethiopia Off, Forests & Livelihoods Res, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Hawassa University; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),"Mekonnen, Z (corresponding author), Hawassa Univ, Wondo Genet Coll Forestry & Nat Resources, POB 128, Shashemene, Ethiopia.",zenebemg2014@gmail.com; h.kassa@cgiar.org; twoldeamanuel@yahoo.com; zebeneasfaw@gmail.com,"Mekonnen, Zenebe/CAG-3033-2022",,Ethiopian Environment and Forest Research Institute; Wondo Genet College of Forestry and Natural Resources,Ethiopian Environment and Forest Research Institute; Wondo Genet College of Forestry and Natural Resources,"The authors would like to express their sincere gratitude to the Ethiopian Environment and Forest Research Institute and Wondo Genet College of Forestry and Natural Resources for providing the financial support to Zenebe Mekonnen to carry-out this research as part of his PhD studies.

Rapid urbanization coinciding with a growing frequency and intensity of floods requires transformative actions in cities worldwide. While abandoning flood prone areas is sometimes discussed as a public climate adaptation option, little attention is paid to studying cumulative impacts of outmigration as an individual choice. To explore the aggregated consequences of households' outmigration decisions in response to increasing flood hazards, we employ a computational agent-based model grounded in empirical heuristics of buyers' and sellers' behaviour in a flood-prone housing market. Our results suggest that pure market-driven processes can cause shifts in demographics in climate-sensitive hotspots placing low-income households further at risk. They get trapped in hazard zones, even when individual risk perceptions and behavioural location preferences are independent of income, suggesting increasing climate gentrification as an outcome of market sorting.","[de Koning, Koen; Filatova, Tatiana] Univ Twente, Dept Governance & Technol Sustainabil CSTM, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands",University of Twente,"de Koning, K (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Dept Governance & Technol Sustainabil CSTM, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",k.dekoning@utwente.nl; t.filatova@utwente.nl,"Filatova, Tatiana/K-8233-2016","Filatova, Tatiana/0000-0002-3546-6930",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [758014],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)),"This work was partially funded by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 758014 SCALAR).

Previous work has attempted to promote carbon allocation justice based on a utilitarian theory of justice, but it has backfired. Adopting the per capita approach in defining justice suggested by a Rawlsian theory of justice, the current research addresses the psychosocial processes underlying justice in carbon allocation. Inspired by the social identity approach, we propose that whether people choose to behave justly in carbon allocation originates, in part, from their perceptions about whether an outgroup shares similar humanness with the ingroup. We conducted four studies (N = 1326) to test this assumption. The results indicated that humanization increased the allocation of carbon credits to an out-group (Study 1), increased the amount of carbon credits contributed and decreased free-riding behavior (Studies 2 & 3), and reduced carbon emissions and over-emitting behavior (Study 4) in carbon allocation; the effects were mediated by an expanded scope of justice (Studies 1-4). By identifying the roles of humanization and the scope of justice in carbon allocation justice, this research provides a psychosocial framework for understanding climate justice, which has implications for guiding the priorities of policymakers.","[Huang, Lingling; Liu, Li; Dang, Jianning; Wei, Cong; Liang, Yuan; Gu, Zibei; Li, Jinfeng] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Psychol, Beijing Key Lab Appl Expt Psychol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Li; Dang, Jianning] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Cognit Neurosci & Learning, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Li; Dang, Jianning] Beijing Normal Univ, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University,"Liu, L; Dang, JN (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",l.liu@bnu.edu.cn; jndang@bnu.edu.cn,"Liu, Li/T-6645-2017; Wei, Cong/G-3302-2018","Liu, Li/0000-0002-4898-3013; Wei, Cong/0000-0002-6804-8508; Huang, Lingling/0000-0001-9501-2247; Dang, Jianning/0000-0002-8174-0136",National Social Science Foundation of China [32100869]; Natural Science Foundation of China [21YJC190003.]; Project of Humanities and Social Science Research of the Ministry of Education of China [2019NTSS30]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University;  [18ZDA332],"National Social Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Project of Humanities and Social Science Research of the Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University; ","This work was supported by the Major Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China [18ZDA332] ; the Natural Science Foundation of China [32100869] ; the Project of Humanities and Social Science Research of the Ministry of Education of China [21YJC190003] ; and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University [2019NTSS30] .

While aggregate bre akdown is assumed to expose the enclosed soil organic carbon (SOC) to preferential erosion and to accelerated decomposition, the link between the stability of soil aggregates and SOC exports from soils, has either been overlooked or unaccounted for, especially when developing carbon cycle models. This study compared SOC losses in particulate (POC), dissolved (DOC) and gaseous (GOC) forms to an indicator of the soil aggregate stability, the mean weight diameter of aggregates (MWD). SOC outputs were considered at 24 locations of a typical hillslope of the South African Highveld showing clayey to sandy soils. Both POC and DOC were evaluated in-situ under natural rains using 1 x 1 m(2) runoff plots while soil CO2 emissions were assessed in the laboratory from undisturbed 0-0.05 m soil samples. MWD was finally compared to selected soil and terrain attributes for predictive purpose and as a means to further the understanding of SOC outputs from soils. MWD ranged between 1.4 mm for unstable aggregates and 3.4 mm for stable aggregates. The increase in aggregate stability resulted in a significant increase in POC and DOC concentrations in the eroded sediments (r = 0.76) and in GOC losses from soils (r = 0.91 when expressed as g C-CO2 per gram of soil; r = 0.95 when as g C-CO2 per gram of soil carbon). In contrast, high aggregate stability induced low total DOC and POC losses (r = -0.81 and -0.77, respectively). The lower POC and DOC losses in the most stable soil aggregates were explained by increased soil infiltration by water and reduced transport by runoff, while the greater CO2 emissions correlated with high SOC concentration. Furthermore, there was a tendency for clayey soils which were fully covered by grass to present stable aggregates and thus to yield greater CO2 emissions but lower POC and DOC outputs than degraded sandy soils of low aggregate stability. Such a quantitative assessment of the role of soil aggregation on SOC outputs might enhance knowledge on organic matter persistence in soils, a prerequisite for developing more accurate global carbon cycle models. Finally further research is required to investigate the downslope to downstream fate of the eroded SOC and to develop land management strategies that aim at lessening carbon losses from soils while enhancing adaptation to climate change.

Yet academics have also voiced concerns against seeing PES as a panacea. This article discusses whether PES is an appropriate and promising approach to promote so-called climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices, which we define as agricultural production practices that contribute to CO2 emission reductions and/or removals and provide benefits to farmers via increased productivity and profits and reduced vulnerability to climate change. PES appears most promising for the promotion of CSA practices in small-scale farming contexts with low incomes. Effective design, however, requires solid estimates of cost and benefit flows from CSA adoption over time, accounting for differences in socioeconomic and ecological conditions, and addressing the risk of leakage. Funding for such PES will likely have to come from public sources, and seems most promising where synergies with other objectives such as agricultural development, food security, and climate adaptation or other environmental services exist. The potential of alternative approaches for CSA support such as taxation with rebates for CSA practices, CSA-related investment support such as microcredits, and hybrid approaches such as conditional microcredit should be further investigated.","[Engel, Stefanie] Univ Osnabruck, Environm Econ, Osnabruck, Germany; [Muller, Adrian] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Zurich, Switzerland; [Muller, Adrian] Res Inst Organ Agr FiBL, Frick, Switzerland",University Osnabruck; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Engel, S (corresponding author), Univ Osnabruck, Environm Econ, Osnabruck, Germany.",stefanie.engel@uos.de,,"Muller, Adrian/0000-0001-7232-9399; Engel, Stefanie/0000-0002-3568-5500",Alexander von Humboldt-Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation SNSF through the National Research Programme Sustainable Use of Soil as a Resource [NRP 68],Alexander von Humboldt-Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Swiss National Science Foundation SNSF through the National Research Programme Sustainable Use of Soil as a Resource(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),The authors thank three anonymous reviewers for helpful feedback on an earlier draft.

This paper aims to develop a Climate Resilience Indicator (CRI) framework for assessing airport climate resilience, which for the first time, considers: climate exposure, vulnerability and adaptive capacity simultaneously and advances the development of climate risk analysis of airports to a point where their adaptation and resilience can be quantified under uncertainty in data. Climate-related data was collected from multiple sources to evaluate an airport's performance against each indicator. An evidential reasoning (ER) approach is used to evaluate each airport by integrating all the indicators to derive its final CRI score. The findings provide valuable insights into how urgently an airport needs to deal with climate change and reveal information to help with resource allocation for different airports nationally through proactive adaptation planning.","[Poo, Mark Ching-Pong; Yang, Zaili] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Logist Offshore & Marine Res Inst, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Yang, Zaili] Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Dimitriu, Delia] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Ecol & Environm Res Ctr, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Qu, Zhuohua] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Business Sch, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Liverpool John Moores University; Zhejiang University; Manchester Metropolitan University; Liverpool John Moores University; University of Liverpool,"Yang, ZL (corresponding author), Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Logist Offshore & Marine Res Inst, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",Z.Yang@ljmu.ac.uk,"yang, zaili/A-6493-2013; zhao, yang/GXF-4424-2022; Poo, Mark Ching-Pong/Q-2235-2017","yang, zaili/0000-0003-1385-493X; Poo, Mark Ching-Pong/0000-0002-9921-3107",,,,,70,2,3,16,33,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1361-9209,1879-2340,,TRANSPORT RES D-TR E,Transport.

Increasingly volatile weather and more extreme events such as droughts can reduce crop productivity. This implies the need for significant increases in production and the adoption of more efficient and sustainable production methods and adaptation to climate change. A new technological and environment-friendly management technique to improve the tolerance of quinoa grown to maturity is proposed using native microbial biostimulants (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; AMF) alone, in the consortium, or in combination with compost (Comp) as an organic matter source under two water treatments (normal irrigation and drought stress (DS)). Compared with controls, growth, grain yield, and all physiological traits under DS were significantly decreased while hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde, and antioxidative enzymatic functions were significantly increased. Under DS, biofertilizer application reverted physiological activities to normal levels and potentially strengthened quinoa's adaptability to water shortage as compared to untreated plants. The dual combination yielded a 97% improvement in grain dry weight. Moreover, the effectiveness of microbial and compost biostimulants as a biological tool improves grain quality and limits soil degradation under DS. Elemental concentrations, particularly macronutrients, antioxidant potential (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity), and bioactive compounds (phenol and flavonoid content), were accumulated at higher levels in biofertilizer-treated quinoa grain than in untreated controls. The effects of AMF + Comp on post-harvest soil fertility traits were the most positive, with significant increases in total phosphorus (47%) and organic matter (200%) content under drought conditions. Taken together, our data demonstrate that drought stress strongly influences the physiological traits, yield, and quality of quinoa. Microbial and compost biostimulation could be an effective alternative to ensure greater recovery capability, thereby maintaining relatively high levels of grain production. Our study shows that aboveground stress responses in quinoa can be modulated by signals from the microbial/compost-treated root. Further, quinoa grains are generally of higher nutritive quality when amended and inoculated with AMF as compared to non-inoculated and compost-free plants.","[Toubali, Salma; Ait-El-Mokhtar, Mohamed; Boutasknit, Abderrahim; Anli, Mohamed; Ait-Rahou, Youssef; Benaffari, Wissal; Meddich, Abdelilah] Cadi Ayyad Univ, Ctr Agrobiotechnol & Bioengn, Ctr AgroBiotech URL CNRST 05, Res Unit Labelled CNRST,Physiol Abiotic Stresses, Marrakech, Morocco; [Toubali, Salma; Ait-El-Mokhtar, Mohamed; Boutasknit, Abderrahim; Anli, Mohamed; Ait-Rahou, Youssef; Benaffari, Wissal; Meddich, Abdelilah] Cadi Ayyad Univ, Fac Sci Semlalia, Lab Agro Food Biotechnol & Valorizat Plant Biores, Marrakech, Morocco; [Toubali, Salma; Boutasknit, Abderrahim; Anli, Mohamed; Benaffari, Wissal; Ben-Ahmed, Hela; Meddich, Abdelilah] Lab Mixte Tunisomarocain LMTM Physiol & Biotechn, Tunis, Tunisia; [Mitsui, Toshiaki; Baslam, Marouane] Niigata Univ, Fac Agr, Lab Biochem, Niigata, Japan",Cadi Ayyad University of Marrakech; Cadi Ayyad University of Marrakech; Niigata University,"Meddich, A (corresponding author), Cadi Ayyad Univ, Ctr Agrobiotechnol & Bioengn, Ctr AgroBiotech URL CNRST 05, Res Unit Labelled CNRST,Physiol Abiotic Stresses, Marrakech, Morocco.;Meddich, A (corresponding author), Cadi Ayyad Univ, Fac Sci Semlalia, Lab Agro Food Biotechnol & Valorizat Plant Biores, Marrakech, Morocco.;Meddich, A (corresponding author), Lab Mixte Tunisomarocain LMTM Physiol & Biotechn, Tunis, Tunisia.;Baslam, M (corresponding author), Niigata Univ, Fac Agr, Lab Biochem, Niigata, Japan.",mbaslam@gs.niigata-u.ac.jp; a.meddich@uca.ma,"ANLI, Mohamed/GPX-6509-2022; Mokhtar, Mohamed Ait El/AFD-0969-2022","ANLI, Mohamed/0000-0002-7028-709X; Mokhtar, Mohamed Ait El/0000-0001-8096-9927",Tuniso-Moroccan Mixed Laboratories (LMTM) of Plant Physiology and Biotechnology; Climate Change LPBV2C; FOSC project (Sus-Agri-CC) from the European Union [N862555]; JSPS KAKENHI [20K15425]; Niigata University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20K15425] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Tuniso-Moroccan Mixed Laboratories (LMTM) of Plant Physiology and Biotechnology; Climate Change LPBV2C; FOSC project (Sus-Agri-CC) from the European Union; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Niigata University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",The present study was supported by the Tuniso-Moroccan Mixed Laboratories (LMTM) of Plant Physiology and Biotechnology and Climate Change LPBV2C and FOSC project (Sus-Agri-CC) from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement N862555.

The increase in soil sealing and the occupation of areas prone to flooding have aggravated this problem. Due to this situation, municipal administrations, in collaboration with the concession holder for the supply of water and sewage services, Hidraqua Gestion Integral de Aguas de Levante SA, are committed a more efficient management of non-conventional water resources. An example of this can be found in the municipalities of Rojales, Daya Nueva, and San Fulgencio. These towns are located in the Bajo Segura region of the province of Alicante, where various initiatives have been implemented that break away from the traditional paradigm of rigid infrastructures. These initiatives include green spaces or areas, and sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) or nature-based solutions (NBS). This article presents various case studies. Firstly, in the town of Rojales, where several actions are being undertaken to improve the management of wastewater and rainwater and provide a solution to unauthorised dumping, as well as encouraging the use of reclaimed water with the creation of a recreational green area, El Recorral Park. Secondly, in the case of Daya Nueva, the Europa Park constitutes a recreational green area, Europa Park, facilitates runoff drainage by SUDS and NBS. Finally, the creation of a floodable pond in the municipality of San Fulgencio encourages the use of wastewater, thus avoiding the discharge of this non-conventional water resource into the sea. In addition, the pond facilitates the appropriate management of runoff water. The working method in this article has been twofold: firstly, bibliographical references have been consulted from other national and international areas; and secondly, the technical projects in the case studies have been analysed in detail. Several field trips have been made to the selected municipalities, accompanied by the technical personnel in charge of the execution of the projects, to examine the measures adopted. The results show that the implementation of these systems contributes to adapting to climate change and creates more resilient urban spaces.","[Sanchez-Almodovar, Esther] Univ Alicante, Interuniv Inst Geog, Water & Terr Res Grp, San Vicente Raspeig 03690, Spain; [Olcina-Cantos, Jorge] Univ Alicante, Dept Reg Geog Anal & Phys Geog, Climatol Lab, San Vicente Raspeig 03690, Spain; [Marti-Talavera, Javier] Univ Alicante, Interuniv Inst Geog, Climatol Lab, San Vicente Raspeig 03690, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat d'Alacant,"Sanchez-Almodovar, E (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Interuniv Inst Geog, Water & Terr Res Grp, San Vicente Raspeig 03690, Spain.",esther.sanchez@ua.es; jorge.olcina@ua.es; jmt25@alu.ua.es,"; Olcina, Jorge/H-2447-2015","Marti Talavera, Javier/0000-0002-1624-2843; Sanchez Almodovar, Esther/0000-0003-4201-0779; Olcina, Jorge/0000-0002-4846-8126",,,,,61,2,2,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JAN,2022,14,2,,,,,,,146,10.3390/w14020146,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14020146,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,YN3TI,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000747183200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Freshwater systems are subject to multiple stressors that include changing climate, changing land use, changing demands on water resources and changing nutrient cycles. Global trends suggest these stressors that impact on water availability will increase over the coming decades, and - without action - will constrain opportunities to sustain ecosystem services to deliver the Millennium Development Goals. 2. Although a key 'service' freshwaters provide is buffering inputs from the land system, predicting ecosystem response through observation and modelling is complex because nonlinear and dynamic interactions amongst a large number of constituents operate to regulate biogeochemical transformations in freshwater systems. 3. Reductionist approaches have been successful at unravelling many of the processes and some of the interactions in freshwater systems. However, reductionist approaches cannot provide the concepts or methods to understand how system properties will emerge in response to a changing climate (particularly the changing spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation); to the consequent change in water availability and water quality in the context of social drivers on the demand for water; and to feedbacks arising from nutrient cycling across a range of scales. 4. This study presents a review of the evidence for landscape-scale filtering of nutrient delivery to receiving waters and examines the role of the internal processing of nutrients at critical interfaces such as the hyporheic in attenuating nutrient loads. Analysis of research on the spatial scales and time step appropriate for catchment and water quality observations indicates the importance of small scale and short time step data for unravelling nutrient cycling in freshwater ecosystems. 5. Thematic implications: leading work in the catchment and aquatic sciences on the importance of diffuse nutrient losses from land, and on nutrient cycling in freshwaters, in governing water quality and protecting water availability, is making an increasing contribution to mainstream environmental science. Critically, the evidence base is starting to grow to inform policy-related debates with respect to food security, to climate change adaptation and for sustaining ecosystem services in freshwater environments.","Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Ctr Sustainable Water Management, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England",Lancaster University; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH),"Heathwaite, AL (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Ctr Sustainable Water Management, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.",louise.heathwaite@lancs.ac.uk,"Heathwaite, Ann Louise/F-7002-2014","Heathwaite, Ann Louise/0000-0001-8791-0039",Natural Environment Research Council [ceh010010] Funding Source: researchfish,Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,161,119,123,6,170,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Consequently, the potential for changes in climate across the design lifetime of built environments represents an immediate challenge for planning, design, and construction. In this study, we consider the opportunities to assess Climate Sensitivity and adaptive opportunities associated with green building practice. We developed a pair of complementary indicators called the Climate Sensitivity Index (CSI) and Climate Adaptation Opportunity Index (CAOI). These indicators are applied to evaluate individual strategies (credits) within the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED (TM)) for New Construction rating system. The indices provide two complementary scores for each strategy. The CSI reflects potential sensitivity to changing conditions (i.e., risks to performance outcomes), and the CAOI indicates potential adaptive opportunities (i.e., plausible strategies to adapt to changing conditions). We apply the indices to retrospectively examine the prevalence of potentially sensitive and adaptive practices among a global set of 2440 LEED-certified projects. Adaptive opportunities were more prevalent than sensitivities in the LEED-NC rating system. The CSI and CAOI indices illustrate how information can be derived by interpreting patterns of LEED credit achievement.

Climate-forced population displacement, including community relocation, will be one of the greatest climate adaptation challenges for Alaska Native communities and the tribal, state and federal governing entities responsible for protecting community residents and providing technical assistance and resources. A new governance framework, based in human rights principles, must be created that can allow institutions to shift their efforts from protecting people in the places where they live to creating a relocation process when environmental and social thresholds are surpassed. Determining which communities are most likely to encounter displacement will require a sophisticated assessment of a community's ecosystem vulnerability to climate change, as well as the vulnerability and adaptive capacity of its social, economic and political structures. In Alaska, understanding the rate of environmental change through the integration of indigenous knowledge with physical and social science is essential.

We examined associations between hospital admissions (all diagnoses) and local meteorological parameters in Southwestern Uganda, with the aim of supporting hospital planning and preparedness in the context of climate change. Methods: Hospital admissions data and meteorological data were collected from Bwindi Community Hospital and a satellite database of weather conditions, respectively (2011 to 2014). Descriptive statistics were used to describe admission patterns. A mixed-effects Poisson regression model was fitted to investigate associations between hospital admissions and season, precipitation, and temperature. Results: Admission counts were highest for acute respiratory infections, malaria, and acute gastrointestinal illness, which are climate-sensitive diseases. Hospital admissions were 1.16 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.31; p = 0.008) times higher during extreme high temperatures (i.e., >95th percentile) on the day of admission.

However, communicating and delivering adaption science across diverse stakeholder groups remain a significant challenge. We explore the utility of concepts from personality research to improve understanding of stakeholder capacity. Specifically, we defined eight potential climate-related personality 'axes' for natural resource management (NRM) organisations. We surveyed 80% of Australia's 56 regional NRM organisations to characterise their traits in relation to these axes. Through cluster analysis and trait mapping, we defined six NRM 'personality types'. These types were unrelated to external factors such as geographic location or land use activities. Rather, five organisational personality axes were important in defining personality type: where information is sourced, strategic skill sets for learning and reorganising, perceptions of risk and the ability to manage for uncertainty, perceptions of the role of NRM groups, and strategies for engagement. Identifying NRM personality type allows organisations to identify and capitalise on their strengths to target their adaptation efforts to maximise success. Organisations can also recognise what they might find most challenging and deliberately collaborate with other personalities with strengths in those areas. Finally, information providers can better understand how to tailor information delivery for improved knowledge exchange between research providers and organisations responsible for sustainability of natural resources, which enables stronger relationships and facilitates evidence-based decision-making.","[Hobday, Alistair J.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Hobday, Alistair J.; Cvitanovic, Christopher] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Doerr, Veronica A.

The rate of climate change and the scale and extent of its impacts on natural systems drive the need to re-evaluate current conservation objectives, from basic concept definitions, to overarching goals and values, to the way they are operationalized at all levels. We outline the case for reform of objectives in the legal framework for conservation and discuss three key strategies that would facilitate this transition: (1) acknowledgment in conservation law of system dynamism; (2) focus on ecosystem function, stability, and resilience; and (3) an explicit recognition that systems operate across multiple scales. Law reform is a slow process, but the potential of climate change to drive transformational changes means that urgent action is needed to overcome the limitations of current objectives and in the legal framework itself.","[McDonald, Jan; McCormack, Phillipa C.] Univ Tasmania, Fac Law, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [McDonald, Jan; Fleming, Aysha J.] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Fleming, Aysha J.] Univ Tasmania, CSIRO Land & Water, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Harris, Rebecca M.

The article reviews research on factors that are endemic to the context of CI use and that can influence whether use happens. It synthesizes factors that promote or impede use at three levels of social aggregation: the micro, meso, and macro levels. The organizing principle of the micro, meso, and macro levels enables a consideration of the nested social layers that comprise the context of CI use. The micro level consists of factors at the smallest level of social aggregation, individuals who use (or do not use) CI. The meso level consists of larger social aggregates, organizations, with leadership, decision-making processes, and technical and human capacity that influence CI use. Finally, the macro level is comprised of the political environment in which individuals and organizations operate, and which may be more or less supportive of CI use. Though the review is focused on the context of water management, the implications are much broader. A conceptual model is introduced to help explain how context shapes CI use. While the interactions between producers and users and the ways in which users see CI influence whether CI use happens, use only happens if elements in the micro, meso, and macro level contexts align to support use. That is, even when the best conditions for interactions between producers and users exist, these interactions alone may be insufficient in a context that stymies CI use, for political reasons or due to organizational dynamics. By attending to context, this new conceptual model shows where and how to strategically invest in supporting CI use.","[Flagg, Julia A.] Connecticut Coll, Sociol Dept, 270 Mohegan Ave, New London, CT 06320 USA; Connecticut Coll, Environm Studies Program, 270 Mohegan Ave, New London, CT 06320 USA; Univ Connecticut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 261 Glenbrook Rd,Unit 3037, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",Connecticut College; Connecticut College; University of Connecticut,"Flagg, JA (corresponding author), Connecticut Coll, Sociol Dept, 270 Mohegan Ave, New London, CT 06320 USA.",julia.flagg@conncoll.edu; christine.kirchhoff@uconn.edu,,"Kirchhoff, Christine/0000-0002-2686-6764",United States Department of Housing and Urban Development [16DPH1500NN],United States Department of Housing and Urban Development,This work was supported by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development [grant number 16DPH1500NN].,,59,21,21,0,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

Focused on local needs and priorities, these planning processes are raising tensions between more compact and dense urban form to reduce energy use and associated emissions and the provision of urban green infrastructure for ecosystem services and climate adaptation. In this study, we investigated the spatial distribution of green infrastructure at the neighbourhood scale in Sydney, Australia and examined how a mix of landscape types (pavement, bare soil/dry grass, green grass, and tree cover) affect temperature variation in three important locations for urban residents-around the home, in the roads and footpaths where people walk, and in parkland areas. Considering that residential and parkland areas contribute to the majority of green space in Sydney, it is important to understand how changes in landscape mix within these three neighbourhood areas will affect local temperature for urban residents. For residential houses, it was found that the percentage of tree canopy cover around the house had a significant negative relationship (p = 0.002) with surface temperatures of rooftops where greater tree cover led to lower rooftop temperatures. In streetscapes, both the percentage of tree cover (p < 0.0001) and the percentage of green grass (p < 0.0001) within the road segment had a significant negative relationship with the surface temperature of the road pavement. In the parks, the percentage of pavement (p < 0.0001) and the percentage of bare soil/dry grass (p < 0.0001) showed a significantly positive trend with land surface temperatures where greater land cover in the form of pavement and bare soil/dry grass led to higher temperatures. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of promoting or reducing certain landscape covers depending on the land use type in order to maximise the cooling potential of green infrastructure.","[Lin, Brenda B.] CSIRO Land & Water, PMB 1, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia; [Meyers, Jacqui; Beaty, R.

This article provides an overview of an ecosystem-based approach to integrated prawn-fish-rice farming in southwest Bangladesh. The practice of prawn and fish farming in rice fields is a form of integrated aquaculture-agriculture, which provides a wide range of social, economic and environmental benefits. Integrated prawn-fish-rice farming plays an important role in the economy of Bangladesh, earning foreign exchange and increasing food production. However, this unique farming system in coastal Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to climate change. We suggest that community-based adaptation strategies must be developed to cope with the challenges. We propose that integrated prawn-fish-rice farming could be relocated from the coastal region to less vulnerable inland areas, but caution that this will require appropriate adaptation strategies and an enabling institutional environment.","[Ahmed, Nesar] Bangladesh Agr Univ, Dept Fisheries Management, Mymensingh, Bangladesh; [Ahmed, Nesar] Univ S Australia, SA Water Ctr Water Management & Reuse, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Bunting, Stuart W.] Univ Essex, Sch Biol Sci, Essex Sustainabil Inst, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Rahman, Sanzidur] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Garforth, Christopher J.] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading, Berks, England",Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU); University of South Australia; University of Essex; University of Plymouth; University of Reading,"Bunting, SW (corresponding author), Univ Essex, Sch Biol Sci, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",swbunt@essex.ac.uk,"Rahman, Sanzidur/AAO-6993-2020","Rahman, Sanzidur/0000-0002-0391-6191; Bunting, Stuart/0000-0003-0151-7733; Ahmed, Nesar/0000-0003-4133-697X",British Council,British Council(The British Council in India),"This review is derived from a British Council sponsored INSPIRE (International Strategic Partnership in Research and Education) Exploratory Research Grant.

In this paper, we explore how collaborative climate hackathons coproduce local adaptation knowledge, and what this method reveals about local climate gover-nance. The data derives from two collaborative climate hackathons, called Klimathons, that attracted 73 and 98 par-ticipants in Bergen, Norway. The participants were practitioners and decision-makers from local, regional, and national institutions as well as researchers from natural and social climate sciences. The collaborative group work re-volved around the challenges and solutions of local adaptation planning and uncovered how a diversity of key actors understand the local adaptation work in Norway. These interventions revealed that there are significant disagreements and divergent understanding of relevant laws, regulations and responsibility between practitioners working within the same governance system. Though the cross-sectorial interaction does not dissolve these divergences, they allow actors to renegotiate boundaries between divergent knowledge communities. The Klimathons helped us navigate the com-plexity of local climate adaptation by shifting the focus to how different actors make sense of and work on adaptation and showing the intertwining and interdependence of potential drivers for adaptation.","[Kvamsas, Hanna; Neby, Simon; Stiller-Reeve, Mathew] NORCE Norwegian Res Ctr, POB 22 Nygardstangen, N-5838 Bergen, Norway; [Kvamsas, Hanna; Neby, Simon; Haarstad, Havard; Stiller-Reeve, Mathew; Schrage, Jesse] Univ Bergen, Ctr Climate & Energy Transformat CET, Fac Social Sci, POB 7802, N-5020 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian Research Centre (NORCE); University of Bergen,"Kvamsas, H (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Dept Geog, POB 7802, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",hanna.kvamsas@uib.no; simon.neby@uib.no; havard.haarstad@uib.no; mathew@stillerreeve.no; jesse.schrage@uib.no,,"Schrage, Jesse/0000-0002-7638-6347",Research Council of Norway and the Regional Research Fund of Western Norway,Research Council of Norway and the Regional Research Fund of Western Norway,"The authors gratefully acknowledge research funding from The Research Council of Norway and the Regional Research Fund of Western Norway.

V.",,,Long-Term Development Prospects of Russia's Wind Energy in the Conditions of Expected Climate Changes,THERMAL ENGINEERING,,,English,Article,,,,,,wind power; climate change; wind speed; climate scenarios,,"The climatic effect on the operation of wind power plants in Russia is analyzed. Based on the global experience of wind farms' operation, a quantitative assessment of the sensitivity of electric power generation by modern wind turbines to wind speed variation is carried out. Using the ensemble approach, predictive estimates of changes in the wind fields in Russia are obtained for the 21st century using the results of general atmospheric circulation models participating in the international project CMIP5 (Coupled Multimodel Intercomparison Project Phase 5). The validity of the findings is ensured by the validation procedure, including a comparison of different versions of the multimodel ensemble with data reanalysis. The predictive estimate obtained for the climatic scenario developed at the National Research University Moscow Power Engineering Institute (NRU MPEI) is compared with generally accepted climatic scenarios based on the use of so-called greenhouse gas representative concentration pathways. It is shown that the choice of the scenario has a significant impact on the forecast results. However, the data of the calculations distinguish several features of the wind regime in the 21st century, which are almost independent of the selected scenario or ensemble composition and, apparently, can be considered reliable. In particular, it is found that there is a possibility of some decrease in average wind speeds across Russia during the 21st century. However, in Primorskiy Kray, the expected climate change will lead to the formation of a zone with a steady increase in its speed. Changes in the technical wind potential in the regions of the country where the construction of wind turbines is planned will amount to from -15 to -20% for the subarctic regions and from +5 to +10% for Primorskiy Kray by the end of the 21st century. It follows from the calculations that the currently observed climate warming, in all likelihood, does not pose a serious threat to the development of wind energy in Russia. The modern and planned location of wind farms even makes it possible to expect some growth in their production rate in the first half of the 21st century. At the same time, the prospect of long-term changes in the wind regime should certainly be taken into account when selecting the wind farm location and predesign analysis as part of the measures aimed at adapting to climate changes.","[Klimenko, V.

Objectives: To investigate the evidence for an association between climatic factors and infectious diseases, and to identify the most climate-sensitive diseases and vulnerable populations in the Arctic and subarctic region. Methods: A systematic review was conducted. A search was made in PubMed, with the last update in May 2013. Inclusion criteria included human cases of infectious disease as outcome, climate or weather factor as exposure, and Arctic or subarctic areas as study origin. Narrative reviews, case reports, and projection studies were excluded. Abstracts and selected full texts were read and evaluated by two independent readers. A data collection sheet and an adjusted version of the SIGN methodology checklist were used to assess the quality grade of each article. Results: In total, 1953 abstracts were initially found, of which finally 29 articles were included. Almost half of the studies were carried out in Canada (n = 14), the rest from Sweden (n = 6), Finland (n = 4), Norway (n = 2), Russia (n = 2), and Alaska, US (n = 1). Articles were analyzed by disease group: food-and waterborne diseases, vector-borne diseases, airborne viral-and airborne bacterial diseases. Strong evidence was found in our review for an association between climatic factors and food-and waterborne diseases. The scientific evidence for a link between climate and specific vector-and rodent-borne diseases was weak due to that only a few diseases being addressed in more than one publication, although several articles were of very high quality. Air temperature and humidity seem to be important climatic factors to investigate further for viral-and bacterial airborne diseases, but from our results no conclusion about a causal relationship could be drawn. Conclusions: More studies of high quality are needed to investigate the adverse health impacts of weather and climatic factors in the Arctic and subarctic region. No studies from Greenland or Iceland were found, and only a few from Siberia and Alaska. Disease and syndromic surveillance should be part of climate change adaptation measures in the Arctic and subarctic regions, with monitoring of extreme weather events known to pose a risk for certain infectious diseases implemented at the community level.","[Hedlund, Christina; Blomstedt, Yulia; Schumann, Barbara] Umea Univ, Dept Publ Hlth & Clin Med, Ctr Global Hlth Res, Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Hedlund, C (corresponding author), Degernas 232, SE-90580 Umea, Sweden.",christina.hedlund@climi.umu.se,"Schumann, Barbara/ABD-4246-2020","Schumann, Barbara/0000-0002-9722-0370","FAS, the Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research [2006-1512]","FAS, the Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte))","Thanks to Wolfgang Lohr, Umea Centre for Global Health Research at Umea University, for creating and editing map 1.

However, its association with local hydrological conditions and the role of city development remain unclear. OBJECTIVE To quantify the association between hydrological conditions and dengue fever incidence in China and to explore the modification role of city development in this association. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study collected data between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2019, from 54 cities in 4 coastal provinces in southeast China. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was calculated from ambient temperature and precipitation, with SPEI thresholds of 2 for extreme wet conditions and -2 for extreme dry conditions. The SPEI-dengue fever incidence association was examined over a 6-month lag, and the modification roles of 5 city development dimensions were assessed. Data were analyzed in May 2022. EXPOSURES City-level monthly temperature, precipitation, SPEI, and annual city development indicators from 2013 to 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was city-level monthly dengue fever incidence. Spatiotemporal bayesian hierarchal models were used to examine the SPEI-dengue fever incidence association over a 6-month lag period. An interaction term between SPEI and each city development indicator was added into the model to assess the modification role of city development. RESULTS Included in the analysis were 70 006 dengue fever cases reported in 54 cities in 4 provinces in China from 2013 to 2019. Overall, a U-shaped cumulative curve was observed, with wet and dry conditions both associated with increased dengue fever risk. The relative risk [RR] peaked at a 1-month lag for extreme wet conditions (1.27; 95% credible interval [CrI], 1.05-1.53) and at a 6-month lag for extreme dry conditions (1.63; 95% CrI, 1.29-2.05). The RRs of extreme wet and dry conditions were greater in areas with limited economic development, health care resources, and income per capita. Extreme dry conditions were higher and prolonged in areas with more green space per capita (RR, 1.84; 95% CrI, 1.37-2.46). Highly urbanized areas had a higher risk of dengue fever after extreme wet conditions (RR, 1.80; 95% CrI, 1.26-2.56), while less urbanized areas had the highest risk of dengue fever in extreme dry conditions (RR, 1.70; 95% CrI, 1.11-2.60). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results of this study showed that extreme hydrological conditions were associated with increased dengue fever incidence within a 6-month lag period, with different dimensions of city development playing various modification roles in this association. These findings may help in developing climate change adaptation strategies and public health interventions against dengue fever.","[Li, Chuanxi; Yan, Yu; Qu, Yinan; Hou, Liangyu; Li, Yijie; Zhao, Qi; Ma, Wei] Shandong Univ, Cheeloo Coll Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Li, Chuanxi; Yan, Yu; Qu, Yinan; Hou, Liangyu; Li, Yijie; Liu, Qiyong; Zhao, Qi; Ma, Wei] Shandong Univ, Climate Change & Hlth Ctr, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhendong] Dezhou Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Dezhou, Peoples R China; [Chu, Cordia] Griffith Univ, Ctr Environm & Populat Hlth, Sch Med, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Woodward, Alistair] Univ Auckland, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Sch Populat Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Auckland, New Zealand; [Schikowski, Tamara; Zhao, Qi] IUF Leibniz Res Inst Environm Med, Dept Epidemiol, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Saldiva, Paulo Hilario Nascimento] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Liu, Qiyong] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Communicable Dis Control & Prevent, State Key Lab Infect Dis Prevent & Control, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qiyong] Shandong Univ, Cheeloo Coll Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Vector Control, Jinan, Peoples R China","Shandong University; Shandong University; Griffith University; University of Auckland; Leibniz Institut fur Umweltmedizinische Forschung (IUF); Universidade de Sao Paulo; Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention; National Institute for Communicable Disease Control & Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention; Shandong University","Zhao, Q; Ma, W (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Cheeloo Coll Med, Sch Publ Hlth, 44 W Wenhua Rd, Jinan 250012, Peoples R China.",qi.zhao@sdu.edu.cn; weima@sdu.edu.cn,,"Chu, Cordia/0000-0002-3683-5638",Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province in China [ZR2021QH318]; Shandong Excellent Young Scientists Fund Program (Overseas) [2022HWYQ-055]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [82073615]; State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control [2018SKLID302],Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province in China(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); Shandong Excellent Young Scientists Fund Program (Overseas); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control,Dr Zhao was funded by grant ZR2021QH318 from the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province in China and by grant 2022HWYQ-055 from the Shandong Excellent Young Scientists Fund Program (Overseas).

To elucidate the climatic adaptation of the house spider, Achaearanea tepidariorum, the photoperiodic response regulating diapause and the overwintering stage were compared between the 'temperate' Hirosaki and the 'subtropical' Okinawa strains. 2. Both strains could enter diapause in the nymphal and imaginal stages and photoperiod was a primary factor inducing it. In each strain, the critical photoperiod for diapause induction did not differ between nymphal and imaginal stages. There was, however, about 3h difference in the critical photoperiod between the two strains. It was longer in the temperate strain than in the subtropical strain. 3. The nymphal diapausing stadia also differed geographically; it was highly variable in the temperate strain, but was fixed at the final nymphal instar in the subtropical strain. In spite of the local difference in the diapausing stadia, all nymphal stadia and adults were found during winter in the field at both Hirosaki and Okinawa. 4. These observations suggest that the adaptive significance of diapause in the subtropical strain is to control the timing of reproduction, rather than to enhance the winter survival of the diapausing individual itself.",,,"TANAKA, K (corresponding author), HOKKAIDO UNIV,FAC AGR,APPL ZOOL LAB,SAPPORO,HOKKAIDO 060,JAPAN.",,,,,,,,0,12,14,0,6,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

It begins by arguing that both mitigation and adaptation are necessary parts of a coordinated policy response to the problem of climatic change, However, the 'problem structure' of adaptation is significantly different from that of mitigation. For instance, adaptation may generate private benefits that are likely to be experienced over the short term, relative to benefits associated with the impacts of mitigation actions which are public and experienced over the longer term. This divergence influences public policy rationales for adaptation and poses challenges for the integration of mitigation and adaptation in climate policies. Five key challenges facing climate adaptation are identified, and these are used as a basis for proposing rationales for policy action on climate adaptation. These relate to: information provision and research; early warning and disaster relief, facilitating adaptation options; regulating the distributional impacts of adaptation; and regulating infrastructures. The article concludes by arguing that the real integration problem for adaptation policy relates to how it is embedded in sectoral policies such as agriculture and transport, rather than how to achieve integration with mitigation policies.","Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Berkhout, F (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",frans.berkhout@ivm.vu.nl,"Berkhout, Frans/N-4196-2013","Berkhout, Frans/0000-0001-8668-0470",,,,,27,38,39,1,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

The approach involves health and wellbeing risk assessment supported through the use of an electronic tool. While climate change is a major foreseeable public health threat, the extent to which health services are prepared for, or able to adequately respond to, climate change impact-related risks remains unclear. Building health decision-support mechanisms in order to involve and empower local stakeholders to help create the basis for agreement on these adaptive actions is an important first step. The primary research question was 'What can be learned from pilot implementation of a community health and well-being risk assessment (CHWRA) information technology-based tool designed to support understanding of, and decision-making on, local community challenges and opportunities associated with health risks posed by climate change?' Methods: The article examines the complexity of climate change science to adaptation translational processes, with reference to existing research literature on community development. This is done in the context of addressing human health risks for rural and remote communities in Tasmania, Australia. This process is further examined through the pilot implementation of an electronic tool designed to support the translation of physically based climate change impact information into community-level assessments of health risks and adaptation priorities. The procedural and technical nature of the CHWRA tool is described, and the implications of the data gathered from stakeholder workshops held at three rural Tasmanian local government sites are considered and discussed. Results: Bushfire, depression and waterborne diseases were identified by community stakeholders as being potentially 'catastrophic' health effects 'likely' to 'almost certain' to occur at one or more Tasmanian rural sites-based on an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change style of assessment. Consensus statements from stakeholders also suggested concern with regard to managing the ways that climate change can multiply socioeconomic and health outcome inequality. Above all, stakeholder responses emphasised the importance of an applied, complexity-oriented understanding of how climate and climate change impacts affect local communities and local services to compromise the overall quality of human health in these communities. Conclusions: Complex community-level assessments about climate change and related health risks and responses can be captured electronically in ways that offer potentially actionable information about priorities for health sector adaptation, as a first step in planning. What is valuable about these community judgements is the creation of shared values and commitments. Future iteration of the IT tool could include decision-support modules to support best practice health sector adaptation scenarios, providing participants with opportunities to develop their know-how about health sector adaptation to climate change. If managed carefully, such tools could work within a balanced portfolio of measures to help reduce the rising health burden from climate change.","[Bell, E. J.; Turner, P.; Meinke, H.; Holbrook, N.

The burning of fossil fuels has increased the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere, amplifying the greenhouse effect in the last decades. In this scenario, the use of biorefineries, a renewable analog to petroleum refineries, has attracted a lot of attention since they use renewable sources as lignocellulosic feedstocks. However, climate change alters the temperature, rainfall patterns, drought, CO2 levels, and air moisture impacting biomass growth, productivity, chemical composition, and soil microbial community. Here, we discuss strategies to produce fuels and value-added products from biomass in a climate change scenario, potential feedstocks for bioenergy purposes, the chemical composition of lignocellulosic biomass, enzymes involved in biomass deconstruction, and other processes related to biomass production, processing, and conversion. Understanding these integrated factors involved in bioenergy production with plant responses to climate change shows that climate-smart agriculture is the only way to lower the negative impact of climate changes on crop adaptation and its use for bioenergy. The climate changes expected for the next decades will expose plants to increasing occurrences of combined abiotic stresses, including drought, higher temperatures, and elevated CO2 atmospheric concentrations. These abiotic stresses have significant consequences on photosynthesis and other plants' physiological processes and can lead to tolerance mechanisms that impact metabolism dynamics and limit plant productivity. Furthermore, due to the high carbohydrate content on the cell wall, plants represent a an essential source of lignocellulosic biomass for biofuels production. Thus, it is necessary to estimate their potential as feedstock for renewable energy production in future climate conditions since the synthesis of cell wall components seems to be affected by abiotic stresses. This review provides a brief overview of plant responses and the tolerance mechanisms applied in climate change scenarios that could impact its use as lignocellulosic biomass for bioenergy purposes. Important steps of biofuel production, which might influence the effects of climate change, besides biomass pretreatments and enzymatic biochemical conversions, are also discussed. We believe that this study may improve our understanding of the plant biological adaptations to combined abiotic stress and assist in the decision-making for selecting key agronomic crops that can be efficiently adapted to climate changes and applied in bioenergy production.","[Freitas, Emanuelle Neiverth de; Contato, Alex Graca; Polizeli, Maria de Lourdes T.

Landscape indicators are commonly used to delineate these relationships. However, most indicators were not developed on the basis of soil loss progresses, and therefore their specific relationships with soil loss are difficult to construct. We improved the Location-weighted landscape Contrast Index which was developed based on sediment source-sink theory. This indicator encompasses three factors of landscape pattern: contribution of land cover types to soil erosion: composition and configuration of land covers. To analyze correlations between the landscape indicator and soil loss processes, variables expressing soil loss status should be first quantified.Therefore we applied the sediment delivery distributed model which incorporates revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and sediment delivery ratio. The methods were applied in the Heishui and Zhenjiangguan subwatershed in the Upper Min River. Modeling results showed that 90% of the study area experienced soil erosion larger than 10 t/(ha yr). While its sediment yield rate was smaller than most tributaries in the Upper Yangtze River. Results of Pearson correlation analysis indicated that the rainfall factor in RUSLE was the dominant control and explained 93% of variance in sediment yield rate. We suggested preserving and increasing percentage cover of forests to adapt to climate change for soil conservation. Besides precipitation, landscape pattern was a principle factor correlated with sediment yield rate. The landscape indicator was significantly correlated to sediment delivery ratio, and explained 98% variation in sediment yield rate not considering precipitation by dropping the rainfall factor. The landscape indicator indicated that the landscape pattern was generally favorable for soil conservation in the two subwatersheds. This advantage was mainly ascribed to superior sediment sink-source compositions. In the Heishui subwatershed, however, sediment source contributed more to soil erosion processes than sink. Spatial configuration of sediment source and sink related to flow length were the most unfavorable factor, mainly due to the crops located in river vallyes. We gave suggestion to further optimize the landscape pattern: reducing percentage cover of grasslands with high soil erosion rate; decreasing soil erosion rate of sediment source in the Heishui subwatershed; increasing lengths of flow path from crops to river channels.

At present, a variety of models are widely used to predict irregular, nonlinear, and nonstationary carbon price series. However, these models ignore the importance of feature extraction and the inherent defects of using a single model; thus, accurate and stable prediction of carbon prices by relevant industry practitioners and the government is still a huge challenge. This research proposes an ensemble prediction system (EPS) that includes improved data feature extraction technology, three prediction submodels (GBiLSTM, CNN, and ELM), and a multiobjective optimization algorithm weighting strategy. At the same time, based on the best fitting distribution of the prediction error of the EPS, the carbon price prediction interval is constructed as a way to explore its uncertainty. More specifically, EPS integrates the advantages of various submodels and provides more accurate point prediction results; the distribution function based on point prediction error is used to establish the prediction interval of carbon prices and to mine and analyze the volatility characteristics of carbon prices. Numerical simulation of the historical data available for three carbon price markets is also conducted. The experimental results show that the ensemble prediction system can provide more effective and stable carbon price forecasting information and that it can provide valuable suggestions that enterprise managers and governments can use to improve the carbon price market.","[Yang, Yi] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Guo, Honggang; Jin, Yu; Song, Aiyi] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat, Dalian, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University; Dongbei University of Finance & Economics,"Guo, HG (corresponding author), Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat, Dalian, Peoples R China.",ghg970612@163.com,,,Major Project of the National Social Science Fund [17ZDA093],Major Project of the National Social Science Fund,Funding This work was supported by the Major Project of the National Social Science Fund (Grant No. 17ZDA093).,,42,2,2,19,76,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

With a focus on MSPs that seek to support adaptation among micro, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Kenya, we then investigate the extent to which this potential is being realised in practice, through interviews with partners engaged in the design and implementation of MSPs. This allows us to examine some of the opportunities, challenges and distributional risks that may result from employing MSPs to support adaptation. We find that through action and investment from donors and the public sector in areas such as research, data access, relationship building, training and capacity building, access to finance and business incubation, MSPs can enable a wide range of private sector actors to deliver adaptation resources to SMEs. Beneficiaries include small-scale SMEs in agricultural value chains in remote regions, that could otherwise fall outside of market inclusion. As such, respondents in this research typically considered MSPs to present an exciting opportunity to plug gaps in adaptation and development finance. Further analysis, however, suggests that dependence on market mechanisms for delivering adaptation resources means that MSPs risk excluding the poorest groups, exposing businesses to new risks and reproducing existing inequalities. Additionally, MSPs often remain heavily dependent on donor-led organisations for both resources and momentum. In Kenya, opportunities to develop more integrated responses to supporting the adaptive capacity of SMEs are being missed through a disconnect between the practice of MSPs and national public sector development frameworks and institutions.","[Gannon, Kate Elizabeth; Conway, Declan] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Crick, Florence] Int Inst Environm & Dev IIED, London, England; [Atela, Joanes] African Ctr Technol Studies ACT, Nairobi, Kenya",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Gannon, KE (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England.",k.e.gannon@lse.ac.uk,"Conway, Declan/HCH-7778-2022",,"Pathways to Resilience in Semi-arid Economies (PRISE) project under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA) programme; UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Ottawa, Canada [107643-004]; UK Research and Innovation's Global Challenges Research Fund (UKRI GCRF) through the Development Corridors Partnership project [ES/P011500/1]; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy [ES/K006576/1]","Pathways to Resilience in Semi-arid Economies (PRISE) project under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA) programme; UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Ottawa, Canada(CGIAR); UK Research and Innovation's Global Challenges Research Fund (UKRI GCRF) through the Development Corridors Partnership project; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","The authors acknowledge funding from the Pathways to Resilience in Semi-arid Economies (PRISE) project under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA) programme, with financial support from the UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID) and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Ottawa, Canada (grant reference: 107643-004).

Key among these are the nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which elaborate country-specific goals for mitigating and adapting to climate change. One role of the academic community and civil society in supporting the Paris Agreement is to assess the consistency between the near-term action under NDCs and the agreement's long-term goals, thereby providing insight into the chances of long-term success. Here we assess the strengths and weaknesses of current methods to estimate the effectiveness of the mitigation component of NDCs and identify the scientific and political advances that could be made to improve confidence in evaluating NDCs against the long-term goals. Specifically, we highlight (1) the influence of post-2030 assumptions on estimated 21st century warming, (2) uncertainties arising from the lack of published integrated assessment modeling scenarios with long-term, moderate effort reflecting a continuation of the current political situation, and (3) challenges in using a carbon budget approach. We further identify aspects that can be improved in the coming years: clearer communication regarding the meaning, likelihood, and timeframe of NDC consistent warming estimates; additional modeling of long-term, moderate action scenarios; and the identification of metrics for assessing progress that are not based solely on emissions, such as infrastructure investment, energy demand, or installed power capacity. Plain Language Summary Under the Paris Agreement, all countries came together to strengthen their commitment to limit warming to well below 2 degrees C and established an aim toward 1.5 degrees C. Each country also presented its own climate action plan, including a description of how it intends to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. A major challenge of the Paris Agreement is ensuring that, when combined, the individual actions of countries are sufficient to achieve the collective long-term goals. In this study, we review the methods used so far to evaluate the sufficiency of the climate action plans and examine how those methods can be improved. A significant difference between current methods is in the assumption of how countries' efforts to reduce emissions will change after the current timeframe of planned action (until 2030)-will it be weaker, stronger, or similar? Some methods are more complex and help to identify opportunities for additional action, while others are better at providing a quick estimate of the warming we can currently expect. We conclude that combining some of the methods we reviewed, modeling of scenarios similar to the current situation, and some clarification in communication would provide a better assessment of collective progress toward the Paris Agreement goals.","[Jeffery, M.

It also examines the change of directions, forms and tools of the Transcarpathian interrelations with neighboring regions during the second half of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st centuries. It is determined that the main areas of cross-bonier cooperation with the participation of Transcarpathia are such: forestry activities, tourism, transboundary ecological-economic cooperation, development of local culture and preservation of historical heritage; environment protection, mitigation and adaptation to climate change; improving the access to the regions, developing sustainable and climate friendly transport and communications networks and systems; common challenges in the field of security and protection, growth of population welfare of the border areas, activation of foreign economic relations, etc. The main organizational forms of cross-bonier cooperation include: clusters, urban agglomerations, regional networks, transport corridors, interregional industrial alliances, interregional business associations, interregional corporation, regional agreements and projects, Euroregions, etc. The article points out that the most promising direction of activation of foreign economic relations in the studied territory is the expansion of the network of cross-bonier tourist clusters in the Ukrainian-Slovak, Ukrainian-Hungarian, Ukrainian-Romanian and Ukrainian-Polish transboundary regions. One of such projects may be a tourist cluster covering the Transcarpathian region of Ukraine and the bothering areas. The main problems of further development of cross-border cooperation with the participation of Transcarpathia are identified, namely: insufficient institutional and legal support of the system of cross-bonier cooperation of Ukrainian regions; excessive centralization of foreign economic activity, restrictions that do not allow local self-government bodies to carry out the necessary volume of international economic relations; poor quality of service of the border traffic due to inconsistency of the design capacity of the international automobile check points with actual indicators and their congestion; insufficient investment climate of the bonier regions of Ukraine; ineffective use of grants; somewhat limited and poorly developed trunk-burden infrastructure, which is a major complication in trade with Ukraine, etc. Along with the economic and legal barriers of cross-bother cooperation, public barriers are important, particularly, negative historical experience, lack of entrepreneurial psychological readiness for business cooperation, mental differences, language barriers, lack of regional cross-border conscience, fear of losing identity, population expectations with regard to the practical results of cross-border cooperation is often not justified.

Feed resources, the primary determinant of productivity, are most important, but are constrained to drive the supply of animal proteins. Currently the scenario is challenged by at least four defining factors: (i) the need for more food and productivity growth, (ii) rampant poverty and malnutrition, (iii) inefficient use of natural resources, and (iv) the effects of climate change. A fifth critical factor is underutilisation of productivity-enhancing technologies, adoption, replication and intensification that link production with post-production in supply value and food chains. Serious doubts have been raised about the capacity and resource efficiency to expand food production. With ruminants, the doubts are reflected in low productivity and inadequate supplies of animal proteins, meat and milk to meet current and projected human demands. Ensuring efficient feed utilisation and production systems are thus central to innovative strategies and pathways are necessary to accelerate productivity and also cope with climate change. Current trend in research on feeds is testing the component technologies. The traditional research-farmer-extension model for technology delivery is unacceptable, due to the top down prescriptions, inappropriate production systems, complex interactions of the natural resources, doubtful technical capacity of the extension personnel, and inability to respond quickly to farmers' needs. Transformation is necessary and is determined by (i) intensive use of new technologies that are adapted to climate change, (ii) empowering farmers into agents of poverty reduction and stewards of the environment, and (iii) when there is community-based participation in economic activities and expansion. Ruminants can be the entry point for the development of LFAs. The limited availability of feeds in small farm systems enables the development of low input systems and cost-effective increased productivity. That forms the backbone of about 470 million mainly mixed small farms in Asian agriculture. They provide jobs for about 60% of the working population, and account for 50-90% of Asia's total food production. The opportunities for technology-induced feed-based productivity gains in economic production systems, policy framework, rigorous R&D, investments, and multinational engagement for improving livelihoods are most challenging. Small farmers and the landless have an enduring dream of well-fed animals, sustained food security, reduced poverty, assured survival, and ability to cope with climate change in harmony with agricultural landscapes and self-reliance. These goals are achievable, provided there is collective will to serve and vision to provide direction and lead the way.",,,"Devendra, C (corresponding author), 130A Jalan Awan Jawa, Kuala Lumpur 58200, Malaysia.",cdev@pc.jaring.my,,,,,,,75,0,0,0,24,ANIMAL NUTRITION ASSOC,IZATNAGAR,"IVRI, IZATNAGAR, 243 122, INDIA",0972-2963,0974-181X,,ANIM NUTR FEED TECHN,Anim.

Much of this influence, this article argues, has come from China forging a path for climate adaptation and mitigation for the global South. This is having far-reaching consequences, the article further argues, for the politics of global climate governance. China's discursive and diplomatic power in climate politics is growing as China builds alliances across the global South. China is leveraging this enhanced soft power to elevate the importance of adaptation in multilateral climate negotiations, advance a technocentric approach to climate mitigation, export its development model, and promote industrial-scale afforestation as a nature-based climate solution. China's strategy is enhancing climate financing, technology transfers, renewable power, and adaptation infrastructure across the global South. To some extent, this is helping with a transition to a lowcarbon world economy. Yet China's leadership is also reinforcing incremental, technocratic, and growthoriented solutions in global climate governance. These findings advance the understanding of China's role in global environmental politics, especially its growing influence on climate governance in the global South.","[Qi, Jianfeng Jeffrey; Dauvergne, Peter] Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, C425-1866 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Dauvergne, P (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, C425-1866 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",peter.dauvergne@ubc.ca,,"Dauvergne, Peter/0000-0003-2887-8168",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [435-2014-0115],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work was supported by a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (Grant No. 435-2014-0115).,,170,5,5,26,34,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

One way to enhance SOC stocks is to increase carbon (C) inputs to the soil. In this study, we assessed the amount of organic C inputs that are necessary to reach a target of SOC stocks increase by 4 parts per thousand yr(-1) on average, for 30 years, at 14 long-term agricultural sites in Europe. We used the Century model to simulate SOC stocks and assessed the required level of additional C inputs to reach the 4 per 1000 target at these sites. Then, we analyzed how this would change under future scenarios of temperature increase. Initial stocks were simulated assuming steady state. We compared modeled C inputs to different treatments of additional C used on the experimental sites (exogenous organic matter addition and one treatment with different crop rotations). The model was calibrated to fit the control plots, i.e. conventional management without additional C inputs from exogenous organic matter or changes in crop rotations, and was able to reproduce the SOC stock dynamics. We found that, on average among the selected experimental sites, annual C inputs will have to increase by 43.15 +/- 5.05 %, which is 0.66 +/- 0.23 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (mean +/- standard error), with respect to the initial C inputs in the control treatment. The simulated amount of C input required to reach the 4 %0 SOC increase was lower than or similar to the amount of C input actually used in the majority of the additional C input treatments of the long-term experiments. However, Century might be overestimating the effect of additional C inputs on SOC stocks. At the experimental sites, we found that treatments with additional C inputs were increasing by 0.25 % on average. This means that the C inputs required to reach the 4 per 1000 target might actually be much higher. Furthermore, we estimated that annual C inputs will have to increase even more due to climate warming, that is 54 % more and 120 % more for a 1 and 5 degrees C warming, respectively. We showed that modeled C inputs required to reach the target depended linearly on the initial SOC stocks, raising concern on the feasibility of the 4 per 1000 objective in soils with a higher potential contribution to C sequestration, that is soils with high SOC stocks. Our work highlights the challenge of increasing SOC stocks at a large scale and in a future with a warmer climate.","[Bruni, Elisa; Guenet, Bertrand; Ciais, Philippe] Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, LSCE IPSL, CEA,CNRS,UVSQ, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Guenet, Bertrand] PSL Univ IPSL, Ecole Normale Super, CNRS, LG ENS,Lab Geol,UMR 8538, F-75005 Paris, France; [Huang, Yuanyuan] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia; [Clivot, Hugues] Univ Lorraine, INRAE, LAE, F-68000 Colmar, France; [Clivot, Hugues] Univ Reims, INRAE, FARE, UMR A 614, F-51097 Reims, France; [Virto, Inigo] Univ Publ Navarra, IS FOOD, Dept Ciencias, Pamplona 31009, Spain; [Farina, Roberta] CREA Council Agr Res & Econ, Res Ctr Agr & Environm, I-00198 Rome, Italy; [Katterer, Thomas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Box 7044, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Martin, Manuel] INRA Orleans, InfoSolUnit, Orleans, France; [Chenu, Claire] Univ Paris Saclay, INRA AgroParisTech, Ecosys, Campus AgroParisTech, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); INRAE; Universite de Lorraine; INRAE; Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne; Universidad Publica de Navarra; Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; INRAE; AgroParisTech; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Bruni, E (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, LSCE IPSL, CEA,CNRS,UVSQ, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",elisa.bruni@lsce.ipsl.fr,"Virto, Inigo/L-9915-2015; Guenet, Bertrand/ABD-5907-2021; Kätterer, Thomas/L-2107-2013","Virto, Inigo/0000-0002-7682-4570; Guenet, Bertrand/0000-0002-4311-8645; Kätterer, Thomas/0000-0002-1751-007X; Huang, Yuanyuan/0000-0003-4202-8071; Clivot, Hugues/0000-0002-5723-6925; FARINA, ROBERTA/0000-0003-4378-0484; Bruni, Elisa/0000-0001-8074-0516",ANR under the Investissements d'avenir program (CLAND project) [ANR-16-CONV-0003],ANR under the Investissements d'avenir program (CLAND project)(French National Research Agency (ANR)),This work benefited from French state aid managed by the ANR under the Investissements d'avenir program (CLAND project (grant no.

Fringe areas, which are more suitable to change in a medium-short time frame, were determined through a spatial multicriteria decision analysis (S-MCDA) process. Three land use changes scenarios were identified and analysed, namely: the current situation, energy crop cultivation in marginal lands, and the possible abandonment of lands such as these. Energy crop cultivation in marginal lands is widely considered to be a useful opportunity for farmers, against the progressive risk of under-utilization or abandonment; nevertheless, the large areas needed can cause important environmental side-effects. In order to assess the possible variations in environmental components in the ex-ante planning phase, scenarios were assessed in terms of habitat and biodiversity ecosystems services (using both monetary and indexes approach), focusing also on possible environmental fragmentation analysis by means of landscape metrics, which are simple measures used to deepen landscape configuration and structure. The S-MCDA process allowed about 10% of the study area with less favourable environmental conditions to be defined, where land use change is desirable in a medium-short time frame. For the energy crops scenario, the ecosystem services (ESs) approach highlights positive repercussions in terms of habitat quality and biodiversity value. Similar trends are highlighted by different ESs assessment methods adopted (monetary and indexes), confirming themselves. Also, landscape pattern analysis confirmed positive habitat connectivity trends: the delineation of fringe areas has preserved, in energy crops scenario, natural and semi-natural classes, reducing the risk of disturbance with respect to the biodiversity and habitat. This condition assumes that adopted S-MCDA method can contribute positively and significantly to the definition of LUC scenarios and land management. In conclusion, marginal lands can become an opportunity to improve socio-economic conditions and to enhance land image, while respecting the environment. LUC scenarios building, and their assessment by means of ecological indicators become a dynamic and structured tool in the land use planning/management process to support decision maker choices and to re-calibrate interventions, with the aim of contributing to sustainable policies of land management (ecological corridors, compensation and / or mitigation measures, etc.), emphasizing land sustainable management benefits (such as climate change adaptation or disaster risk reduction).","[Cervelli, Elena; di Perta, Ester Scotto; Pindozzi, Stefania] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, Portici, NA, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Pindozzi, S (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, Portici, NA, Italy.",stefania.pindozzi@unina.it,"di Perta, Ester Scotto/AAM-7067-2020; Pindozzi, Stefania/P-7478-2019; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","di Perta, Ester Scotto/0000-0003-1174-8607; Pindozzi, Stefania/0000-0001-9301-7984; Cervelli, Elena/0000-0003-3218-3641","Vesuvio National Park; Campania Region, Italy [B42D18000320007]","Vesuvio National Park; Campania Region, Italy(Regione Campania)","This paper was supported by the Vesuvio National Park (under the Agreement between Vesuvius National Park and University of Naples Federico II, Italy, 2018), and by the Rural Development Program for 2014 - 2020 of Campania Region, Italy, under the Project RiAGRI-Sele (grant ID B42D18000320007, 2018).

An open field experiment and a temperature gradient field chamber experiment were performed to obtain model coefficients for South Korea and to assess the performance of CERES-barley under elevated temperature conditions. Projected barley yield data were further used to establish a new landscape classification system to provide agricultural policymakers with useful information on coping with climate change. Expected yields of four barley cultivars for the whole nation showed moderate increases under representative concentration pathways 4.5 and rapid increases under representative concentration pathways 8.5. More differences in yield were observed between different geospatial regions. Based on k-means clustering and the impact of climate change on barley yield, regional characteristics of the whole country could be classified into six categories.

Bridging organizations help align stakeholder and local perspectives and mediate communication that shapes adaptation responses. We argue that a first step for adaptation projects is to determine the nature of the climate norms and how climate is changing. This paper explores the degree to which development organizations in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania used analysis of local historical climate information in project aims, planning and design. This included 67 participants, managing 102 community-level climate-related agricultural projects, and three NGO case studies. Most focused on low-regret options. The majority of projects enhanced awareness of climate change and variability, but only 7% had used historical climate information during planning. Instead, projects relied on general knowledge or farmers' perceptions, which sometimes differ from analyzed historical climate information, potentially leading reinforcement of perceptions. It is vital that bridging organizations and policy makers value analyzed historical climate information when determining climate norms (including variability) and identify what data shows regarding how climate is changing. This is essential for planning with stakeholders the suitability of alternative crops and cultivars and ensuring other relevant environmental factors influencing agricultural production are considered.","[Dorward, Peter; Osbahr, Henny] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, POB 237, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England; [Sutcliffe, Chloe] Cranfield Univ, Sch Water Energy & Environm, Cranfield, Beds, England; [Mbeche, Robert] Jomo Kenyatta Univ Agr & Technol, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Reading; Cranfield University; Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture & Technology,"Dorward, P (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, POB 237, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England.",p.t.dorward@reading.ac.uk,"Sutcliffe, Chloe/GWC-6886-2022; Sutcliffe, Chloe/GZG-3359-2022","Sutcliffe, Chloe/0000-0002-8035-1964; Sutcliffe, Chloe/0000-0002-8035-1964; MBECHE, Robert/0000-0002-0160-037X; Osbahr, Henny/0000-0002-0130-2313",Rockefeller Foundation [CLI 314/CSD 202]; Rockefeller Foundation Climate Change Units in East,Rockefeller Foundation; Rockefeller Foundation Climate Change Units in East,"The authors would like to acknowledge support from the Rockefeller Foundation [grant number CLI 314/CSD 202] for the project 'Supporting the Rockefeller Foundation Climate Change Units in East and Central Africa', as well as support from Dr Cristina Rumbaitis del Rio, Dr John Gathenya, Professor Roger Stern and Dr Maria Noguer in the development of this research.",,42,13,13,4,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Findings from community consultations across 16 communities in these settings demonstrate the critical role of endogenous modes of resilience, as well as the strong correlation between these spaces and sub-city climate vulnerability. Cross-scale integration with climate resilience planning processes is then used to examine points of conflict between stakeholder interpretations of core functions within socioecological systems, demonstrating the importance of considering values and conflict within urban climate adaptation.","[Trundle, Alexei] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sustainable Soc Inst, Melbourne Sch Design, Level 3,Bldg 133,Masson Rd, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Barth, Bernhard] UN Habitats Reg Off Asia & Pacific, Fukuoka, Japan; [Barth, Bernhard] UN ESCAP, Bangkok, Thailand; [McEvoy, Darryn] RMIT Univ, Urban Resilience & Climate Change Adaptat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Trundle, A (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sustainable Soc Inst, Melbourne Sch Design, Level 3,Bldg 133,Masson Rd, Parkville, Vic, Australia.",alexei.trundle@unimelb.edu.au; bernhard.barth@un.org; Darryn.McEvoy@rmit.edu.au,"Trundle, Alexei/D-5762-2018","Trundle, Alexei/0000-0002-7076-4626",,,,,55,26,26,5,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,1746-0301,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

Although there is an increasing proliferation of studies on adaptation strategies of cocoa farmers, many of the studies are not linked to climate services that provide information to help ensure climate smart decision-making among cocoa farmers. This study investigates the perception and adaptation strategies of cocoa farmers to draw insights into climate services necessary for adaptation. Through a semi-structured questionnaire survey of 150 cocoa farming households and Focus Group Discussions, the study found that key adaptation strategies include changing planting dates, diversification to non-farm activities, planting improved cocoa varieties, crop diversification, and tree planting. Age and information seeking behaviour of farmers have positive influence on access to climate services which serves as a basis for these adaptation strategies. The existing climate services are not comprehensive enough to cover the wide array of adaptation needs of farmers. Current services focus on only dissemination of rainfall and temperature information through radio and television without providing information on other adaptation needs such as planning and harvesting dates.

Adaptation measures are required to reduce the loss of sites, monuments and remains. However, little research has been directed towards understanding potential impacts of climate adaptation measures in other governmental sectors on cultural heritage. We provide a case study demonstrating that winter road salt, used to reduce ice related accidents, damages historical iron milestones. As the climate warms, road salt use will move north into areas where sites have been protected by contiguous winter snow cover. This will expose Artic/sub-Arctic cultural heritage, including Viking graves and Sami sites, to a new anthropogenic source of damage.

This signifies a shift in the framing of climate change from asking what its potential impacts are to asking whether it induces policy failure and unacceptable change. In this paper, we explore the background, feasibility, and consequences of this new framing. We focus on the specific situation in which a social-political threshold of concern is likely to be exceeded as a result of climate change, requiring consideration of alternative strategies. Action is imperative when such a situation is conceivable, and at this point climate change becomes particularly relevant to decision makers. We call this situation an adaptation turning point. The assessment of adaptation turning points converts uncertainty surrounding the extent of a climate impact into a time range over which it is likely that specific thresholds will be exceeded. This can then be used to take adaptive action. Despite the difficulty in identifying adaptation turning points and the relative newness of the approach, experience so far suggests that the assessment generates a meaningful dialogue between stakeholders and scientists. Discussion revolves around the amount of change that is acceptable; how likely it is that unacceptable, or more favorable, conditions will be reached; and the adaptation pathways that need to be considered under these circumstances. Defining and renegotiating policy objectives under climate change are important topics in the governance of adaptation.","[Werners, Saskia Elisabeth; van Slobbe, Erik] Wageningen UR, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Bolscher, Tobias] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Oost, Albert] Deltares, Delft, Netherlands; [Pfenninger, Stefan] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Trombi, Giacomo; Bindi, Marco] Univ Florence, Dept Agri Food Prod & Environm Sci DISPAA, I-50121 Florence, Italy; [Moriondo, Marco] CNR IBIMET, Florence, Italy",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Deltares; Imperial College London; University of Florence; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Biometeorologia (IBIMET-CNR),"Werners, SE (corresponding author), Wageningen UR, Wageningen, Netherlands.",,"bindi, marco/M-6415-2014; Moriondo, Marco/H-5279-2019","bindi, marco/0000-0002-8968-954X; Moriondo, Marco/0000-0002-8356-7517; werners, saskia/0000-0002-1705-4318; Pfenninger, Stefan/0000-0002-8420-9498; Trombi, Giacomo/0000-0002-3775-272X; van Slobbe, Erik/0000-0003-0499-2281; Bolscher, Tobias/0000-0001-5305-0616",European Commission through research project MEDIATION; Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs,"European Commission through research project MEDIATION; Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs(Ministry of Economic Affairs, Netherlands)","Work on this paper has been kindly supported by a grant from the European Commission through the research project MEDIATION and from the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs.

This paper critically discusses the modification and application of one particular participatory approach to agricultural systems analysis (Rapid Appraisal of Agricultural Innovation Systems [RAAIS]) to agricultural adaptation in Southeast Kazakhstan. We consider the overall effectiveness of the method as a research tool, practical issues in the implementation of workshops, definition of and selection of participant groups, as well as the questions of participation and empowerment within the workshops themselves. We find that although RAAIS is adaptable to alternative theoretical frameworks, its implementation in different socio-cultural and political contexts may require more consideration than is apparent in previous discussions. In particular, the appropriate training of workshop organisers is of crucial importance to the success of this methodology. These findings will be useful to those adapting participatory research methods to different research topics and contexts more broadly. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Study Focus: This study aims to assess future glacio-hydrological changes in a small basin and their impacts on the operation of two Small Hydropower Projects (SHP) with contrasting hydrological requirements. The Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model is used to integrate cryosphere, hydrology and hydropower production modelling in the 21st century using climate changes projected by the ensembles of five global climate models under RCP 4.5 and 8.5. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: The total streamflow in the future is projected to have widespread uncertainty in the magnitude but shows noticeable changes in the seasonality. Of the two SHPs, the one utilizing high flows with low hydraulic head shows a power generation behaviour similar to streamflow projections. Its annual hydropower production is projected to change by 2 to 21% (RCP4.5) and -5 to 40% (RCP8.5) by the end of the century. The other plant that uses lesser flows but high head maintains its designed power production consistently throughout the century. The study indicates that the design of hydropower plants strongly influences their sensitivity to future climate and thus provides important insights into the climate-adaptive designs and planning of future hydropower projects in Himalaya.","[Shirsat, Tejal S.; Kulkarni, Anil, V] Indian Inst Sci, Divecha Ctr Climate Change, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; [Momblanch, Andrea; Holman, Ian P.] Cranfield Univ, Coll Rd, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England; [Randhawa, S.

Survey data gathered from 2010 to 2019 of a representative sample of United States residents (N = 22,468) document greater increases in worry about climate change and, to a lesser degree, anger and guilt about climate change, within the two youngest generations relative to changes among Generation X, Baby Boomers, and the Silent and Greatest Generations. Although generational differences were small and suggest overstatements of unique effects for younger generations, increases in younger generations' emotions transform into the two youngest generations reporting the strongest emotions in 2019.

Governments have access to a diverse array of instruments that can be employed to adapt their operations and influence the behaviour of individuals, organizations, and other governments. However, the choice of policy instrument is political, because it affects the distribution of benefits and costs, and entrenches institutional procedures and resources that are difficult to redeploy. This article identifies four key governing resources that governments employ in the service of adaptation and analyses these resources using criteria drawn from the policy studies literature. For each category, specific policy instruments are described, and examples are provided to illustrate how they have been used in particular jurisdictions. The article also discusses instrument selection, focusing on trade-offs among the instrument attributes, processes for setting the stage for instrument choice, jurisdictional constraints on instrument selection, and ways to avoid negative vertical and horizontal policy interplay. Policy relevance Adaptation is a nascent field of public policy, and courses of action to reduce vulnerability and build adaptive capacity are in their infancy. This article contributes to policy development and analysis by identifying the range of policy instruments available to governments and analysing concrete ways in which they are employed to implement adaptation policy objectives. Taking stock of these adaptation tools and comparing their behavioural assumptions and attributes helps to illuminate potential policy options, and to evaluate their technical viability, political acceptability, and economic feasibility. Providing examples of how these instruments have been implemented successfully in other jurisdictions offers ideas and lessons for public officials.","[Henstra, Daniel] Univ Waterloo, Dept Polit Sci, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Henstra, D (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Polit Sci, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",dhenstra@uwaterloo.ca,,"Henstra, Daniel/0000-0003-0224-9152",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work was supported by an Insight Development Grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.,,125,66,67,12,85,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Chloride ingress leads to corrosion initiation and its interaction with service loading could reduce its operational life. Chloride ingress and corrosion propagation are highly influenced by weather conditions in the surrounding environment including climate change. Therefore, both structural design and maintenance should be adapted to these new environmental conditions. This study focuses on the assessment of the costs and benefits of climate adaptation strategies for existing RC structures subjected to chloride ingress and climate change. We studied RC structures built at different periods under different construction standards in France. The cost-effectiveness of adaptation measures was measured in terms of the benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR) and the probability that BCR exceeds unity - i.e. Pr(BCR > 1). The results of the paper could provide practical advice to policy-makers to improve the management of existing RC structures under a changing climate by discussing the influence of the following factors on the mean BCR and Pr(BCR > 1): specific exposure conditions, climate change scenarios, risk reduction due to the implementation of adaptation strategies, type of structural component, years of construction and adaptation, discount rates and damage costs.","[Bastidas-Arteaga, Emilio] Univ Nantes, Sea & Littoral Res Inst, Ecole Cent Nantes,UMR 6183,FR 3473, Inst Res Civil & Mech Engn GeM,LUNAM Univ,CNRS, Rue Houssiniere BP 92208, F-44322 Nantes 3, France; [Stewart, Mark G.] Univ Newcastle, Ctr Infrastruct Performance & Reliabil, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Nantes Universite; Ecole Centrale de Nantes; University of Newcastle,"Bastidas-Arteaga, E (corresponding author), Univ Nantes, Sea & Littoral Res Inst, Ecole Cent Nantes,UMR 6183,FR 3473, Inst Res Civil & Mech Engn GeM,LUNAM Univ,CNRS, Rue Houssiniere BP 92208, F-44322 Nantes 3, France.",emilio.bastidas@univ-nantes.fr; mark.stewart@newcastle.edu.au,"Bastidas-Arteaga, Emilio/A-6090-2012","Bastidas-Arteaga, Emilio/0000-0002-7370-5218; Stewart, Mark/0000-0001-6887-6533",project PHC Fasic [30490UL]; project CAEx (Climate Adaptation Engineering for Extreme Events Cluster); 'Pays de la Loire' region through the project RI-ADAPTCLIM 'International Network on Risk Assessment and Climate Adaptation for Infrastructure and Buildings',project PHC Fasic; project CAEx (Climate Adaptation Engineering for Extreme Events Cluster); 'Pays de la Loire' region through the project RI-ADAPTCLIM 'International Network on Risk Assessment and Climate Adaptation for Infrastructure and Buildings'(Region Pays de la Loire),"The support of the projects PHC Fasic 2013 (30490UL), and CAEx (Climate Adaptation Engineering for Extreme Events Cluster) for funding the position of Visiting Fellow (first author) is gratefully acknowledged.

Using discrete choice analysis and a cross section of farms from Israel, we test whether these decisions are sensitive to climate and find that they are. In the case of Israel, the farmers completely substitute capital for climate. Simulating increase in temperature suggests that warming would lead Israeli farmers to shift mainly to orchards under cover and irrigation.

While being considered as particularly vulnerable, many coastal communities, nevertheless, have long traditions of living not only by but with the sea. If such ecotones. places where ecosystems intersect. have features distinct from purely continental regions, the question is how life with the shore translates into adaptability towards environmental change. Life at the shore shapes emergent social relationships, local traditions, and collective memory. At the same time, issues such as tourism development, demographic change, and national and international administrations influence how environmental challenges in coastal areas are addressed. In this paper, I analyse how place-specific social structures and conflicting influences in ecotones affect adaptability to sea-level rise in coastal areas.

The main aim was to analyze the timing and origin of inorganic N loading and the effectiveness of different water protection methods. Predicted changes in precipitation and temperature increases the nutrient load from catchments to water bodies in future climate. The total inorganic N load from the forested Simojoki river basin located in northern Finland was about 5% of that from the Loimijoki river basin in south western Finland. In the Loimijoki river basin agriculture dominated inorganic N loading. When applying realistic water protection methods (limits on manure spreading) the simulated inorganic N load from the river basin decreased by 11%. With more drastic methods (no manure spreading + catch crop) a decrease up to 34% was achieved. In the Simojoki river basin there were several equally significant sources, so suitable combinations of different water protection measures would be the most efficient way to decrease the inorganic N load. As the inorganic N load may be composed of very different sources, depending on land use in the river basin, efficient allocation of water protection measures requires detailed analysis of different sources of loading.","[Rankinen, Katri; Kenttamies, Kaarle] Finnish Environm Inst, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland; [Valpasvuo-Jaatinen, Pirkko; Karhunen, Anni] W Finland Reg Environm Ctr, FI-20801 Turku, Finland; [Nenonen, Suvi] Lapland Reg Environm Ctr, FI-96101 Rovaniemi, Finland; [Baerlund, Ilona] Univ Kassel, Ctr Environm Syst Res, D-34125 Kassel, Germany",Finnish Environment Institute; Universitat Kassel,"Rankinen, K (corresponding author), Finnish Environm Inst, POB 140, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland.",katri.rankinen@ymparisto.fi,,"Rankinen, Katri/0000-0001-8744-1420","Academy of Finland, Baltic Sea Research Programme [202421]; Commission of the European Union [LIFELIFE02/NAT/FIN/8465]; Euro-limpacs [GOCE-CT-2003-505540]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [202421] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)","Academy of Finland, Baltic Sea Research Programme(Academy of Finland); Commission of the European Union(European Commission); Euro-limpacs(European Commission); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Academy of FinlandFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES))","The authors would like to thank the Academy of Finland, Baltic Sea Research Programme (project NUTRIBA, contract 202421) for financing the study.

However, existing research shows that individual engagement with adaptation is low. One contributing factor to this might be that public discourses on climate change often seems dominated by overly negative and seemingly pre-determined visions of the future. Futures thinking intends to counter this by re-presenting the future as choice contingent and inclusive of other possible and preferable outcomes. Here, we undertook storytelling workshops with participants from the West Yorkshire region of the U.K. They were asked to write fictional adaptation futures stories which: opened by detailing their imagined story world, moved to events that disrupted those worlds, provided a description of who responded and how and closed with outcomes and learnings from the experience. We found that many of the stories envisioned adaptation as a here-and-now phenomenon, and that good adaptation meant identifying and safeguarding things of most value. However, we also found notable differences as to whether the government, local community or rebel groups were imagined as leaders of the responsive actions, and as to whether good adaptation meant maintaining life as it had been before the disruptive events occurred or using the disruptive events as a catalyst for social change. We suggest that the creative futures storytelling method tested here could be gainfully applied to support adaptation planning across local, regional and national scales.","[Harcourt, Rachel; Taylor, Andrea] Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Ctr Decis Res, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Harcourt, Rachel; Dessai, Suraje; Taylor, Andrea] Univ Leeds, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Harcourt, Rachel; Dessai, Suraje; Taylor, Andrea] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [de Bruin, Wandi Bruine] Univ Southern Calif, Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, Dornsife Dept Psychol, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, 635 Downey Way VPD 512, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [de Bruin, Wandi Bruine] Univ Southern Calif, Ctr Econ & Social Res, Dornsife Dept Psychol, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, 635 Downey Way VPD 512, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Leeds; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of Leeds; University of Leeds; University of Southern California; University of Southern California,"Harcourt, R (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Ctr Decis Res, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Harcourt, R (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Harcourt, R (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",r.s.harcourt@leeds.ac.uk; wandibdb@usc.edu; S.Dessai@leeds.ac.uk; A.L.Taylor@leeds.ac.uk,"Bruine de Bruin, Wandi/N-8588-2018; Dessai, Suraje/D-4219-2009","Bruine de Bruin, Wandi/0000-0002-1601-789X; Dessai, Suraje/0000-0002-7879-9364; Harcourt, Rachel/0000-0001-7085-5192; Taylor, Andrea/0000-0002-8949-1234","Priestley International Centre for Climate Pump Priming Fund; U.K.'s Economic and Social Research Council [ES/R009708/1]; Centre for Climate Change, Economics and Policy (CCCEP); Strategic Priorities Fund U.K. Climate Resilience Programme [NE/S017321/1]; Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making (CEDM) through National Science Foundation [SES-0949710, SES-1463492]; Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making (CEDM) through Carnegie Mellon University [SES-0949710, SES-1463492]; Riksbankens Jubileumsfond (The Swedish foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences) Program on Science and Proven Experience; ESRC [ES/R009708/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Priestley International Centre for Climate Pump Priming Fund; U.K.'s Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Centre for Climate Change, Economics and Policy (CCCEP); Strategic Priorities Fund U.K. Climate Resilience Programme; Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making (CEDM) through National Science Foundation; Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making (CEDM) through Carnegie Mellon University; Riksbankens Jubileumsfond (The Swedish foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences) Program on Science and Proven Experience; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","Thanks to the Priestley International Centre for Climate Pump Priming Fund for funding the workshops.

Landslides lead to severe economic damage and property loss, as well as fatalities. Furthermore, they tend to increase in the context of climate change. The purpose of this study is to comprehensively assess landslide susceptibility across the Hengduan Mountain Region in southwest China. Specifically, the analysis is focused on the eastern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau within the context of future climate change scenarios, which are based on the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) global climate model ensemble. The Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Random Forest (RF), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) were selected in order to map landslide susceptibility within the context of 1.5-4.0 degrees C warming scenarios. This was achieved by considering the changes in extreme rainfall that exceeded the landslide triggering thresholds. The results show that the frequency over extreme rainfall thresholds (FOERT) tend to increase in conjunction with warming targets, thereby ranging from 2.3/a (at a 1.5 degrees C warming) to 9.0/a (at a 4.0 degrees C warming) on average. Such elevated extreme precipitation events contribute to an increase in projected future zones of high landslide susceptibility when compared to the historical baseline period ranging from -1.2% (at a 1.5 degrees C warming) to 4.0% (at a 4.0 degrees C warming) using different machine learning models. Moreover, the extent of high susceptibility zones increases more significantly in the context of 4.0 degrees C warming when compared to the historical baseline results. These results indicate the importance of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 as well as 2 degrees C. The high landslide susceptibility zones estimated by the CMIP6 multi-models ensemble are mainly located in the central and southeastern regions of the Hengduan Mountain Region. The possible changes in terms of introducing extreme precipitation in order to assess landslide susceptibility in the context of climate change that is proposed in this study may be further applied to additional study areas. These projections under different targets can provide scientific guidelines for the purposes of the development of climate change adaptation strategies.","[Yin, Huaxiang; Wang, Bingwei; Lin, Qigen] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Inst Disaster Risk Management, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jiahui] Beijing Normal Univ, Acad Disaster Reduct & Emergency Management, Minist Emergency Management, Minist Educ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Mondal, Sanjit Kumar] Yonsei Univ, Irreversible Climate Change Res Ctr, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seoul 03722, South Korea; [Zhou, Lingfeng] Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, State Key Lab Environm Criteria & Risk Assessment, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Wang, Leibin] Hebei Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shijiazhuang 050024, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Beijing Normal University; Yonsei University; Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences; Hebei Normal University,"Lin, QG (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Inst Disaster Risk Management, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",linqigen@mail.bnu.edu.cn,,,,,,,75,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,FEB,2023,14,2,,,,,,,214,10.3390/atmos14020214,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos14020214,,,21,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,9G5UQ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000938217800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although reservoirs and dams are criticized for their negative social and environmental impacts by reducing natural flow variability and obstructing river connections, they are also recognized as important for social and economic development and climate change adaptation. Multiple studies map large dams and analyze the dynamics of water stored in the reservoirs behind these dams, but very few studies focus on small and medium-sized reservoirs on a global scale. In this research, we use multi-annual multi-sensor satellite data, combined with cloud analytics, to monitor the state of small (10-100 ha) to medium-sized (> 100 ha, excluding 479 large ones) artificial water reservoirs globally for the first time. These reservoirs are of crucial importance to the well-being of many societies, but regular monitoring records of their water dynamics are mostly missing. We combine the results of multiple studies to identify 71,208 small to medium-sized reservoirs, followed by reconstructing surface water area changes from satellite data using a novel method introduced in this study. The dataset is validated using 768 daily in-situ water level and storage measurements (r2 > 0.7 for 67% of the reservoirs used for the validation) demonstrating that the surface water area dynamics can be used as a proxy for water storage dynamics in many cases. Our analysis shows that for small reservoirs, the inter-annual and intra-annual variability is much higher than for medium-sized reservoirs worldwide. This implies that the communities reliant on small reservoirs are more vulnerable to climate extremes, both short-term (within seasons) and longer-term (across seasons). Our findings show that the long-term inter-annual and intra-annual changes in these reservoirs are not equally distributed geographically. Through several cases, we demonstrate that this technology can help monitor water scarcity conditions and emerging food insecurity, and facilitate transboundary cooperation. It has the potential to provide operational information on conditions in ungauged or upstream riparian countries that do not share such data with neighboring countries.

The essence of the transfer of environmentally sound technologies is the coordination of interests among regions, with the aim of mitigating and adapting to global climate change. The realization of environmentally sound technology transfer mainly reflects the game between control and freedom, the coordination of public interests and private interests, and the equilibrium theory of supply and demand. Faced with the current situation of weak laws on the transfer of environmentally sound technologies, it is suggested that China needs to establish and improve the relevant legal system from the four dimensions of technology transfer law, environmental law, intellectual property law, and investment law, improve the legal system to realize the transfer of environmentally sound technology, and strengthen the connection between China's laws and relevant international law rules. At the same time, in order to improve the management mechanism of environmentally sound technology transfer, it is suggested that China should propose legal measures to optimize the institutional system of environmentally sound technology transfer from three dimensions, namely the state, social organizations, and individuals, and form a governance model of multi-actor cooperative management to promote the transfer of environmentally sound technology between China and other countries to achieve the goal of coping with climate change and to protect the global environment.","[Zhang, Zhenyu] Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Humanities & Law, Taiyuan 030024, Peoples R China; [Ren, Xumin] Shanxi Univ, Law Sch, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China",Taiyuan University of Technology; Shanxi University,"Ren, XM (corresponding author), Shanxi Univ, Law Sch, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China.",202121805004@email.sxu.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Zhenyu/0000-0002-2267-6840",China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Research on the legal system of green energy technology transfer under the background of China's energy revolution  [2020M670707],China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Research on the legal system of green energy technology transfer under the background of China's energy revolution ,This paper is supported by the general funded projects of the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Research on the legal system of green energy technology transfer under the background of China's energy revolution  (2020M670707).,,47,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2023,15,3,,,,,,,2151,10.3390/su15032151,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15032151,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,8U0NB,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000929647100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To investigate environmental impacts on climate change, it uses examples from the `Landscape Observatory' (Catalonia) and the `Room for the River' (The Netherlands) landscape programmes. Noordwaard is the largest rural project of the Room for the River programme, dealing with agricultural land, farming and nature reserves at a strategic scale. It demonstrates the potential and significance of addressing the sea rising water levels by creating landscape climate adaptation projects by introducing the ideas of landscape, low carbon, ecosystem services and governance as vital aspects of rural infrastructure, which underpin the ways in which agricultural land and water are managed. The Landscape Observatory has had a significant impact on the development of landscape policies in Catalonia and has been influential in a global level. Focusing on Llucanes and the establishment of a Landscape Charter protecting the agricultural land and examining the natural area of La Cerdanya in Pyrenees, the research extracts best practices in policy and legislation as well as participatory methods on climate and landscape awareness. This research concludes that a communication strategy strongly supported by policies, legislation and governance structures, in conjunction with a wider understanding of the role of landscape, results in significantly improved responses to deal with the challenges of the climate crisis in rural and agricultural areas.","[Nikologianni, Anastasia; Moore, Kathryn] Birmingham City Univ, Sch Architecture & Design, City Ctr Campus, Birmingham B4 7BD, W Midlands, England; [Larkham, Peter J.] Birmingham City Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, City Ctr Campus, Birmingham B4 7BD, W Midlands, England",Birmingham City University; Birmingham City University,"Nikologianni, A (corresponding author), Birmingham City Univ, Sch Architecture & Design, City Ctr Campus, Birmingham B4 7BD, W Midlands, England.",anastasia.nikologianni@bcu.ac.uk; kathryn.moore@bcu.ac.uk; peter.larkham@bcu.ac.uk,,"Nikologianni, Dr Anastasia/0000-0002-2234-4707; Moore, Kathryn/0000-0002-0792-1537",EIT Climate-KIC,EIT Climate-KIC,This research was partly funded by EIT Climate-KIC.,,17,1,1,3,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2412-3811,,INFRASTRUCTURES-BASE,Infrastructures-Basel,NOV,2020,5,11,,,,,,,97,10.3390/infrastructures5110097,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/infrastructures5110097,,,13,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil; Transportation Science & Technology",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering; Transportation,QP2CH,,"Green Accepted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000623643000009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Forests play increasing significant roles in regulating global carbon balance and mitigating climate change. Therefore, to understand the response mechanisms of the carbon budget of global forest ecosystems to future climate change, an improved version of the FORest ecosystem Carbon budget model for CHiNa (FORCCHN) and future Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenario RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 were applied in this study. The results demonstrated that the global forest ecosystems will play a major role in the carbon sink under the future two climate change scenarios. In particular, the average carbon budget of global forest ecosystems under RCP4.5 scenario was estimated to be 0.017 kg(C).m(-2).yr(-1) from 2007 to 2100. The future carbon sink areas of global forest ecosystems will increase significantly. Under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios, the carbon sink areas of global forest ecosystems during 2026-2100 would be significantly been expanded than those in 2007-2025, with increases of 83.16-87.26% and 23.53-29.70%, respectively. The impacts of future climate change on carbon budget of global forest ecosystems will significantly vary between different regions. The carbon budget of forests will be enhanced in the northern hemisphere and significantly weakened in the southern hemisphere under the future two climate change scenarios. The carbon sink regions of global forests will be mainly distributed in the middle and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere. In particular, the forests' carbon budget in northeastern and central Asia, northern Europe and western North America will increase by 40% similar to 80%. However, the carbon budget of forests will decrease by 20% similar to 40% in the most regions of the southern hemisphere. In northern South America and central Africa, the forests' carbon budget will be reduced by more than 40%. In the future, in some areas of southern hemisphere, where the forests' carbon budget was predicted to be reduced, some measures for improving forest carbon sink, such as strengthening forest tending, enforcing prohibiting deforestation laws and scientific forest management, and so on, should be implemented to ensure immediate mitigation and adaptation to climate change.","[Zhao, Junfang; Xie, Hongfei; Wang, Kaili] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 10081, Peoples R China; [Ma, Jianyong] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Plant Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Ma, Jianyong] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res Atmospher Environm Re, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Wang, Kaili] Sichuan Agr Univ, Resources Coll, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Huazhong Agricultural University; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Sichuan Agricultural University,"Zhao, JF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 10081, Peoples R China.",zhaojfcams@163.com,,,National Key Research and Development Programme of China [2017YFA0603004],National Key Research and Development Programme of China,The project was supported by the National Key Research and Development Programme of China (2017YFA0603004) .,,37,5,6,11,66,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8181,1872-6364,,GLOBAL PLANET CHANGE,Glob.

Despite ongoing advances in technology and crop varieties, an imbalance between water availability and demand, combined with robust shifts in drought propagation has negatively affected the agro-ecosystem and environmental conditions. In this study, we examined hydro-meteorological drought propagation and its associated impacts on crop yield across natural and human-disturbed agro-ecological zones (AEZs) in Pakistan. Multisource datasets (i.e., ground observations, reanalysis, and satellites) were used to characterize the most extensive, intense drought episodes from 1981 to 2018 based on the standardized precipitation evaporation index (SPEI), standardized streamflow index (SSFI), standardized surface water storage index (SSWSI), and standardized groundwater storage index (SGWI). The most common and intense drought episodes characterized by SPEI, SSFI, SSWSI, and SGWI were observed in years 1981-1983, 2000-2003, 2005, and 2018. SPEI yielded the maximum number of drought months (90) followed by SSFI (85), SSWSI (75), and SGWI (35). Droughts were frequently longer and had a slower termination rate in the human-disturbed AEZs (e.g., North Irrigated Plain and South Irrigated Plain) compared to natural zones (e.g., Wet Mountains and Northern Dry Mountains). The historical droughts are likely caused by the anomalous large-scale patterns of geopotential height, near-surface air temperature, total precipitation, and prevailing soil moisture conditions. The negative values (<-2) of standardized drought severity index (DSI) observed during the drought episodes (1988, 2000, and 2002) indicated a decline in vegetation growth and yield of major crops such as sugarcane, maize, wheat, cotton, and rice. A large number of low-yield years (SYRI <= -1.5) were recorded for sugarcane and maize (10 years), followed by rice (9 years), wheat (8 years), and cotton (6 years). Maximum crop yield reductions relative to the historic mean (1981-2017) were recorded in 1983 (38% for cotton), 1985 (51% for maize), 1999 (15% for wheat), 2000 (29% for cotton), 2001 (37% for rice), 2002 (21% for rice), and 2004 (32% for maize). The percentage yield losses associated with shifts in SSFI and SSWSI were greater than those in SPEI, likely due to longer drought termination duration and a slower termination rate in the human-disturbed AEZs. The study's findings will assist policymakers to adopt sustainable agricultural and water management practices, and make climate change adaptation plans to mitigate drought impacts in the study region.","[Saleem, Farhan; Zeng, Xiaodong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Saleem, Farhan; Zeng, Xiaodong; Dilawar, Adil] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Arshad, Arfan; Mirchi, Ali] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Biosyst & Agr Engn, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Arshad, Arfan] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Irrigat & Drainage, Fac Agr Engn, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan; [Khaliq, Tasneem] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Agron, Agro Climatol Lab, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan; [Zeng, Xiaodong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Rahman, Md Masudur] Pabna Univ Sci Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Pabna 6600, Bangladesh; [Dilawar, Adil] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Pham, Quoc Bao] Thu Dau Mot Univ, Inst Appl Technol, Thu Dau Mot 820000, Vietnam; [Mahmood, Kashif] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, D-53113 Bonn, Germany","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; University of Agriculture Faisalabad; University of Agriculture Faisalabad; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Thu Dau Mot University; University of Bonn","Zeng, XD (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Zeng, XD (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;Zeng, XD (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",farhan@mail.iap.ac.cn; aarshad@okstate.edu; amirchi@okstate.edu; drtasneem@uaf.edu.pk; xdzeng@mail.iap.ac.cn; mmrahman@pust.ac.bd; adilawar2018@igsnrr.ac.cn; phambaoquoc@tdmu.edu.vn; kashif.mehmood@uni-bonn.de,"Arshad, Arfan/AAX-6947-2021; Pham, Quoc Bao/AAD-5611-2020; Khaliq, Tasneem/B-3603-2013","Arshad, Arfan/0000-0002-0726-1807; Dilawar, Adil/0000-0001-7295-0361; Pham, Quoc Bao/0000-0002-0468-5962; Saleem, Farhan/0000-0002-8395-0399; Zeng, Xiaodong/0000-0001-9321-0426; Rahman, Md Masudur/0000-0001-5546-0491; Khaliq, Tasneem/0000-0002-4616-8429",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41991282]; CAS-TWAS Centre of Excellence for Climate and Environment Sciences,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CAS-TWAS Centre of Excellence for Climate and Environment Sciences,"This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 41991282 and the CAS-TWAS Centre of Excellence for Climate and Environment Sciences.",,117,3,3,4,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,MAY,2022,14,9,,,,,,,2152,10.3390/rs14092152,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14092152,,,28,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,1G9EF,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000796150200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study addressed this knowledge gap through the development and use of a dynamic modelling framework integrating climate, crop, pasture and livestock models. The framework was applied to a population of 91 farms located in semi-arid Zimbabwe to assess effects on livestock production resulting from climate change and management interventions. Climate scenarios representing relative cool-wet, hot-dry and middle conditions by mid-century (2040-2070) for two representative concentration pathways were compared with the baseline climate. On-farm fodder resources and rangeland grass production were simulated with the crop model APSIM and the pasture model GRASP respectively. The simulated fodder availability was used in the livestock model LIVSIM to generate various production indicators including milk, offtake, mortality, manure, and net revenue. We investigated the effects of two adaptation packages targeting soil fertility management and crop diversification and quantified the sensitivity to climate change of both current and improved systems. Livestock productivity was constrained by dry-season feed gaps, which were particularly severe for crude protein and caused by the reliance on rangeland grazing and crop residues, both of low quality in the dry season. Effects on grass and stover production depended on the climate scenario and the crop, but year-to-year variation generally increased. Relative changes in livestock net revenue compared to the baseline climate varied from a 6% increase to a 43% decrease, and the proportion of farmers negatively affected varied from 20% to 100%, depending on the climate scenario. Adverse effects of climate change on average livestock production usually coincided with increased year-to-year variability and risk. Farms with larger stocking density faced more severe feed gaps and were more sensitive to climate change than less densely stocked farms. The first adaptation package resulted in increased stover production and a small increase in livestock productivity. The inclusion of grain and forage legumes with the second package increased milk productivity and net revenues more profoundly by 30%. This was attributed to the alleviation of dry-season feed gaps, which also reduced the sensitivity to climate change compared to the current system. Clearly, individual farms were affected differently by climate change and by improved farm management, illustrating that disaggregated impact assessments are needed to effectively inform decision making towards climate change adaptation.","[Descheemaeker, Katrien; Zijlstra, Mink] Wageningen Univ, Plant Prod Syst, POB 430, NL-6700 AK Wageningen, Netherlands; [Masikati, Patricia] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Lusaka, Zambia; [Crespo, Olivier] Univ Cape Town, Environm & Geog Sci Dept, Climate Syst Anal Grp, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Tui, Sabine Homann-Kee] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, POB 776, Matopos, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe",Wageningen University & Research; University of Cape Town; CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT),"Descheemaeker, K (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Plant Prod Syst, POB 430, NL-6700 AK Wageningen, Netherlands.",katrien.descheemaeker@wur.nl,"descheemaeker, katrien/P-6605-2014; crespo, olivier/L-6398-2013","descheemaeker, katrien/0000-0003-0184-2034; crespo, olivier/0000-0001-7320-9428",UK Department for International Development (UKAID) [GB-1-202108]; Systemwide Livestock Programme (SLP); CGIAR,UK Department for International Development (UKAID)(CGIAR); Systemwide Livestock Programme (SLP); CGIAR(CGIAR),"This study was conducted as part of the Crop Livestock Intensification Project (CLIP), which is one component of the Regional Integrated Assessment project (RIA, www.agmip.org) of AGMIP.

The emerging discourse at the international policy level calls for a 'resilience-based' response to climate adaptation and infrastructure planning. This paper reviews the relevance of resilience theory in the context of infrastructure in developing countries and finds that 'resilience thinking' offers a way to improve engineers' understanding of the adaptation needs of vulnerable communities. The paper develops a conceptual framework based on resilience thinking, and applies it to the case of a vulnerable coastal community in Honduras where primary fieldwork was undertaken to assess infrastructure planning. The analysis exposes the unintended consequences of traditional planning that exacerbates climate vulnerability and adversely impacts the long-term preparedness of vulnerable communities. Civil engineering scholars and practitioners concerned with sustainable development in developing countries may gain a superior understanding of climate adaptation by integrating resilience thinking into infrastructure planning.","[Gallagher, Daniel] MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Cruickshank, Heather] Univ Cambridge, Engn Sustainable Dev, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Cambridge, England",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Cambridge,"Gallagher, D (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,"Gallagher, Daniel/Q-7133-2019","Gallagher, Daniel/0000-0001-7291-5558",Institution of Civil Engineers; Santander Travel Grant; Clare College at Cambridge University,Institution of Civil Engineers; Santander Travel Grant; Clare College at Cambridge University,"The authors thank the following individuals and organizations who contributed to this paper: the two anonymous reviewers who provided valuable comments on earlier drafts of this manuscript; the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Santander Travel Grant, and Clare College at Cambridge University for financial support; and Emanuele Michelangeli and Andrea Micangeli of the Sapienza University of Rome for logistical support during fieldwork.",,38,6,6,2,43,ICE PUBLISHING,WESTMINISTER,"INST CIVIL ENGINEERS, 1 GREAT GEORGE ST, WESTMINISTER SW 1P 3AA, ENGLAND",0965-0903,1751-7699,,P I CIVIL ENG-MUNIC,Proc.

Results indicate that policy action will be needed to attain water sustainability in 2030, even without reductions in river flows caused by climate change. Challenging but feasible changes in lifestyle and slower rates of population growth would allow the region to avoid shortage conditions and achieve groundwater sustainability under all but the most dire climate scenarios. Changes in lifestyle involve more native desert landscaping and fewer pools in addition to slower growth and higher urban densities. There is not a single most likely or optimal future for Phoenix.

It is still conventional wisdom that unilateral action does not pay off for individual countries due to free-riding incentives for other countries. Does this conclusion change if damage can be reduced by adaptation measures? This article considers adaptation as an explicit decision variable and frames unilateral action as Stackelberg game with two countries. The sequence of play is determined endogenously. We show that the Stackelberg leader reduces adaptation expenditures and emissions if the follower's damage function has a specific convexity property where adaptation leads to strategic complements. Then, no country has an incentive to deviate from the sequence of play. Unilateral action in adaptation or in emissions leads to a strict Pareto improvement compared to the non-co-operative Nash solution. There are lower total emissions and less adaptation.","[Eisenack, Klaus; Kaehler, Leonhard] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Eisenack, K (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany.",klaus.eisenack@uni-oldenburg.de,,,Ev.

Using Barbados as a case study, the research conducted first examined ecosystem degradation. Second, an analysis of adaptation options for climate change and rising sea levels was undertaken. Based on the study conducted, conclusions were drawn on the implementation challenges of adaptation measures and approaches, and areas for future research. The research found that hard engineering is highly prioritised because of the vulnerability of settlements, infrastructure, and beaches to erosion. Beach protection in particular receives significant attention because beach tourism is economically significant. Additionally, beach nourishment is popular in alleviating erosion. A major finding is that reactive and standalone protective efforts are less effective, so that hard and soft engineering measures, though economically costly, are combined responses. On the other hand, retreat and relocation are controversial given limited space, and are economically and politically costly.","[Mycoo, Michelle] Univ W Indies, Dept Geomat Engn & Land Management, Fac Engn, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago; [Chadwick, Andrew] Univ Plymouth, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Saint Augustine; University of Plymouth,"Mycoo, M (corresponding author), Univ W Indies, Dept Geomat Engn & Land Management, Fac Engn, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago.",,,,,,,,48,19,19,0,75,ICE PUBLISHING,WESTMINISTER,"INST CIVIL ENGINEERS, 1 GREAT GEORGE ST, WESTMINISTER SW 1P 3AA, ENGLAND",1741-7597,1751-7737,,P I CIVIL ENG-MAR EN,Proc.

While adaptation responses are generally recognised to be place-based, policy processes on adaptation often reside with central (state or national) governments that may be remote from regional communities. In this paper, we contribute to the literature regarding how diverse regional communities engage with planning and policy for climate adaptation, which is important for successful implementation. We adopt a social network analysis (SNA) approach that enables an exploration of the interaction of community networks with policy information. There are limited empirical studies of information sharing about climate adaptation policy through community knowledge networks. One previous study, located in coastal New South Wales, Australia, mapped the community's knowledge acquisition and diffusion to reveal the underlying network structures that influenced policy engagement pathways. However, further studies are needed to determine how the features of community networks may change with local context (e.g., coastal versus inland). This paper extends previous studies to compare and contrast adaptation knowledge networks in three NSW communities: Shoalhaven (the original coastal study site), Bega (coastal) and Orange (inland). Findings suggest that the presence of a natural resource-dependent industry, local geographies and boundary spanners acting as network knowledge brokers are factors influencing community knowledge flows. The work further demonstrates the utility of SNA to measure knowledge networks that can inform government engagement and communication with communities on climate adaptation policy.","[Cunningham, Rebecca; Jacobs, Brent] Univ Technol, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Measham, Thomas G.] CSIRO, QCAT, Pullenvale, Qld 4069, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Cunningham, R (corresponding author), Univ Technol, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",Rebecca.Cunningham@uts.edu.au; Brent.Jacobs@uts.edu.au; Tom.Measham@csiro.au,"Measham, Tom/A-5210-2010","Measham, Tom/0000-0003-4549-5361; Cunningham, Rebecca/0000-0001-8066-9019",New SouthWales Office of Environment and Heritage through the Adaptive Communities Node 2013-2019,New SouthWales Office of Environment and Heritage through the Adaptive Communities Node 2013-2019,This research was funded by the New SouthWales Office of Environment and Heritage through the Adaptive Communities Node 2013-2019.,,48,2,2,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,FEB,2021,9,2,,,,,,,21,10.3390/cli9020021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli9020021,,,16,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,QN4CJ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000622409400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This has caused over-consumption of these, which has dangerously altered the climate. Despite this issue, with on-going economic growth, especially cities continue to consume even more such natural resources. Radical new urban planning approaches linked to a paradigm shift are urgently needed. Integrated urban planning can help cities exploit potential synergies of climate change mitigation and adaptation approaches to act on climate change more effectively. In this study, a case study neighbourhood of the City of Munich, Germany, is used as a model. By applying the Water-Energy-Food Nexus approach, the study finds that intensive urban agriculture could provide for 66% of local demand for fruit and 246% of local demand for vegetables; wastewater recycling and reuse coupled with rainwater harvesting can save 26% of current freshwater supply; biogas generation from human sewage can save 20% of current electricity supply; and the cost of decentralized wastewater management may be significantly lower than the planned renovation of the centralized sewage system.

This symbiotic relationship is an important consideration for businesses as they work to adapt to a changing climate. By thinking broadly about how working with local governments can influence their resilience, businesses may be able to uncover additional adaptation opportunities and enhance their adaption efforts in ways they may not be able to achieve on their own.

In this region, improving income and soil carbon content became the driving forces for planting non-native trees, among which Acacia decurrens and Eucalyptus globulus, are prominent. However, farmer decision-making on land-use selection is not well informed by local evidence-based best practices. This study aims to analyze the comparative advantages of Acacia decurrens and Eucalyptus globulus land uses on income and soil organic carbon (OC) content in the highlands. Socio-economic data and farm-plot-based soil data were collected for the analysis of income and soil OC content (%), respectively. For the socio-economic survey, a total of 120 sample household farmers were selected through a stratified and systematic random sampling. The farmers were evenly split among those who planted Acacia decurrens (60) and those who opted for Eucalyptus globulus (60). A total of 48 (6 replications x 2 kebeles x 2 plantation type x 2 soil depths) composite soil samples were collected for soil analysis. The collected socio-economic and soil datasets were subjected to descriptive, one-way ANOVA and regression analyses. A correlation matrix was also employed to analyze the effects of plantation types on organic carbon and other selected soil properties. In the 6 years observed, the local farmers generated a net profit of 46,587.6 ETB (1 USD =43.9 ETB) per hectare from Acacia decurrens plantation and 825,042.8 ETB from Eucalyptus globulus. The net income generated from Eucalyptus globulus was found to be approximately 17 times more than that of Acacia decurrens. The average OC percentage varied from 4.1% in the Acacia decurrens to 3.5% in the Eucalyptus plantations at the soil depth of 0-15 cm. The value of OC was found to be significantly different (p < 0.001) in the two land uses. Income and soil carbon content were found to have no significant association with the choice of farmers between the two land uses. A higher OC value was observed in the Acacia decurrens plantations, which can improve land productivity. Meanwhile, Eucalyptus was found more advantageous for improving income and quicker return on farmer investment. Considering the differing competitive advantages of the two land uses, mixed plantations in separate plots could be more appropriate to harmonize interests in increasing income and improving soil carbon content.","[Dessie, Belayneh; Taye, Mintesinot; Jember, Ayana] Bahir Dar Univ, Inst Disaster Risk Management & Food Secur Studie, POB 5501, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Adane, Zablon] World Resource Inst WRI, 10 G St NE Suite 800, Washington, DC USA",Bahir Dar University,"Taye, M (corresponding author), Bahir Dar Univ, Inst Disaster Risk Management & Food Secur Studie, POB 5501, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia.",belaynehadmasu2013@gmail.com; mintesinotazene@yahoo.com; zablon.adane@wri.org; ayanaadmass2011@gmail.com,,"Taye, Mintesinot/0000-0002-9226-7225",Bahir Dar University,Bahir Dar University,The authors would like to thank Bahir Dar University for funding the process of data collection for the current study.,,78,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

Based on an analysis of historical climate and summer maize yield data from 1980 to 2016 in the Huang-Huai-Hai (3H) region of China, we calculated two high-temperature event indices, namely, high-temperature hours (HTH) and high-temperature degrees (HTD, the sum of the differences between 35 degrees C and above), and then investigated the temporal trend of high-temperature events from maize heading to maturity and their impact on the yield of summer maize. Our results indicated that the air temperature showed a significant upward trend when heading into the maturity period of summer maize in the 3H region from 1980-2016 and that the increase was greater in the northern Huang-Huai-Hai (N3H) region than in the southern Huang-Huai-Hai (S3H) region. The intensity of high-temperature events when heading into the maturity period increased considerably from 1980 to 2016 in the 3H region, especially in the S3H region. The HTH and HTD increased by 1.30 h and 0.80 degrees C per decade in the S3H region, respectively. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis of panel data showed that the increases in HTH and HTD when heading into the maturity period had a consistent negative effect on yield in S3H and N3H regions; this effect was more obvious in the S3H region. In the S3H region, a 1 h increase in HTH was found to be associated with a 0.45-1.13% decrease in yield and a 1 degrees C increase in HTD could result in a yield loss of 1.34-4.29%. High-temperature events were detrimental to summer maize production, and the severity of this effect was projected to increase in the 3H region. In this study, we used two indices (HTH and HTD) to quantify the impact of high-temperature events on summer maize yield during the critical growth phase (heading to maturity) at a small timescale (hours and days). The results of this study can provide a reference for policymakers to use in the formulation of corresponding climate change adaptation strategies.","[Wei, Shengbao; Liu, Jing; Li, Tiantian; Wang, Xiaoying; Peng, Anchun; Chen, Changqing] Nanjing Agr Univ, Inst Appl Ecol, Nanjing 210095, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University,"Chen, CQ (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Inst Appl Ecol, Nanjing 210095, Peoples R China.",2019101014@njau.edu.cn; 2018101004@njau.edu.cn; 2019801188@njau.edu.cn; 2018101027@njau.edu.cn; 2020101021@njau.edu.cn; cn828@njau.edu.cn,,,Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest [201503118]; National Key Technology R&D Program of China [2015BAC02B02]; Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund of Institute of Crop Science [Y2016PT12]; Innovation Program of CAAS [Y2016XT01],Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest; National Key Technology R&D Program of China(National Key Technology R&D Program); Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund of Institute of Crop Science; Innovation Program of CAAS,"This work was supported by the Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest (201503118), the National Key Technology R&D Program of China (2015BAC02B02), the Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund of Institute of Crop Science (Y2016PT12), and the Innovation Program of CAAS (Y2016XT01).",,49,8,8,6,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,DEC,2020,11,12,,,,,,,1291,10.3390/atmos11121291,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11121291,,,12,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,PJ3NK,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000601678800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Furthermore crop management of plant nutrients, based on a combination of agricultural inputs and crop diversity, has not been assessed with respect to adaptation to climate change. This modeling study assessed soil NO3-N leaching and labile P simulated with the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model for historical and future climate scenarios for the Alternative Cropping Systems (ACS) study (1994-2013) in North-Western Saskatchewan, Canada. The EPIC model was updated with 19 years of field management information from the ACS study. The field study was a combination of the three levels of agricultural inputs [organic (ORG), reduced (RED), and high (HI)] and three levels of cropping diversity [low (LOW), diversified annual grains (DAG), and diversified annual & perennial (DAP)]. Recursive partitioning with multivariate analyses of agricultural inputs, cropping diversity, precipitation, growing degree days, and terrain were used to assess changes in NO3-N and P for each climate change scenario. This is the first analysis, with the EPIC model in the Canadian Prairies, of the effects of climate change on NO3-N losses in agricultural runoff, and soil P content in the context of different agricultural input systems in combinations with diversified rotations. NO3-N losses increased by 28% (from 27.1 to 34.7 kg ha(-1) y(-1)), while labile soil P decreased by 12% (from 24.7 to 21.6 kg ha(-1) y(-1)) under climate change, compared to historical weather. Summer precipitation explained 12% of total variation in future NO3-N losses. Combined, input and diversity explained 23% and 20% of variation in NO3-N losses and labile P, respectively. Cropping diversity was most significant, with reduced NO3-N leaching and labile P under climate change, accounting for 22% and 13% of total variation, respectively. Combined, RED inputs and DAG diversity reduced the impact of climate change on NO3-N losses and soil P and may provide a sustainable, adaptive solution for farming with regards to upcoming seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation. The scientific community, decision and policy makers will use this information to develop conceptual and practical farm- and field-scale technologies for producers, in order to adapt to the impact of climate change on agricultural production and the environment, with methodology which can be applied in Canada and other countries.","[Lychuk, Taras E.; Moulin, Alan P.] Agr & Agrifood Canada, Brandon Res & Dev Ctr, 2701 Grand Valley Rd, Brandon, MB R7A 5Y3, Canada; [Lemke, Reynald L.; Olfert, Owen O.] Agr & Agrifood Canada, Saskatoon Res & Dev Ctr, 107 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0X2, Canada; [Izaurralde, Roberto C.] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, 2181 LeFrak Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Johnson, Eric N.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Plant Sci, 51 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0X2, Canada; [Brandt, Stewart A.] Northeast Agr Res Fdn, POB 1240, Melfort, SK S0E IA0, Canada",Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Saskatchewan,"Lychuk, TE (corresponding author), Agr & Agrifood Canada, Brandon Res & Dev Ctr, 2701 Grand Valley Rd, Brandon, MB R7A 5Y3, Canada.",taras.lychuk@agr.gc.ca,"Izaurralde, Roberto Cesar/E-5257-2019","Izaurralde, Roberto Cesar/0000-0002-8797-9500","National Science Foundation (NSF); US Department of Energy (DOE); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); US Environmental Protection Agency Office of Research and Development (EPA); Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada under Growing Forward 2, Lake Winnipeg Agroecosystem Resilience project [J-002207]; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada under Eastern Prairie Living Laboratories project [J-002289]","National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea); US Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); US Environmental Protection Agency Office of Research and Development (EPA)(United States Environmental Protection Agency); Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada under Growing Forward 2, Lake Winnipeg Agroecosystem Resilience project; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada under Eastern Prairie Living Laboratories project","The authors wish to thank Dr. S.

However, the nature of climate change resilience is widely debated in the literature, and there is a knowledge gap regarding the best way to address adaptation at the interface with development objectives as part of mainstreaming. This paper aims to address this knowledge gap via a case study of a community-based, Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) project in Vietnam. A case study approach was applied with fieldwork at one project site, complemented by semi-structured interviews with government stakeholders, key experts, and project leaders of related projects. The analysis identifies five key factors that enhance rural resilience in a smallholder agricultural context: (i) engaging local governments as partners, (ii) considering broader landscape issues such as markets, (iii) providing farmers with support to facilitate adoption of CSA practices, (iv) fostering community capacity building, and (v) promoting adaptive management and scenario planning to deal with uncertainty. The paper concludes that resilience is multidimensional and not solely in line with any one of the approaches dominant in the literature.","[Halbherr, Lucia; Hutjes, Ronald] Wageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Maat, Harro] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Knowledge Technol & Innovat Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Talsma, Tiffany] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Hanoi, Vietnam",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT,"Halbherr, L (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",lucia.halbherr@wur.nl; harro.maat@wur.nl; t.talsma@cgiar.org; ronald.hutjes@wur.nl,"Maat, Harro/D-2142-2012","Maat, Harro/0000-0001-7338-7910","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR)","The first author received a stipend for data collection in Vietnam from the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).",,46,2,2,5,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,OCT,2021,11,10,,,,,,,1926,10.3390/agronomy11101926,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11101926,,,18,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,WO8KV,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000712697200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To develop tailored coastal climate services that can inform decision makers on climate adaptation in coastal cities, a better understanding and modeling of multifaceted urban dynamics is important. We develop a coastal urban model family, where the population growth and urbanization rates are modeled in the framework of diffusion over the half-bounded and bounded domains, and apply the maximum entropy principle to the latter case. Population density distributions are derived analytically whenever possible. Steady-state wave solutions balancing the width of inhabited coastal zones, with the skewed distributions maximizing population entropy, might be responsible for the coastward migrations outstripping the demographic development of the hinterland. With appropriate modifications of boundary conditions, the developed family of diffusion models can describe coastal urban dynamics affected by climate change.","[Kovalevsky, Dmitry, V] Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, Fischertwiete 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany; [Volchenkov, Dimitri] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Math & Stat, 1108 Mem Circle, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Scheffran, Juergen] Univ Hamburg, Res Grp Climate Change & Secur CLISEC, Inst Geog, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, Grindelberg 7, D-20144 Hamburg, Germany",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; University of Hamburg,"Kovalevsky, DV (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, Fischertwiete 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany.",dmitrii.kovalevskii@hereon.de; dimitri.volchenkov@ttu.edu; juergen.scheffran@uni-hamburg.de,"Scheffran, Jürgen/M-6876-2019; Kovalevsky, Dmitry V./K-7994-2012","Scheffran, Jürgen/0000-0002-7171-3062; Kovalevsky, Dmitry V./0000-0001-7331-1406; Volchenkov, Dmitri/0000-0002-3378-365X",Helmholtz Institute for Climate Service Science (HICSS),Helmholtz Institute for Climate Service Science (HICSS),"The work done by D.V.K. and J.S. was conducted and financed within the framework of the Helmholtz Institute for Climate Service Science (HICSS), a cooperation between Climate Service Center Germany (GERICS) and Universitat Hamburg, Germany [Project 'modeling Urban dynamics affected by Climate Change for Coastal Spatial planning and management' (MUCCCS)].",,98,2,2,1,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1099-4300,,ENTROPY-SWITZ,Entropy,AUG,2021,23,8,,,,,,,1041,10.3390/e23081041,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e23081041,,,23,"Physics, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physics,UI2MY,34441181,"gold, Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000690449300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The panel data model and time series region model with/without adaptation are applied at the same time to assess the effectiveness of a common production function. To capture the effects of weather variables we employ a random coefficients model where the production elasticities are the logarithmic function on temperature and rainfall. A Cobb-Douglas production function with additional interaction between inputs and climate variables is applied. We find that the economic impacts of climate change are mixed, that is, some regions are winners and others are losers, and the effect is crop-specific, not general. With adaptation, the economic impacts of warming on grain production are always positive; less precipitation will benefit rice production, but will harm wheat and maize production. Most of the central, western and northern China, which have already been adapted, are less sensitive to climate variables, but some eastern provinces, such as Shandong and Hebei, are very vulnerable. However, this study finds that the adaptation by irrigation is not sensitive to climate change. In summary, the analysis indicates that policymakers should recognize that the climate change would change the productivity of factors, so a regional and crop-specific total-factor-adaptation model is recommended.

The aim of this article is to contribute to more informed and efficient decision-making processes in climate adaptation by developing a typology of usability gaps for climate services. To do so, we first present and demonstrate a so-called 'climate information design' (CID) template with which to study and potentially improve the visual communicative qualities of climate services. Then, two climates services are selected for a further, qualitative explorative case study of two cases in the north and south of the Netherlands. A combination of focus group sessions and semi-structured interviews are used to collect data from Dutch governmental stakeholders as well as private stakeholders and NGOs. This data is then coded to discover what usability gaps are present. We then present twelve different types of usability gaps that were encountered as a typology. This typology could be used to improve and redesign climate services.","[Raaphorst, Kevin] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Geog Planning & Environm, NL-6525 XZ Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Koers, Gerben; Ellen, Gerald Jan; van der Brugge, Rutger] Deltares, Dept Urban Water & Subsurface, NL-3584 BK Utrecht, Netherlands; [Oen, Amy; Kalsnes, Bjorn] NGI, Dept Risk Slope Stabil & Climate Adaptat, N-0855 Oslo, Norway; [van Well, Lisa] SGI, Dept Geotech Risk & Climate Adaptat, SE-58193 Linkoping, Sweden; [Koerth, Jana] Univ Kiel, Coastal Risks & Sea Level Rise Res Grp, D-24118 Kiel, Germany","Radboud University Nijmegen; Deltares; Norwegian Geotechnical Institute, NGI; University of Kiel","Raaphorst, K (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Geog Planning & Environm, NL-6525 XZ Nijmegen, Netherlands.",k.raaphorst@fm.ru.nl; gerben.koers@deltares.nl; geraldjan.ellen@deltares.nl; amy.oen@ngi.no; bjorn.kalsnes@ngi.no; lisa.vanwell@swedgeo.se; koerth@geographie.uni-kiel.de; rutger.vanderbrugge@deltares.nl,,"Raaphorst, Kevin/0000-0003-0809-4315; Koers, Gerben/0000-0001-9749-3339",RCN (NO); FORMAS (SE); NWO (NL); BMBF (DE); European Union [690462],RCN (NO); FORMAS (SE); NWO (NL); BMBF (DE)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); European Union(European Commission),"This research was funded by RCN (NO), FORMAS (SE), NWO (NL), BMBF (DE) with co-funding by European Union (Grant 690462).",,48,4,4,4,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB 2,2020,12,4,,,,,,,1512,10.3390/su12041512,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12041512,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KY3GT,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000522460200230,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is particularly true in socio-ecological systems, where climate not only influences social and ecosystem dynamics, but also modulates their interaction. In this paper, we presented a conceptual framework through a literature review and a trend analysis for assessing the impact of climate change that incorporates socio-ecological interactions. In particular, we focused on the Mongolian pastoral system, which has tightly coupled socio-ecological interactions, as a model for describing the framework. Our framework suggests that the flexibility in mobility of herders is the principal factor in determining the vulnerability of the socio-ecological system to climate change. The flexibility varies along a climatic gradient and socio-ecological interactions in each region have evolved to be suited to its local climate regime. Herders in northern and central regions of Mongolia move shorter distances, and less flexible, than those in southern (Gobi) region. Climatic hazards, on the other hand have been increasing across Mongolia with a trend toward warmer and drier conditions since the 1960s. We suggest that further warming and drying would have the greatest impact on northern and central regions due to lower flexibility in mobility among herders there coupled with the much higher livestock density in the regions. The findings support that maintaining flexibility of mobile herding will likely be crucial to reducing the vulnerability of the Mongolian pastoral system to climate change.","[Kakinuma, Kaoru] Shanghai Univ, Asian Demog Res Inst, 333 Nanchen Rd, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China; [Yanagawa, Aki] Meisei Univ, Sch Sci & Engn, Environm Syst & Engn, 29-1006,2-1-1 Hodokubo, Hino, Tokyo 1918506, Japan; [Sasaki, Takehiro] Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm & Informat Sci, 79-7 Tokiwadai, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan; [Rao, Mukund Palat] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Tree Ring Lab, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Rao, Mukund Palat] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Kanae, Shinjiro] Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Environm & Soc, Meguro Ku, 2-12-1-M1-6 Ookayama, Tokyo 1528552, Japan",Shanghai University; Meisei University; Yokohama National University; Columbia University; Columbia University; Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Kakinuma, K (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ, Asian Demog Res Inst, 333 Nanchen Rd, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China.",k.kakinuma0214@gmail.com; aki.yanagawa@meisei-u.ac.jp; sasaki-takehiro-kw@ynu.ac.jp; mukund@ldeo.columbia.edu; kanae@cv.titech.ac.jp,"Rao, Mukund/AAM-8319-2020; Kanae, Shinjiro/E-5606-2010; Kakinuma, Kaoru/B-9848-2015","Rao, Mukund/0000-0003-3398-2453; Kanae, Shinjiro/0000-0002-3176-4957; Kakinuma, Kaoru/0000-0003-4647-9582; Sasaki, Takehiro/0000-0001-8727-9152","JSPS KAKENHI [15J12081]; National Science Foundation O ffice of Polar Programs (NSF-OPP) Arctic Social Sciences grant [1737788]; Research and Development Initiative, Chuo University, Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15J12081] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); National Science Foundation O ffice of Polar Programs (NSF-OPP) Arctic Social Sciences grant; Research and Development Initiative, Chuo University, Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was funded by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 15J12081, National Science Foundation O ffice of Polar Programs (NSF-OPP) Arctic Social Sciences grant #1737788 and Research and Development Initiative, Chuo University, Japan.",,86,13,13,5,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2019,11,21,,,,,,,5883,10.3390/su11215883,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11215883,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JT7ZZ,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000501205200012,View Full Record in Web of Science

With rapid development of society and the economy, China's cropping structure has profoundly changed since the reform and opening up in 1978, but there has been no systematic investigation of the pattern, process and characteristics of these changes. In view of this, a crop area database for China was acquired and compiled at the county level for the period 1980-2011, and linear regression and spatial analysis were employed to investigate the cropping structure type and cropping proportion changes at the national level. This research had three main findings: (1) China's cropping structure has undergone significant changes since 2002; the richness of cropping structure types has increased significantly and a diversified-type structure has gradually replaced the single types. The single-crop types-dominated by rice, wheat or maize-declined, affected by the combination of these three major food crops in mixed plantings and conversion of some of their planting area to other crops. (2) In the top 10 types, 82.7% of the county-level cropping structure was rice, wheat, maize and their combinations in 1980; however, this proportion decreased to 50.7% in 2011, indicating an adjustment period of China's cropping structure. Spatial analysis showed that 63.8% of China's counties adjusted their cropping structure, with the general change toward reducing the main food types and increasing fruits and vegetables during 1980-2011. (3) At the national level, the grain-planting pattern dominated by rice shifted to coexistence of rice, wheat and maize during this period. There were significant decreasing trends for 47% of rice, 61% of wheat and 29.6% of maize cropping counties. The pattern of maize cropping had the most significant change, with the maize proportion decreasing in the zone from northeastern to southwestern China during this period. Cities and their surroundings were hotspots for cropping structural adjustment. Urbanization has significantly changed cropping structure, with most of these regions showing rapid increases in the proportion of fruit and vegetables. Our research suggests that the policy of cropping structural adjustment needs to consider geographical characteristics and spatial planning of cropping systems. In this way, the future direction of cropping structural adjustment will be appropriate and scientifically based, such as where there is a need to maintain or increase rice and wheat cropping, increase soybean and decrease maize, and increase the supply of fruit and vegetables.","[Liu Zhenhuan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yang Peng; Wu Wenbin] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Minist Agr, Key Lab Agr Remote Sensing AGRIRS, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [You Liangzhi] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA","Sun Yat Sen University; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning, CAAS; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)","Yang, P (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Minist Agr, Key Lab Agr Remote Sensing AGRIRS, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",zhenhuanliu@gmail.com; yangpeng@caas.cn,,"YANG, PENG/0000-0002-7999-9763",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571172]; Ministry of Finance of China through the Non-Profit National Research Institute [2017-CAAS-30],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Finance of China through the Non-Profit National Research Institute,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, No.41571172; Ministry of Finance of China through the Non-Profit National Research Institute, No.2017-CAAS-30",,39,26,33,12,52,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1009-637X,1861-9568,,J GEOGR SCI,J.

Available research focused on profitability and economic constraints alone, disregarding the farmers' perception of the adoption of CSA innovations. There is relatively little empirical work on farmers' perceptions of innovations. Hence, a critical research gap that will strengthen CSA innovation research and practice includes understanding farmers' perceptions about CSA innovations and how these perceptions interact with their adoption. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional household survey was conducted among 424 smallholder farmers selected from five agro-ecosystems. A structured questionnaire was used to collect primary data and a review of literature and documents was used to collect secondary data. The study used a multivariate probit model to examine perception factors affecting the likelihood of adopting multiple CSA innovations. The dependent variables were eight CSA innovations, while the independent variables were crafted from the three pillars of CSA. Findings Major CSA innovations adopted by farmers include improved variety, crop residue management, crop rotation, compost, row planting, soil and water conservation, intercropping and agroforestry. Farmers' perception toward CSA innovations includes: CSA innovations sustainably increase productivity and income; enhance soil fertility; diversify livestock feed and energy sources; reduce soil erosion, weed infestation and crop failure; enhance soil organic matter, reduce chemical fertilizer use and rehabilitate land. Farmers' positive perceptions of the benefits of CSA innovations for increasing crop productivity, reducing agricultural vulnerability to climate change and lowering farm greenhouse gas emissions have boosted adoption. Practical implications Farmers' perceptions toward CSA innovations must be enhanced to increase the adoption of CSA innovations in the smallholder agriculture system. The CSA innovation scale-up strategies should focus on farmers' perception of CSA innovation benefits toward food security, climate change adaption and mitigation outcomes. Awareness of CSA needs the close collaboration of public extension as well as local institutions such as farmers' training centers. Originality/value The study adopts a multivariate probit model that models farmers' simultaneous CSA innovation choices. Hence, this study contributes to the literature in four significant areas.

The dependency of Africa's population on generating income mostly from the agricultural resource base combined with persistent poverty and food insecurity increases exposure and vulnerability to climate variability and climate change. In this paper an approach is outlined for the rapid identification of agricultural areas under stress due to potential mismatches between natural resource availability under changing climatic conditions and needs for a growing and largely agricultural population. In this approach spatial data on climate, soils, topography, and water resources for agriculture were converted into thematic indices to quantify spatial variations in the resource base under baseline 1960-1990 climatic conditions and climate change projections for 2050. These indices were combined to produce integrated agricultural resource availability indices, which were then combined with population density using a per-capita Agricultural Resource Availability Index, which was subjected to a hotspot-cold spot analysis. The hotspot-cold spot analysis allows to make a rapid synthesis of changes in the agricultural resource base under various climate change projections and population pressure. The results of the analysis indicate that in all African countries, the per-capita Agricultural Resource Availability Index tends to decline under climate change projections combined with population growth. Countries that currently already are hotspots (Burkina Faso, Burundi, Nigeria, Rwanda) remain hotspots entirely, whereas countries with significant 'cold spot' areas (Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and to a lesser extent Ethiopia) see these areas further turn into hotspots due to combined effect of population growth and climate change scenario used. The impact of climatic change is expected to be greater where rural populations are dense, poorer and largely dependent on income generation from agriculture. The analysis can serve as an exploratory medium-term and broad-spectrum forecasting tool for identifying areas that either already are or could eventually become stressed in their food security due to the combination of climate change and pressure on the resource base from population increase. Introducing capabilities in medium-term warning at the national level could be facilitated greatly by starting or strengthening the process of compiling relevant databases that allow a better synthesis within countries of the likely evolution of the agricultural resource base under climate change. Many data, even if imperfect, already exist for this purpose and could serve as very useful additions for national-level climate change adaptation responses, which offers principles, practices and options for 'cooling off' hotspots.","[De Pauw, Eddy; Ramasamy, Selvaraju] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Rome, Italy",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"De Pauw, E (corresponding author), Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Rome, Italy.",edepauw@pavocarto.be; selvaraju.ramasamy@fao.org,,,project on Climate change predictions in sub-Saharan Africa: Impacts and adaptations - European Commission [244240]; FAO's regular programme funds,project on Climate change predictions in sub-Saharan Africa: Impacts and adaptations - European Commission; FAO's regular programme funds,"The work was supported through a project on Climate change predictions in sub-Saharan Africa: Impacts and adaptations funded by European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme (FP7),Grant agreement 244240, and partly through FAO's regular programme funds.

A major constraint for crop production is the amount of rainfall and its intra and inter-annual variability. We evaluated the effects of planting date on the yield of different varieties of four major crops (maize, millet, sorghum and cotton) over three contrasting growing seasons in 2009-2011 (with 842 mm, 1248 mm and 685 mm of rainfall respectively) with the aim of identifying climate adaptation options in the Sudano-Sahelian region. Three planting dates (early, medium, and late) and three varieties of long, medium, and short duration of each crop were compared. For fertilized cereal crops, maize out yielded millet and sorghum by respectively 57% and 45% across the three seasons. Analysis of 40 years of weather data indicates that this finding holds for the longer time periods than the length of this trial. Late planting resulted in significant yield decreases for maize, sorghum and cotton, but not for millet. However, a short duration variety of millet was better adapted for late planting. When the rainy season starts late, sorghum planting can be delayed from the beginning of June to early July without substantial reductions in grain yield. Cotton yield at early planting was 28% larger than yield at medium planting and late planting gave the lowest yield with all three varieties. For all four crops the largest stover yields were obtained with early planting and the longer planting was delayed, the less stover was produced. There was an interaction between planting date and variety for millet and sorghum, while for maize and cotton the best planting date was more affected by the weather conditions. The findings of this study can support simple adaptation decisions: priority should be given to planting cotton early; maize is the best option if fertilizer is available; planting of maize and sorghum can be delayed by up to a month without strong yield penalties; and millet should be planted last.

Although large-scale engineered interventions have been common for the purposes of risk reduction and adaptation in the past, emerging ecosystem-based approaches are gaining attention. In contrast to 'hard' infrastructure, ecosystem-based solutions that integrate risk management priorities with natural processes are touted as being more cost effective, socially equitable, and environmentally sustainable. Current developments in ecosystem-based approaches to climate adaptation (EbA) and ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) tend to focus on scientific projections, engineering techniques, and their respective roles in shaping economic benefits. However, recent studies show that effective implementation of such solutions is dependent on the governance practices and interactions between relevant actors, interests, and institutional structures. In response, this paper reviews the current status of governance studies in the context of EbA and Eco-DRR. The analysis is grounded in the interdisciplinary theories of governance, socio-ecological systems, infrastructure studies, and multilevel politics, with sources derived from scientific databases including Scopus and Science Direct advanced query. Based on the review, we evaluate existing governance theories, assessment methods, and implementation through illustrating emblematic examples from around the world. The paper concludes with a synthesis of governance gaps and opportunities, and notes that while emerging ecological engineering approaches provide distinct opportunities, there is a lack of comprehensive assessment beyond diagnosing potential financial, institutional, and political shortfalls. We therefore highlight the need for future research on the socio-ecological, spatial/scalar, and political dimensions of EbA and Eco-DRR.","[Triyanti, Annisa] Univ Amsterdam, Governance & Inclus Dev, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Chu, Eric] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Amsterdam; University of Birmingham,"Triyanti, A (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Governance & Inclus Dev, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",A.Triyanti@uva.nl; E.Chu@bham.ac.uk,"Chu, Eric/O-6464-2015","Chu, Eric/0000-0002-5648-6615; Triyanti, Annisa/0000-0001-5524-7551",,,,,138,20,21,3,55,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

Recent paleoclimate reconstructions from the Beas River Valley demonstrate hydro-climatic stress due to a weakened monsoon system may have impacted urban centers like Harappa by the end of the third millennium B.

Climate, economic, and social changes contributed to the disintegration of this civilization after 1900 B. C. We assess evidence for paleopathology to infer the biological consequences of climate change and socio-economic disruption in the post-urban period at Harappa, one of the largest urban centers in the Indus Civilization. Bioarchaeological evidence demonstrates the prevalence of infection and infectious disease increased through time. Furthermore, the risk for infection and disease was uneven among burial communities. Corresponding mortuary differences suggest that socially and economically marginalized communities were most vulnerable in the context of climate uncertainty at Harappa. Combined with prior evidence for increasing levels of interpersonal violence, our data support a growing pathology of power at Harappa after 2000 B. C.

Water management, which will be particularly affected by climate change, could provide an opportunity to initiate structured adaptation responses. Adaptation costs in the sub-Saharan urban water sector are estimated at between 10 and 20 per cent of current overseas development assistance to the region. This paper suggests that additional funding should be made available in terms of the polluter pays principle, and should be channelled through government budgets rather than ring-fenced climate funds. This would help ensure that climate proofing is mainstreamed and would be in keeping with current trends in overseas development assistance reflected in the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.","Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Publ & Dev Management, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Muller, M (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Publ & Dev Management, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa.",mikemuller1949@gmail.com,"Muller, MikesIESn/HLQ-6114-2023; muller, mike/AAI-5023-2020","muller, mike/0000-0002-4252-3200",,,,,30,125,128,4,145,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

However, little is known about whether and how adaptation is occurring among people in these ecosystems. Understanding adaptation at the level of individuals, including members of households and extended families, is especially important because it is the level at which people most directly experience climate change impacts and engage in behavioral change. I offer a framework for characterizing the responses of individual landowners to climate change impacts in terms of adaptation behavior, and distinguishing adaptation from coping. The framework expands existing typologies of adaptation behavior to include a hierarchy of three analytical units of behavior: activities, practices, and strategies. I illustrate the framework by applying it to landowners' responses to climate change impacts in temperate forests, a biome that is undergoing dramatic change. Individuals own and rely on large proportions of land in many temperate forest countries and are therefore exposed and sensitive to climate change impacts. Through management, they also influence how forests and their own well-being are affected by climate change. By improving characterizations of behavioral responses to climate change, the framework I propose can help researchers and practitioners evaluate progress toward adaptation with greater rigor.","[Fischer, Alexandra Paige] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Fischer, AP (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",apfisch@umich.edu,"Fischer, Alexandra Paige/D-4068-2016","Fischer, Alexandra Paige/0000-0003-2274-1689",USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntire Stennis project [1011135]; Forest Service Northern Research Station,USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntire Stennis project; Forest Service Northern Research Station,"I acknowledge support from USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntire Stennis project 1011135 and Forest Service Northern Research Station, and thank Matt Hamilton, Michal Russo, Aniseh Bro, and Garrett Powers for reviewing previous drafts of this article.",,85,12,12,5,29,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-2046,1872-6062,,LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN,Landsc.

Climatic stimuli include changes in long-term mean conditions and variability about means, both current and future, and including extremes. Adaptation depends fundamentally on the characteristics of the system of interest, including its sensitivities and vulnerabilities. The nature of adaptation processes and forms can be distinguished by numerous attributes including timing, purposefulness, and effect.

However, so far a systematic application to climate policy (CP) does not exist. One important postulation of PT is that outcomes are perceived as gains or losses, relative to the reference point. When it comes to CP, different decision-makers may have different reference points. For example, one decision-maker perceives the current climate as the reference point whereas another decision-maker may have another one, say climate in 100years. For the former, climate damages are losses and the benefits of CP are reductions of losses. For the latter, benefits of CP are gains. PT suggests that the former places a higher value in CP than the latter. After a critical review whether and how PT may be applied to CP, the paper systematically presents this and other cases where PT offers new insights into climate-related analyses, notwithstanding the importance of well-known aspects such as discounting, altruism, political and economic costs. It is shown that accounting for PT may contribute to a better understanding of some well-known puzzles in the climate debate, including different preferences for CP amongst individuals and nations, the role of technical vs. financial adaptation, and the apparent preference for hard protection measures in coastal adaptation. Finally, concrete possibilities for empirical research on these effects are proposed.","[Osberghaus, Daniel] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Osberghaus, D (corresponding author), Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany.",osberghaus@zew.de,,,,,,,95,14,14,2,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-9877,1466-4461,,J RISK RES,J.

However, modelling studies consistently have projected that climate change is likely to increase the intensity of cyclones and the related rainfall rates in the future. A precautionary approach to this possibility is to adapt to the adverse effects of the changing climate by improving early warning services for cyclones as a 'no or low-regrets' option. Given limited funding resources, assessments of economic efficiency will be necessary, and values for benefits are an essential input. This paper aims to estimate the benefits to households of an improved cyclone warning service in Vietnam. Choice experiment surveys with 1014 respondents were designed and conducted to inform this paper. The benefit estimates of the maximal improvements in a number of attributes of cyclone warning services (i.e. forecasting accuracy, frequency of update, and mobile phone based warnings) are approximately USD7.1-8.1 per household, which would be an upper bound estimate. Results from the marginal willingness to pay for the attributes suggest that investments should be dedicated to improvements in the accuracy of warning information and a warning service based on mobile phone short message.

Our data suggest that beyond their immediate benefits for their participants, expressions of collective action generate higher-level impacts which often translate into drivers of adaptive capacity. Drawing on a metaphor from urban design, we suggest that collective action should be considered a desire line for food systems adaptation: rather than building adaptation strategies based on top-down design, collective action emerges from farmers' needs and capacities to build financial resilience, enhance human and social capital and strengthen institutional agency within the system.

Unilateral environmental regulations can increase the outsourcing probability of polluting production processes in regions with looser environmental regulations and can consequently alter trade patterns by changing comparative advantage. The Kyoto Protocol (KP) is considered as one of the international but unilateral environmental regulations for coping with climate changes. This protocol was implemented to mitigate emissions in industrial economies, and its potential side effects such as production relocation have always been controversial. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the impacts of the KP on trade patterns of the ratifying countries within the context of global value chains (GVCs). For this purpose, the difference-in-differences (DiD) regression and the generalized synthetic control method (GSCM) were used to model the panel data during 1990-2017. The estimation results indicated that the KP ratification decreased the forward participation of the committed countries, while increased their backward participation. As a result, it deepened their relative downstream positions in the GVCs. Accordingly, the KP reduced the share of intermediate goods and services exports in committed countries that ratified KP but increased the share of foreign intermediate goods and services in their exports.

The current study extends these efforts by specifically addressing the effect of climate change on the African road infrastructure. The study identifies both total costs and opportunity costs of repairing and maintaining infrastructure due to increased stressors from climate change. Proactive and reactive costs are examined for six climate scenarios, with costs ranging, respectively, from an average of $22 million USD to $54 million USD annually per country.

We provide a novel, systematic characterization of breed-based behavioral differences to assist researchers and beef producers in selecting breed-based management strategies for achieving adaptation goals. We conducted a systematic search of studies that compared beef cattle breeds for behavioral trends, and found 54 studies conducted between 1966 and present day, located in 9 of the 14 major terrestrial world biomes, with 60 beef or dual-purpose breeds represented. We created a typology of the studies with respect to decade, continent, breed provenance (Conti-nental, Criollo, Hybrid, B. indicus, Mediterranean, Sanga, British Isles), breed selection intensity (heritage, conventional, hybrid), biome, study intent, and whether breeds met desired outcomes described by the study authors. Most studies (69%) were conducted in arid rangeland settings in developed nations where researchers sought to minimize the environmental impacts of beef production. In comparisons of grazing behavior of heritage versus conventional types (n = 25 studies), and hybrid versus conventional types (n = 18 studies), heritage and hybrid displayed more adapted traits (e.g., better grazing distribution) in 88% and 78% of the studies, respec-tively. No differences were found in grazing behaviors among most studies wherein heritage breeds were compared to other heritage breeds or conventional with conventional (n = 6 and 15 studies, respectively). In the subset of studies coded with the intent of foraging behavior, heritage types traveled faster across a range of pasture sizes, suggesting a lighter environmental footprint and adaptive capacity to heat impacts. Overall, our review suggests that locally derived breeds display grazing behaviors that demonstrate adaptation to their respective native environments and may help producers meet production goals in similar environments. We conclude that breeds with more natural selection tend to exhibit less rigid grazing behaviors, which is a necessary coping strategy in variable climates and locales with heterogeneous forage availability, both of which are increasingly common scenarios caused by climate change.","[McIntosh, Matthew M.; Spiegal, Sheri A.; Sanchez, Jose Castano; Estell, Richard E.] US Dept Agr Agr Res Serv Jornada Expt Range, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [McIntosh, Stacia Z.] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Bailey, Derek W.] New Mexico State Univ, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Steele, Caitriana M.; Elias, Emile H.; Brown, Joel R.] US Dept Agr Agr Res Serv Southwest Climate Hub, Jornada Expt Range, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Cibils, Andres F.] Oklahoma & Cent Plains Ag Res Ctr, US Dept Agr Southern Plains Climate Hub, USDA Agr Res Serv, El Reno, OK 73036 USA",University of Arizona; New Mexico State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"McIntosh, MM (corresponding author), US Dept Agr Agr Res Serv Jornada Expt Range, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",mattmac@nmsu.edu,,"McIntosh, Matthew/0000-0002-8957-8735",Long -Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network; USDA; USDA-NIFA-AFRI 's Sustainable South- west Beef Coordinated Agricultural Project [12726269],Long -Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network; USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); USDA-NIFA-AFRI 's Sustainable South- west Beef Coordinated Agricultural Project,This research was a contribution from the Long -Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network; LTAR is supported by the USDA.

In this Perspective, we show that there is a significant opportunity to advance the understanding of adaptation governance by integrating insights that have been developed in the extensive commons literature on the institutions that work to overcome social conflicts or dilemmas. 'Realist-materialist' approaches to understanding such collective action are particularly valuable to adaptation governance research because they emphasize how biophysical conditions give rise to certain types of social dilemma. Climate change affects these biophysical conditions, and thus may alter dilemmas or create new ones. Based on realist-materialist reasoning, this Perspective describes six types of dilemma, illustrates each with a case from the adaptation literature and draws on insights from the commons literature regarding relevant contextual conditions and effective policy instruments for overcoming social dilemmas. The dilemma types provide entry points for rigorous comparative adaptation research to deepen understanding of how context influences adaptation governance processes.","[Bisaro, Alexander; Hinkel, Jochen] Global Climate Forum, Neue Promenade 6, D-10178 Berlin, Germany; [Hinkel, Jochen] Humboldt Univ, Div Resource Econ, Albrecht Daniel Thaer Inst, Fac Life Sci, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Bisaro, A (corresponding author), Global Climate Forum, Neue Promenade 6, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",sandy.bisaro@globalclimateforum.org,,"Bisaro, Alexander/0000-0003-4281-0012; Hinkel, Jochen/0000-0001-7590-992X","EU [603396, 642018]",EU(European Commission),This work has been supported by the EU-funded projects RISES-AM (grant no. 603396) and GREEN-WIN (grant no. 642018).,,68,64,63,1,45,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1758-678X,1758-6798,,NAT CLIM CHANGE,Nat.

The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect and summer-time heat waves can significantly affect urban microclimate with negative consequences for human mortality and morbidity and building energy demand. So far, most studies on urban microclimate employed observational approaches with field measurements. However, in order to provide more information towards the design of climate adaptive urban areas, deterministic analyses are required. In this study, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed to predict urban temperatures in the Bergpolder Zuid region in Rotterdam, which is planned to be renovated to increase its climate resilience. 3D unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations with the realizable k-epsilon turbulence model are performed on a high-resolution computational grid. The simulations include wind flow and heat transfer by conduction, convection and radiation. The resulting surface temperatures are validated using experimental data from high-resolution thermal infrared satellite imagery performed during the heat wave of July 2006. The results show that the CFD simulations are able to predict urban surface temperatures with an average deviation of 7.9% from the experimental data. It is concluded that CFD has the potential of accurately predicting urban microclimate. Results from CFD simulations can therefore be used to identify problem areas and to evaluate the effect of climate adaptation measures in these areas such as urban greening and evaporative cooling.

The first has encouraged the development and use of mathematical models to enhance the efficiency of field research through extrapolation beyond the limits of site, season, and management. The second reflects the increasing need (by scientists, managers, and the public) for simulation experimentation to explore options and consequences, for example, future resource use efficiency (i.e., management in sustainable intensification), impacts of and adaptation to climate change, understanding market and policy responses to shocks initiated at a biophysical level under increasing demand, and limited supply capacity. Production concerns thus dominate most model applications, but there is a notable growing emphasis on environmental, economic, and policy dimensions. Identifying effective methods of assessing model quality and performance has become a challenging but vital imperative, considering the variety of factors influencing model outputs. Understanding the requirements of stakeholders, in respect of model use, logically implies the need for their inclusion in model evaluation methods. We reviewed the use of metrics of model evaluation, with a particular emphasis on the involvement of stakeholders to expand horizons beyond conventional structured, numeric analyses. Two major topics are discussed: (1) the importance of deliberative processes for model evaluation, and (2) the role computer-aided techniques may play to integrate deliberative processes into the evaluation of agroecological models. We point out that (i) the evaluation of agroecological models can be improved through stakeholder follow-up, which is a key for the acceptability of model realizations in practice, (ii) model credibility depends not only on the outcomes of well-structured, numerically based evaluation, but also on less tangible factors that may need to be addressed using complementary deliberative processes, (iii) comprehensive evaluation of simulation models can be achieved by integrating the expectations of stakeholders via a weighting system of preferences and perception, (iv) questionnaire-based surveys can help understand the challenges posed by the deliberative process, and (v) a benefit can be obtained if model evaluation is conceived in a decisional perspective and evaluation techniques are developed at the same pace with which the models themselves are created and improved. Scientific knowledge hubs are also recognized as critical pillars to advance good modeling practice in relation to model evaluation (including access to dedicated software tools), an activity which is frequently neglected in the context of time-limited framework programs.","[Bellocchi, Gianni] French Natl Inst Agr Res, Grassland Ecosyst Res Unit, F-63039 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Rivington, Mike; Matthews, Keith] James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Acutis, Marco] Univ Milan, Dept Agr & Environm Sci Prod, Landscape, Agroenergy, Milan, Italy",INRAE; James Hutton Institute; University of Milan,"Bellocchi, G (corresponding author), French Natl Inst Agr Res, Grassland Ecosyst Res Unit, 5 Chemin Beaulieu, F-63039 Clermont Ferrand, France.",gianni.bellocchi@clermont.inra.fr,"Acutis, Marco/E-9722-2010; Acutis, Marco/S-8114-2019","Acutis, Marco/0000-0002-1576-8261; Matthews, Keith/0000-0001-8472-8872","MACSUR FACCE knowledge hub; CN-MIP project - French National Research Agency under the multipartner Call on Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research (FACCE-JPI) [ANR-13-JFAC-0001]; European Community's Seventh Framework Programme-FP7 [KBBE. 2013.1.4-09, 613817]",MACSUR FACCE knowledge hub; CN-MIP project - French National Research Agency under the multipartner Call on Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research (FACCE-JPI)(French National Research Agency (ANR)); European Community's Seventh Framework Programme-FP7,"This study was supported by the MACSUR FACCE knowledge hub (http://macsur.eu), the CN-MIP project funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR-13-JFAC-0001) under the multipartner Call on Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research (FACCE-JPI) and the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme-FP7 (KBBE. 2013.1.4-09) under Grant Agreement No. 613817 (MODEXTREME, http:///www.modextreme.org).

The Mann-Kendall (MK) test with Sen's slope estimator and Sen's Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) have been used for detecting the trend of the hydro-meteorological parameters-temperature and rainfall. The temperature trend during the period 1979-2014 has been analyzed using MK test and ITA method. The annual maximum, annual minimum and annual mean temperature analysis is carried out for 5 weather stations in the basin. Also, the trend has been analyzed using MK test and ITA method for annual rainfall for 9 raingauging stations for three time periods i.e. 1928-2013, 1955-2013, and 1970-2013. Most of the results obtained from these two methods for trend detection of these hydro-meteorological parameters are found to be matching. Further, the results of this study shown that the annual maximum, minimum and mean temperature increases at trend value of 0.009 degrees C/yr, 0.0244 degrees C/yr and 0.0188 degrees C/yr, respectively, over the LTRB during 1979-2014. The annual rainfall increases at the trend value of 2.185 mm/yr, 4.181 mm/yr and 5.495 mm/yr for the period of 1928-2013, 1955-2013 and 1970-2013 respectively. The magnitude of upward (positive) trend of annual rainfall is greater for the period of 1955-2013 and 1970-2013 in comparison to the period of 1928-2013. The spatial distribution of temporal trend of these hydro-meteorological parameters have been represented in Arc-GIS 10.3. The results of Spatio-Temporal trend distribution over the study area shown that the annual mean and annual minimum temperature indicates the upward (positive) trend over whole LTRB, while annual maximum temperature indicates the upward (positive) trend over the basin except west coastal region of LTRB. The annual rainfall exhibits upward (positive) trend in all three time periods over entire LTRB. The trend (positive/negative) detected for mean temperature and annual rainfall is found to be consistent with the trend noticed by Indian Meteorological Department for the state of Gujarat. The spatial distribution of trend further needs to be analyzed to correlate it with changing pattern of land use - land cover over a period of time. The present case study for the assessment of climate change would be useful to the water resources engineers for planning and management and policy decisions for climate change adaptation in the study area.","[Chandole, Vishal; Joshi, Geeta S.; Rana, Shilpesh C.] Maharaja Sayajirao Univ Baroda, Civil Engn Dept, Fac Technol & Engn, Vadodara, India",Maharaja Sayajirao University Baroda,"Joshi, GS (corresponding author), Maharaja Sayajirao Univ Baroda, Civil Engn Dept, Fac Technol & Engn, Vadodara, India.",chandolevishal@gmail.com; geeta.joshi-ced@msubaroda.ac.in; shilpesh1978@yahoo.co.in,"Joshi, Geeta S./AAA-3458-2020","Joshi, Geeta S./0000-0001-7006-2379; Chandole, Vishal/0000-0003-3325-8692",Higher Education Department and Climate Change Department of state Government of Gujarat of India,Higher Education Department and Climate Change Department of state Government of Gujarat of India,"The authors are thankful to the Higher Education Department and Climate Change Department of state Government of Gujarat of India for funding the climate change project, under which this study has been carried out.",,55,10,10,2,9,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-6826,1879-1824,,J ATMOS SOL-TERR PHY,J.

J,"Holton, NE; Franciscus, RG",,,,"Holton, Nathan E.; Franciscus, Robert G.",,,The paradox of a wide nasal aperture in cold-adapted Neandertals: a causal assessment,JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Nasal breadth; Anterior palate breadth; Facial growth; Climatic adaptation,NATURAL-SELECTION; CRANIAL BASE; EVOLUTION; GROWTH; SHAPE; NOSE; FACE; INTEGRATION; ADAPTATION; PATTERNS,"Neandertals have been characterized as possessing features indicative of cold-climate adaptation largely based on ecogeographical morphological patterning found in recent humans. Interestingly, one character that deviates from this pattern is a relatively wide nasal aperture. The ecogeographical patterning of the nasal aperture in recent humans would predict instead that Neandertals should exhibit reduced nasal breadth dimensions. To explain this apparent anomaly it has been argued that a reduction in Neandertal nasal breadth was not possible due to dentognathic constraints on their midfaces via large anterior palatal breadth dimensions, especially large intercanine distances. A complicating factor in understanding the relationship between anterior palate breadth and nasal breadth is that both measurements are also correlated with facial prognathism. It is, therefore, unknown to what degree the relationship between anterior palate breadth and nasal breadth in Neandertals is a function of the pleisiomorphic retention of a prognathic facial skeleton. We used path analysis to test for a causal relationship between intercanine breadth and nasal breadth taking into account the potential effect of facial projection and facial prognathism (i.e., basion-nasion length and basion-prosthion length) using a large sample of geographically diverse recent and fossil Homo. Additionally, we examined the ontogenetic relationship between nasal breadth and intercanine breadth using a longitudinal human growth series to determine whether these variables exhibit similar growth trajectories. The results of these analyses indicate a weaker association between intercanine breadth and nasal breadth than expected, and that more variation in nasal breadth can be explained through basion-prosthion length rather than anterior palatal breadth dimensions. Moreover, the ontogenetic development of anterior palate breadth does not correspond to the growth trajectory of the breadth of the nose. These results explain the apparent paradox of wide piriform apertures in generally cooler climate-adapted Neandertals without resorting to dentognathic constraints, and provide additional insight into both the adaptive and nonadaptive (i.e., neutral) basis for Neandertal facial evolution.

While the existing literature on climate variability and climate change makes important theoretical contributions on development, vulnerability, and adaptation more broadly, with few exceptions it has not acknowledged that contradictions arise in addressing insecurities via the implementation of development, vulnerability reduction, and adaptation programs. An empirical assessment of how such contradictions are both driven by and negotiated in such programs is particularly useful if we are to design a more robust and grounded adaptation agenda. In this article, we focus on the paradigmatic case of Gambella in Ethiopia, a region that lies near the bottom of many development indices, but has also been the site for recent efforts to reduce climate vulnerability through village and agricultural modernization programs. Drawing on recent research in the region and on these programs, we demonstrate how the politics of development and adaptation lead to differential and contradictory impacts on four arenas of human security (a) elements of water security, (b) temporal aspects of water security and livelihoods security, (c) personal, state and community security, and (d) differentiated geographies economic security which privilege the national and international scale. The result of this complex political economy is that responses have served to increase rather than decrease tensions in the region. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The rise in sea level and increase in the frequency and intensity of climate-induced coastal hazards are threatening the increasing coastal populations. Brazil, with its 8,500 km of coast, is one of the countries most at risk from coastal flooding and erosion. Nature-based solutions have been suggested as climate adaptation strategies with the greatest potential to counteract coastal hazards stemming from sea-level rise and safeguard coastal cities. However, there is still a knowledge gap in the scientific literature on the effectiveness of naturebased solutions, especially at large spatial scales in Central and South America. Here, we assessed the risks from climate-induced hazards of coastal erosion and flooding related to sea-level rise on the Brazilian coast, and the effectiveness of nature-based solutions as climate adaptation strategies. We reveal that nature-based shoreline protection can reduce by 2.5 times the risks to the Brazilian coastline. The loss of existing natural habitats would substantially increase the area and population at risk from these climate-induced hazards. Worrisomely, legal mechanisms to protect these natural habitats are few and being weakened. Only 10% of the coastal natural habitats are within protected areas, and these alone do not ensure coastal protection, as our results indicate that the loss of unprotected natural habitats has about the same risk as the total absence of natural habitats. Our results warn of the severe consequences of the continued loss of natural habitats along the coast. Thus, actions towards the maintenance and protection of coastal habitats are paramount for climate adaptation and to ensure the well-being and livelihoods of coastal populations. Brazil has a central role in demonstrating the benefits of strategies based on nature-based solutions for shoreline protection, favoring their implementation worldwide. We provide both the natural habitat maps and the maps with model results with spatial and numerical information so readers can explore the relations between the natural habitats and coastal risk indexes at a subnational level and foster their use by local stakeholders.","[Manes, Stella; Gama-Maia, Danielle; Vaz, Stephanie] Fed Univ Rio de Janeiro UFRJ, Ctr Ciencias Saude, Grad Program Ecol, Ave Carlos Chagas Filho,373,Block A, BR-21941590 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Gama-Maia, Danielle] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro UFRJ, Lab Vertebrados, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Vaz, Stephanie] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, Lab Ecol Insetos, Inst Biol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Vaz, Stephanie] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Zool, Lab Polychaeta, Inst Biol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Pires, Aliny P.

For this reason, a bidirectional fixed effect model based on panel data of 30 provinces (cities and autonomous regions) in China is empirically tested. The results show that the digital economy can significantly improve the level of common prosperity, and has a positive impact on green and sustainable economic activities such as promoting environmental improvement, coping with climate change and resource conservation and efficient utilization, which is still valid after a series of robustness tests. It also demonstrates the role of green finance as a partial intermediary in the process of shared prosperity and as a negative regulator of environmental pollution. Analysis of regional heterogeneity shows that the enabling effect of the digital economy on common prosperity is more significant in eastern and central provinces, but not significant in western provinces. The results of this study have some reference significance for some countries, where the gap between rich and poor has widened during the epidemic, to narrow the income gap and provide ideas for the parties that made commitments at the Glasgow Climate Summit (COP26) to curb warming and reduce CO2 emissions.

Taking the case of Khulna city, Bangladesh, in this paper we follow a two-pronged approach. First, we use remote sensing techniques to analyze the changing land use and land cover patterns (LULC) and their relationship with emerging land surface temperature (LST) change, that results in urban heat islands (UHI). Second, we follow up on the emergent results from the remote sensing analysis to draw key links with the existing UHI spatio-temporal variations with existing and future planning pathways. Our findings suggest that rapidly reducing green spaces and increased built-up areas are contributing strongly towards increasing UHI. The overall increase of LST in the city is nearly 2 degrees C in the past 5 years, which calls for more urgent climate adaptive planning and action. Document analysis of the Khulna city master plan demonstrates that several mitigation strategies were initiated through the Khulna Master Plan 2001, yet key implementation barriers continue to persist. We conclude by arguing for a holistic approach to green space planning in the city (through strategic action and institutional planning approaches), coupled with local scaled adaptation and mitigation strategies, that can help the planning process to deal with the challenges associated with UHI increase in urban areas.","[Leya, Rabeya Sultana; Jodder, Pankaj Kanti] Khulna Univ, Urban & Rural Planning Discipline, Khulna, Bangladesh; [Rahaman, Khan Rubayet] St Marys Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, 923 Robie St, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada; [Chowdhury, Md Arif] Jashore Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Climate & Disaster Management, Jashore 7408, Bangladesh; [Parida, Debadutta] Univ Alberta, Sch Urban & Reg Planning, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Islam, Mohammed Sharif] Univ Mississippi, Dept Polit Sci, Oxford, MS USA",Khulna University; Saint Marys University - Canada; University of Alberta; University of Mississippi,"Parida, D (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Sch Urban & Reg Planning, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",rabeya.leya@ku.ac.bd; pankajkantijodder@gmail.com; khan.rahaman@smu.ca; arifchowdhury065@gmail.com; dparida@ualberta.ca; mislam2@go.olemiss.edu,,,,,,,72,2,2,4,7,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2509-9426,2509-9434,,EARTH SYST ENVIRON,Earth Syst.

To acknowledge this need, we propose the term ecological renovation to describe ecological management and nature conservation actions that actively allow for environmental change. To evaluate and progress the development of ecological renovation and related intervention options in a climate change context, we reviewed the literature and established a typology of options that have been proposed. We explored how these options address emerging principles underpinning climate-adapted conservation goals and whether the balance of approaches reflected in our typology is likely to be sufficient given expected rapid rates of climate change. Our typology recognizes a matrix of 23 intervention option types arranged on the basis of underpinning ecological mechanisms (ameliorate changing conditions or build adaptive capacity) on one axis, and the nature of the tools used to manipulate them (low regrets or climate targeted) on the other. Despite a burgeoning literature since 2008, we found that the majority of effort has consistently focused on low-regrets adaptation approaches that aim to build adaptive capacity. This is in many ways desirable, but a paradigm shift enabling greater attention to climate-targeted approaches is likely to be needed as climate change accelerates. When assessed against five emerging principles for setting nature conservation goals in a changing climate, only one option type could deliver to all five, and we identified a conflict between climate-targeted options and wildness values that calls for deeper evaluation. Importantly, much of the inference in the 473 reviewed studies was drawn from ecological reasoning and modeling, with only 16% offering new empirical evidence. We also noted significant biases toward North America and Europe, forest ecosystems, trees, and vertebrates. To address these limitations and help shift the paradigm toward humans as renovators rather than restorers of a prior world, we propose that ecological researchers contribute by (1) informing societal discourse toward adapting nature conservation goals to climate change, (2) adjusting and upscaling conservation planning to accommodate this suite of climate-adapted goals, and (3) reconceptualizing experimental approaches to increase empirical evidence and expedite innovation of tools to address change.","[Prober, Suzanne M.] CSIRO Land & Water, Private Bag 5, Wembley, WA 6913, Australia; [Doerr, Veronica A.

Deep cuts in emissions must be made rapidly to avoid warming of 2 degrees above preindustrial levels but this is most unlikely, given present trends. It is possible that warming may in fact reach 4 degrees C or more by 2100. Risks to health result principally from the effects of climate change on local food production, severity and frequency of storms and floods, threats to water supplies, and the direct effects of heat. The health sector has an important role protecting health in times of climate change. However, other sectors must be involved as well-steps taken in agriculture, urban planning, water and civil defence, for instance, will have implications for prevention of illness and injury. We offer a framework for planning adaptation, taking into account present climate-sensitive health problems, control options, and constraints. (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Thus, an important issue is the impact on crop production by land use change under such policies and by notable climate variability during the past decades. Using a productivity attenuation method, we estimated the climatic productivity of winter wheat (WWCP) in the North China Plain, based on land use classification data and daily weather data from 1980 to 2010. Impacts of historic climate variability and land use change on WWCP were quantified. Results indicate: (1) on average, WWCP for newly-increased dry land was lower than that for the lost land, which may result in reduced land quality associated with conversion. (2) In recent years, the increasing area of dry land provided sufficient wheat yield to compensate for the loss resulted from reduction of WWCP. (3) Both historic climate variability and land use change decreased WWCP, but the effects of the latter (within - 1%) were less than those of the former (about - 3%). Given the scarce land resource and rapidly growing food demand, the approach through expanding the area of cultivated land to maintain grain yield is not a long-term guarantee of food security. Thus, cultivated land conservation policy should shift from protecting land quantity into preserving land productivity. In addition, agriculture policies should further emphasize the critical role of adaptation strategies in coping with climate change. Obtaining higher yield production will depend upon adopting adaptation measures which could effectively mitigate effects of dramatic climate change or even take advantage of possible climate conditions.","[Chen, Qiaomin; Liu, Yujie; Ge, Quansheng; Pan, Tao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Chen, Qiaomin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Liu, YJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",liuyujie@igsnrr.ac.cn,,"Ge, Quansheng/0000-0001-8712-8565; Liu, Yujie/0000-0002-0751-6857; Chen, Qiaomin/0000-0003-0628-8896","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41671037, 41301091]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS [2016049]; Program for Kezhen Excellent Talents in IGSNRR of CAS [2017RC101]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences of CAS [QYZDB-SSW-DQC005]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS; Program for Kezhen Excellent Talents in IGSNRR of CAS; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences of CAS,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No. 41671037, 41301091]; the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS [Grant No. 2016049]; the Program for Kezhen Excellent Talents in IGSNRR of CAS [Grant No. 2017RC101]; and the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences of CAS [Grant No. QYZDB-SSW-DQC005].",,58,17,18,8,79,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,JUL,2018,76,,,,,,1,9,,10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.04.018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.04.018,,,9,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ8DQ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000435619900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

First, we describe two major challenges: understanding adaptation as a process and recognizing the inadequacy of existing learning tools, with a specific focus on high poverty contexts and complex livelihood-vulnerability risks. Then, the article examines learning processes from a dynamic systems perspective, comparing theoretical aspects and conceptual advances in resilience thinking and action research/learning (AR/AL). Particular attention is paid to learning loops (cycles), critical reflection, spaces for learning, and power. Finally, we outline a methodological framework to facilitate iterative learning processes and adaptive decision making in practice. We stress memory, monitoring of key drivers of change, scenario planning, and measuring anticipatory capacity as crucial ingredients. Our aim is to identify opportunities and obstacles for forward-looking learning processes at the intersection of climatic uncertainty and development challenges in Africa, with the overarching objective to enhance adaptation and resilient livelihood pathways, rather than learning by shock.","[Tschakert, Petra; Dietrich, Kathleen Ann] Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Tschakert, Petra] Penn State Univ, EESI, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Tschakert, P (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,"McLean, Laurence JA/C-7367-2014","Tschakert, Petra/0000-0002-4268-3378","United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [EEM-A- 00-06-00014]; National Science Foundation [0826941]; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0826941] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We wish to thank the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for supporting CCLONG (Climate Change Collective Learning and Observatory Network Ghana; #EEM-A- 00-06-00014) and the National Science Foundation for funding HSD #0826941 on anticipatory learning under climatic uncertainty in Ghana and Tanzania.

The results from a case study show that, first, the model of office + multi-courtyards has positive impact on climatic adaptation, in terms of ventilation, air temperature, thermal radiation environment, and effectiveness of thermal energy conservation. Second, the average energy efficiency rate of the model of office + multi-courtyards is from 12.8% to 4.7% with the interior space coverage of 20%-80%.

This necessitates mainstreaming of climate adaptation strategies in the global movement on climate action. Ecosystem-Based Adaptation (EBA) has become popular as an effective means of climate adaptation, which can be resilient and flexible compared to hard engineering-based measures. However, ecosystem-based approaches in disaster risk reduction still remain under-researched despite their growing popularity. This study delves into the utility of EBA in the context of the living lab, using a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) based Systematic Literature Review. A living lab (LL) is a participatory tool invented to foster innovation through real-life testing environments, such as individual cities. This study focuses on European coastal regions, as these are both highly populated and vulnerable to climate change impacts such as sea-level rise, storms, flooding and erosion. This study identified multiple synergies between the EBA concepts, living lab and disaster-risk reduction and concludes that EBA schemes can be highly effective in the living lab set-up. It also demonstrates that increased stakeholder engagement and the consideration of socio-economic co-benefits as part of the EBA-LL model can lead to successful disaster risk reduction.","[Tiwari, Ananya; Lucy, Frances E.; Gharbia, Salem] Atlantic Technol Univ, Ctr Environm Res Innovat & Sustainabil CERIS, Dept Environm Sci, Sligo F91 YW50, Ireland; [Rodrigues, Luis Campos] ENT Environm & Management, C Josep Llanza 1-7,2nd Floor,3, Vilanova I La Geltru 08800, Spain; [Rodrigues, Luis Campos] Fundacio ENT, C Josep Llanza 1-7,2nd Floor,3, Vilanova I La Geltru 08800, Spain",,"Tiwari, A (corresponding author), Atlantic Technol Univ, Ctr Environm Res Innovat & Sustainabil CERIS, Dept Environm Sci, Sligo F91 YW50, Ireland.",ananya.tiwari@mail.itsligo.ie,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Campos Rodrigues, Luis/0000-0003-1049-4107; Tiwari, Ananya/0000-0001-6573-3043; Gharbia, Salem/0000-0003-2130-1841",European Union [101003534],European Union(European Commission),.

Climate change policy in Bangladesh seeks to replicate adaptation policies under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This paper will briefly review the policy response to climate change in Bangladesh. As climate adaptation requires a multi-sectoral response, relevant policy concerned with climate, adaptation, poverty, gender and health will be studied. This assessment will determine whether gender issues related to adaptation are addressed in key policy pieces in Bangladesh. Key interventions related to climate change will also be assessed to determine whether gender is integrated in operational activity. Finally, the role of women in the development of adaptation policy will be assessed by outlining their participation in adaptation discourse. Findings indicate that gender-sensitive policies are quite limited. Policies may acknowledge the particular vulnerabilities of women, but operational planning to address these is absent.

Along adaptation pathways, people navigate the trade-offs between different ecosystem contributions to adaptation, or adaptation services (AS), and can enhance their synergies and co-benefits as environmental change unfolds. Understanding trade-offs and co-benefits of AS is therefore essential to support social adaptation and requires analysing how people co-produce AS. We analysed co-production along the three steps of the ecosystem cascade: (i) ecosystem management; (ii) mobilization; and (iii) appropriation, social access and appreciation. Using five exemplary case studies across socio-ecosystems and continents, we show how five broad mechanisms already active for current ecosystem services can enhance co-benefits and minimize trade-offs between AS: (1) traditional and multi-functional land/sea management targeting ecological resilience; (2) pro-active management for ecosystem transformation; (3) co-production of novel services in landscapes without compromising other services; (4) collective governance of all co-production steps; and (5) feedbacks from appropriation, appreciation of and social access to main AS. We conclude that knowledge and recognition of co-production mechanisms will enable pro-active management and governance for collective adaptation to ecosystem transformation.

Limits are traditionally analysed as a set of immutable thresholds in biological, economic or technological parameters. This paper contends that limits to adaptation are endogenous to society and hence contingent on ethics, knowledge, attitudes to risk and culture. We review insights from history, sociology and psychology of risk, economics and political science to develop four propositions concerning limits to adaptation. First, any limits to adaptation depend on the ultimate goals of adaptation underpinned by diverse values. Second, adaptation need not be limited by uncertainty around future foresight of risk. Third, social and individual factors limit adaptation action. Fourth, systematic undervaluation of loss of places and culture disguises real, experienced but subjective limits to adaptation. We conclude that these issues of values and ethics, risk, knowledge and culture construct societal limits to adaptation, but that these limits are mutable.","[Adger, W.

The detrimental impact of climate change on food systems and mental health is further exacerbated by a lack of food sovereignty. We urgently require innovative solutions to enable food sovereignty, minimize food insecurity, and address climate change-related mental distress (ie, solastalgia). Indigenous communities have a wealth of Traditional Knowledge for climate change adaptation and preparedness to strengthen food systems. Traditional Knowledge combined with Western methods can revolutionize ethical data collection, engagement, and knowledge mobilization. Objective: The Food Equity and Environmental Data Sovereignty (FEEDS) Project takes a participatory action, citizen science approach for early detection and warning of climate change impacts on food sovereignty, food security, and solastalgia. The aim of this project is to develop and implement a sustainable digital platform that enables real-time decision-making to mitigate climate change-related impacts on food systems and mental well-being. Methods: Citizen science enables citizens to actively contribute to all aspects of the research process. The FEEDS Project is being implemented in five phases: participatory project planning, digital climate change platform customization, community-led evaluation, digital platform and project refinement, and integrated knowledge translation. The project is governed by a Citizen Scientist Advisory Council comprising Elders, Traditional Knowledge Keepers, key community decision makers, youth, and FEEDS Project researchers. The Council governs all phases of the project, including coconceptualizing a climate change platform, which consists of a smartphone app and a digital decision-making dashboard. Apart from capturing environmental and health-related big data (eg, weather, permafrost degradation, fire hazards, and human movement), the custom-built app uses artificial intelligence to engage and enable citizens to report on environmental hazards, changes in biodiversity or wildlife, and related food and mental health issues in their communities. The app provides citizens with valuable information to mitigate health-related risks and relays big data in real time to a digital dashboard. Results: This project is currently in phase 1, with the subarctic Metis jurisdiction of Ile-a-la-Crosse, Saskatchewan, Canada. Conclusions: The FEEDS Project facilitates Indigenous Peoples' self-determination, governance, and data sovereignty. All citizen data are anonymous and encrypted, and communities have ownership, access, control, and possession of their data. The digital dashboard system provides decision makers with real-time data, thereby increasing the capacity to self-govern. The participatory action research approach, combined with digital citizen science, advances the cocreation of knowledge and multidisciplinary collaboration in the digital age. Given the urgency of climate change, leveraging technology provides communities with tools to respond to existing and emerging crises in a timely manner, as well as scientific evidence regarding the urgency of current health and environmental issues.","[Bhawra, Jasmin; Coates, Ken] Univ Saskatchewan, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, 101 Diefenbaker Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B8, Canada; [Skinner, Kelly] Univ Waterloo, Sch Publ Hlth Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Favel, Duane] Northern Village Ile A La Crosse, Ile A La Crosse, SK, Canada; [Green, Brenda] Ile A La Crosse Sch Div, Ile A La Crosse, SK, Canada; [Katapally, Tarun Reddy] Univ Regina, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, Regina, SK, Canada",University of Saskatchewan; University of Waterloo; University of Regina,"Bhawra, J (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, 101 Diefenbaker Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B8, Canada.",jasmin.bhawra@usask.ca,,"Bhawra, Jasmin/0000-0001-9926-8442; KATAPALLY, TARUN REDDY/0000-0001-5765-1435",Saskatchewan Health Research Foundation Establishment grant [3779]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship,Saskatchewan Health Research Foundation Establishment grant; Canadian Institutes of Health Research Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),This study is funded by the Saskatchewan Health Research Foundation Establishment grant #3779 (TRK) and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship (JB) .,,74,2,2,3,16,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY East, Unit 1100, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",1929-0748,,,JMIR RES PROTOC,JMIR RES.

However, the potential impacts of climate change and adaptation on wheat yield has not been documented for this region. Wheat field experiments were carried out during the 2011-2013 cropping seasons in Northern Ethiopia to: (1) calibrate and evaluate Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM)-wheat model for exploring the impacts of climate change and adaptation on wheat yield; (2) explore the response of wheat cultivar/s to possible change in climate and carbon dioxide (CO2) under optimal and sub-optimal fertilizer application and (3) assess the impact of climate change and adaptation practices on wheat yield based on integration of surveyed field data with climate simulations using multi-global climate models (GCMs; for short- and mid-term periods) for the Hintalo-Wajrat areas of Northern Ethiopia. The treatments were two levels of fertilizer (optimal and zero fertilization); treatments were replicated three times and arranged in a randomized complete block design. All required information for model calibration and evaluation were gathered from experimental studies. In addition, a household survey was conducted in 2012 in Northern Ethiopia. Following model calibration and performance testing, response of wheat to various nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates, planting date, temperature and combinations of other climate variables and CO2 were assessed. Crop simulations were conducted with future climate scenarios using 20 different GCMs and compared with a baseline. In addition, simulations were carried out using climate data from five different GCM with and without climate change adaptation practices. The simulated yield showed clear responses to changes in temperature, N fertilizer and CO2. Regardless of choice of cultivar, increasing temperatures alone (by up to 5 degrees C compared with the baseline) resulted in reduced yield while the addition of other factors (optimal fertilizer with elevated CO2) resulted in increased yield. Considering optimal fertilizer (64kg/ha N) as an adaptation practice, wheat yield in the short-term (2010-2039) and mid-term (2040-2069) may increase at least by 40%, compared with sub-optimal N levels. Assuming CO2 and present wheat management is unchanged, simulation results based on 20 GCMs showed that median wheat yields will reduce by 10% in the short term and by 11% in the mid-term relative to the baseline data, whereas under changed CO2 with present management, wheat yield will increase slightly, by up to 8% in the short term and by up to 11% in the mid-term period, respectively. Wheat yield will substantially increase, by more than 100%, when simulated based on combined use of optimal planting date and fertilizer applications. Increased temperature in future scenarios will cause yield to decline, whereas CO2 is expected to have positive impacts on wheat yield.","[Araya, A.; Girma, A.; Afewerk, A.; Tsehaye, Y.] Mekelle Univ, Coll Dryland Agr & Nat Resources, POB 231, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Kisekka, I.] Kansas State Univ, Southwest Res & Extens Ctr, 4500 East Mary St, Garden City, KS 67846 USA; [Hadgu, K.

We set out to study how spatial design based on pathways thinking can help develop more adaptive and sustainable landscapes. Using landscape analysis, field research, and research-through-designing in a case study on climate resilience in Boston (USA), we argue for better understanding of the spatial and design consequences of pathways in general. Our results indicate that pathways can be spatially translated, demanding landscape-informed choices when sequencing different policy actions. We found that spatial designing makes the landscape consequences of pathways transparent and enables policy-makers to replace the input of policy actions with spatial interventions, select pathways according to different underlying design strategies, use the mapped pathways to initiate an iterative research-through-designing process to test and inform different designs, and spatially visualize the pathways and possible sequences of actions. We conclude that policy-makers should be cognizant about the spatial implications of pathways and offer directions to enrich applications of pathways thinking for achieving adaptive and sustainable landscapes.","[Zandvoort, Mark; Kooijmans, Nora; van den Brink, Adri] Wageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Landscape Architecture Chair Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kirshen, Paul] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Environm, Sustainable Solut Lab, Boston, MA 02125 USA",Wageningen University & Research; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,"Zandvoort, M (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Landscape Architecture Chair Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",mark.zandvoort@wur.nl; n.a.kooijmans@gmail.com; paul.kirshen@umb.edu; adri.vandenbrink@wur.nl,,"Zandvoort, Mark/0000-0001-6207-7562; van den Brink, Adri/0000-0002-8403-7470",,,,,53,4,4,9,29,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB 1,2019,11,3,,,,,,,565,10.3390/su11030565,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11030565,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HL7NY,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000458929500010,View Full Record in Web of Science

In practice, they fall short of this goal. One potential explanation is that optimization models are not more successful because they are built on, and depend on, a misrepresentation of law and politics. The legal reality of California's hydropower system is a web of networked jurisdictions of multiple federal and state agencies, with varying levels of coordination, long periods of legally obligated stability with rigid rules, and prone to conflict, but with multiple procedures for conflict resolution. Barriers to climate adaptation from that mix vary according to where a given dam is located. The virtual institutional arrangements represented in optimization models are not a simplification of existing arrangements. Instead, they are a dramatic replacement. That replacement is deliberate and reasoned. As seen in two optimization models supported by the state of California, CALVIN and INFORM, the operation of the optimization function of computer models depends on a virtual system of rules that are centrally controlled, coordinated, nimble, and without the possibility of conflict (let alone conflict resolution). But that smooth virtual system comes with a real cost. Institutional economics suggests that this mismatch between existing formal law and represented law may upend the results of models, since value is determined from institutional context.","[Ziaja, Sonya F.

This study aimed to describe the effect of incorporating chicory to ryegrass or to a ryegrass-white clover mixture on feeding behaviour, digestive parameters, nitrogen (N) balance and methane (CH4) emissions in sheep. In total, three swards of ryegrass, white clover and chicory were established and managed in a manner ensuring the forage use at a constant vegetative stage throughout the experiment. In all, four dietary treatments (pure ryegrass; binary mixture: 50% ryegrass-50% chicory; ternary mixture: 50% ryegrass-25% white clover-25% chicory; and pure chicory) were evaluated in a 4x4 replicated Latin square design with eight young castrated Texel sheep. Each experimental period consisted of an 8-day diet adaptation phase, followed by a 6-day measuring phase during which intake dynamics, chewing activity, digestibility, rumen liquid passage rate, fermentation end-products, N balance and CH4 emissions were determined. Data were analysed using a mixed model and orthogonal contrasts were used to detect the potential associative effects between ryegrass and chicory. The daily voluntary dry matter intake was lower for pure ryegrass than for diets containing chicory (P<0.001) and increased quadratically from 1.39 to 1.74 kg/day with increasing proportion of chicory. Huge positive quadratic effects (P<0.001) between ryegrass and chicory were detected on eating time and eating rate just after feeding indicating an increase of the motivation to eat with mixtures, whereas rumination activity decreased linearly with the proportion of chicory (P<0.001). The organic matter digestibility was similar among treatments (around 80%), but a strong positive quadratic P<0.001) effect was observed on liquid passage rate suggesting that chicory allowed fast particle breakdown in the rumen. Animals fed with the ryegrass-white clover-chicory mixture had the higher urinary N losses (P<0.001), whereas retained N per day or per g N intake was greater when the proportion of chicory was at least 50% (P<0.001) being similar to 40% greater than for the other treatments. The CH4 yield was lower with pure chicory than with the other treatments (P<0.001) for which emissions were similar. In conclusion, mixing ryegrass and chicory in equal proportions produces a synergy on voluntary intake and an improved N use efficiency likely due to complementarity in chemical composition, increased motivation to eat and faster ruminal particle breakdown.","[Niderkorn, V; Martin, C.; Le Morvan, A.; Rochette, Y.; Baumont, R.] Univ Clermont Auvergne, INRA, VetAgro Sup, UMR Herbivores, F-63122 St Genes Champanelle, France; [Bernard, M.] INRA, UE1414 Herbipole, F-63122 St Genes Champanelle, France",INRAE; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); VetAgro Sup; INRAE,"Niderkorn, V (corresponding author), Univ Clermont Auvergne, INRA, VetAgro Sup, UMR Herbivores, F-63122 St Genes Champanelle, France.",vincent.niderkorn@inra.fr,"BAUMONT, RENE/AAZ-8503-2021; Niderkorn, Vincent/O-7290-2019; martin, cécile/F-9543-2019","Niderkorn, Vincent/0000-0002-4631-7623; MARTIN, cecile/0000-0002-2265-2048",European Community [FP7-244983],European Community(European Commission),The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under the agreement no.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess climate change impacts and adaptation practices (biochar and irrigation) simulated with the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model on nitrate-N (NO3-N) losses, microbial respiration (MR) and soil organic carbon (SOC) in the Southeastern USA. METHODS: The EPIC model was used to assess the impacts of climate change and adaptations on NO3-N losses in leachate and runoff from the soil profile (0-100 cm), loss of soil C via MR (0-100 cm), and impacts on SOC stocks (0-10 cm) for representative farms growing C-3 and C-4 crops within ten Southeastern USA states. The adaptations explored were annual biochar applications and irrigation. Historical baseline (1979-2009) and future (2041-2070) climate scenarios were used for simulations with CO2 concentrations of 360 ppm and 500 ppm, respectively. Four regional climate models (RCMs), nested within global climate models (GCMs) for their boundary conditions, simulated changes in air temperatures, precipitation, and solar radiation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Climate change increased simulated NO3-N losses in leaching and runoff by 40-80%, compared to historical baseline scenarios that was attributed to overall increased annual precipitation under three of the four RCM_GCM models. For the C(4 )crops, NO3-N leaching and runoff losses were 16-47% and 31-45% lower than for the C-3 crops, respectively. Biochar applications reduced NO3-N leaching in the West region during 2066-2070 under the RCM3_CGCM3 model. The differences in MR between the C-4 and C-3 crops ranged from 3 to 75%. SOC increased under C-4 crops and when biochar was applied. We concluded that inclusion of C-4 crops in crop rotations and the applications of biochar under wetter climate scenarios may be a promising adaptation strategy to reduce NO3-N losses and increase SOC content in the soils of the Southeastern USA. SIGNIFICANCE: This study represents one of the first attempts to assess the effectiveness of climate change adaptations such as the agricultural use of biochar and irrigation. The findings from this study strongly contribute to our understanding of potential climate change impacts on a region's agriculture and resulting environmental footprint. This information may be used by the scientific community along with decision and policy makers working on conceptual and practical technologies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on agriculture and the environment.","[Lychuk, Taras E.; Thomson, Allison M.] Univ Maryland, Joint Global Change Res Inst, Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, 5825 Univ Res Court,Suite 1200, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Hill, Robert L.] Univ Maryland, Dept Environm Sci & Technol, 1426 ANSC AGR ENG Bldg, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Izaurralde, Roberto C.] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, 2181 Lefrak Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Momen, Bahram] Univ Maryland, Dept Environm Sci & Technol, 1109 HJ Patterson Hall, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Thomson, Allison M.] Alliance Sustainable Agr, Field Market, 777 N Capitol St NE Suite 803, Washington, DC 20002 USA; [Lychuk, Taras E.] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Brandon Res & Dev Ctr, 2701 Grand Valley Rd, Brandon, MB R7A 5Y3, Canada",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada,"Lychuk, TE (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Joint Global Change Res Inst, Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, 5825 Univ Res Court,Suite 1200, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",taras.lychuk@agr.gc.ca; rlh@umd.edu; cizaurra@umd.edu; athomson@fieldtomarket.org,"Izaurralde, Roberto Cesar/E-5257-2019; Thomson, Allison/GRO-3207-2022; Thomson, Allison M/B-1254-2010","Izaurralde, Roberto Cesar/0000-0002-8797-9500; Thomson, Allison M/0000-0001-5326-1755","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, under the Carbon Sequestration in Terrestrial Ecosystems (CSiTE) Program; Terrestrial Ecosystem Sciences Program; Regional Climate Modeling Program; Battelle Memorial Institute Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; US Fulbright Commission; North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program - National Science Foundation (NSF); US Department of Energy (DOE); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, under the Carbon Sequestration in Terrestrial Ecosystems (CSiTE) Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Terrestrial Ecosystem Sciences Program; Regional Climate Modeling Program; Battelle Memorial Institute Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; US Fulbright Commission; North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program - National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development","This material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, under the Carbon Sequestration in Terrestrial Ecosystems (CSiTE) Program, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Sciences Program, the Regional Climate Modeling Program, and Climate Modeling (SFA) Project within the Joint Global Change Research Institute (JGCRI, sponsored by the Battelle Memorial Institute Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the University of Maryland, College Park) , the University of Maryland's Department of Environmental Sci-ence and Technology, and the US Fulbright Commission.

Hence, a wide range of often conflicting material interests can be expected surrounding mangrove forest policy and management. These conflicts result in different issues of mangrove policy and management, on which different actors articulate their positions through publicly stated claims. It is unclear, in how far these publicly stated positions and claims resemble the formal interest of the actors only, or if they also reveal parts of their informal interests. In the Sundarbans mangrove forests, a number of issues have arisen, which are of contemporary policy concern. The aim of this study is to identify the most recent issues relating to the Sundarbans in Bangladesh and analyse the actors' claims/arguments on the identified issues which were publicly stated as an expression of formal or informal interest. In order to analyse these public claims, content analysis of selected Bangladeshi national newspapers, experts' deliberations and national policy documents was undertaken as an empirical method to ascertain relevant issues and actors' claims. A theory-based actor typology was applied to distinguish the relevant actors, and the concept of formal and informal interests was employed. The results indicate that the most salient policy issues around mangrove forest policy and management are: establishing Rampal power plant; protection of the Sundarbans forest area; environmental pollution; biodiversity conservation; reputation as a World Natural Heritage Site; relevance for climate change adaptation and mitigation; and local people's livelihoods. Government and Administration are found to be the most active actor in all the observed issues. Surprisingly, only very few administrations partake in public deliberations and the Prime Minister seems to dominate the public debate. This might be explained by the fact that the Rampal power plant project is perceived as the most contentious issue among all actors, with strong discursive support from the Prime Minister. In light of this issue structure, non-governmental actors as well as most bureaucracies are rarely found to actively engage in public debate on mangrove issues while informal interests were being displayed by Prime Minister and non-ruling political parties to a limited extent. Future empirical study to be conducted on the historical trajectory of Rampal power plant addressing the Prime Minister's arguments and environmental concerns of civil society actors. Also it would be worth to map the high degree of bureaucratic rivalry which can be assumed form the conflicting interest in mangrove forests between the responsible ministry-the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and other ministries in their struggle for power.","[Khan, Md Faisal Abedin] Georg August Univ, Chair Grp Forest & Nat Conservat Policy, Busgenweg 3, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Khan, Md Faisal Abedin; Rahman, Md Saifur] Minist Publ Adm, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Giessen, Lukas] European Forest Inst, Bonn Off, Governance Programme, bonn, Germany; [Giessen, Lukas] Bogor Agr Univ, IPB, Bogor, Indonesia",University of Gottingen; Bogor Agricultural University,"Khan, MFA (corresponding author), Georg August Univ, Chair Grp Forest & Nat Conservat Policy, Busgenweg 3, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",fkhan@uni-goettingen.de,,,Government of Bangladesh,Government of Bangladesh,"This research was supported by the Government of Bangladesh, for pursuing doctoral study with Chair Group of Forest and Nature Conservation Policy, Georg-August University, Gottingen, Germany.

Recent trends as well as model outputs for the future strongly support an increase of average and extreme temperatures. For the maturation period, this increase will by far exceed mean atmospheric temperature increase, as the ripening period will occur earlier in hotter climatic conditions. Therefore, a detrimental secondary metabolism response is expected in grape berries, and of particular concern are the impacts on phenolics and aromas and aroma precursors. The effects of high temperatures on secondary metabolism control have been partly characterized for phenolics, however mostly in artificial growing conditions, while little is known with respect to aromas. A better understanding of how high temperatures influence grape berry secondary metabolites could help vineyard growers to adapt to climate change and maintain wine quality. Material and methods: A two-year field study was carried out in 2015 and 2016 in a vineyard in Bordeaux, France. Two treatments, heated (H) and control (C), were applied to two varieties, Cabernet-Sauvignon and Sauvignon blanc, from fruit-set to maturity. Field heating was achieved by a very local greenhouse effect applied to the bottom of the rows, by enclosing most of the underlying soil surface by polycarbonate shields. As the training system was vertically trellised, the heated volume surrounded most of the bunches but did not disturb most of the leaves in the canopy. This simple and robust setup allowed an increase of berry temperature by about +1.5 degrees C in mean value, up to +5 degrees C at times during clear sky days. This moderate increase of temperature was indicative of the predicted future climatic conditions for the mid-21st century. Berry samples were collected at 4 time points from bunch closure to maturity for each cultivar and treatment. Primary and secondary metabolites were measured in whole berries or skins. Results and conclusions: With this moderate temperature increase, primary metabolite content in berries did not change significantly. In H samples, anthocyanins were reduced and tannins increased before veraison, and both decreased thereafter. H samples also exhibited lower concentrations of some amino acids, especially alanine, serine and phenylalanine. IBMP (2-methoxy-3-isobutylpyrazine) concentrations were also reduced in H samples of Cabernet-Sauvignon, in both seasons, especially at bunch closure stage, but the differences diminished at full maturity. For thiol 3-sulfanyl hexanol precursors, H samples again exhibited much lower concentrations for both varieties, with weak differences at early stages that increased at later stages (up to -70% decline at maturity in 2015 for Sauvignon blanc). These results demonstrate the potential negative impact of elevated temperature on polyphenols and aroma quality of grape berries. Significance and impact of the study: For viticulture to adapt to new climatic conditions, the negative impacts of high temperature on secondary metabolites and aromas, and therefore on wine quality, need to be contemplated. Thus, already established or new vineyard plantings must prepare and consider practices able to mitigate these impacts, for instance practices that increase bunch shading.","[Wu, Jing; Hilbert, Ghislaine; Guillaumie, Sabine; Dai, Zhanwu; Delrot, Serge; Pieri, Philippe] Univ Bordeaux, INRA, ISVV, UMR EGFV,BSA, F-33140 Villenave Dornon, France; [Drappier, Julie; Geny, Laurence; Darriet, Philippe; Thibon, Cecile] Univ Bordeaux, UR CEnol, F-33140 Villenave Dornon, France",INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux,"Pieri, P (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, INRA, ISVV, UMR EGFV,BSA, F-33140 Villenave Dornon, France.",Philippe.Pieri@inra.fr,"Darriet, Philippe/AAC-9989-2022; Dai, Zhanwu/V-6274-2019","Darriet, Philippe/0000-0002-7202-8710; Dai, Zhanwu/0000-0002-7625-8337; thibon, cecile/0000-0001-9259-5176; HILBERT, Ghislaine/0000-0003-0279-6703",CIVB; Aquitaine Region; INRA,CIVB; Aquitaine Region(Region Nouvelle-Aquitaine); INRA,"This study was part of the HeatBerry and  LACCAVE 2 projects, with financial support from CIVB, Aquitaine Region and INRA.

Our results showed that farmers perceived change in the distribution of rainfall, rise in temperature, increase in frequency of heat waves and droughts in the region. Further, degradation of common property resources, uncertainty in crop yields, increased soil salinity, farm unemployment and reduction in consumption were some of the potential non-climatic impacts as perceived by the farmers. As climate adaptation measures, farmers resorted to disease/heat tolerant varieties, plant protection chemicals and water conservation techniques. Moreover, lack of access to institutional credit, poorly defined property rights, inadequate infrastructure and information gaps were some of the major barriers to climate adaptation in the region. The study provides a useful guide for identifying region-specific issues and implementable adaptation strategies.

Monitoring and understanding drought characteristics are essential for integrated drought risk mitigation and prevetion of land degradation. This study evaluates drought conditions in North Darfur by analyzing the spatiotemporal distribution of drought using three drought indices (Standardized Precipitation Index, Vegetation Condition Index, and Soil Moisture Content Index) and their combined drought index (CDI) from 2004 to 2013. Biophysical and socioeconomic indicators are further used to measure vulnerability to drought risk and its three components (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity) through a comprehensive risk assessment framework. The results show that most of North Darfur has experienced prolonged droughts during the study period, especially from 2007 to 2011. There is also a significant correlation between the monsoon season CDI and annual crop yield anomaly. The results confirm the validity of the CDI index, which provides a comprehensive description of the drought situation by combing four drought indices quantifying different drought aspects. The vulnerability results show that the majority of this region is highly exposed and sensitive to drought risks. In particular, the northern zone of the region is highly vulnerable, which is categorized by less-crop diversity, higher land degradation, frequent droughts, and high-poverty levels. This study provides valuable information for coping with climate change-induced drought risk in this region and demonstrates that there is still a large room for enhancing the adaptation capacity in this region.","[Mohmmed, Nail; Zhang, Ke] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Mohmmed, Nail; Zhang, Ke] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Kabenge, Martin; Reuben, Makomere] Tongji Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse Stu, UNEP Tongji Inst Environm Sustainable Dev, 1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Keesstra, Saskia] Wageningen Univ, Soil Phys & Land Management Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 4, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Keesstra, Saskia] Univ Newcastle, Civil Surveying & Environm Engn, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Cerda, Artemi] Univ Valencia, Dept Geog, Blasco Ibanez 28, Valencia 46010, Spain; [Elbashier, Mohammed M.

In this context, this research presents a review of 55 previous studies since 2010, including the quantitative and the qualitative description of the research topics, research methodologies, and corresponding main findings by using the clustering analysis, the statistical analysis and the classification analysis. The results could be grouped into three categories: climate responsiveness of vernacular buildings, adaptive thermal comfort of residents, climate adaptability of both buildings and residents, and the vernacular dwelling climate responsiveness is the mainstream. In addition, approximately 83.64% of the studies used quantitative research methods, which is the field and simulation study, to verify the effectiveness of strategies. And the relationship between strategies and building were not single mapped. In order to explore the connection between these two, a further classification by season, location and elements is conducted. Finally, this research indicates that more rigorous quantitative research and more scenarios, especially future climate adaption, are necessary for future exploration in this field. This research aims to demonstrate a clear and effective overview of this field for further promotion of architecture sustainability.","[Yang, Wenting; Xu, Juan; Lu, Ziliang; Yan, Jiawei; Li, Fuwen] Changan Univ, Sch Architecture, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Chang'an University,"Xu, J (corresponding author), Changan Univ, Sch Architecture, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",xujuan0626@chd.edu.cn,,,"National Nature Science Foundation of China [51308048, 519780158]",National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Acknowledgments This work was supported by National Nature Science Foundation of China (No. 51308048, No. 519780158) .

Depending on its type and extent, green infrastructure (GI) can reduce local urban temperatures significantly and at the same time reduce the risk of flooding. This article views the streetscape as an important area of activity for GI-based climate-adaptation interventions for two main reasons: it serves as a conduit for urban human activity and mobility, and it acts as a significant heat store. The approach proposed unites some key elements that can form the basis for all future public-realm (streetscape) design, promoting a truly climate-responsive urban environment. These include reduction of sealing to only essential areas, decentralized water management using rain-garden technology, low maintenance, aesthetic planting supporting biodiversity, and sensor-based monitoring of thermal comfort parameters to optimize measures.

The rapid construction activity means that the efforts made in Germany are only relevant, if similar targets are adopted also in countries like China and if climate adapted measures are implemented locally. In this sense a simulation study of a typical residential room module has been conducted in order to identify climate adapted and lifecycle optimized wall constructions in 26 climates in China. Therein opaque wall elements have been improved stepwise in their insulation capacity. For a constant room and operation configuration the energy demand for heating and cooling has been determined. Following, selected materials have been assigned to the external wall. It has been calculated for which layer thickness the last added centimetre has an energy payback time within the useful life (30, 60 and 100 years). Furthermore the room was turned in the four compass points and the thicknesses have been determined. It has been shown, that in all climates a certain insulation capacity is required, but that in southern China monolithic walls, for example made from aerated concrete, are optimal and sufficient. It is concluded that large part of the global new construction volume could be constructed with energy and resource optimized wall elements that are also able to be recycled.","[Schwede, Dirk; Lu, Yi] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Leichtbau Entwerfen & Konstruieren, Pfaffenwaldring 14, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany",University of Stuttgart,"Schwede, D (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Leichtbau Entwerfen & Konstruieren, Pfaffenwaldring 14, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",,"Schwede, Dirk Alexander/P-6890-2017","Schwede, Dirk Alexander/0000-0001-5147-954X",,,,,7,1,1,0,3,ERNST & SOHN,BERLIN,"ROTHERSTRASSE 21, BERLIN, DEUTSCHLAND 10245, GERMANY",0171-5445,1437-0980,,BAUPHYSIK,Bauphysik,DEC,2015,37,6,,,,,334,344,,10.1002/bapi.201510039,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bapi.201510039,,,11,Construction & Building Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology,DB4TU,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000368507100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

While previous studies have evaluated a range of impacts and adaptation of climate change (CC) on crop yield, few studies have focused on evaluating the effectiveness of changing cultivars with different vernalization requirements as an adaptation. In the present study, mean and inter-annual variability of yield were quantified for three winter wheat cultivar types at three ecological sites (Shangzhuang in Beijing, Quzhou in Hebei and Huangfanqu in Henan) in the North China Plain, by linking a crop model and the outputs of Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS) for both the baseline (1961-90) and future SRES scenarios A2 and B2 (2070-2100). The results showed that a warming trend prolonged the length of the vegetative growth period of local cultivars through reduced vernalization, generally leading to a negative impact on yield. However, the introduction of cultivars with relatively lower vernalization demands from warmer southern to cooler northern regions could be an effective adaptation strategy to offset the negative impact of climatic change. Adjustment in cultivars increased yield at Shangzhuang and maintained it at Quzhou and Huangfanqu. Elevated CO2 would significantly increase yield in the future with or without considering the sensitivities of the selected cultivars. The inter-annual variability of yield generally increased in the A2 scenario, but decreased in the B2 scenario. Overall, winter wheat with semi-winter types or weak-winter types would grow preferentially, while cultivars with winter types would probably be reduced in future.","[Zhang, Y.; Feng, L.

In the Murray-Darling Basin of south-eastern Australia, identifying the requirements of flood-dependent natural values would better inform the delivery of environmental water in response to reduced runoff and less water. In the Savannah Basin of the south-eastern USA, dam managers are considering technological and engineering upgrades in response to more severe floods and droughts, which would also improve the implementation of recommended environmental flows.

Thus, it is vital to understand the process of farmers' adaptation decisions when informing policy interventions. It is hypothesized that farmers' decisions to take actions against climate change are related to risk experience as well as a range of socio-economic variables. Although evidence indicates that socio-economic variables are relevant, the empirical evidence on the role of risk experience on adaptation decisions is limited. The present study assesses whether perceived risk experience in terms of agricultural production shocks and yield reduction influence farmers' decisions to adapt. Data collected from smallholder farmers in Ethiopia is used for this purpose. The study applies a multivariate endogenous probit model and controls for potential endogeneity of perceived risk experiences to adaptation decision. The results indicate that farmers who perceive having experienced production shocks are more likely to decide to adapt. However, experiencing simply yield reduction is not associated with adaptation decision. Other socio-economic, institutional, and agro-ecological variables are also found to be associated with adaptation decisions. It is concluded that the role of risk experience on farmers' decision to adapt is a function of the severity of the experienced risk.","[Habtemariama, Lemlem Teklegiorgis; Kassa, Getachew Abate; Sieber, Stefan] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Habtemariama, Lemlem Teklegiorgis] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Agr Prod & Resource Econ, Alte Akad 16, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Gandorfer, Markus] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Econ Hort & Landscaping, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Gandorfer, Markus] Bavarian State Res Ctr Agr, Inst Agr Engn & Anim Husb, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Sieber, Stefan] Humboldt Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Berlin, Germany",Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Habtemariam, LT (corresponding author), Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany.;Habtemariam, LT (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Chair Agr Prod & Resource Econ, Alte Akad 16, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",lemlem.habtemariam@zalf.de,,"Sieber, Stefan/0000-0002-4849-7277",Katholischer Akademischer Auslander-Dienst (KAAD); Laura Bassi award from Technische Universitat Munchen,Katholischer Akademischer Auslander-Dienst (KAAD); Laura Bassi award from Technische Universitat Munchen,The first author has received a scholarship from Katholischer Akademischer Auslander-Dienst (KAAD) and the Laura Bassi award from Technische Universitat Munchen for PhD study.

It is understood that agriculture is highly sensitive to climatic variability and likely to. be affected most to predicted climate change. The fourth assessment report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has reconfirmed that the phenomenon of existence of climate change in recent decades is due to anthropogenic activities. It is also revealed the availability of wide array of adaptation options for agro-ecosystem to cope up with the impact of climate change. However, it is important to design more extensive adaptation strategies to reduce vulnerability of agriculture and rural poor to impacts of climate change. Climate change impacts and responses are presently observed as autonomous adaptation in the physical and ecological systems as well as in human adjustments to resource availability and risks at different spatial and trophic levels. But these strategies are not enough to reduce the current anthropogenic driven climate change, so there is a need to adopt the planned adaptation. This paper reviews the findings based on the series of studies carried across the globe on the potential adaptation strategies to alleviate the impact of climate change by improving the resilience of the agro-ecosystems. Adaptation strategies have to be in place to reduce vulnerability to climate change through developing consensus between industrialized countries and developing countries at global scale, whereas new public policies in place at national regional and local level is prudent to support adaptation research, insurances, incentives to farmers to adapt new technologies.","[Boomiraj, K.; Wani, Suhas P.; Garg, Kaushal K.] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Patancheru 502324, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Aggarwal, P.

Moreover, although one often regards perceptions as preconditions for adaptation, some direct and underlying factors may influence perceptions and adaptations in opposite ways. To assess determinants of perceived directions of climate change and adaptations by farmers, the paper formulates ordered response and multinomial choice models accounting for the location and neighbourhood effects. Relative to a survey of rural households in the Ethiopian Nile basin, perceptions of long-term climate trends are found to substantially vary across regions, altitudes, distances from markets, and neighbourhood characteristics, with climate reference scales being themselves non-uniform across respondents. The inclusion of proxies for local spatial dependence and clustering in multinomial logit regressions on adaptation decisions provides further insights, relative to individual- and farm-specific features. Adaptation measures turn out to be largely independent from degree of awareness of negative trends in climate changes. This highlights the importance of adaptive strategies coordinated at regional and national scale, such as preventive measures of control of pest damage risk due to increasing temperatures, and specific interventions for semi-arid agro-climatic zones.","[Mainardi, Stefano] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Appl Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Mainardi, S (corresponding author), VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Appl Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",stemaind@gmail.com,,"Mainardi, Stefano/0000-0002-4684-9857",Czech Science Foundation [GA15-23177S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"The author wishes to thank two referees for insightful comments, S.

To balance urban waterfront development and climate adaptation, floating housing is presented as a promising solution-however it has not been studied sufficiently. This paper explores floating housing as urban climate experimentation, targeting vision/motivation, practice and upscaling in a national context where support mechanisms and traditions are absent. Interviews with innovation entrepreneurs and municipal planners involved with planning and building floating districts show that, with one exception, the Swedish initiatives are at odds with the theoretical assumptions behind urban climate experimentation. Initiatives are neither challenge-led in terms of climate risk nor inclusive and community-based. Rather, the small-scale private entrepreneurs are pioneers in offering unique living on water as one-off innovations. While allowing experimentation, municipal planners are less convinced by the effectiveness and appropriateness of upscaling. Floating housing may contribute to local identity building and place marketing, but are riddled with implementation challenges regarding shoreline protection, privatization/accessibility, limited market interest and urban development fit. While the floating houses themselves withstand flooding, thus safeguarding individual house owners, they do not protect the land-based city with its vulnerable waterfront development patterns. Results thus suggest the limitation of floating houses in shifting development pathways and strengthening urban climate proofing.","[Storbjork, Sofie; Hjerpe, Mattias] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University,"Storbjork, S (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Linkoping, Sweden.",sofie.storbjork@liu.se,,"Hjerpe, Mattias/0000-0002-5500-3300; Storbjork, Sofie/0000-0003-0109-2288",Linkoping University; Swedish research council Formas [942-2015-356],Linkoping University; Swedish research council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),"Open access funding provided by Linkoping University.

The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400-1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO(2) to more than 120 GtCO(2) per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6 W/m(2) that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2 degrees C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).

Coffee rust epidemics, with intensities higher than previously observed, have affected a number of countries including: Colombia, from 2008 to 2011; Central America and Mexico, in 2012-13; and Peru and Ecuador in 2013. There are many contributing factors to the onset of these epidemics e.g. the state of the economy, crop management decisions and the prevailing weather, and many resulting impacts e.g. on production, on farmers' and labourers' income and livelihood, and on food security. Production has been considerably reduced in Colombia (by 31 % on average during the epidemic years compared with 2007) and Central America (by 16 % in 2013 compared with 2011-12 and by 10 % in 2013-14 compared with 2012-13). These reductions have had direct impacts on the livelihoods of thousands of smallholders and harvesters. For these populations, particularly in Central America, coffee is often the only source of income used to buy food and supplies for the cultivation of basic grains. As a result, the coffee rust epidemic has had indirect impacts on food security. The main drivers of these epidemics are economic and meteorological. All the intense epidemics experienced during the last 37 years in Central America and Colombia were concurrent with low coffee profitability periods due to coffee price declines, as was the case in the 2012-13 Central American epidemic, or due to increases in input costs, as in the 2008-11 Colombian epidemics. Low profitability led to suboptimal coffee management, which resulted in increased plant vulnerability to pests and diseases. A common factor in the recent Colombian and Central American epidemics was a reduction in the diurnal thermal amplitude, with higher minimum/lower maximum temperatures (+0.1 degrees C/-0.5 degrees C on average during 2008-2011 compared to a low coffee rust incidence period, 1991-1994, in Chinchina, Colombia; +0.9 degrees C/-1.2 degrees C on average in 2012 compared with prevailing climate, in 1224 farms from Guatemala). This likely decreased the latency period of the disease. These epidemics should be considered as a warning for the future, as they were enhanced by weather conditions consistent with climate change. Appropriate actions need to be taken in the near future to address this issue including: the development and establishment of resistant coffee cultivars; the creation of early warning systems; the design of crop management systems adapted to climate change and to pest and disease threats; and socio-economic solutions such as training and organisational strengthening.","[Avelino, Jacques] CIRAD, UPR Bioagresseurs Anal & Maitrise Risque, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Cristancho, Marco] Natl Coffee Res Ctr, CENICAFE, Dept Plant Pathol, Chinchina, Colombia; [Avelino, Jacques; Georgiou, Selena; Imbach, Pablo] CATIE, Dept Res & Dev, Turrialba, Costa Rica; [Aguilar, Lorena] FEWS NET, Reg Off Latin Amer & Caribbean, Guatemala City, Guatemala; [Bornemann, Gustavo; Hruska, Allan J.] FAO, Plant Prod & Protect Div, Panama City, Panama; [Laederach, Peter] CIAT, Reg Off Cent Amer & Caribbean, Managua, Nicaragua; [Anzueto, Francisco] ANACAFE, Res Dept, Guatemala City, Guatemala; [Avelino, Jacques; Morales, Carmen] IICA PROMECAFE, Guatemala City, Guatemala; [Cristancho, Marco] Ctr Bioinformat & Biol Computac BIOS, Manizales, Colombia",CIRAD; CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT,"Avelino, J (corresponding author), CIRAD, UPR Bioagresseurs Anal & Maitrise Risque, F-34398 Montpellier, France.",jacques.avelino@cirad.fr,"Avelino, Jacques/C-5624-2009; Hruska, Allan/AAV-7547-2020","Avelino, Jacques/0000-0003-1983-9431; Hruska, Allan/0000-0003-0984-3816; CRISTANCHO, MARCO/0000-0001-9115-4117; Laderach, Peter/0000-0001-8708-6318; Imbach, Pablo/0000-0003-4078-6063","Cascade project (Ecosystem-based adaptation for smallholder farmers in Central America); German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB); Neumann Foundation","Cascade project (Ecosystem-based adaptation for smallholder farmers in Central America); German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB); Neumann Foundation","We thank the Cascade project (Ecosystem-based adaptation for smallholder farmers in Central America) for their financial support for the analysis of weather and climatic data at Central American scale.

We found that the diversity of bacteria and fungi in the soil was positively affected by NT + CC, especially under water stress conditions. Under NT + CC, the presence of important plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria was revealed. Soil enzymatic activity confirmed the depleting impact of conventional tillage. Soil C and N were increased under NT + CC due to their inclusion into large soil aggregates that are beneficial for long-term C and N stabilization in soils. Water stress was found to have detrimental effects on aggregates formation and limited C and N inclusion within aggregates. The microbiological and physicochemical parameters correlation supported the hypothesis that long-term NT + CC is a valuable strategy for sustainable agroecosystems, due to its contribution to soil C and N stabilization while enhancing the biodiversity and enzymes. Combining no-till and cover crops (NT + CC) as an alternative to conventional tillage (CT) is generating interest to build-up farming systems' resilience while promoting climate change adaptation in agriculture. Our field study aimed to assess the impact of long-term NT + CC management and short-term water stress on soil microbial communities, enzymatic activities, and the distribution of C and N within soil aggregates. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) revealed the positive impact of NT + CC on microbial biodiversity, especially under water stress conditions, with the presence of important rhizobacteria (e.g., Bradyrhizobium spp.). An alteration index based on soil enzymes confirmed soil depletion under CT. C and N pools within aggregates showed an enrichment under NT + CC mostly due to C and N-rich large macroaggregates (LM), accounting for 44% and 33% of the total soil C and N. Within LM, C and N pools were associated to microaggregates within macroaggregates (mM), which are beneficial for long-term C and N stabilization in soils. Water stress had detrimental effects on aggregate formation and limited C and N inclusion within aggregates. The microbiological and physicochemical parameters correlation supported the hypothesis that long-term NT + CC is a promising alternative to CT, due to the contribution to soil C and N stabilization while enhancing the biodiversity and enzymes.","[Taskin, Eren; Misci, Chiara; Bandini, Francesca; Puglisi, Edoardo] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol Alimentari Sostenibilit, Fac Sci Agr Alimentari & Ambientali, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy; [Boselli, Roberta; Fiorini, Andrea; Ardenti, Federico; Tabaglio, Vincenzo] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dipartimento Sci Prod Vegetali Sostenibili DIPROV, Fac Sci Agr Alimentari & Ambientali, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy; [Guzzetti, Lorenzo; Panzeri, Davide; Tommasi, Nicola; Galimberti, Andrea; Labra, Massimo] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Biotecnol & Biosci BtBs, I-20126 Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Tabaglio, V (corresponding author), Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dipartimento Sci Prod Vegetali Sostenibili DIPROV, Fac Sci Agr Alimentari & Ambientali, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy.",eren.taskin@unicatt.it; roberta.boselli@unicatt.it; andrea.fiorini@unicatt.it; chiara.misci1@unicatt.it; federico.ardenti@unicatt.it; francesca.bandini@unicatt.it; lorenzo.guzzetti@unimib.it; davide.panzeri@unimib.it; nicola.tommasi@unimib.it; andrea.galimberti@unimib.it; massimo.labra@unimib.it; vincenzo.tabaglio@unicatt.it; edoardo.puglisi@unicatt.it,"Puglisi, Edoardo/I-8720-2012; Tabaglio, Vincenzo/C-5989-2008; Panzeri, Davide/AAI-2207-2021","Puglisi, Edoardo/0000-0001-5051-0971; Tabaglio, Vincenzo/0000-0003-3456-1589; Panzeri, Davide/0000-0003-2672-5846; Galimberti, Andrea/0000-0003-3140-3024; Bandini, Francesca/0000-0002-8926-7275; Misci, Chiara/0000-0002-4882-6392; Fiorini, Andrea/0000-0002-5601-2954","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research-MIUR [(CUP) H42F16002450001]; Romeo and Enrica Invernizzi Foundation (Italy) [C3S INVERNIZZI EXPO 2015]","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research-MIUR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Romeo and Enrica Invernizzi Foundation (Italy)","This study was supported by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research-MIUR The Sustainable Agrifood Systems Strategies (SASS) Project Code (CUP) H42F16002450001 and the Romeo and Enrica Invernizzi Foundation (Italy), C3S INVERNIZZI EXPO 2015.",,84,3,3,1,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-7737,,BIOLOGY-BASEL,Biology-Basel,JAN,2021,10,1,,,,,,,23,10.3390/biology10010023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology10010023,,,19,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,PV1GE,33401423,"Green Published, gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000609741600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Due to its terrain structure, the Bangladesh portion of the basin experiences frequent floods that cause severe human and economic losses. Bangladesh, as the downstream nation in the basin, faces challenges in receiving hydro-meteorological and water use data from India for effective water resource management. To address such issue, satellite rainfall products are recognized as an alternative. However, they are affected by biases and, thus, must be calibrated and verified using ground observations. This research compares the performance of four widely available gauge-adjusted satellite rainfall products (GSRPs) against ground rainfall observations in the Meghna basin within Bangladesh. Further biases in the GSRPs are then identified. The GSRPs have both similarities and differences in terms of producing biases. To maximize the usage of the GSRPs and to further improve their accuracy, several bias correction and merging techniques are applied to correct them. Correction factors and merging weights are calculated at the local gauge stations and are spatially distributed by adopting an interpolation method to improve the GSRPs, both inside and outside Bangladesh. Of the four bias correction methods, modified linear correction (MLC) has performed better, and partially removed the GSRPs' systematic biases. In addition, of the three merging techniques, inverse error-variance weighting (IEVW) has provided better results than the individual GSRPs and removed significantly more biases than the MLC correction method for three of the five validation stations, whereas the two other stations that experienced heavy rainfall events, showed better results for the MLC method. Hence, the combined use of IEVW merging and MLC correction is explored. The combined method has provided the best results, thus creating an improved dataset. The applicability of this dataset is then investigated using a hydrological model to simulated streamflows at two critical locations. The results show that the dataset reproduces the hydrological responses of the basin well, as compared with the observed streamflows. Together, these results indicate that the improved dataset can overcome the limitations of poor data availability in the basin and can serve as a reference rainfall dataset for wide range of applications (e.g., flood modelling and forecasting, irrigation planning, damage and risk assessment, and climate change adaptation planning). In addition, the proposed methodology of creating a reference rainfall dataset based on the GSRPs could also be applicable to other poorly-gauged and inaccessible transboundary river basins, thus providing reliable rainfall information and effective water resource management for sustainable development.","[Khairul, Islam M.; Rasmy, Mohamed; Koike, Toshio] PWRI, Int Ctr Water Hazard & Risk Management ICHARM, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058516, Japan; [Khairul, Islam M.; Rasmy, Mohamed; Koike, Toshio] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo 1068677, Japan; [Takeuchi, Kuniyoshi] Univ Yamanashi, Kofu, Yamanashi 4008510, Japan",PWRI: Public Works Research Institute; National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies; University of Yamanashi,"Khairul, IM (corresponding author), PWRI, Int Ctr Water Hazard & Risk Management ICHARM, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058516, Japan.;Khairul, IM (corresponding author), Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo 1068677, Japan.",k-islam55@pwri.go.jp; abdul@pwri.go.jp; koike@icharm.org; takeuchi@yamanashi.ac.jp,"Koike, Toshio/AAC-8548-2020; Mastrantonas, Nikolaos/T-5654-2018","Mastrantonas, Nikolaos/0000-0002-2430-3634; Takeuchi, Kuniyoshi/0000-0003-1954-7535","International Centre for Water Hazard and Risk Management (ICHARM); Public Works Research Institute (PWRI), Japan","International Centre for Water Hazard and Risk Management (ICHARM); Public Works Research Institute (PWRI), Japan","We would like to thank the International Centre for Water Hazard and Risk Management (ICHARM) and Public Works Research Institute (PWRI), Japan, for supporting this research.

While the number of feature variables in buildings is considerable, in many cases, a reliable dataset is only obtained from the target building operation through unique features. This results in insufficient data for building an operable ML model. In this study, we proposed a methodology applying a robust algorithm and carefully selected feature variables based on building physics. An operation using climate-adaptive building shells is presented as a case study. Energy simulations utilizing a generic office building model equipped with electrochromic glasses were performed on 2016-2019 weather data from Tokyo and Fukuoka, Japan. The k-nearest neighbor algorithm was employed for the ML application because of its robustness regarding small datasets, and feature variables were prearranged and carefully chosen to set an adequate combination between the numbers of feature and objective variables. Without ML, the air conditioning system operation became unstable in intermediate seasons. The ML application successfully solved this problem; 95% of the undesired cooling operation was avoided. The results prove that a simple ML algorithm could become a better solution than a complex one in cases where building physics based on building engineers' knowledge is effectively utilized. It expands the ML application in various building operations, even in cases that do not respond to the direct application of complex ML techniques that require large datasets, known as big data.","[Hiyama, Kyosuke] Meiji Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2148571, Japan; [Omodaka, Yuichi] Meiji Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2148571, Japan",Meiji University; Meiji University,"Hiyama, K (corresponding author), Meiji Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2148571, Japan.",hiyama@meiji.ac.jp,,,JSPS KAKENHI [19K04741]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [19K04741] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number 19K04741) .,,37,2,2,4,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2352-7102,,J BUILD ENG,J.

This family of methodologies relies on strong social networks among flood practitioners and the public to support careful definition of stakeholder-relevant thresholds and vulnerabilities to hazards. In parallel, flood researchers are directly considering distinct atmospheric mechanisms that induce flooding to readily incorporate information on future climate projections. We perform a case study of flood professionals actively engaged in flood risk mitigation within Tompkins County, New York, USA, a community dealing with moderate flooding, to gage how much variance exists among professionals from the perspective of establishing a bottom-up flood mitigation study from an atmospheric perspective. Results of this case study indicate disagreement among flooding professionals as to which socioeconomic losses constitute a flood, disagreement on anticipated community needs, weak understanding of climate-weather-flood linkages, and some disagreement on community perceptions of climate adaptation. In aggregate, the knowledge base of the Tompkins County flood practitioners provides a well-defined picture of community vulnerability and perceptions. Our research supports the growing evidence that collaborative interdisciplinary flood mitigation work could reduce risk, and potentially better support the implementation of emerging bottomup decision analysis frameworks for flood mitigation and climate adaptation.","[Knighton, James O.; Walter, M.

Here we integrated a fuzzy-based approach in the vulnerability assessment of mangrove social-ecological systems combining environmental parameters, socio-economic, and vegetative components from exposure dimensions, sensitivity and adaptive capacity along the northern coasts of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman for the first time. This study aims to provide critical information for habitat-scale management strategies and adaptation plans by assessing the vulnerability of mangrove social-ecological systems. This study provides a methodology framework that consists of five steps. Step 1: We com-bined the fuzzy weighted maps of seven environmental hazards, including tidal range, maximum wind speeds, drought magnitude, maximum temperatures, extreme storm surge, sea-level rise, significant wave height, and social vulnerability. This map combination determined that the computed exposure index is from 1.07 to 4.32 across the study areas, with an increasing trend from the coasts of the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman. Step 2: We integrated the fuzzy weighted maps of four sensitivity variables, including area change, health change, seaward edge retreat, and production potential change. The findings show that the sensitivity index is from 1.40 to 2.64 across the study areas, increasing the trend from the Persian Gulf coast to the Gulf of Oman. Step 3: Besides, we combined the fuzzy weighted maps of three adaptive capacity variables, including the availability of migration areas, recruitment, and local communities' participation in restoration projects and education pro-grams. The result showed that the index value across the study areas varies between 0.087 and 2.38, decreasing the trend from the Persian Gulf coast to the Gulf of Oman. Step 4: Implementing fuzzy hierarchical analysis process to determine the relative weight of variables corresponding to exposure, sensitivity and adaptive ca-pacity. Step 5: The integration of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity and the vulnerability index maps in the study areas showed variation from 0.25 to 5.92, with the vulnerability of mangroves from the west coast of the Persian Gulf (Nayband) decreasing towards Khamir, then increasing to the eastern coasts of the Gulf of Oman (Jask and Gwadar). Overall, the results indicate the importance of the proposed approach to the vulnerability of mangroves at the habitat scale along a coastal area and across environmental gradients of climatic, maritime and socio-economic variables. This study validated the findings based on the ground truth measurements, and high -resolution satellite data incorporated the Consistency Rate (CR) in the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP). The overall accuracy of all classified remote sensing images and maps consistently exceeded 90%, and the CR of the 25 completed questionnaires was <0.1. Finally, this study indicates differences in vulnerability of various habitats, leading to focus conservation completion and rehabilitation and climate change adaptation planning to support the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)-13 implementation.","[Mafi-Gholami, Davood; Pirasteh, Saied] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Fac Geosci & Environm Engn FGEE, Dept Surveying & Geoinformat, Chengdu 611756, Peoples R China; [Mafi-Gholami, Davood] Shahrekord Univ, Fac Nat Resources & Earth Sci, Dept Forest Sci, Shahrekord, Iran; [Ellison, Joanna C.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog Planning & Spatial Sci, Launceston, Tas, Australia; [Jaafari, Abolfazl] Agr Res Educ & Extens Org AREEO, Res Inst Forests & Rangelands, Tehran, Iran",Southwest Jiaotong University; Shahrekord University; University of Tasmania,"Pirasteh, S (corresponding author), Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Fac Geosci & Environm Engn FGEE, Dept Surveying & Geoinformat, Chengdu 611756, Peoples R China.",d.mafigholami@nres.sku.ac.ir; spirasteh@swjtu.edu.cn; Joanna.Ellison@utas.edu.au; jaafari@rifr-ac.ir,,"Pirasteh, Saied/0000-0002-3177-037X",SWJTU [A1920502051907-6],SWJTU,This study was carried out as part of the proposed joint research to build a foundation for working together to support Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)-17 and develop possibilities for the authors with international University collaborators to join the GeoAI Smarter Map LiDAR Lab at Southwest Jiaotong University (SWJTU).

Two sample Z-test is an inferential statistical test that determines whether there is a statistically significant difference between the means in the data from two independent groups. FA is a multivariate analysis that can examine the structure or relationship between variables. Twelve pilot plots for forests of 17 ha were surveyed in a water protection catchment near Hanover, Germany. The forest types were deciduous, coniferous, and mixed. In order to sustain groundwater quality, deciduous trees were planted over a period of several years to gradually replace the coniferous trees in the catchment area. Regular forest observations were required to ensure that the percentages of deciduous and mixed forests in this catchment area were increasing relative to coniferous forests. Fourteen dual-co-polarized TerraSAR-X (HH/VV) images were used to monitor the forests in the period from March 2008 to January 2009. The values of the backscattering coefficient (sigma(0)) for the test plots were statistically analyzed using the two sample Z-test and the Factor Analysis tools. The study showed that Factor analysis tools succeeded in differentiating between the coniferous forest and both the deciduous forest and the mixed forest, but failed to discriminate between the deciduous and the mixed forest. Only one factor was extracted for each sample plot of the coniferous forest with approximately equal loadings during the whole acquisition period from March 2008 to January 2009. However, two factors were extracted for each deciduous or mixed forest sample plot, where one factor had high loadings during the leaf-on period from May to October, and the other one had high loadings during the leaf-off period from November to April. Furthermore, the research revealed that the two sample Z-test differentiated the deciduous and mixed forests from the coniferous forest, and discriminated between deciduous forest and mixed forest. Statistically significant differences were observed between the mean backscatter values of the HH-polarized acquisitions for the deciduous forest and the mixed forest during the leaf-off period from November to April, but no statistically significant difference was found during the leaf-on period from May to October. Moreover, plot samples for the deciduous forest had slightly higher mean backscattering coefficients than those for the mixed forest during the leaf-off period. Applying the Factor Analysis and the two sample Z-test on the backscattering coefficient of multi-temporal TerraSAR-X data facilitates distinction of forest types, tracks changes in forest patterns, and estimates the extent of environmental disasters in forest regions. This accomplishes sustainable forest management, which can play an important role not only in preserving groundwater quality but also in achieving climate change adaptation goals.","[Farghaly, Dalia; Urban, Brigitte; Elba, Emad] LEUPHANA Univ Lueneburg, Fac Sustainabil Sci, Inst Ecol, Div Landscape Change, Luneburg, Germany; [Soergel, Uwe] Stuttgart Univ, Inst Photogrammetry, Stuttgart, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg; University of Stuttgart,"Farghaly, D (corresponding author), LEUPHANA Univ Lueneburg, Fac Sustainabil Sci, Inst Ecol, Div Landscape Change, Luneburg, Germany.",dalia.farghaly@stud.leuphana.de,,,German Aerospace Center (DLR) [LAN0011],German Aerospace Center (DLR)(Helmholtz AssociationGerman Aerospace Centre (DLR)),"The results presented here have been created using images provided by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to the Institute of Photogrammetry and Geoinformation (IPI) at Leibniz University in Hanover, Germany during a pilot project of DLR TerraSAR Science proposal LAN0011.",,44,1,1,0,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-9385,,,REMOTE SENS APPL,Remote Sens.

They are also expected to generate widespread response to adapt and mitigate the sufferings associated with these extremes. Societal and cultural responses to prolonged drought include population dislocation, cultural separation, habitation abandonment, and societal collapse. A typical response to local aridity is the human migration to safer and productive areas. However, climate and culture can interact in numerous ways. We hypothesize that people may resort to modify dwelling environments by adapting new strategies to optimize the utility of available water by harvesting rain rather than migrating to newer areas. We review recent palaeoclimatological evidence for climate change during the Holocene, and match those data with archaeological and historical records to test our 'climate change-rainwater harvest' hypothesis. We find correlation between heightened historical human efforts for construction of rainwater harvesting structures across regions in response to abrupt climate fluctuations, like aridity and drought. Historical societal adaptations to climate fluctuations may provide insights on potential responses of modern societies to future climate change that has a bearing on water resources, food production and management of natural systems.","Indian Inst Forest Management, Bhopal 462003, India; Forest Dept, Jaipur 302005, Rajasthan, India; Indian Inst Technol, Dept Geol & Geophys, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; NOAA Paleoclimatol Program, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80303 USA",Indian Institute of Forest Management; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Pandey, DN (corresponding author), Indian Inst Forest Management, Bhopal 462003, India.",dnpandey@ethnoforestry.org,"Pandey, Deep Narayan/F-7703-2010; anderson, david/E-6416-2011","Gupta, Anil/0000-0003-0536-3911; Pandey, Deep Narayan/0000-0002-6514-2152",,,,,136,177,179,3,92,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, SADASHIVANAGAR, P B #8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",0011-3891,,,CURR SCI INDIA,Curr.

We use socio-economic and climatic data from 1981 to 2015 to examine how climate variability led to variation in yield, as simulated by an economy-climate model (C-D-C). The sensitivity of crop yield to the impact of climate change refers to the change in yield caused by changing climatic factors under the condition of constant non-climatic factors. An 'output elasticity of comprehensive climate factor (CCF)' approach determines the sensitivity, using the yields per hectare for grain, rice, wheat and maize in China's main grain-producing areas as a case study. The results show that the CCF has a negative trend at a rate of -0.84/(10a) in the North region, while a positive trend of 0.79/(10a) is observed for the South region. Climate change promotes the ensemble increase in yields, and the contribution of agricultural labor force and total mechanical power to yields are greater, indicating that the yield in major grain-producing areas mainly depends on labor resources and the level of mechanization. However, the sensitivities to climate change of different crop yields to climate change present obvious regional differences: the sensitivity to climate change of the yield per hectare for maize in the North region was stronger than that in the South region. Therefore, the increase in the yield per hectare for maize in the North region due to the positive impacts of climate change was greater than that in the South region. In contrast, the sensitivity to climate change of the yield per hectare for rice in the South region was stronger than that in the North region. Furthermore, the sensitivity to climate change of maize per hectare yield was stronger than that of rice and wheat in the North region, and that of rice was the highest of the three crop yields in the South region. Finally, the economy-climate sensitivity zones of different crops were determined by the output elasticity of the CCF to help adapt to climate change and prevent food production risks.","[Xu, Yuan; Chou, Jieming; Yang, Fan; Sun, Mingyang; Zhao, Weixing; Li, Jiangnan] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Chou, JM (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",xuyuan01@mail.bnu.edu.cn; choujm@bnu.edu.cn; yangfan_bnu@mail.bnu.edu.cn; 201821051163@mail.bnu.edu.cn; 201921051146@mail.bnu.edu.cn; 201921051150@mail.bnu.edu.cn,,"chou, jieming/0000-0003-3343-3673; Xu, Yuan/0000-0002-3539-4068","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1509003, 2016YFA0602703]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42075167]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China, grant number 2018YFC1509003, and 2016YFA0602703; the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42075167).",,56,4,4,8,63,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,FEB,2021,12,2,,,,,,,172,10.3390/atmos12020172,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos12020172,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,QM9WN,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000622123600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

FILICOLLIS; BATTUS; PARASITES; PREVALENCE; SPATHIGER; SAMPLES,"Background: To address a lack of information on the control of ovine helminth parasites in Northern Ireland (NI), a number of research projects have been undertaken, dealing with gastrointestinal nematodes, tapeworms and liver fluke. This investigation concerns Nematodirus and concentrates on three aspects of disease: farm management strategies for its control, derived from the results of a Questionnaire; the efficacy of treatment used by farmers, as determined by a coprological survey; and the hatching requirements of Nematodirus eggs, that is, whether prolonged chilling is a pre-requisite for hatching. Results: A Questionnaire was sent to 252 sheep farmers in NI in March 2012 (covering the years 2009-2012) and replies were received from 228 farmers. Under-dosing, inaccurate calibration of equipment and inappropriate product choice were poor practices identified. Following this survey, the efficacy of treatment of Nematodirus spp. in sheep flocks was evaluated in April and May 2012. Sampling kits were sent to 51 flock owners, all of whom returned pre-and post-anthelmintic dosing faecal samples to the laboratory for analysis. At the time of treatment, 41 flocks were positive for Nematodirus (as diagnosed by the presence of eggs). Reduced benzimidazole efficacy was detected in 35.7% of flocks tested (n = 28). Although only involving a small number of flocks, reduced efficacy of levamisole treatment was detected in 50%, of avermectins in 33% and of moxidectin in 75% of flocks tested (n = 2, 6 and 4, respectively). In the egg hatch experiment, carried out under chilled and non-chilled conditions, 43% of the eggs in the non-chilled group were able to hatch, compared to 100% in the chilled group. Conclusions: The identification of inefficient control strategies argues for continued education of stockholders, in order to improve their management programmes. This is particularly important where the practices might impact on the development of anthelmintic resistance, which has been shown to exist on NI farms. The appropriate choice of anthelmintic is a vital part of this plan. The ability of eggs to hatch under non-chilled conditions demonstrates a flexibility in hatching behaviour.

The elasticity method was used to detect the responses of streamflow and runoff coefficient to various driving factors in 15 main catchments of the Loess Plateau, China between 1961 and 2009. The elasticity of streamflow (Q) and runoff coefficient (R-c) to precipitation (P), potential evapotranspiration (E-0), and catchment characteristics (represented by the parameter m in Fu's equation) were derived based on the Budyko hypothesis. There were two critical values of m = 2 and E-0/P = 1 for the elasticity of Q and R-c. The hydrological responses were mainly affected by catchment characteristics in water-limited regions (E-0/P > 1), and in humid areas (E-0/P < 1), climate conditions played a more important role for cases of m > 2 whereas catchment characteristics had a greater impact for cases of m < 2. The annual Q and R-c in 14 of the 15 catchments significantly decreased with average reduction of 0.87 mm yr(-1) and 0.18% yr(-1), respectively. The mean elasticities of Q to P, E-0 and m were 2.66,- 1.66 and -3.17, respectively. The contributions of land use/cover change and P reduction to decreased Q were 64.75% and 41.55%, respectively, while those to decreased R-c were 75.68% and 32.06%, respectively. In contrast, the decreased E-0 resulted in 6.30% and 7.73% increase of Q and R-c, respectively. The contribution of land use/cover changes was significantly and positively correlated with the increase in the percentage of the soil and water conservation measures area (p < 0.05). The R-c significantly and linearly decreased with the vegetation coverage (p < 0.01). Moreover, the R-c linearly decreased with the percentage of measures area in all catchments (eight of them were statistically significant with p < 0.05). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we reported the changes of climatic conditions, soil nutrients, variety types and management practices in the Taihu region (a typical rice growing zone) of east China in two periods (the 1980s and the 2000s), and simulated the changes of rice (Oryza sativa L) yields under different scenarios by using the APSIM-Oryza model. The contributions of the influencing factors in rice growing system were also calculated. The results revealed that there was a warming trend in the rice growing period in the Taihu region. However, the precipitation and sunshine hours in the rice growing season showed a decreasing trend in the past 30 years. Compared with the soil nutrients in the 19805, the mean concentrations of soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and potassium in the 2000s in the Taihu region were increased by 15.85%, 79.55%, 124.55% and 10.37%, respectively. The rice varieties in the 1980s could be described as the 'panicle weight type', while in the 2000s as the 'panicle number type'. The differences in management practices between 1980s and 2000s were mainly attributed to the fertilization and irrigation methods. From the 1980s to 2000s, the average rice yield in the Taihu region increased by 46.3%. The individual contribution of the climate change, soil improvement, variety updating and management progress on rice productivity was estimated as -19.5%, 12.7%, 21.7% and 34.6%, respectively. In addition, the spatial variation of rice yields in the whole region was reduced from 13.7% to 7.4% with the soil fertility improvement. The results indicate that future adaptations to climate change for rice yields would require either enhanced tolerance to high temperatures in the existing rice varieties or change in the current management practices, while balancing the soil fertility is a continuing process.

Such knowledge is pertinent to the design of sustainable livelihoods related to water resources. Here we present physico-chemical, stable environmental isotopes and microbial characteristics of drinking water sources that were investigated during the dry and rainy seasons of 2015 and 2018, along the West Coast of Cameroon to assess potability, health impacts and impacts of climate change. Field work involved mapping, collection of water samples and measurement of physical parameters (pH, EC and temperature). Major ions and total coliform were analyzed using Ion Chromatography and the Violet Red Bile Lactose Agar, respectively. Microbial contaminated samples were analyzed for Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. bacteria using MacConkey agar and Salmonella Shigella Agar agar, respectively. The health impacts of the water on the population were assessed based on records of water borne diseases from health centers and a hospital within the study area. delta O-18 and delta D isotopic ratios of 6 monthly rainfall samples and 12 samples from the different water sources were analyzed with the PICARRO made Cavity Ring Down Spectrometer, model L2120. The results revealed various seasonal dependent water chemistry with facies such as Ca+Mg-HCO3, Na+K-Cl and Ca+Mg-Cl+SO4, Ca+Mg-HCO3, Na+K-HCO3 for the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Furthermore, except for some rivers that showed slight evaporation effects, the waters in the springs and wells represent pristine rainwater, which shows delta O-18 depletion trend in the 1960s and enrichment between 1972 and 2017. 57% of the water sources were contaminated by either Escherichia coli and/or Salmonella spp., thus not potable as records from health centers indicated high prevalence of water borne diseases, caused by microbial contamination of the drinking water sources and inadequate sanitation and hygiene. Based on major ions content, 16% of the water sources were unsuitable for drinking. Factors that control water chemistry include water-rock interaction, anthropic inputs, and climate change driven seawater intrusion. Integrated water resources management would include among others, construction of drinking water treatment plants and implementation of climate change adaptation measures in the water sector.","[Sanga, Amban B.; Melisa, Bijingsi; Ayonghe, Samuel N.] Univ Buea, Dept Environm Sci, Buea, Cameroon; [Fantong, Wilson Y.] Inst Geol & Min Res, Box 4110, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Banseka, Hycinth S.] Cent Africa, Global Water Partnership, Yaounde, Cameroon",,"Fantong, WY (corresponding author), Inst Geol & Min Res, Box 4110, Yaounde, Cameroon.",fyetoh@yahoo.com,,,UBuea Consortium of the USAID Periperi U Grant for 2018/2019,UBuea Consortium of the USAID Periperi U Grant for 2018/2019,"We would like to acknowledge the contributions of the staff of the Laboratoire de Geochimie des Eaux (LAGE) of the Institute of Geological and Mining Research (IRGM) that is located in Nkolbisson-Yaounde) for the major ions and isotope analysis, the Microbiology unit of the University of Buea for microbial analysis.

It has since been recognised as appropriate for defining sections of the Australian coast, but had not been uniformly adopted around the nation in the way that has underpinned management, as in other countries. In 2012, the Australian Government supported a project to better understand coastal sediment dynamics using the sediment compartment approach as a framework within which to consider future shoreline behaviour and the impacts of climate change, including rising sea level, changing wave climates and sediment budgets. This paper outlines the sediment compartment project and uses case studies to demonstrate its application. The project consisted of three steps. The first step involved delineation of a hierarchy of coastal sediment compartments following a nationally agreed set of criteria, integrating the onshore/offshore geologic framework with known patterns of sediment movement and those inferred from surface landforms. This identified more than 100 primary compartments bounded by major structural features such as headlands or changes of shoreline orientation. At a finer scale, approximately 350 secondary compartments were identified, many of which encompass smaller scale structural features that define tertiary scale compartments or cells. For verification of this sediment compartments approach to coastal planning and management, the second step of the study comprised case studies of contrasting compartments with different patterns of sediment supply, transport and deposition. The third step, involved embedding all secondary compartments around the continental coast into the Shoreline Explorer, within the CoastAdqt toolbox (National Climate Change Adaption Research Facility). Information regarding the sensitivity of shorelines to change was compiled at the compartment scale, based upon evidence such as substrate, sediment transport attributes and oceanographic forcing, including waves, tides and storm processes. Presentation of information through CoastAdapt within the compartments framework provides a resource to facilitate improved coastal planning and management over different implementation levels, from national strategy scale down to local policy scale. Case studies from several contrasting settings around the Australian coast demonstrated the potential and feasible application of the sediment compartment approach at different spatial and temporal scales.","[Thom, B.

However, for instance, in mountain regions and in developing countries there exist significant gaps in ground based climate records in space and time. Specifically, in the Peruvian Andes spatially and temporally coherent precipitation information is a prerequisite for ongoing climate change adaptation projects in the fields of water resources, disasters and food security. The present work aims at evaluating the ability of Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) to estimate precipitation rates at daily 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees scale in the Central Andes and the dependency of the estimate performance on changing spatial and temporal resolution. Comparison of the TMPA product with gauge measurements in the regions of Cuzco, Peru and La Paz, Bolivia were carried out and analysed statistically. Large biases are identified in both investigation areas in the estimation of daily precipitation amounts. The occurrence of strong precipitation events was well assessed, but their intensities were underestimated. TMPA estimates for La Paz show high false alarm ratio. The dependency of the TMPA estimate quality with changing resolution was analysed by comparisons of 1-, 7-, 15- and 30-day sums for Cuzco, Peru. The correlation of TMPA estimates with ground data increases strongly and almost linearly with temporal aggregation. The spatial aggregation to 0.5 degrees, 0.75 degrees and 1 degrees grid box averaged precipitation and its comparison to gauge data of the same areas revealed no significant change in correlation coefficients and estimate performance. In order to profit from the TMPA combination product on a daily basis, a procedure to blend it with daily precipitation gauge measurements is proposed. Different sources of errors and uncertainties introduced by the sensors, sensor-specific algorithm aspects and the TMPA processing scheme are discussed. This study reveals the possibilities and restrictions of the use of TMPA estimates in the Central Andes and should assist other researchers in the choice of the best resolution-accuracy relationship according to requirements of their applications.","[Scheel, M.

Our results show that population-weighted exposure to locally defined extreme heat (i.e., population heat exposure) would increase by a factor of 12.7-29.5 under a high-intensity greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and urban development pathway. Additionally, end-of-century population cold exposure is projected to rise by a factor of 1.3-2.2, relative to start-of-century population cold exposure. We identify specific metropolitan regions in which population heat exposure would increase most markedly and characterize the relative significance of various drivers responsible for this increase. The largest absolute changes in population heat exposure during the 21st century are projected to occur in major US metropolitan regions like New York City (NY), Los Angeles (CA), Atlanta (GA), and Washington DC. The largest relative changes in population heat exposure (i.e., changes relative to start-of-century) are projected to occur in rapidly growing cities across the US Sunbelt, for example Orlando (FL), Austin (TX), Miami (FL), and Atlanta. The surge in population heat exposure across the Sunbelt is driven by concurrent GHG-induced warming and population growth which, in tandem, could strongly compound population heat exposure.

It is however paradoxical that climate mitigation in Denmark has created negative energy and indoor climate problems in housing that may be made worse by climate change. A literature review has been carried out of housing schemes where climate mitigation was sought through reduced space heating demand, and it is shown that extensive problems with overheating exist. A theoretical study of regulative and design strategies for climate mitigation in new build housing has therefore been carried out, and it is shown that reducing space heating with high levels of thermal insulation and passive solar energy results in overheating and a growing demand for cooling. Climate change is expected to reduce space heating and increase cooling demand in housing. An analysis of new build housing using passive solar energy as a climate mitigation strategy has therefore been carried out in relation to future climate change scenarios. It is shown that severe indoor comfort problems can occur, questioning the relevance of passive solar energy as a climate mitigation strategy. In conclusion, a theoretical study of the interplay between climate adaptation and mitigation strategies is carried out, with a cross-disciplinary focus on users, passive design and active technologies. It is shown that the cumulative use of these strategies can create an adaptation buffer, thus eliminating problems with overheating and reducing energy consumption. New build housing should therefore be designed in relation to both current and future climate scenarios to show that the climate mitigation strategies ensure climate adaptation.","Aalborg Univ, Danish Bldg Res Inst, SBi Energy & Environm, Aalborg, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Marsh, R (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Danish Bldg Res Inst, SBi Energy & Environm, Aalborg, Denmark.",rom@sbi.aau.dk,,,,,,,27,2,2,0,19,OPEN HOUSE INT,GREAT BRITAIN,"URBAN INTERNATIONAL PRESS, PO BOX 74, GATESHEAD, TYNE & WEAR, GREAT BRITAIN, NE9 5UZ, ENGLAND",0168-2601,,,OPEN HOUSE INT,Open House Int.,DEC,2012,37,4,,,,,19,28,,,,,,10,Architecture; Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Architecture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,068SZ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000313387800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

We analyze extreme precipitation using indices (EPIs), including consecutive dry days (CDD), annual total precipitation, simple daily intensity, and the number of extremely wet days, under the past and future climatic conditions over East Africa. The exposure of the East African population to these extreme events at 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C global warming levels (GWLs) is analyzed based on Climate Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 models. Exposure is computed from extremely wet and dry days (R95p and CDD, respectively). Under both GWLs, EPIs (except CDD) averaged over East Africa are projected to increase under the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP)2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. The largest increase in wet events will likely occur in eastern and northern Kenya. The results also reveal an intensification of precipitation extremes over Burundi, Rwanda, and some parts of Uganda. However, small changes are expected over most parts of Kenya and Tanzania. Examination of population exposure to EPIs shows that the most prominent and net intense occurrence is over Burundi, Rwanda, and some parts of Uganda. In contrast, less change is noted to occur over vast parts of Kenya and Tanzania. Meanwhile, limiting the warming target to less than 1.5 degrees C but not more than 2.0 degrees C has 37% (44.2%) and 92% (4%) less impact on the occurrence of EPIs for R95p (CDD) under SSP2-4.5 (SSP5-8.5) scenarios, respectively. The study establishes that future exposure is predominantly driven by changes in population compared to other factors such as climate or concurrent changes in climate and population (the nonlinear interaction effect). For instance, climate effects are anticipated to contribute similar to 10.6% (12.6%) of the total change in population exposure under 1.5 degrees C (2.0 degrees C) warming levels, while population and interaction effects are expected to contribute similar to 77.4% (71.9%) and 12% (15.5%), respectively, under 1.5 degrees C (2.0 degrees C) scenarios. Interestingly, the projected changes in regional exposure due to the interaction effects under SSP2-4.5 are greater than the climate effect, while the reverse pattern is observed under SSP5-8.5. For example, under SSP5-8.5, climate effects for 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C are larger (after population effect) with similar to 3.8 x 10(5) (15.7%) and similar to 6.1 x 10(5) (17.5%) billion person-mm, respectively. The high exposure noted over East Africa calls for a shift in policies to instate suitable adaptation measures to cushion the already vulnerable population.","[Ayugi, Brian] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Atmospher Environm & Equip, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Jiangsu Key Lab Atmospher Environm Monitoring & P, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Ayugi, Brian; Jiang, Zhihong; Iyakaremye, Vedaste] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ KLME, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Ayugi, Brian; Jiang, Zhihong; Iyakaremye, Vedaste] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Ayugi, Brian; Jiang, Zhihong; Iyakaremye, Vedaste] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Ayugi, Brian] Org African Acad Doctors OAAD, Off Kamiti Rd,POB 25305-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Iyakaremye, Vedaste] Rwanda Meteorol Agcy, Nyarugenge KN 96 St, Kigali, Rwanda; [Ngoma, Hamida] Univ Connecticut, Dept Geosci, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Babaousmail, Hassen] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Binjiang Coll, Wuxi, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Onyutha, Charles] Kyambogo Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, POB 1, Kampala, Uganda; [Dike, Victor Nnamdi] Chinese Acad Sci, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Dike, Victor Nnamdi] Imo State Polytech Umuagwo, Energy Climate & Environm Sci Grp, PMB 1472, Owerri, Imo State, Nigeria; [Mumo, Richard] Botswana Int Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math & Stat Sci, Plot 10071,Private Bag 16, Palapye, Botswana; [Ongoma, Victor] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ, Int Water Res Inst, Lot 660, Ben Guerir 43150, Morocco","Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of Connecticut; Wuxi University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Mohammed VI Polytechnic University","Jiang, ZH (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ KLME, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.;Jiang, ZH (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.;Jiang, ZH (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",zhjiang@nuist.edu.cn,"Babaousmail, Hassen/ABA-1211-2021; Ayugi, Brian Odhiambo/C-3372-2017; Dike, Victor Nnamdi/J-7734-2018","Babaousmail, Hassen/0000-0001-6648-574X; Ayugi, Brian Odhiambo/0000-0003-3660-7755; Dike, Victor Nnamdi/0000-0003-2268-5859; Nadoya, Hamida Ngoma/0000-0002-3690-244X; /0000-0002-5110-2870",Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0603804]; Postdoctoral Research Foundation of Jiangsu Province [2191012100301],Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology(Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Postdoctoral Research Foundation of Jiangsu Province,The authors appreciate the WCRP-WGCM for making the latest outputs from CMIP6 publicly available.

Climateadaptive forest management strategies such as genomics-based assisted migration (AM) may help protect many of these threatened benefits. However, such novel technological interventions in complex social-ecological systems will generate new risks, benefits, and uncertainties that interact with diverse forest values and preexisting risks. Using data from 16 focus groups in British Columbia, Canada, we show that different stakeholders (forestry professionals, environmental nongovernmental organizations, local government officials, and members of local business communities) emphasize different kinds of risks and uncertainties in judging the appropriateness of AM. We show the difficulty of climate-adaptive decisions in complex social-ecological systems in which both climate change and adaptation will have widespread and cascading impacts on diverse nonclimate values. Overarching judgments about AM as an adaptation strategy, which may appear simple when elicited in surveys or questionnaires, require that participants make complex trade-offs among multiple domains of uncertain and unknown risks. Overall, the highest-priority forest management objective for most stakeholders is the health and integrity of the forest ecosystem from which all other important forest values derive. The factor perceived as riskiest is our lack of knowledge of how forest ecosystems work, which hinders stakeholders in their assessment of AM's acceptability. These results are further evidence of the inherent risk in privileging natural science above other forms of knowledge at the science-policy interface. When decisions are framed as technical, the normative and ethical considerations that define our fundamental goals are made invisible.","[Findlater, Kieran; Kozak, Robert; Hagerman, Shannon] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Findlater, Kieran] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Findlater, Kieran] Univ British Columbia, Sch Publ Policy & Global Affairs, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"Findlater, K (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.;Findlater, K (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.;Findlater, K (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Sch Publ Policy & Global Affairs, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",k.findlater@alumni.ubc.ca,,,Genome Canada [241REF]; Genome BC,Genome Canada(Genome Canada); Genome BC,"We thank our participants for their time and atten-tion as well as Michele Sam for her constructive critique and thoughtful advice on Indigenous engagement.

In Mexico, extensive Wildlife Management Units (eWMUs) are environmental policy instruments designed to promote ecosystem conservation and rural development via the sustainable use of wildlife by local populations. However, evidence of the successful reduction of LULCC by eWMUs is contradictory, and there has been no investigation into their potential as an action to promote climate change adaptation. In this study, we focused on the overall patterns of LULCC associated with eWMU throughout the country and examined strengths and weaknesses of eWMUs as policy instruments to address climate change. In particular, we analyzed how differences in areas with eWMUs influence LULCC and assessed how eWMUs could contribute to reducing vulnerability, particularly in double exposure municipalities. We calculated the percentage of eWMUs per municipality from official information and estimated LULCC from vegetation changes between 2002 and 2011. We then used the Kruskal-Wallis test to find statistically significant differences in vegetation changes based on the percentage of eWMUs and performed between-group comparisons using a post hoc Dunn test. Although Mexico has 2456 municipalities, only 37% have eWMUs. Furthermore, 64% of Mexico's municipalities have lost vegetation cover, whereas only 36% have either gained vegetation or remained stable. In municipalities that recorded changes to the vegetation, those changes were, overall, minimal and involved less than 10% of the total area of those municipalities. In general, municipalities with less than 10% of their total area dedicated to eWMUs experienced higher vegetation losses than those with more than 10% of their total area dedicated to eWMUs. We detected twelve double exposure municipalities, i.e. they are vulnerable to climate change and lost more than 10% of their vegetation. Double exposure municipalities dedicated less than 2% of their total area to eWMUs as well. Our results suggest that incremental increases in the area dedicated to eWMUs may reduce LULCC and protect vegetation, particularly in double exposure municipalities. Based on the literature, some ecological, economic and socio-cultural factors may determine the success of eWMUs and strongly impact LULCC. Therefore, additional efforts must be made to enhance our understanding of ecological and climatic processes; habitats must be monitored using a standardized methodology; biological, cultural, economic and institutional diversity must be incorporated into the planning, implementation and monitoring of eWMUs; and agreements must be established to strengthen social organization and human capital. Taking all this into account, we suggest that reducing vulnerability and improving double exposure areas by increasing the number and interconnectedness of eWMUs could represent an effective strategic approach at the municipal level to address LULCC and climate change.

While globalisation and development mark the good face of the consequential coin, increased frequency of extreme events and disaster risks along with the phenomenon of climate change, marks the dark face of the same coin. Each time the society takes a catastrophic hit, humanity begs to question the role of corporates in disaster mitigation, management and rehabilitation. The most popular way of engagement for the corporates in such a time of dire need is through providing relief and support, be it in cash, kind, man-power etc. The idea of this study evolves from this very trend which appears to be embedded in the socio-political fibre of our society, especially India. The Companies Act, 2013 of India has steered India into becoming one of the few countries with a mandatory CSR regime. The avenues of expenditure, as mandated by the government, effectively circumscribes the objectives of sustainable development. This study finds its genesis in the logical question that follows this premise; since expenditure through CSR is already mandatory in India and is directed towards sustainable development, why not channel such investments in such a manner that disaster resilience and climate change adaptation becomes inclusive of the final objective of sustainable development? However, the socio-political ecosystemis not conducive to enforce such a paradigm shift; from CSR expenditures in relief and rehabilitation to disaster resilience oriented sustainable development. Hence, the purpose of this study is to identify those crucial elements of our society and their inter-dependencies which when ideally tweaked and nurtured will lead to a social setup where CSR investments would lead to sustainable development inclusive of disaster resilience. Extensive literature review was done to identify elements or enablers, which are critical in bringing about a change in the present socio-political texture of CSR investment and engagement. Questionnaire survey and interviews were used as a tool to judge and evaluate these enablers. Discussions and debates leading to feed backs and inputs from twenty experts from the relevant field and academicians were used for further refinement of the enablers and then the enablers were subjected to Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) which brought out the contextual relationships among the enablers. The resultant model is illustrated in the form of a hierarchical structure of enablers revealing their inter-dependencies and relations with each-other. This would help policymakers, corporates and other stakeholders to understand and know those, already existing, societal elements which when tapped upon would not only benefit them but also help in building a disaster resilient society.

It is anticipated that the property sector could be affected by variable climate and related extremes as well as by the strategies adopted to combat greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper aims to analyse the current knowledge regarding future climate changes to understand their possible impacts on the real estate sector of Malaysia with an aim to help stakeholders to adopt necessary responses to reduce negative impacts. Design/methodology/approach - Available literature is reviewed and data related to climatic influences on buildings and structures are analysed to understand the climate change impacts on real estate in Malaysia. Findings - The study reveals that temperature in the Peninsular Malaysia will increase by 1.1 to 3.6 degrees C, rainfall will be more variable and river discharge in some river basins will increase up to 43 per cent during the northeast monsoon season by the end of this century. These changes in turn will pose risks of property damage and increase property lifecycle costs. Furthermore, property prices and the overall growth of the property sector may be affected by the government policy of GHG emission reduction by up to 45 per cent by the year 2030. This study concludes that the property sector of Malaysia will be most affected by the implementation of GHG emission reduction policy in the short term and due to the physical risk posed by variable climate and related extremes in the long term. Originality/value - The study in general will assist in guiding the operational responses of various authorities, especially in terms of those interventions aimed at climate change risk reduction in the property sector of Malaysia.","[Shahid, Shamsuddin; Shourav, Sabbir Ahmed; Minhans, Anil; bin Ismail, Tarmizi] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Johor Baharu, Malaysia; [Wang, Xiaojun] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaojun] Minist Water Resources, Res Ctr Climate Change, Water Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research; Ministry of Water Resources,"Shahid, S (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Johor Baharu, Malaysia.",sshahid@utm.my,"Hadi Pour, Sahar/AAL-1037-2020; Ismail, Tarmizi/AAO-3422-2020; SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/B-5185-2010","Hadi Pour, Sahar/0000-0002-8458-8803; Ismail, Tarmizi/0000-0002-6748-4703; SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/0000-0001-9621-6452",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia through GUP [10H36],Universiti Teknologi Malaysia through GUP,The authors are grateful to Universiti Teknologi Malaysia for providing financial support for this research through GUP Grant No 10H36.,,74,45,45,3,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

This paper combines a comprehensive estimation strategy and a unique panel dataset to study the role of financial insurance in farmers' welfare under uncertainty. Data are drawn from a large Italian farm panel dataset. We find that (i) demand for insurance products is likely to increase in response to climatic conditions, and (ii) that the use of insurance reduces the extent of risk exposure. We also find that farms growing more crops are less likely to adopt the insurance scheme. This confirms what is found in the theoretical literature.

To address this issue, an integrative farm management approach such as Climate-Smart Agriculture can help reorient agricultural practices towards climate adaptation and food security. Past studies have shown that several factors can either hinder or encourage the adoptions of Climate-Smart practices, including subjective expectations and perceptions. Building on this literature, we analyze farmers' climate awareness and their perceptions regarding the change in climate patterns as well as their choices of fanning practices to adapt to these changes. We show that reforestation was the preferred adaptation strategy among interviewed farmers and that educational profiles and the size of landholdings drive the adoption of this and other practices. Soil management and introduction of new crops are preferred by literate farms with large farmlands, whereas illiterate farmers with smaller farmland tend to move towards farm intensification with an increase in the utilization of external inputs. Our findings provide evidence to support the design of capacity development interventions targeting specific groups of farmers according to their main crop and education profile.","[de Sousa, Kaue; Mercado, Leida] Trop Agr & Higher Educ Ctr CATIE, Res Program Dev Econ & Environm, Turrialba, Costa Rica; [de Sousa, Kaue] Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Agr Sci, Hamar, Norway; [de Sousa, Kaue] Biovers Int, Costa Rica Off, Turrialba, Costa Rica; [Casanoves, Fernando; Ospina, Alejandra] Trop Agr & Higher Educ Ctr CATIE, Biostat Unit, Turrialba, Costa Rica; [Sellare, Jorge] Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany; [Suchini, Jose Gabriel] Trop Agr & Higher Educ Ctr CATIE, Guatemala Tech Off, Esquipulas, Guatemala; [Aguilar, Amilcar] Trop Agr & Higher Educ Ctr CATIE, Nicaragua Tech Off, Managua, Nicaragua",CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza; Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences; Alliance; Bioversity International; CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza; University of Gottingen,"de Sousa, K (corresponding author), Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Agr Sci, Postboks 400, N-2418 Elverum, Norway.;Mercado, L (corresponding author), CATIE, Res Program Dev Econ & Environm, Trop Agr Res & Higher Educ Ctr, Turrialba 30501, Costa Rica.",k.desousa@cgiar.org; lmercado@catie.ac.cr,"de Sousa, Kauê/AAX-5396-2020; Sellare, Jorge/ABE-8669-2020; Casanoves, Fernando/I-3588-2016","de Sousa, Kauê/0000-0002-7571-7845; Sellare, Jorge/0000-0002-4445-0252; Casanoves, Fernando/0000-0001-8765-9382",Royal Embassy of Norway [CAM-2647-12/0004],Royal Embassy of Norway,"This work has been possible thanks to the financial support from the Royal Embassy of Norway (contract no.

The paper applies this method in the context of residential electricity and natural gas demand for the world's fifth largest economy - California. The advantage of the proposed method is that it only requires detailed information on intensive margin behavior, yet does not require explicit knowledge of the extensive margin response (e.g., technology adoption). Using almost two billion energy bills, we estimate spatially highly disaggregated intensive margin temperature response functions using daily variation in weather. In a second step, we explain variation in the slopes of the dose response functions across space as a function of summer climate. Using 18 climate models, we simulate future demand by letting households vary consumption along the intensive and extensive margins. We show that failing to account for extensive margin adjustment in electricity demand leads to a significant underestimate of the future impacts on electricity consumption. We further show that reductions in natural gas demand more than offset any climate-driven increases in electricity consumption in this context.","[Auffhammer, Maximilian] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA; [Auffhammer, Maximilian] NBER, Cambridge, MA USA; [Auffhammer, Maximilian] 207 Giannini Hall 3310, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Auffhammer, M (corresponding author), 207 Giannini Hall 3310, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",auffhammer@berkeley.edu,,"Auffhammer, Maximilian/0000-0002-1941-6132",,,,,42,7,7,12,22,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0095-0696,1096-0449,,J ENVIRON ECON MANAG,J.Environ.Econ.Manage.,JUL,2022,114,,,,,,,,102669,10.1016/j.jeem.2022.102669,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2022.102669,,JUN 2022,19,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,2D9SQ,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000811877900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, various design parameters that meet the principle of climate adaptation are proposed to achieve the unity of energy utilization and indoor thermal comfort level. According to the local energy conservation codes, five typical benchmark geometric models were established in Open Studio (Sketch-Up plug-in) for sites representative of various climates, meanwhile, adopting the engine of Energy Plus (EP-Launch) to calculate the instrument definition file (IDF), respectively, for assessing the coupling relationship between energy consumption as well as thermal comfort. Results implied that based on the time proportion (8760 h) that met the level 1 comfort range, total energy reductions of different Chinese climate regions were different. Among them, the severe cold zone (SCZ-Changchun) and hot summer and cold winter zone (HSCW-Shanghai) appeared to have the greatest energy saving potential with 18-24% and 16-19%, respectively, while the cold zone (CZ-Beijing) and mild zone (MZ-Kunming) approximately equaled 15% and 12-15%, and the saving space of the hot summer and warm winter zone (HSWW-Haikou) appeared relatively low, only around 5-7%. Although the simulation results may be limited by the number of parameter settings, the main ones are under consideration seriously, which is further indication that there is still much room for appropriate improvements in the local public building energy efficiency codes.","[Guo, Yuang; Bart, Dewancker] Univ Kitakyushu, Fac Environm Engn, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8080135, Japan",University of Kitakyushu,"Guo, Y (corresponding author), Univ Kitakyushu, Fac Environm Engn, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8080135, Japan.",gya900328@gmail.com; bart@kitakyu-u.ac.jp,"Guo, Yuang/HMD-5796-2023","Guo, Yuang/0000-0001-5035-2336; Dewancker, Bart/0000-0002-1212-0750",,,,,50,14,14,2,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2020,12,9,,,,,,,3540,10.3390/su12093540,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12093540,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LU0TK,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000537476200039,View Full Record in Web of Science

One factor among many is housing quality because an intact house is a household's first line of defense against the wrath of nature. By taking the San Francisco Bay Area as a proof-of-concept, we develop a deep-learning algorithm to show that blue roof tarps, used in the area as semipermanent fixtures to reduce roof leakage, can serve as a proxy for poor-quality housing. Our cascading structure of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) operates in a coarse-to-fine manner by first identifying buildings and then classifying them as containing a blue roof tarp or not, achieving a recall of 89.6% and a precision of 34.3% in our study area. Our work suggests that up to 5% of houses are of poor quality in some low-to-intermediate income communities in the San Francisco Bay Area. However, the percentage of poor-quality houses varies by an order of magnitude even in communities with a comparable median income or social vulnerability index, suggesting that prioritizing climate adaptation investments based on these common indicators could be ineffective. Our work emphasizes the value of a community-centric approach to improving housing quality and reducing the disproportional impacts of not only one but multiple climate hazards.","[Velterop, Emma] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Uzkent, Burak] Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Suckale, Jenny] Stanford Univ, Dept Geophys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University; Stanford University,"Suckale, J (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Geophys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jsuckale@stanford.edu,,"Velterop, Emma/0000-0003-1832-4292",Stanford Future Bay Initiative; Stanford Impact Labs; Haas Center for Public Service at Stanford University,Stanford Future Bay Initiative; Stanford Impact Labs; Haas Center for Public Service at Stanford University,"This research and its publication were supported by the Stanford Future Bay Initiative, the Stanford Impact Labs, and the Haas Center for Public Service at Stanford University.

Adaptation-including efforts to manage climate change risks, reduce damages, and take advantage of new opportunities-has been identified as a priority for policy action across government levels. However, our understanding of adaptation in the Canadian North is limited: Is adaptation taking place, to what stresses, and what does it look like? In this paper we answer these questions for the Inuit territory of Nunavut, systematically cataloguing and reviewing government-led adaptation programs and policies at community, territorial, and federal levels, drawing on publically available information. We documented a total of 700 discrete adaptation initiatives. The focus on adaptation to-date has primarily been at the groundwork level, aimed at informing and preparing for adaptation through impact assessments, adaptation planning exercises, and stakeholder engagement. Adaptation in Nunavut has been driven by cross-scale coordination and leadership from the territorial and federal government. Our study finds few examples of concrete actions for planned adaptation, such as changes to or creation of policies that enable adaptation, alterations to building codes and infrastructure design with changing geohazards, or enhanced disaster planning and emergency preparedness in light of projected impacts. This study indicates a need for formal adaptation plans for the Governments of Canada and Nunavut, emphasis on adaptation monitoring and evaluation, and a greater role of Inuit traditional knowledge and cultural values in adaptation policy.","[Labbe, Jolene; Ford, James D.; Araos, Malcolm; Flynn, Melanie] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, 805 Sherbrooke, Montreal, PQ H3A 089, Canada",McGill University,"Labbe, J (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Geog, 805 Sherbrooke, Montreal, PQ H3A 089, Canada.",jolene.labbe@mail.mcgill.ca,"Ford, James/A-4284-2013","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council; Canadian Institute of Health Research; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council; International Development Research Center; ArcticNet,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Canadian Institute of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); International Development Research Center; ArcticNet,"Funding for this research was provided by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Canadian Institute of Health Research, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, the International Development Research Center, and ArcticNet.

The ensuing impacts are anticipated to present immense challenges for remote communities, in terms of maintaining housing comfort, family health and wellbeing, engagement in education and employment, and community services and businesses. About 50 % of the Australian landmass is considered remote and it is home to a highly dispersed population of about half a million people (with 30 % being Indigenous people). Much of the population in remote Australia is considered highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change as they are highly exposed and sensitive to the impacts, with many having a low adaptive capacity. The lives of Aboriginal Australians living in remote communities are strongly influenced and governed by traditional customs, knowledge and practices. Even when living in large towns, people who are strongly connected to their country are able to blend knowledge from traditional and modern sources to adapt to the current climate. This article explores the extent of adaptive capacity of people to climate change in a small remote community and large service town in the Northern Territory of Australia and provides insights about their capacities and vulnerabilities. Results indicate that the social and cultural capital are of greater importance than commonly assessed and provide scope to enhance effective community-based climate adaptation.","[Race, Digby; Mathew, Supriya; Campbell, Matthew; Hampton, Karl] Cooperat Res Ctr Remote Econ Participat, Alice Springs, NT 0870, Australia; [Race, Digby] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Alice Springs, NT 0870, Australia; [Race, Digby] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Mathew, Supriya] Charles Darwin Univ, Alice Springs, NT 0870, Australia; [Campbell, Matthew] Tangentyere Council, Alice Springs, NT 0870, Australia; [Hampton, Karl] Ninti One Ltd, Alice Springs, NT 0870, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Australian National University; Charles Darwin University,"Race, D (corresponding author), Cooperat Res Ctr Remote Econ Participat, Alice Springs, NT 0870, Australia.;Race, D (corresponding author), CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Alice Springs, NT 0870, Australia.;Race, D (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",digby.race@anu.edu.au,"Fazli, Ghazal/AAE-8320-2022","Race, Digby/0000-0002-6947-6125; mathew, supriya/0000-0002-8078-3708",Cooperative Research Centre for Remote Economic Participation,"Cooperative Research Centre for Remote Economic Participation(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme)","The authors would like to thank Jocelyn Davies, Rosemary Hill, Nadine Marshall and Siri Veland for their valuable comments on an earlier draft of this article.

Within the European project Life + TRUST (Tool for Regional-scale assessment of groundwater Storage improvement in adaptation to climaTe change), a Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) methodology was developed in order to identify impacts from climate change on groundwater and associated ecosystems (e.g. surface waters, agricultural areas, natural environments) and to rank areas and receptors at risk in the high and middle Veneto and Friuli Plain (Italy). Based on an integrated analysis of impacts, vulnerability and risks linked to climate change at the regional scale, a RRA framework complying with the Sources-Pathway-Receptor-Consequence (SPRC) approach was defined. Relevant impacts on groundwater and surface waters (i.e. groundwater level variations, changes in nitrate infiltration processes, changes in water availability for irrigation) were selected and analyzed through hazard scenario, exposure, susceptibility and risk assessment. The RRA methodology used hazard scenarios constructed through global and high resolution model simulations for the 2071-2100 period, according to IPCC A1B emission scenario in order to produce useful indications for future risk prioritization and to support the addressing of adaptation measures, primarily Managed Artificial Recharge (MAR) techniques. Relevant outcomes from the described RRA application highlighted that potential climate change impacts will occur with different extension and magnitude in the case study area. Particularly, qualitative and quantitative impacts on groundwater will occur with more severe consequences in the wettest and in the driest scenario (respectively). Moreover, such impacts will likely have little direct effects on related ecosystems - croplands, forests and natural environments - lying along the spring area (about 12% of croplands and 2% of natural environments at risk) while more severe consequences will indirectly occur on natural and anthropic systems through the reduction in quality and quantity of water availability for agricultural and other uses (about 80% of agricultural areas and 27% of groundwater bodies at risk).

In established wine-growing regions, bestowing to local climatic conditions, yield and quality are mostly optimized, planting the best wine variety and applying specific cultural practices. Thus, the sustainability of the winemaking sector worldwide is being challenged by ongoing climate change, requiring adaptation at different levels. Climate change will inflict progressively dry and warm conditions on Portuguese vineyards, with changes in frequency and intensity of weather extremes. However, the future pro-jections of these extreme events and their potential impacts on viticulture are less understood. For this purpose, in this study, seventeen climate extreme indices were calculated for the Portuguese wine denomination of origin regions/subregions, in the historical period (1981-2010) and future periods (2041-2070 and 2071-2100), under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5, and based on a five-member ensemble of Regional Climate Model-Global Climate Model chain simulations. Furthermore, a principal component analysis was undertaken for both precipitation and temperature extreme indices independently. We found an increase in temperature ex-tremes in all wine regions in Portugal, particularly in the westernmost regions. Regarding the precipitation extremes, they reveal a lessening effect for future periods, accompanied by a generalized decrease of precipi-tation, but will remain an important threat in the northeastern regions. Conversely, the dry extremes, potenti-ating severe droughts, will be significantly strengthened. Lastly, it was possible to identify the most exposed and vulnerable wine regions to weather extremes in future climates. This information is critical for supporting decision-making in the sector, namely for long-term planning, climate change adaptation and risk reduction. Practical Implications: In the winemaking sector, resorting to climate information is an effective way of mitigating climate-related risks to attain specific terroirs. To effectively deliver this information to winemakers, climatic vulnerability needs to be identified regionally, in order to promote suitable and locally adjusted measures and policies. In this study, Wine Protected Denomination of Origin (PDO) in Portugal are the key target of the climate (temperature and precipitation) extreme variability between present and future periods. The results provided and synthesized in this study should be able to inform winemakers by identifying potential areas of risk con-cerning the ongoing climate change and acting accordingly based on the potential occurrence of these climate extremes in each PDO area. Furthermore, some short-term and long-term strategies are presented to mitigate the general increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation.","[Fonseca, Andre; Fraga, Helder; Santos, Joao A.] Univ Tras os Montes & Alto Douro UTAD, Ctr Res & Technol Agro Environm & Biol Sci CITAB, POB 1013, P-5001801 Vila Real, Portugal; [Fonseca, Andre; Fraga, Helder; Santos, Joao A.] Inst Innovat Capac Bldg & Sustainabil Agrifood Pro, Vairao, Portugal",University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro,"Fonseca, A (corresponding author), Univ Tras os Montes & Alto Douro UTAD, Ctr Res & Technol Agro Environm & Biol Sci CITAB, POB 1013, P-5001801 Vila Real, Portugal.;Fonseca, A (corresponding author), Inst Innovat Capac Bldg & Sustainabil Agrifood Pro, Vairao, Portugal.",andre.fonseca@utad.pt,"Fraga, Helder/D-8507-2012; Fonseca, Andre/A-1805-2017","Fraga, Helder/0000-0002-7946-8786; Fonseca, Andre/0000-0001-6792-8047; Santos, Joao Carlos Andrade dos/0000-0002-8135-5078","National Funds by FCT - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [UIDB/04033/ 2020]; Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional (FEDER); Programa Operacional Regional do Norte, under the project Soil recover for a healthy food and quality of life (SoilRec4+Health) [NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000083]; CoaClimateRisk - FCT [COA/CAC/0030/2019]; FCT [CEECIND/00447/2017, 2022.02317.CEECIND]","National Funds by FCT - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional (FEDER)(European Commission); Programa Operacional Regional do Norte, under the project Soil recover for a healthy food and quality of life (SoilRec4+Health); CoaClimateRisk - FCT; FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","This research was funded by National Funds by FCT - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, under the project UIDB/04033/ 2020, and by Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional (FEDER), Programa Operacional Regional do Norte, under the project Soil recover for a healthy food and quality of life (SoilRec4+Health), NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000083.

Alterations in rainfall patterns and increasing temperatures projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) could lead to a decline in agricultural production in many areas requiring significant changes in agricultural practices and land distribution. The study provided estimates of the economic impacts of climate change, compared these with historical impacts of drought spells, and estimated the extent to which the current Moroccan agricultural development and investment strategy, the Plan Maroc Vert, helps in agricultural adaptation to climate change and uncertainty. The aim of this study was to quantify the effects of climate change on the overall economy by using an integrated framework incorporating a computable general equilibrium model. A concomitant factor to climate change will be the increase in population and its distribution and level of consumption, which will also influence agricultural production strategies, the conversion of agricultural land, the type of irrigation, and technological development. We demonstrated how changes in cereal production and area, affluence, and climate (rainfall and temperature) can be acquired for 12 regions of Morocco and used to develop and validate an earth system model in relation to the environment and socio-economic level, which projects their impact on current and potential land use over the next 20 years. We used different mathematical equations based on cereal area and production, population, consumption (kg/person), and change in climate (temperature and rainfall) in bour and irrigated areas for the growing season of 2014 in 12 regions to project agricultural land use over the next 20 years. Therefore, several possible scenarios were investigated to explore how variations in climate change, socio-economic level, and technological development will affect the future of agricultural land use over the next 20 years, which in turn could have important implications for human well-being. Among the 12 Moroccan regions, only 4 had a surplus of cereal production compared to their local consumption. The increase in population will generate a cereal deficit in 2024 and 2034, thus lowering the average annual quantity available per capita of cereals from 204.75 to 160.61 kg/p in 2014 and 2034, respectively. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the amount of cereals per person by 5 kg/p and 25 kg/p so that the 2014 production could satisfy the population projected in 2024 and 2034. We found that cereal production will decrease with increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation according to the simulated scenarios, which might not satisfy the growing population in 2024 and 2034. This study provides a practical tool that can be used to provide policy makers with advice on food security assurance policy based on our current knowledge of the impending onset of climate change, including socio-economic statistics and the agricultural constraints of cereals in the 12 regions of Morocco.","[Amiri, Nassima; Khebiza, Mohammed Yacoubi; Messouli, Mohammed] Cadi Ayyad Univ, Fac Sci Semlalia, Lab Water Biodivers & Climate Change, Marrakech 40000, Morocco; [Lahlali, Rachid; Amiri, Said] Ecole Natl Agr Meknes, Dept Plant Protect, Phytopathol Unit, Km 10,BP S-40, Meknes 50001, Morocco; [El Jarroudi, Moussa] Univ Liege, UR SPHERES Res Unit, Dept Environm Sci & Management, Water Environm & Dev Unit, B-6700 Arlon, Belgium",Cadi Ayyad University of Marrakech; University of Liege,"Amiri, N (corresponding author), Cadi Ayyad Univ, Fac Sci Semlalia, Lab Water Biodivers & Climate Change, Marrakech 40000, Morocco.",nassima.amiri@ced.uca.ma; rlahlali@enameknes.ac.ma; samiri@enameknes.ac.ma; meljarroudi@uliege.be; yacoubi@ucam.ac.ma; Messouli@ucam.ac.ma,,"Lahlali, Rachid/0000-0002-1299-5733; EL JARROUDI, Moussa/0000-0002-9169-8824; Amiri, Said/0000-0002-5147-2468",,,,,114,1,1,0,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2021,13,21,,,,,,,11943,10.3390/su132111943,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132111943,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WY7FR,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000719444700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Workshop presentations and discussions highlight interconnected themes of resources, systems & structures, regulatory imbalance, and resilience that underpin climate resettlement. We reflect on the narratives presented by members of both Indigenous tribes and NGO partners that illustrate the shortcomings of resettlement planning practices past and present as perpetuating existing inequality.

This challenge is magnified with growing evidence of climate change and related water supply stressors. This stress will challenge food, energy, and water systems as climate adaptation policy measures see continued debate. Despite numerous achievements made many by previous works, few attempts have scanned the literature on economic optimization analysis for water resources planning to discover affordable climate adaptation measures. This paper aims to fill that gap by reviewing the literature on water resource optimization analysis at the basin scale to guide discovery of affordable climate adaptation measures. It does so by posing the question What principles, practices, and recent developments are available to guide discovery of policy measures to improve water resource system adaptions to growing evidence of climate water stress? It describes past achievements and identifies improvements needed for optimization analysis to inform policy debates for crafting plans to improve climate resilience. It describes an economic conceptual framework as well as identifying data needs for conducting economic optimization exercises to support river basin planning faced by the challenge of managing the six water dimensions described above. It presents an example from an ongoing issue facing water planners in the Middle East.

Design/methodology/approach Data on the consumption of cement and site works for 100 ongoing building construction sites were gathered for a period of 12 months. The variance partitioning capabilities of the Ordinary Least Squares and Hierarchical Linear Modelling forms of regression analysis are comparatively used to evaluate the sensitivity of cement demand to the meteorological profile of wet-humid climate Findings The study outcome provides statistical evidence demonstrating that the meteorological profile of wet-humid climate induces a significantly high percentage of the variance in the real-time demand for bagged cement on construction sites. However, nested within this variance, are the fixed effects of the cement footprint of the building architecture inherent in the locality. Particularly, positive changes to reduce the wet trade composition of buildings or compensating changes in technological bias, are necessary to combat weather interference in the humid tropics. Research limitations/implications - The findings are exploratory, and not for the purposes of holistically forecasting cement demand, and can therefore only form part of a more comprehensive decision support system, bespoke to the study area. Practical implications - The study outcome provides a back-end view to climatic adaptation in wet humid settings, making a compelling case for localized climate-risk adaptive supply chain strategies and policies geared towards sustainability in cement usage. Originality/value The study delineates the confounding impact of weather, distinct from local building architecture and technological bias, thus creating a methodological platform for replication and comparative productivity studies in diverse geographical areas.","[Amadi, Alolote, I] Rivers State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Quant Surveying, Fac Environm Sci, Port Harcourt, Nigeria",,"Amadi, AI (corresponding author), Rivers State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Quant Surveying, Fac Environm Sci, Port Harcourt, Nigeria.",amadialolote@yahoo.com,"Amadi, Alolote/ADL-0741-2022","Amadi, Alolote/0000-0002-0569-6604",,,,,57,1,1,0,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2398-4708,,,INT J BUILD PATHOL,Int.

In order to reduce the harmful impacts of climate change and allow communities to thrive in the face of it, adaptation strategies are needed. These strategies need to be accepted by local and national governments, households, and industry. This paper has aimed to derive information about each and discuss the best solution. A theory of smart cities, eco-city theory, city logistics, and sustainable cities are the main strategies whose concepts have upgraded urban planning and building design that can prevent climatic damage but are still consistent with the environment.

It is shown that this way improves the quality of life and supports the development of a culture of sustainability.","[Blagojevic, Dragana] Res & Dev Inst Informat Technol Biosyst, BioSense Inst, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Blagojevic, Dragana; Nagy, Imre; Lukic, Aco; Tesic, Dajana] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Sci, Dept Geog Tourism & Hotel Management, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Lukic, Aco] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Demog & Geodemog, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Novi Sad; Charles University Prague,"Blagojevic, D (corresponding author), Res & Dev Inst Informat Technol Biosyst, BioSense Inst, Novi Sad, Serbia.;Blagojevic, D (corresponding author), Univ Novi Sad, Fac Sci, Dept Geog Tourism & Hotel Management, Novi Sad, Serbia.",dragana.blagojevic@biosense.rs; nagyi@rkk.hu; acolukic994@gmail.com; dajanatesic2@gmail.com,"Blagojević, Dragana/FDD-0238-2022; Tesic, Dajana/HJB-2723-2022",,,,,,54,2,2,2,12,"REGIONAL SCIENCE ASSOC SUBOTICA, SERBIA",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"INT OFF FAC ECONOMICS UNIV SOUTH BOHEMIA STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, 370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",1821-2506,,,DETUROPE,Deturope,,2020,12,3,,,,,37,57,,,,,,21,"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics,QF1MH,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000616662900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, energy resilience is at its pregnancy stage with inconsistency in multiple perspectives, ranging from concept definition to quantifi-cation approach. Moreover, the consideration of energy resilience will conflict with energy efficiency, calling for the necessity on trade-off solutions. In this study, in order to ensure the survivability of district power systems when suffering from extreme events, an up-to-date review on concept definition and quantification approach of energy resilience was conducted, together with distinguished boundary and correlation with reliability, robustness, and flexibility in multi-energy systems. Recent advancement in distributed renewable systems, electric vehicles, peer-to-peer energy sharing, electrification and hydro-genation in power systems was provided, together with their potential contributions in future smart energy systems. By enabling each agent to become a power supply agent, a typology transformation from centralized to distributed energy prosumers was proposed, with an intermediate step-by-step transition from centralized power plants to distributed energy prosumers. Afterwards, multi-scale applications and future prospects of energy resilience are provided, including resilient heating/cooling of buildings, dynamical downscaling for robust design on urban morphology, mobility-based interactive energy shar-ing in regional districts, and smart microgrids with V2X (vehicle-to-everything) and energy flexible build-ings. This study can highlight the significance in district energy resilience with joint and continuous endeavors and tradeoff solutions, during energy planning, design and operation stages.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

To better design such structures, the effects of climate events must be well understood, and the conventional design procedures must be improved by incorporating the knowledge of climatology in geotechnical engineering. In this study, a new climate-adaptive design method is developed to investigate the impact of extreme climate events on the safety and serviceability performances of embedded footing through incorporating the site-specific hydrological loads such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, and water table depth to geotechnical parameters. The proposed method was applied to two arid climate sites in the United States, Austin, TX, and Albuquerque, NM. The site-specific extreme hydrological cycle was determined based on historical records. The mathematical model was solved for temporal and spatial variations of the degree of saturation and matric suction considering the hydrological loads as the upper and lower boundary conditions, respectively. The results showed that the worst performance (higher elastic settlement and lower ultimate bearing capacity) was observed during the period when the degree of saturation in the influence zone was the highest. The critical design parameters including ultimate bearing capacity and settlement obtained from the proposed method increased by 28% and 35%, respectively, in Austin, compared to those calculated from conventional approaches where the soil is assumed to be fully saturated. In Albuquerque, the increase in ultimate bearing capacity and settlement were 61% and 45%, respectively.","[Mahmoudabadi, Vahidreza] MC Squared Inc, 2025 Barrett Lakes Blvd NW,Apt 6301, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA; [Ravichandran, Nadarajah] Clemson Univ, Glenn Dept Civil Engn, Clemson, SC USA",Clemson University,"Mahmoudabadi, V (corresponding author), MC Squared Inc, 2025 Barrett Lakes Blvd NW,Apt 6301, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA.",vr.mahmoudabadi@gmail.com,"Mahmoudabadi, Vahidreza/K-8781-2019","Mahmoudabadi, Vahidreza/0000-0002-9363-6635",,,,,68,0,0,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0363-9061,1096-9853,,INT J NUMER ANAL MET,Int.

However, how the prevailing housing practices are intertwined with rural livelihoods and how the external initiatives to promote disaster-resistant housing practices materialize in a contested marginalized space are key questions with social vulnerability implications that seldom receive adequate attention. This paper aims to explore these questions through case studies of two hazard-prone rural areas in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach The two study areas were selected considering the variation of risk patterns: one located in cyclone hazard-prone southern District of Noakhali and the other located in a flood hazard-prone area of Rajbari District. Existing housing practices in these two communities, their adoption of disaster-resistant housing options and their overall livelihood challenges were explored through questionnaire surveys, focus group discussions and transect walks. Findings As this study shows, safe housing practices are tertiary concerns for people living in those contested spaces after meeting livelihood challenges. Further, in the absence of formal land tenure, adaptation efforts that introduce disaster-resistant housing practices may fail to be effective. Practical implications - The findings of this study demonstrate the need for a reorientation in the present approaches of climate adaptation (particularly, in case of housing practice) to make them more responsive to the adaptation challenges of socially vulnerable populations. Originality/value Most of the prior studies on disaster and rural housing have focused on the post-disaster housing recovery, but there is yet to have enough study that looked at households' current housing strategies and, in particular, how land tenure and livelihood challenges influence their choices. This study fills this research gap and also provides evidence in support of considering the risk priority of marginalized vulnerable population while responding to the broader concerns of climate change.","[Bin Kashem, Shakil] Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Bin Kashem, S (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",kashem1@illinois.edu,,"Kashem, Md Shakil/0000-0001-7333-4093",,,,,49,1,1,0,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1759-5908,1759-5916,,INT J DISASTER RESIL,Int.

Survey results show that while many farmers noticed long-term changes in temperature and precipitation, most could not take remedial action. Lack of access to credit and water were cited as the main factors inhibiting adaptation. Common adaptation responses reported included diversifying crops, changing varieties and planting dates, using irrigation, and supplementing livestock feed. A multinomial logit analysis of climate adaptation responses suggests that access to water, credit, extension services and off-farm income and employment opportunities, tenure security, farmers' asset base and farming experience are key to enhancing farmers' adaptive capacity. This implies that appropriate government interventions to improve farmers' access to and the status of these factors are needed for reducing vulnerability of farmers to climate adversities in such arid areas.","[Gbetibouo, Glawdys Aymone] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Rural Dev, CEEPA, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Hassan, Rashid M.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, CEEPA, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria; University of Pretoria,"Gbetibouo, GA (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Rural Dev, CEEPA, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",glawdys.gbetibouo@up.ac.za; rashid.hassan@up.ac.za; c.ringler@cgiar.org,"Hassan, Rashid/CAG-5246-2022","Ringler, Claudia/0000-0002-8266-0488","Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany; IFPRI DGO Small Grants Initiative Program","Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany; IFPRI DGO Small Grants Initiative Program","This work was supported by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany, under the project Food and Water Security under Global Change: Developing Adaptive Capacity with a Focus on Rural Africa, which forms part of the CGIAR Challenge Programme on Water and Food.

The increased frequency and intensity of such disruptive events is shifting priorities in electricity system planning around the world, including how multiple stakeholders consider linkages between climate vulnerability and energy. This research links smart grid development with adaptation to changing climates and explores how different stakeholders grapple with system vulnerabilities and climate disruptions. To illustrate this, the in-depth case study assesses post-Sandy discourse to compare how electricity sector stakeholder groups in New York, Massachusetts and Vermont associate energy, smart grid, and climate change. To explore how different energy system stakeholders frame the impacts of Superstorm Sandy on energy system planning, we conducted 22 focus groups with a broad range of organizations representing diverse aspects of the electricity system including utilities, regulatory authorities, research and development agencies, regional transmission organizations, academic research institutions, consumer advocacy and environmental organizations across the three states. We used these data to examine post-Sandy discourse about climate mitigation and climate adaptation, routine system management, and the potential value of smart grid for future energy system planning. We found that both New York and Massachusetts stakeholders focused more on climate adaptation than climate mitigation, while stakeholders in Vermont focused more on mitigation. In all three states stakeholder discussions of adaptation focused most heavily on system resilience and reliability, whereas discussions of mitigation focused on demand-side management and demand response followed by alternative energy strategies. These results suggest that extreme weather and climate disruptions will differentially shape discourse around smart grid and energy system change and shift the focus among energy system stakeholders on climate adaptation compared to climate mitigation. This research demonstrates variation between political jurisdictions (states) and energy system stakeholders in energy system planning in the face of new challenges related to an uncertain and rapidly changing world.","[Feldpausch-Parker, Andrea M.] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Peterson, Tarla Rai] Univ Texas El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; [Stephens, Jennie C.] Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA USA; [Wilson, Elizabeth J.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry; University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso; Northeastern University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Feldpausch-Parker, AM (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",amparker@esf.edu,"Feldpausch-Parker, Andrea M/M-6960-2016; Peterson, Tarla Rai/AAC-4503-2019; Stephens, Jennie/Q-1961-2019","Feldpausch-Parker, Andrea M/0000-0002-8030-4762; Stephens, Jennie/0000-0003-0386-8115; Wilson, Elizabeth Joan/0000-0003-1137-0851",National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank the National Science Foundation for financial support of this research, and we also thank all those that participated in the focus groups.

Policy change is proposed, but the detail of policy processes less often discussed. Adaptation to increased climate change and variability will require policy interventions to change behaviors across multiple sectors, requiring policy processes constrained or enabled by institutional settings. Detailed discussion of how to redesign policy processes and institutions are especially rare at the crucial jurisdictional scales of national and sub-national policy and planning. We review coverage of policy and institutions in the adaptation literature and clarify key issues by drawing on the domains of public policy, institutional change, and sustainable development. The distinction between, but close dependencies among, institutions, institutional systems, organizations, policy processes, policy instruments, and management are emphasized. We propose that the climate policy literature has rapidly become large enough that a tendency of self-referencing has developed, and that insights can be gained from other areas. Within existing parameters of law, politics, and governance, options are identified that could embed considerations of climate adaptation into policy processes and institutional systems, with focus on enabling cross-sectoral policy integration ('mainstreaming'), decision making under conditions of uncertainty, vertical ('cross-scale') policy coordination, issues of capacity and devolution, and policy evaluation and learning. The value of seeking lessons from past policy interventions and from cognate policy sectors is explored. (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Successful climate adaptation measures are needed to affordably sustain irrigated agriculture in the face of elevated carbon emissions affecting the reliability of water supplies. Numerous potential adaptation options are available for adjusting irrigated agricultural systems to implement climate risk adaptation. This work focuses on addressing the gap in the literature defined by a scarcity of reviews on measures to elevate the capacity of irrigated agriculture to enhance its climate change resilience. Accordingly, the original contribution of this work is to review the literature describing measures for enhancing climate resilience by irrigated agriculture. In addition, it describes the role of economic analysis to discover affordable measures to enhance resilience by irrigated agriculture. It achieves those aims by posing the question What principles, practices, and recent developments are available to guide discovery of measures to improve resilience by irrigated agriculture to adapt to ongoing evidence of climate change? It addresses that question by reviewing several risk reduction measures to control the economic cost of losses to irrigators in the face of growing water supply unreliability. Following this review, a role for optimizing a portfolio of climate adaptation measures is described, followed by a discussion of potential contributions that can be made by the use of hydroeconomic analysis.

Following recent studies investigating professional work and moral agency, the article engages with Terence Halliday's famous distinction between science-based and normative professions. Contrary to this argument, the article argues that the practice of engineers, the clearest example of the so-called 'science-based' profession, is fraught with moral questions and practices. By drawing on French pragmatic sociology, the article conceptualizes the different ways engineers and others work in situations of uncertainty as different modes of trying. In these modes, professionals rely on different moral principles and ideas for evaluating and judging the professional solutions. As such, the article contributes to the sociology of professions by suggesting a new analytical frame for analyzing moral work as fundamental to professional practice in situations of uncertainty. Empirically, the article builds on fieldwork observations and interviews with professionals from an ongoing research project on Danish climate adaptation in cities and urban rainwater management.","[Meilvang, Marie] UCL, Niels Borhs Alle 1, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark",,"Meilvang, M (corresponding author), UCL, Niels Borhs Alle 1, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",mlme@ucl.dk,,,Danish Council for Independent Research -Social Sciences [DFF -6109-00063],Danish Council for Independent Research -Social Sciences(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)),This study was financially supported by The Danish Council for Independent Research -Social Sciences with Grant Number DFF -6109-00063.,,32,2,2,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2051-8803,2051-8811,,J PROF ORGAN,J.

J,"Jessee, N",,,,"Jessee, Nathan",,,Reshaping Louisiana's coastal frontier: managed retreat as colonial decontextualization,JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Community resettlement; managed retreat; racial capitalism; environmental change; native American and Indigenous Studies,SOCIAL-JUSTICE; ADAPTATION; PROPERTY; MOBILITY; RACE,"This article describes social encounters produced by climate adaptation policy experimentation focused on managed retreat-a concept increasingly used by academics and planning professionals to describe various kinds of relocation from areas exposed to environmental hazards. Building on scholarship that examines the political ecology of resettlement and adaptation, I draw on five years of ethnographic work conducted alongside Isle de Jean Charles Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribal leaders as their longstanding Tribal resettlement was transformed by government investment. I describe how Louisiana's Office of Community Development relied on Tribal planning to garner federal funds, used those funds to reduce the scope of the resettlement, and systematically erased the initial resettlement rationales and aims of Indigenous leaders. I liken the state's approach to Dina Gilio-Whitaker's notion of decontextualization as a colonial strategy, and argue that state efforts to transform the resettlement from what Tribal leaders viewed as an act of cultural survival to a scalable model for managed retreat policy threatens to reproduce a frontier dynamic whereby colonial and capitalist futures are once again rested upon the erasure of Indigenous peoples. State tools for decontextualization included published constructions of risk, community, and timelines; liberal planning conventions; and evocations of legal barriers. Ethnographic accounts of such processes can inform future resistance to ecocolonial schemes within climate adaptation.","[Jessee, Nathan] Princeton Univ, High Meadows Environm Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Jessee, N (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, High Meadows Environm Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",nathanjessee@princeton.edu,,,Wenner-Gren Foundation; Tulane University's Center for the Gulf South; Temple University's Graduate School,Wenner-Gren Foundation; Tulane University's Center for the Gulf South; Temple University's Graduate School,"The research for this article was funded by Wenner-Gren Foundation, Tulane University's Center for the Gulf South, and Temple University's Graduate School.",,126,4,4,1,2,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1073-0451,,,J POLIT ECOL,J.
